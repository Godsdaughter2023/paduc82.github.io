<h2>            Linked excel into word - duplicating tables when reopen document</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2013 (Word and Excel)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied and pasted excel tables into a word document using "Link and keep source formatting" option
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a861e59f-7df1-4080-99c4-946c061c50eb" /></p>
<p>In the word doc I have: </p>
<p>- been into options, Advanced, general and un-ticked "update automatic links at open".</p>
<p>- right clicked on every table in the document and gone to "linked worksheet object" - "Links" and changed update method to Manual
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I re-open the saved document it inserts multiple copies of some of the tables (some up to 4 times) which throws the whole formatting of the document out.&nbsp; I have tried marking the document as a Final thinking it wouldn't update any more but it
 still does the same. I cannot open the document and print it without having to do major editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally it was duplicating tables every time I changed anything in the excel (even adjusting column widths or spelling) but setting to manual seems to have stopped that part.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in how to stop this happening would be greatly appreciated. </p>

            <p>this is the first table which is one of the ones that is giving me problems - strangely enough there is only one copy of the table in when I open it this morning but the link seems to refer twice, not sure what the MERGEFORMAT means.

            <p>I don't know if this is the same issue, but i was having multiple copies of a table be duplicated over and over in a Word document. I couldn't delete the extra tables, because they were apparently not separate from the original one (it would just delete
 everything). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not figure it out, until i remembered that i had inserted a page break for one of the table rows because the row was bleeding into another page. Once i removed the page break, everything went back to normal.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope that helps someone if they are having the same issue!</p>

            <p>Hi Kylie and all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an identical issue, but it won't resolve as swiftly. In fact, when I do Alt-F9, I only have 1 link appear, so I have no duplicate links to remove. Furthermore, I noticed that my original table loose the ''link'' whenever that duplicate appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, when I copy/paste the desired table, I drag it to a specific spot elsewhere on the page, and when I save/close/open, my original table is at the correct location and I have a duplicate that pops on the line where I initially copy/pasted my table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I redid the same steps on a blank new document = no issues, works perfectly, no duplicates, all pretty. So I thought, something with my last doc is corrupt, therefore, I copy/pasted all the stuff from my original file to the new doc, redid the copy/paste/link
 table, save/close/open and same story over again... a duplicate sitting there laughing at me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My document consists of a 30+ number of pictures, shapes and textboxes, and so over 8 pages. So on this new test document where I just copy/pasted everything, I deleted everything except this spiteful table, saved/closed/opened: once again, the original
 table lost the link and a new one with the link appeared in the location where I initially copy-pasted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AAAAnd I just found the solution while I was typing this. Create a textbox and copy/paste/link your table into it. It stops duplicating like this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any1 has any other insight, it would still&nbsp;be greatly appreciated, because I think my solution is more of a "work-around" patch, that a solid answer to this problem...</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot Create New Task, Cannot Open Existing Tasks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pt53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Create New Task, Cannot Open Existing Tasks</h2>
                    <p>I am running XP with all updates. Office 2007, with all updates.</p>
<p>Recently, ZoneAlarm detected a virus in one of the .pst files and after choosing to quarantine the file, ZA&nbsp;did something which caused the loss of about three months of emails. However, the task files were still there, contacts were unaffected and everything
 else seemed fine. I ran the scanpst.exe program to see if some of the emails might be recoverd, and then imported the repaired file. I also ran scanpst.exe on two archive files, thinking I might recover some of the lost emails. Then I imported those files.
 I wound up with a ton of duplicate and triplicate emails and tasks and about 12,000 old sent emails. &nbsp;I deleted most of the extra copies of the emails, and deleted the extra task items after comparing each to be sure I had the most recent version.
</p>
<p>After restarting Outlook, I am no longer able to open a new task, nor can I open any of the existing tasks. They are visible, and I can read the task item by choosing the reading pane option, but I cannot edit any task or create a new task.
</p>
<p>I created a new .pst folder, and after running scanpst.exe again, imported the data into the new folder. It also imported all the emails and task items I had deleted from the old one, but still I am unable to open a new task nor edit an existing task.
</p>
<p>Any helpful suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I was about to go that route when I noticed something odd. Following a reboot of my computer, Outlook started in regular, as opposed to safe mode because I wasn't quick enough to hit the cntrl key. However, the fonts and views&nbsp;all appeared normal. So, I
 tried opening a task. It opened! I created a new task, and saved, then reopened it. It worked!
</p>
<p>I have no idea whatsoever what led to this, the last change I had made was a full three days before. Now, Outlook opens with all the views as previously set and all existing tasks open plus new tasks can be created. I have now backed up my .pst files and
 hope Outlook continues to co-operate. </p>
<p>It would be nice to know what the problem was, and what solved it, but now that things are working normally I can get back to work. I never did have to create a new profile, and everything else I tried was unsuccessful following implementation and multiple
 restarts. </p>
<p>Thanks for offering your assistance. I just wish I knew what the problem was and what fixed it.

<h2>            COPY TO CALENDAR Button-OUTLOOK in OFFICE 365-Doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>There is a "Copy to my<span> Calendar" button in my Outlook Calendar in Office 365.&nbsp; It is located on the ribbon&nbsp;in the "Appointments, Actions" dialog.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Outlook 2010, it would duplicate the event, on the same day/time, IN THE SAME CALENDAR,&nbsp;allowing you to open the duplicate and change the date / time, then SAVE.&nbsp; This eliminated having to reenter the details on a subsequent appointment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The button still exists, it reacts to clicking, but it doesn't do anything.</span></p>

<p>Hi Uolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings, I'm glad to follow up this thread for you, the Copy to my calendar button under appointment is used to copy this calendar item your main calendar,<span>&nbsp;
</span>that means if you have add multiple Office 365 accounts in your Outlook desktop client, if your create a new appointment item in other Office 365 account, the Calendar item will be added to your main Calendar(Calendar of the first Office 365 account
 you add to your Outlook desktop client) if you choose Copy to my calendar and save it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to contact us if you still have concern, we will be glad to continue to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now discover that I have three (3) calendars!!&nbsp; They are:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Calendar - Outlook Data File</li><li>Calendar - Archives</li><li>Calendar (This computer only)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>#1 Has all the data and history and I use it daily.</p>
<p>#2 Doesn't have much in it.&nbsp; Mostly holidays.</p>
<p>#3 Apparently, this is where the results of my using the "Copy to my Calendar" have gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2010, the&nbsp;<span>"Copy to my Calendar" button duplicated the appointment in the SAME CALENDAR.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Uolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, after you click the button Copy to Calendar, the event will be copied to the same calendar. In this scenario, you can refer to the article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/197038/how-to-copy-outlook-calendar-items-from-one-folder-to-another" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to copy Outlook Calendar items from one folder to another</a>&nbsp;to check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While if the issue persists, it would be better for you to know that <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3088463/mainstream-support-ends-for-office-professional-plus-2010-for-office-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mainstream support had been ended for Office Professional Plus 2010 for Office 365 subscribers</a>.&nbsp;And in Outlook 2016 desktop client, the button has been removed since we can share the calendar with each other directly which is more convenient. So you may
 try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-do-i-upgrade-office-ee68f6cf-422f-464a-82ec-385f65391350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I am sorry.&nbsp; I misspoke in my earlier request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing this situation in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Outlook on Office 365</strong></span>; that is, the<span> "Copy to my Calendar" button places a copy in ANOTHER CALENDAR.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know why I have more than one (1) calendar.&nbsp; I only need (and want) one (1) calendar.&nbsp; I would be pleased to delete these other two (2) calendars if I knew how, but I don't.</span></p>
<p><span>Outlook 2010 duplicated a calendar event when "<span>Copy to my Calendar" was selected.&nbsp; In my version of Outlook (Office 365), it copies the event to one of the other calendars.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any thoughts?&nbsp; Is there a solution or has the&nbsp;<span>"Copy to my Calendar" been "improved" beyond its usefulness to me.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Uolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have multiple accounts added in Outlook, then you may have multiple calendars. If you'd like to delete the other calendars, it's required to remove the other email accounts in your Outlook. You can navigate to File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings
 to view your email accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While if you have only one email account in Outlook, you can refer to the article
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/delete-a-calendar-9ba1364c-bdb0-41be-8f66-eaf96698d021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Delete a calendar</a>&nbsp;to check if it helps. Before you delete the calendar, please make sure there's no important data stored in the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Besides, since Outlook 2016 desktop client doesn't have this button, as much as I'd love to help, I cannot do the tests in my lab. Meanwhile, for Office 365 subscribers who use Office Professional Plus 2010, the support has been ended as the link above.
 If you have Office 365 business subscription, we recommend you install Office 365 Pro Plus with the latest version of Office 2016 apps for the better experience. We kindly appreciate for your understanding.</p>

            The C3-00 is an s40 phone, and is not a smartphone, it only supports jar apps. As such, I do not think there is any existing jar app that has the capabilities you want.

            I am very disappointed with the c3. I have important documents that i have received and cant open any as there is no pdf reader that is compatible with this phone. It is no doubt a waste of money. If you want to do anything more than make calls and send
 sms, strongly suggest you get something more recent than this dinosaur of a phone!

            You may get apps for reading word documents but for now an editor is out of question. Have seen an app in Ovi store for S40 phones called S40 reader. You may check it out and see if it works in the C3.

            I guess it is the same app in both cases... It gives reading capabilities but no editing options.

Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset try to check if the issue persists.

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<p>You tProduct table is not normalized, and you should fix that before proceeding. You should never have columns named PriceA, PriceB, etc. It would be okay to have columns named SellingPrice (i.e. the price at which an item is sold) and PurchasePrice (i.e.
 the price at which you purchase the item), but have 3 columns to store the same thing is a sign of an improperly designed database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned earlier, you should have a table that stores your Customer Prices, and use that to determine the price you'll charge for a Customer. Your tProduct table could contain a DefaultPrice column (i.e. the price you will sell if for if there is no
 custom pricing), but if you need to apply specific pricing for specific Customers, then you'll need to have a Many-to-Many table to store those prices, as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If pricing is dependent on the CustomerType, then your new tProductPrice table would look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tProductPrice</p>
<p>------------ </p>
<p>ProductPriceID</p>
<p>ProductID</p>
<p>CustomerType</p>
<p>ProductPrice</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of your Products would have a single row in that table which would relate the Product to a specific CustomerType, and would provide you with the ProductPrice for the Product. To get the correct price you'd query the tProductPrice table with the ProductID
 and CustomerType:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT ProductPrice FROM tProductPrice WHERE CustomerType='A' AND ProductID='123456'</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also include tProductPrice in any query that is needed to retrieve that data:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT tCustomer.Customer, tPRoduct.Product, tProductPrice.ProductPrice, tProduct.DefaultPrice FROM tProduct INNER JOIN tCustomer ON tProduct.CustomerID=tCustomer.CustomerID LEFT JOIN tProductPrice ON tProduct.ProductID=tProductPrice.ProductID AND tCustomer.CustomerID=tProductPrice.CustomerID</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, those table and column names are just ones I made up. In order for the query to work you'd have to change them to match your own.</p>

Perhaps they are just trying to be kind and not let you see the consequences of trying to use their site on a device which has some known limitations?&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise what happens if you try using a different User-Agent string than the IE11 one which will be being
 used?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. use the IE11 Developer Tools, Emulation tab to test that idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; (F12, Ctrl-8, etc.)</p>

This is change made by the BBC as opposed to a Windows 8/8.1 or Surface RT update. The same problem occurs on both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 on the Surface RT. The BBC website has started detecting the Surface RT's web browser as a mobile device and is sending
 you to a page advising that mobile devices are not supported.
<div><br />
<div>As a workaround the developer tools in the desktop version of IE can be used to temporarily change how the Surface RT is identified to websites. This will allow the desktop version of IE to be used but not the app version.</div>

I emailed them this morning too with replication steps related the the user agent and the fact that it is unrelated to the Windows 8.1 release. There is a FAQ on their website saying that they are aware of the issue and are investigating:

 Bands?

<p>You're implying that Cortana will work on the Band 2, so long as the user installs Cortana on their device...an iPhone in this case. This is inaccurate information. According to the company you represent, Cortana is not yet supported with the Band 2 for
 user of iPhone's or Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to be snide, but false information from someone who represents the company behind the device will make people go to the competition. You all have a great device here with LOTS of potential. Please be precise and accurate with information so
 the device doesn't end up as EOL prematurely, or permanently. (For those that don't know, EOL means End of Life... or discontinued)</p>

            <p>Hi Jack, If your Home and Student is OEM, you are 100% correct. The product does live and die on the original machine.
</p>
<p>I didn't mention this because it is rare that Office is OEM.</p>
<p>Most new computers are preinstalled with a trial of Home and Student. Are you sure your computer didn't have one of these and you simply bought the retail version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can easily tell if you have an OEM installation.</p>
<p>In any Office app, go to File tab / Help command. Look on the right side, at the bottom for the Product ID. If you have an OEM installation, the Product ID will contain the letters OEM. If all you see are numbers, you probably have a retail version which
 can be installed on up to 3 computers at the same time. Go ahead and try to install and activate on the new machine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately OEM is the only License you can identify that way. I really wish MS would get with the program and make a change in the next edition that will show the license type (OEM, FPP, PKC, KMS, MAK etc)&nbsp;&nbsp;in the help screen. It would really simplify
 a lot of trouble shooting.</p>

    <title>PST Import through Admin Console Appears Stuck - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PST Import through Admin Console Appears Stuck</h2>
                    
<p>I am in the process of Importing two pst files using the Office 365 Admin Console (from Office 365, Admin then Import). After some struggle with the .pst Upload crashing, we added the switch /nc:2 which slows the Upload, but they didn't crash. The two pst
 files were successfully Uploaded around 6:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>At 6:20 AM I started the Import with a CSV mapping file. The Import started fine, but about midday it seems to have stopped Importing at 23% of the first of two files. The files are less-than 10GB by a bunch - one is 2+GB, the other 4+GB - the smaller of
 the two is the one that was first to import and now appears stuck. I've seen a couple of posts here which seem to indicate that the portal is not correctly displaying the status. How can I check that?</p>
<p>The import of these two pst files does not appear to have failed - they still show that they're working but no change in status for the past 7 hours.</p>
<p>I have two more big files to import which I'm probably going to have to break into smaller pieces according to several posts which indicate that the pst upload won't work if the files are over 10GB, and I'm wondering if I should just do the import directly
 through Outlook instead of using the Import function on the Admin console?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi David，</p>
<p>Since this feature is in preview and may have some limitations,&nbsp;if a pst is a large file, it may take a long time to finish it.</p>
<p>If you have two more big files and Outlook clients, we recommend you import pst file via Outlook clients. You can also cancel the job for the previous two pst file and import them in Outlook clients. It should be done quickly. If you have any special requirements,
 please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>Note: Please use Exchange connection to set up your Office 365 account in Outlook clients. All data will be synced to Outlook Web App (OWA).</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

<p>Thanks Erick and JohnPatrick4241. We've elected to import via the Outlook client which seems to be working about 100x faster than the Office 365 Import Service. Erick, if you can, however, tell me how to stop the PST import via the Outlook 365 Admin console
 - there doesn't appear to be an option to do so. </p>

<p>If you and everyone else who edits the document has Word 2007 or later, there is a way. If anyone with Word 2003 tries to edit the document, though, they'll find the whole document to be locked.</p>
<p>First remove whatever protection (I'm guessing it's "protected for forms") is in the document now.</p>
<p>Click the Protect Document button (on either the Review tab or the Developer tab) and choose Restrict Formatting and Editing.</p>
<p>Under Editing Restrictions, check the box for "Allow only this type of editing" and set the dropdown to "No changes (Read only)".</p>
<p>Select the part of the document before your formulas, and check the box next to Everyone in the Exceptions section of the pane. Select the part after the formulas, and again check the Everyone box. If there are editable areas between the formulas, do the
 same for each one. Finally, open the header pane, select its contents, and check the Everyone box.</p>
<p>Click the "Yes, Start Enforcing Protection" button in the pane, enter your password, and click OK.</p>

<p>I found the directions&nbsp;very helpful and was able to allow for filling in form fields in the header of a protected document.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)"><font><font>The tricky part is that once I followed the instructions to allow the
 header unprotected, Word erases the functionality to ‘fill fields’.&nbsp; I had to go back and unprotect one by one each of the fields in the body of the document. Note these forms are in Word 2010 and include tables and require the user to either type text for
 some questions or to select items by clicking on a box next to each response. When I followed the directions you can type in the form fields and use the header option (which is great because every page has to have the client's name, medicaid number and DOB).
 You can also type text responses where this is needed. But, when you try to make selections by clicking on a box it takes you to the check/uncheck window. Before, once a document was password protected they just had to click on the box once to select it. HELP!

            Unfortunately, the procedure I provided for Buck Jeppson was specifically for a document that was protected but did not include form fields (he was protecting formulas). It isn't appropriate for your application. Instead, there are two other alternatives.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
Somewhere in the body of the form (usually at the top of the first page), insert text form fields for entering the information you need in the headers. Place each form field in a separate paragraph.<br />
<br />
Create a new style for each form field (most easily, click the lower down-arrow at the right end of the Styles gallery on the Home tab and click Save Selection as New Quick Style, and assign a unique name to the style; you don't have to change any of the style's
 formatting if you don't want to).<br />
<br />
In the header, replace the current form fields with STYLEREF fields. Each STYLEREF field should refer to the name of the style that you applied to the corresponding form field in the document body. For example, if the form field for entering the patient name
 has the PName style, then the header should contain a field {STYLEREF PName}. Repeat for the other pieces of information.<br />
<br />
If the form fields on the first page are sufficient to identify that page, then you can enable the first-page header and leave it empty; the STYLEREF fields will appear on all other pages from page 2 onward.<br />
<br />
You can then apply forms protection to the entire form. When you fill in the fields on the first page, the STYLEREF fields in the header will automatically display the same information.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
Read <a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/create_employ_userform.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/create_employ_userform.html</a> to find out how to create a userform (a custom dialog box) where the data can be entered, and how to use DOCPROPERTY fields to display the data that's collected by the userform. This method
 is more complex than method 1, but more useful if you want to do things like verifying the data during entry or protecting it against being changed accidentally.<br />

<h2>            Excel 2013 keyboard not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 2013 on a server 2012 RDS environment.</p>
<p>For a while we have a weird problem that for one user randomly the Keyboard function stops working in Excel.</p>
<p>The mouse input keeps working when this problem occurs.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I minimize&nbsp;excel and maximize it again, the keyboard starts working again.</p>
<p>Office and Windows are completely updated and the machines have been rebooted multiple times but the problem still exists.</p>
<p>In other Office apps this problem doesn't occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you for all your replies!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Uodates that corrupt you computer</h2>
                    I had downloaded the window 10 Pro Insider Preview Evaluation Copy. Build 17025.rs_Pre Release. 171020-1626 and now my Microsoft office 2010 has been total cleaned from my computer. Also, I now have no CD/Dvd.&nbsp; there is nothing on the system to get it.&nbsp;
 Again also, the Windows 10&nbsp; states on my screen that I need to activate Windows. any help for someone who has no idea.

<p>More info would be nice.&nbsp; We have to assume that you moved from 17017 to 17025 in the normal way (W10 update) and that you are a registered W10 Pro user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance that you did a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are close to a new Insider release.&nbsp; It might be best to restore back to your previous release and STOP Insiders and wait.&nbsp; This should give you a 7 day window before any attempt to update Insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Office 2016 Pro Plus and I never have an activation issue as long as I follow normal procedures.&nbsp; However, a clean install will often drop Office activation.&nbsp; I also run an Enterprise and W10 activation can often be delayed a day or 2 on a major update.&nbsp;
 It does not have Digital Activation so may be waiting for the servers to check its valid activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More info = better results</p>

<p>His ofspra.&nbsp; thanks for the reply. No,&nbsp; there was not a clean install.&nbsp; I woke up that morning to find the update<span>17025 had already been installed.&nbsp; There was no password on start, so the update restarted the computer automatically without
 any hinderance, like waiting to have the password put in.&nbsp; You can imagine my horror when I noticed that my DVD-RW's were not even traceable in the F2 setup, there was nowhere for me to turn the on DVD's
</span>in the setup, and there is no trace in the control panel. I even spent money on new DVD-RW in case it was the older DVD-RW.&nbsp; I have been using my DVD-RW to save 3D printer stl's to print on my 3Dprinter.&nbsp; Did you know that the CURA program for the 3D
 printer has disappeared from my system, I have managed to download the program itself again, but now it states that my computer graphics are out of date.&nbsp; Yet my graphics assistant says that my computer is up to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!. &nbsp; I had Microsoft Office
 2010 on the computer since I bought it.&nbsp; I use the Excel part mostly. but now I have documents that is not recognisable by the programs on the computer.&nbsp; Just a blank box where there was once a nice little green box before.&nbsp; Also, now the computer states I
 have to go to Settings to activate Windows.&nbsp; Firstly, the windows update is suppose to install the code for the new update.&nbsp; I do not have this luxury as the windows 10 is their system and I upgrades from windows 7 and to really smooth things over (yeh, right),
 I do not have any of the disks required, namely Microsoft Office as it was on the computer when bought.&nbsp; I do not have the previous updates to go back to because the newest update has wiped them off aswell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a nice day, but I am thinking of buying another computer (This would be the third one I have had to purchase)&nbsp; Get the picture?&nbsp; Clean install my ass.&nbsp; sorry for swearing like that but I am really upset as to what Window's Insider has done to me</p>

<p>This is what you agreed to when you joined the Insider Program. I suggest you read it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Basically, insider builds are for test purposes only. You should not be using them on your main work computer except possibly in a dual boot configuration. It is better to use an old computer dedicated to testing insider builds.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok, the more info about your system, the easier it will be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, there are settings as to how you want updates to be handled.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are settings where you can request that you want to be advised before an update can take place.&nbsp; There are also settings where you can&nbsp; set hours outside of your normal work hours
 where an update can take place on its own.&nbsp; I use this setting where I can start an update and go to bed and all will be done in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, your result would likely have been the same except you could blame yourself for pulling the trigger
 - lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is time to do some detective work.&nbsp; Let's look at Office 2010.&nbsp; This is an older package but should still work.&nbsp; Time to find out if the Excel program is actually gone or if only the Icon has disappeared.&nbsp; Do a program search for Excel and see if it loads.&nbsp;
 I just did that on my 17015 and Excel came up.&nbsp; If Excel is still there, them you have just lost the Icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on Excel.&nbsp; Out of the box, Excel files may be in your Document folder.&nbsp; In any event, take a look at the folder where your Excel files are expected to be
</p>
<p>and see if you suffered actual data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that you do not Recovery options now?&nbsp; I just went to Settings/Update and I have the option to Recover my system with the option to keep my data.&nbsp; If you have this option, then you should be able to get back to where you were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a folder on Drive C called C:\Windows.old.&nbsp; This should be your prior install and should be quite large.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you do not have all data to re-install starting with Office 2010 which came pre-installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your best path seems like a Re-store to prior system and then wait for a new Insider build.&nbsp; If you moved from 17017, then you are an Insider with more
 limited means to get back to Public build.&nbsp; If you moved from 16299.19, then your path back to Public build is easier.&nbsp; However, you not appear to be a dis-grunted Insider, just an Insider with a problem build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More data = better results</p>

            Lesson learned when using a BETA testing program as posted by MS before using<br />
 of info on them that helps with issues. if looking to buy a Mac best to search the internet about issues with Mac's, one good thing about Apple and it's&nbsp; beta testing program it isn't open to the public.

<p>&nbsp;Let me just add my 2 cents to what's already been said.</p>
<p>Here is the most important sentence in the Windows Insider Program Agreement (in case you didn't already read it):</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>You understand that using experimental and early pre-release software means you may experience occasional crashes and data loss. By participating, you agree to frequently backup your data.</em>"&nbsp;<br />
~<br />
&nbsp;If you don't read and heed the above, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; I've successfully used Macrium Reflect and Easeus Todo Backup for several years without problems.&nbsp; Both have free versions for non-commercial use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And BTW I have Office 2010 installed on one of my partitions that I upgraded from 17017 to 17025 (64 bit Pro version) with no problems.</p>

<h2>            Simple tasks</h2>
                    <p>Hey Everyone, I don't normally do this sort of thing but I'd really like someone to see my suggestions for WP10. Steal them for all I care and tell someone who can make the changes lol. I'm on firmware update 1.2.16.7 and I have a 950XL. I have no idea what
 other numbers might be helpful, so here's my core build ID: 1130.122 (01078.00038.16025.39000). That's all you get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok the clipboard is junk. We need that fixed lol. Why can I only half the time copy and paste info from a text message&nbsp;to Edge? Why can't you copy info from one tab to another in Edge? I just about threw my phone out the window of my car earlier because
 of this lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple task I was trying to do was take a screen shot, draw a circle on part of it, and share the link to the edited picture on one drive. This shouldn't require 3rd party apps. Lets see if we can get that down to about a 15 second job ok?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we please have our email addresses added back to the suggestions bar when typing? I miss that a lot, I know it was there&nbsp;in 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the vent. I'm sure this isn't the right place to do this, I've had a rough week lol. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>1. Audio/Video Conferencing- I'm&nbsp; currently using Polycom device in the conference room for the same and a 3rd party solution to enable the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Bridge Call where external participants are logging into a dial-in no and the conference is happening</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I'm using&nbsp; EPABX to make calls to users mobile no’s</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My&nbsp; Expectation:</p>
<p>I wants to use a single solution for carrying out the following and it is my opinion that Office 365 Unified messaging will allow us to do the below mentioned :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Audio/Video conferencing using Skype for Business client without a need of any additional 3rd party software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Integrating Skype for Business with Video conferencing equipment to make video conferencing calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Make direct phone calls from Skype for business i.e. call a person’s mobile no using the Skype for Business client</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. enable Bridge or Dial-in conferencing calls directly from Skype for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If solution is there please clarify the below things</p>
<p>1. Specify whether the above mentioned requirement can be handled using the Unified messaging from Office 365</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Specify if all of the above would have to be enabled what is the Pre-requisities in regards to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Software needed to deploy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Hardware that needs to be deployed</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Any additional licenses should i&nbsp; have to buy for the same</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Would i have to deploy any software or hardware on-premise to carry out the same</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. what hardware or software would be needed to integrate my EPABX to allow direct phone calls using skype for business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Logical diagram of the entire connectivity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Network Bandwidth ( You can assume for 100 users)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust this brings the necessary clarity.</p>

<p>Hi ChethanM,<br />
<br />
I’d like to answer your question one by one.<br />
1. Specify whether the above mentioned requirement can be handled using the Unified messaging from Office 365.<br />
Answer: “Make direct phone calls from Skype for business i.e. call a person’s mobile no using the Skype for Business client” is not supported currently. Others are supported.</p>
<p>2. Specify if all of the above would have to be enabled what is the Pre-requisities in regards to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Software needed to deploy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Hardware that needs to be deployed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Any additional licenses should i have to buy for the same<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Would i have to deploy any software or hardware on-premise to carry out the same<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. what hardware or software would be needed to integrate my EPABX to allow direct phone calls using skype for business.<br />
A: For the Dial-in conferencing, Smaller customers usually acquire a contract from a provider through the Office 365 Marketplace. Larger customers often work with an account team or a sales representative from their existing provider. In case you were wondering,
 the marketplace is thriving with lots of great partners. Check it out by exploring audio conferencing partners on the

Office 365 Marketplace</a><br />
No additional licenses need and we do not support direct phone calls using Skype for Business.<br />
<br />
3. Logical diagram of the entire connectivity<br />
Answer: Currently, there is no Microsoft logical diagram of the entire connectivity<br />

            <p>What is "Microsoft 2013"?&nbsp; Do you mean Office 2013?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mail tile on the Windows 8 Start screen runs the local Windows 8 mail app and cannot be made (as far as I know) to run any other program.&nbsp; You can certainly add a tile for Outlook 2013 to your start screen, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also make Outlook 2013 your default mail program.&nbsp; When you say your messages are "going to one outbound folder", what folder do you mean?&nbsp; The one you see in the Mail app or the one you see in Outlook 2013?</p>

    <title>Lumia 920 Screen broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maltegg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920 Screen broken</h2>
                    
<p>I dropped my phone and the screen broke, it cant be used. The phone is locked and I can't retrieve my pictures since I have not used any backup/onedrive etc etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is, is there any way I could enter my password without using the phone screen. With a program or something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not possible I guess I'm going for android next time, since they sure have it. Nokia was and maybe still is the best phone I've used. But if backup is the only thing keeping my info "safe". Then it's&nbsp;garbage. I don't feel safe having everything
 in the "clouds" where when the security of our personal life is what it is today.</p>

            No,back up is provided for a reason,this is why one drive is there ,same as google drive for Android,cloud storage is pretty much new to people and are only now beginning to use it more.<br />
Have you at least tried to connect your device to a pc ??
