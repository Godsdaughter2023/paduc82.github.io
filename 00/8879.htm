<h2>            Change Default Text Box Size In Word</h2>
                    Hi MS Community,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am aware of how to set the default text box size for the active document; however, is there a way to set it for Word "globally" or for all documents? Thanks.</div>

            See if this helps, in a Blank document:<br />
<ol>
<li>Go to Word &gt; Preferences &gt;Save</li><li>Check (turn on) Prompt to save in Normal</li><li>Now Type something in Blank document.(one word will be okay)</li><li>Now Save document to desktop</li><li>Quit Word</li><li>When asked do you want to save changes in Normal Click Okay (or yes)</li><li>Now go to Desktop (what you see when you open computer for the day), and throw documet in trash its no longer needed.</li><li>Now reopen Word.Your new Fonts size should now show as well as any other formatting changes.</li><li>I would leave the Prompt for save setting on. So you can prevent changes for normal Template if you don't want them.<br />

<br />
<br />Can you share with me what the error says?
<br />
<br />Are you able to try a different web browser (Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) or a different computer or mobile device to see if you have the same experience?
<br />

<br />A pleasure to help you.

<br />I get to create your Outlook.com account successfully or you received the error creating it.

            Hello - Yesterday (8/11/2018), Outlook 365 decided that I cannot send emails or reply to those received.&nbsp; I get an error 421 Resomta-PO-16v.sys.co, and also get an error "this account is not authorized to send email".&nbsp; Receiving email still works OK.&nbsp;
 Prior to yesterday, no such send errors occurred, and no settings have changed.&nbsp; I simply switched to using Xfinity Email (my service provider) and everything now works as expected.&nbsp; I consider this to be a problem with Outlook 365.

            Thank you DebraAnderson1 for your kind reply.&nbsp; Here is another symptom of the problem:&nbsp; I get a message "CSI IP 173.244.36.19 is not permitted to send messages".&nbsp; I don't know what that message implies.&nbsp; Also, if I exit Outlook with the offending send
 request still residing and failing in the OUTBOX, restart my PC and start Outlook, the message then gets sent immediately after Outlook starts.&nbsp; To protect my PC from hackers, I run a Virtual Private Network (VPN), and also keep a recent backup of my whole
 PC using the Acronis product, which does a whole backup of my system, including the boot sectors with a UNIX OS, and restores them from the offline backup disk using a CD that boots to a UNIX OS, then launches Acronis within UNIX and restores my complete system
 with no need for Windows to be running.&nbsp; I fear no hackers.&nbsp; Good luck to you.

            Hi - I use Comcast mail.&nbsp; I use Outlook to access Comcast mail.&nbsp; If I use Comcast mail by itself, the send errors do not occur.&nbsp; When I use Outlook to access Comcast email, the errors occurred.&nbsp; So here is the kicker - the errors went away all by themselves,
 and Outlook does not get errors when I send mail.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; Thanks for your ideas.

            <p><span>Hi Avian,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When we subscribe for a trial Intune license, then we get multiple licenses. First, you can go to Admin Center&gt;Users&gt;Active Users and assign the license to yourself, if you have the admin rights. Once the Intune license is assigned, you’ll be able
 to select the policies under <strong>Deploy the policy</strong> in <strong>OneDrive for business admin center</strong></span><span>&gt;</span><strong><span>Device Access.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, the article which is provided by James in his last post, if you follow the steps it will take you to Intune portal, once clicked on
<strong>Device management</strong> under <strong>Security &amp; compliance</strong>. In your case, it does not ask you to set up MDM for Office 365 because someone in your organization have already set up the account. Otherwise the article is right with the correct
 steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Furthermore, as you mentioned when you tried downloading APN certificate and nothing happened. Please confirm at which process you were stuck, perhaps please try again after clearing the browser cache or try an InPrivate browser, see if this makes
 any difference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Neha</span></p>
<p />

<p>i've been fighting this issue for almost 3 weeks now.&nbsp; i was told it's a service outage on office365, but that doesn't seem right as other users around me don't have any issues.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>According to the first screenshot, the error message appears when you sign in to SharePoint. To find out if it is related to the account, I've sent you a test account in PM, you could try the test account to see if the issue persists. Besides, I'd like to
 confirm some information in PM for further investigation. You can access the PM via
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.</p>
<p>After trying the test account, please notify us on the forum so that we can help you in time.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jared</p>

<strong>note</strong>: before performing that, i’d like to know whether you have outlook &amp; onedrive for business configured. if yes, you need to reconfigure them after performing the following action, so&nbsp;backing up for your files is needed&nbsp;in case of file missing.<br />
<br />
<br />
if the issue persists after performing the steps above, we need confirm the following information for further investigation:<br />
1.does the issue occur to any others in your organization?<br />
if yes, the issue may be related to the single sign on settings in your environment. at this point, we suggest you involve your system administrator. we may need your admin's help to do the checks and then try the fixes like item #4 in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3015526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3015526</a>
 based on the symptoms.<br />
<br />
2.for the test account we shared with you in private message. please log in to sharepoint team site via the url i provide in the private message and check the outcome when you try to save documents to the sharepoint site.<br />
<br />
<br />
in addition, in order to protect your privacy, i have masked the tenant information in your screenshot.<br />

<h2>            Icons for Word on taskbar not grouping but are for Excel</h2>
                    <br />

I have pinned both Word and Excel to the taskbar, but when I open multiple documents in both, only Excel groups. Word docs group, but not under the pinned icon. I can't seem to figure out why.<br />

<h3> shawnwernig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail and Other Microsoft Accounts Silently Discard Mail</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a lot of trouble sending to hotmail.com, live.com and other Microsoft properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be that mail is accepted, then Queued for Delivery, and is never delivered. Here's an example from the logs when sending to myself:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** R=dkim_lookuphost T=dkim_remote_smtp H=hotmail-com.olc.protection.outlook.com [104.47.38.33] X=TLSv1.2:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:256 CV=no C="250 2.6.0 &lt;***&gt; [InternalId=1434519076973, Hostname=BL2NAM02HT120.eop-nam02.prod.protection.outlook.com]
 9043 bytes in 0.108, 81.598 KB/sec Queued mail for delivery"</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time our Senderscore is ~98/100, not on ANY blacklists, we have SPF/DKIM/DMARC configured, mail-tester.com gives us 10/10, we're registered for SNDS and JMRP - of which there are no issues apparent. I've also filled in the Support request form, but
 have not heard any response back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're not a huge company but we have taken great care and responsibility in configuring our emails to be on-side with current best-practices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why in this case are Microsoft services being so difficult for us? What ELSE do we need to do?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Shawn,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reading the error string it appears like you're trying to send an email from an Exchange account, either from work or school email account. Errors like this come up when there are a number of filters in

<p><span>If this problem in only isolated to sending out to Outlook.com/Live/Hotmail accounts, your email domain at some point may have been reported. This happens when a number of recipients of your email reports

            Hi SaniG 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>i have made sure no new updates are required and the app has been working fine up until now.</p>
<p>can anyone tell me if i am wrong or if this new update isn't working?</p>

<h2>            Fwd&#39;ed emails with attached PDFs yield Zero K file size at recipient</h2>
                    <p>Hello Folks, I think I might have lost this thread with the switch over to the new microsoft community. If this question gets doubled-up, my apologies :</p>
<p>
</p><p>original post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forwarding PDF around is huge part of our business, as it would be for many I suppose. We run mostly Mac's with Apple Mail and have been plagued lately (for a while actually) with fwd'ed emails whose PDF attachments are magically transformed into file sizes
 that are Zero K, (un-openable). Much to the annoyance of our customers and us as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been with o365 for 3 or more years and this is a recent problem. What has changed? Certainly OSX and Apple Mail have gone through their natural updates in this time but I cannot believe that something so fundamental as file integrity can become an
 issue in a new OS. Can anyone shed light on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I read something about keeping attachments attached at the very end of an email so that it does not get intermingled with message text, something about how the Exchange Server encodes the text portion of the email differently from attachments and
 if they are mixed files can become corrupt... certainly we have adjusted our behaviour in attaching outgoing files to emails ie. "Always Insert Attachments at End of Message"... but ultimately we cannot conrol how our customers, and theor customers send us
 emails. We would like to return to the good 'ol days when attachments were rarely rendered un-openable by emails servers, (if this is the what is happening)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other odd thing is it seems to be PDF only at this point. What is it about PDF that mail servers do not like? Currently our workaround is to open PDF attachments and close them again before fwd'ing (not saving, just open/close). This simple mystical
 action does something to re-affirm the PDF in the email. I don't understand why this works but it does. Of course this is not practical and time consuming. I'd like to out away our mystical rituals and have real solution to this if possible. Please help, thx</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Steve_1315,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed information. <br />
<br />
From your description, I know you are encountering an issue that the PDF attachment size becomes 0 in the recipient side during the email forwarding.
<br />
<br />
Given the situation, I’d like to suggest you isolate whether the issue is related to the sender or the recipient. You can do as follows:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Re-send a test email with the same PDF attachment in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App (OWA)</a> and see if the same issue persists in the recipient side. This step is to exclude the potential issue of the Outlook for Mac client. Note: Keep your Outlook for Mac client closed while testing in OWA as well as other mobile devices
 configured with the same Office 365 account.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contact the recipient to receive the test email in OWA and see if there is any difference. The intention and the detailed steps are the same as above.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we need to collect the following information to see whether the issue can be reproduced:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What are your Outlook for Mac client version and the recipient’s?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does the issue persist with all the PDF files or just some certain one (for example, big size/small size)?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From your description “the issue persists while forwarding an email with PDF attachment”, dose the issue occur if you send an email with a PDF attachment directly to the recipient? This is to confirm whether the issue is related to the original PDF attachment
 you received. <br />
<br />
Any update is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>Hello Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, thank you for your reply. The situation just happened again this morning, so this is a live sample of what we are up against. I will attached 3 screen caps from OWA showing a transaction between our customer, my boss, and myself, here is the progression:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Email from customer (Chuck) w/ two PDF attachments to Steve (my boss) - size = 1mb and 2mb.</p>
<p>2. Email forwarded from Steve (who is on Apple Mail) to me. size = now PDF 378 bytes each.</p>
<p>3. Email received by me (Christian) again on Apple Mail, but PDF attachments are now both Zero K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the attachments are initially received intact by the o365 email server, but then a fwd command from Apple Mail corrupts the attachments somehow. I receive the corrupt PDF but it reports as Zero K though Apple Mail. Does this give any insight
 to the situation. thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Christian</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to confirm whether you can reproduce this issue every time. Based on my experience, it might be a network issue. When it occurs, the attachments are not downloaded successfully and show up as Zero K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And can you try using a different mail client other than Apple mail to test? From the description, I agree with you that Apple Mail may be the root cause of the issue. You can also contact Apple support to see if they can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Henry</p>

            <blockquote>
<blockquote>...the issue I'm experiencing is that links in some websites do not open when I click them. They will however open when I right click and make a choice for tab or new window....</blockquote>
<p>When I first purchased this Windows Home Premium 7, HP laptop computer, new from
<em>Best Buy</em>, it came loaded with lots of preloaded, unwanted programs. [<em>emphasis mine</em>] I requested BB to run it's
<em>Geek Squad removal tool</em> on everything unessential; and that was performed at the same time that Kaspersky 2010 Antivirus was installed. During the ensuing three years (Aug 2010-Aug 2013), everything ran smoothly...Windows Defender was updated weekly
 by me manually, then run to scan, then turned off while KAV maintained full service as my main malware/adware and antivirus program. By the end of Aug 2013 though, I had begun to notice that my inability to open links on certain webpages seemed to be related
 to Microsoft's upgrade to Internet 10. When I was first presented with that upgrade, I did not elect to install it; I waited for a period of time, perhaps as long as 4-6 months...</p>
<p>Since I usually use right clicking, I have ignored the problem, and am just curious as to why it can not be corrected.
</p>
<p>Beginning Aug 1, 2013, I <em>uninstalled Kaspersky</em> (because I had decided by then that I did not like the corporation and its customer service, as well as Kas' annoying, interfering, subscription-key, popup screens which usually led to an uninstall/reinstall
 procedure) and installed <em>2013 Webroot SecureAnywhere</em> v8.0.2.155 within the following minute.</p>
<p>The installation of Webroot has made no difference to the link-problem.</p>
<p>During the entire history of this machine, Windows has automatically updated and installed all relevant material to my operating system and etceteras.
</p>
<p>Outside of this minor, annoying "issue", everything seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>I imagine that I may be able to correct my problem with an Internet Explorer reset however I do not wish to alter my customized settings at this time, and am getting by happily. I remember performing a reset once during the previous year (why? I don't recall,
 but I do remember that I was annoyed greatly with the alteration of everything). [<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/ie-100920016660/318ad174-f86b-4616-9f90-c6cc0898f77d"><em><strong>SOURCE</strong></em></a>]</p>

3. java (no).&nbsp; I have a problem here*&nbsp;<strong>&lt;edit added Sunday 11:58 am ET: I uninstalled/reinstalled.&nbsp; I now have a Version 7 Update 25 (build 1.7.0_25-b17)&nbsp; So the current answer to no. 3 is "yes"...but, now here's the insanity of what has transpired since
 I wrote "yes" at&nbsp;11:58 am ET.&nbsp; I accessed my usual Java website and found everything workable, however I knew that my IE 10 was operating&nbsp;without the enhanced protection.&nbsp; So I shut everything down, accessed IE Internet Options and checked "enhanced" at Security
 and also at Advanced Security.&nbsp; Then I rebooted.&nbsp; Accessing the website then&nbsp;brought forth the Windows message (detailed below during my first encounter with this nonsense last night), as did the Java test site when I accessed that!&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp;in order to ascertain
 that "enhanced protection" definitely causes&nbsp;a Java shutdown, I then reversed everything, rebooted, and tried both the website and the Java test again without protection; they both then worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, in order for Java to function in Internet 10 it
 is necessary for the user to&nbsp;disable "enhanced protection" in both IE Security and in&nbsp;Advanced Tools.&nbsp; What a stupid arrangement $%#@!&nbsp; It is now 12:24 pm ET and I am now operating without enhanced protection,&nbsp;in an "unsecure" operation according to Microsoft's
 wisdom!&nbsp; Geez.&nbsp;&gt;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[* When I attempted your link, I repeatedly received a Microsoft window which said "The page you are viewing uses Java.&nbsp; More information on Java support is available from the Microsoft website." And the&nbsp;supplied "More Info" link took me to this page. [&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/install-java" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/install-java</a>&nbsp;].&nbsp;
 If I bypassed the Microsoft window message and instead&nbsp;tried to test for my version, I received a blank java screen at your java-test location.&nbsp; So I assumed that there was something wrong and checked the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
[ The Java which is&nbsp;listed in my Control Panel Programs&nbsp;is listed as Java (32-bit).&nbsp; The "About" inside the java console says version 7 Update 25 (build 1.7.0_25-b16).&nbsp; When I attempt to&nbsp;perform an update via the console's&nbsp;update button, the result informs
 that I have the latest Version 7 Update 25 installed and gives today's date!&nbsp; Then when I access&nbsp;the Advanced tab in the Java console,&nbsp;the "Default Java for browsers" shows that Microsoft Internet Explorer is checked but greyed out.&nbsp; Meanwhile, when I move
 to&nbsp;IE&nbsp;Internet Options/Security, I have "Enhanced Protected Mode" checked and there, inside the Custom tab,&nbsp;"Scripting for java applets" is checked.&nbsp; If I uncheck the "enhanced" and then&nbsp;revisit the "Scripting for java applets",&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing is different, still
 enabled.&nbsp; Then in IE "managed add-ons" there are two locations for "Java Plug-in 2 SSV" and both claim to be enabled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ As an aside to all this,&nbsp; I came across something, within the last week, which mentioned&nbsp;that Internet Explorer&nbsp;10 did not have&nbsp;an "Internet Explorer 64-bit, without add-ons" as IE 9 had had&nbsp;( http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/ie-10-32-or-64-bit/e10533b1-bbf7-47a8-8b9d-c1ea9e8c8cd0
 &nbsp;)&nbsp;;&nbsp;so when I then&nbsp;looked inside my programs, I discovered that this indeed was the case -- that is,&nbsp;I no longer had two different Internet Explorers offered.&nbsp; I remember using the "64-bit w/o"&nbsp;once within the last 6 mos. for some reason but.....&nbsp;Perhaps
 this is somehow relevant?&nbsp; Perhaps my Java (32-bit) needs to be uninstalled and perhaps the new Java will be Java (64-bit)?&nbsp; Beats me.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I suppose since my Java doesn't work, I should uninstall it and download whatever is offered at the&nbsp;Java download
 center.&nbsp; I seldom use Java.&nbsp; When I attempted (during the above) to see if it worked where I usually used it, it didn't.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ All of this Java is too much of a headache right now so I'm offline now&nbsp;until tomorrow.]&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link to download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<font color="#0072c6">ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Download/run the appropriate scripts from the following Trusted Source (my colleague IE MVP Kai Schätzl):

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE9 &amp; IE10, too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the scripts below (plus a third one you will NOT use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.<em>32on64</em>.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named

<p>Well things don't look too promising right now for Denise.&nbsp; As to whether or not, "nothing...can harm my computer".&nbsp; You obviously realize you are asking a lot of trust from a novice without providing any supporting documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless...before I attempt the fix:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I need to copy by hand all the instructions because I do not have a printer.&nbsp; Or go to library and figure out how to get their printer involved.&nbsp; (That's not a biggie, but the library is under new construction and I'm not sure they are open yet.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Or I need to drive 20 miles to another location for a printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Overlooking those problems, I've got to deal with work for the rest of the week so rather than leave myself without my working tool, I'll need to abandon this particular "fix" until next weekend ...at least.&nbsp; By then, I should have a hand copy done too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry.&nbsp; ps. I'll delete my other posts from Denise's thread so that you don't get bogged down.&nbsp; I understand the importance of her having her own material.</p>

<p>I'm reading and copying and noticing that there is no mention of Kaspersky.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be more&nbsp;prudent to download and run a Kaspersky Removal Tool?&nbsp; Is your Step #1 reference to
<em>Symantec's Norton Removal tool</em> an oversight?&nbsp; Also, I'm not really experiencing any "issue" any longer as far as I can tell.&nbsp; Since the correction for the Java and the "enhanced protection mode" fiasco (above), everything seems to be functioning smoothly.</p>

A1. Kaspersky applications almost always uninstall cleanly. If you wish, you can run the Kaspersky removal tool &amp; reboot
<em>BEFORE </em>you run the Norton Removal Tool. Whatever floats your boat...</p>

<p>A2. No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A3. Trust me: You wanna get rid of the Norton "leftovers" &amp; other bad effects Norton applications have on a computer in hopes of not running into
<em>anymore</em> issues (e.g., when the September 2013 security updates are released on the 10th)!&nbsp; Consider the multi-step fix a 'vaccine' of sorts.</p>

            <p>Thanks Bob. &nbsp;Michael figured it out. &nbsp;He sent these steps which got rid of the line. &nbsp;But thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be sure from your description... There is not sufficient descriptive detail about the structure of what you're copying from, the one you're pasting to, or anything that would shed some light on what these lines
 might be. Without seeing the document first hand it's difficult to determine what they are, but for several reasons it doesn't sound to me like they are&nbsp;<em>endnote separators</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endnote Separators appear&nbsp;<em>above</em>&nbsp;the endnotes, not below them. The separators separate the endnotes from the text that precedes them.</li><li>Standard Endnote separators are rather short [approx. 2" in length] starting at the left margin. They don't go "across the top of the page".</li><li>Endnotes can be specified to be placed at the end of Sections, but they only appear for Sections which&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;contain endnotes, not on every page of the Section.</li><li>Endnote separators typically do not appear at the&nbsp;<em>top</em>&nbsp;of a page... That's why they're called<em>end</em>note separators :-) They always &amp; only appear at the end of the content on the last page of the document or Section.</li><li>If there isn't enough room the separator will get shifted to the next page, but it will be followed only by the endnotes pertaining to that Section.</li><li>Nothing other than endnotes can appear below the separator on that same page. The one exception is if&nbsp;<em>Sectio
<p>If you haven't already done so, I'd suggest toggling on the nonprinting characters [<strong>¶</strong>] in both the source document as well as the target. Having those displayed better enables you to determine exactly
 what you're copying because they provide the key to what controls the content being copied. If they are endnote separators they'll look like this with the nonprinting characters displayed:</p>

<h2>            BB5 Nokia 6280 Network Restriction Code</h2>
                    I think the Network Restriction Codes / Algorithm should be made available.<br />
<br />
Why should a phone restrict access to other networks? This is not fair and this will see a lot of Nokia's new BB5 phones out of the market soon because no-one will want to purchase them.<br />
<br />
I am one of those people with a phone that has a restriction code. It's locked to 3 Network - UK.

            This would be up to the networks. They subsidise the cost of the handset. The charge they make for supplying the code is one way of getting this back.

<h3> fiske1  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Synchronization could not be completed because one or more objects were in use.  Please close all programs on your device and this PC and try again.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>For the past seven months I have wasted precious hours calling AT&amp;T’s, HTC’s and Microsoft’s “tech support” in trying to solve various problems with my new (and getting real old by the minute) AT&amp;T Tilt.&nbsp; I had previously owned
 an iPAQ 1940 Pocket PC (which I would sync through ActiveSync [various versions] to Outlook 2003 almost every night on my desktop PC) and a Nokia cell phone for several years.&nbsp; When the technology finally came about, I wanted to combine what I had into a single
 device.&nbsp; After months of online research for the “right” choice of PDA/cell phone, I decided to purchase the AT&amp;T Tilt in August of 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From almost day one, I have had various problems ranging from, (“tech support”) “Well, you have an outdated operating system.&nbsp; You need to upgrade your ROM from 6.0 to Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional.”&nbsp; (So, why didn’t someone
 do that before they sold it to me, or at least tell me about the upgrade that was needed before I bought it?)&nbsp; to a syncing problem.&nbsp; After months of trying to keep up with making notations of what I had tried to do on my own, or what “tech support” suggested
 that I do to fix a particular problem, and failing, I’ve given up the note-taking and decided to give this blog a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now been having problems on my Tilt with syncing properly with Outlook 2007 on my Dell Inspiron E1505 laptop with Windows Vista.&nbsp; I had another problem during this same seven-month time period with my Outlook 2003 program
 and after many, many emails and calls back and forth, the final Microsoft tech finally had to upgrade me to Office/Outlook 2007 at no cost.&nbsp; But that still has not solved my Tilt problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After FINALLY solving a Calendar/time/date syncing problem from the Tilt to Outlook for Daylight Saving Time (all I did was uncheck "Automatic change time zone and clock" box on the "Time Zone" tab of the "Phone" icon on the "Personal"
 tab under "Settings"&nbsp; AND rechecked [after a tech told me to uncheck it] the "Enable advanced network functionality" box after clicking the "USB to PC" icon on the "Connections" tab under "Settings.") I am still left with the Title caution message above.&nbsp;
 The syncing operation from the device to Outlook (and vice versa)&nbsp;is now going just fine with Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC) and I have no other programs (that I can see) that are still open and need closing.&nbsp; So, I can't understand why this message keeps
 coming up.<br />
<br />
I was also wondering why WMDC does NOT open automatically, as the WMDC Help info says it should.&nbsp; I have to actually open the program myself.&nbsp; Connecting the cable between the laptop and the device does NOT trigger the WMDC program to open.<br />
<br />
Can I get some help with both of these issues please?&nbsp; Sorry about the length.</p>

            Hi,<br />
Do you have any 3rd party add ons installed in Outlook?&nbsp; These can cause problems where the files are in use.&nbsp; Also, what antivirus software are you using?&nbsp; These modify Outlook as well.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no longer able to get my BCC recipients in an email from my "sent" emails from outlook web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have emails in my sent items that I want to "reply all" to follow up with everyone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select the email from my "sent items" and choose "reply all", it only fills out the "to" field.&nbsp; Nothing in BCC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used this for many years to send emails to the same list of people weekly and not have to type all the BCCs over again.&nbsp; I just select "reply all", then erase my old message and make a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if this is broken or how to perform this operation not that is is no longer working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Mac, PC, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, iPad to attempt this.&nbsp; Same symptoms in all cases. Have many PCs, Macs and laptops of various types.&nbsp; Same on everything.</p>

            Hi NMSTeam,<br />
<br />
Base on the 452 4.5.3 error code, your email was bounced back because the recipients were over the limit allowed by your account. You should check your Recipient limit
<em>(That is the number of recipients which allowed in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields for a single email message).</em><br />
<br />
Since you are not Office 365 Business customer therefore, I would suggest you please contact one of the Office 365 admin/customer you're trying to email using another method (e.g. by phone/personal email) and involve the Office 365 admin in the case for further
 assistance .&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In some cases, for legal reasons, Microsoft Support communicate directly with the sender who owns the Email/IP space that is being blocked. However, non-customers typically can't open support tickets.<br />
<br />

<br />
Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            Hi sorry,<br />
<br />
It cannot the limit: there are only 5 recipients in that email<br />
<br />
<br />
On top of it, what about the second error?<br />
451 4.7.500 Server busy. Please try again later from [XX.XXX.XXX.XXX]. (AS77713180) [HE1EUR02FT056.eop-EUR02.prod.protection.outlook.com]<br />
<br />
<br />
I think Microsoft is IP throttling my server<br />
<br />
It is over than 48h <br />
Do you know how long it will take the IP throtteling to be over?<br />
Or Do you have any link that can explain this, please?<br />

<p>The message you see is from the school's web software, not from Microsoft Office, so no one here is likely to know anything about the process. Ask the instructor of the on-line class to look into the problem, or refer it to the school's IT department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when you're discussing this, you should know that "dox" can't be correct. Word documents are stored with an extension of "docx" (or, in older versions, just "doc").</p>

    <title>merge fields inside merged fields - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martull  say:</h3>
<h2>            merge fields inside merged fields</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Excuse my English, I hope you can understand me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Our system uses an Oracle Database.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The documents are created in word 2003 and stored in the system.</div>
<div>This documents contains merged fields that are substituted with data from the data base. This is done perfectly.</div>
<div>The casuistic is so big/wide that I need to create many different word docs.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I could insert "the text_code that calls" the merge field inside the oracle data base, it would easy my duty.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&lt;doc star&gt;</div>
<div>Long text here which differs depending on conditions 1&nbsp;</div>
<div>{merge field} (always the same)</div>
<div>Long text here which differs depending on conditions 2</div>
<div>{merge filed 2} (always the same)</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>
<div>Long text here which differs depending on conditions N</div>
<div>{merge filed N} (always the same)</div>
</div>
<div>&lt;doc end&gt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I would like to do is to process the word document twice, on the first time the system will merge the content of the oracle in to the merge fields, which I want it to include another merge fields to be processed in a second time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can do this now, but when I extract the text in the data base and write it in to the .doc file, is is not a merge field, it is plain text. Is there a way to include it as a new merge field?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can this be done? If so, how?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>Fernando</div>
                </div>

            This sounds like you want to create a merged document and then re-merge the document with fields from another database/table. Wouldn't it be easier to include the second set of data in the first set of data through a
<i>join</i>&nbsp;or <i>union</i>&nbsp;query that combines the data from both databases/tables?

<div>Hi, thanks for the response. This can't be done. My system is related to criminal jurisdiction and the casuistic is enormous.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I could include in my Oracle Data base the code that represents a MERGEFIELD field in Word, on he first time it is processed the code would be printed to the template, and on the second one that code would be replaced with the actual value that I need.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried with { MERGEFIELD _MY_FIELD_ }, with&nbsp;<span>≪_MY_FIELD_≫...&nbsp;</span></div>

<h2>            Drop down list with images instead of text</h2>
                    Can you create a drop down list that has pictures rather than text and repeat it over multiple rows. &nbsp;I want to create a spreadsheet that shows the picture and then can state how many needed.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example:</div>
<div>Column 1 = Picture Drop Box</div>
<div>Column 2 = Based on picture selected will provide text description of items</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can do it one time but I need it for Column 1; rows 1 through infinity.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi Kelli,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you would like to use pictures instead of text in the dropdown list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be able to do this task with using 'Active X controls'.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home, Outlook app - email delayed delivery &#40;POP checked at 30 minutes and no functionality to manually check email&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Howdy all, I was asked to re-post here - I hope that someone from MS can give some feedback:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I noticed that the delivery to inbox of any email message is delayed about 20 minutes or so. It was confirmed in the below thread by MS that the POP accounts are checked automatically every 30 minutes. OK, I am going to say that again:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">30 minutes!</span> Furthermore, there is no manual 'check email' now... nor functionality (like a 'refresh' inbox)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I am in the evaluation period of the product and before really making a commitment, I have the following question and would like to get MS' answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1). Does MS have a plan for have this fixed/enhanced in a near version? If yes, when? If no, why?</p>
<p>2). Would it help if we all put in feedback and request this enhancement? If yes where? (I would like to get an acknowledgement)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to make this last comment: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks, this is year 2015, this a paid for application/service and you are Microsoft - go back to the ones who shaved from the development requirement and spec'd it to check email at 30 minutes! ... and no manual way to check inbox.</p>
<p>Honestly, if you want to be in the market you must change your way of thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I appreciate your feedback, hopefully you'll come up with good news and say this will be updated in our next version which should be deployed on ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Delayed delivery to outlook.com<br />
I am not sure if this was already reported but the delivery of emails to outlook.com is delayed with 20+ minutes.<br />
This happens with yahoo, gmail and own server emails - they all show in the outlook.com mailbox always after the above mentioned delay - never in a minute or so as one would expect.<br />
Does anyone has any input on this issue, or is Microsoft addressing it?<br />

<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>I can understand the inconvenience this may have caused. I will be happy to help you on this.<br />
</p>
<p>To further investigate with the issue, please let us know:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you use a web browser or an email client to access Outlook.com account? If you are using an email client have you configured Outlook.com using POP or IMAP settings.</li><li>Have you made any changes to your account, prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>If you have set up your Outlook.com account using POP settings, Outlook.com automatically check&nbsp;the POP account for new messages every 30 minutes, and you can receive up to 50 new messages at a time. Any remaining messages will be included the next time
 your mail synchs. <br />
</p>

<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>I access web Outlook.com with a paid for subscription, Office 365 Home (first month
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">evaluation</span>).</p>
<p>Yes, they are all POP.</p>
<p>So, you are saying that (intentionally) Microsoft decided to check email <strong>
automatically</strong> every 30 minutes??</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no option to <strong>manually</strong> check for new email!?</p>
<p>Folks, sorry but we are in 2014. I find the above totally unacceptable, especially for a paid for product.
</p>
<p>1). Do you at least plan for have this fixed/enhanced in a near version? If yes, when?</p>
<p>2).&nbsp; Should I put in feedback for a new request? If yes where? (I would like to get an acknowledgement)</p>

            <p>Email is not an IM and I understand that. </p>
<p>F9 does not work. </p>
<p>So, if this is not a business application and just paid consumer it doesn't matter - what, $9 per months is not money?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution suggested by 'Palcouk' (a list of 'shortcuts that work for Microsoft Outlook 2013') does not work for the app.
</p>
<p>Therefore, F9 is not a workable method of checking email.</p>
<p>One may also expect that the 'refresh' button next to 'Folders' to do that but it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore the user has no way to manually check for email but to wait 30 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft planning to address this in any way?</p>
