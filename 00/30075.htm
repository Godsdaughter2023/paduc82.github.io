<h2>            Onedrive Photos, not pictures file</h2>
                    <p>I was shocked to see ALL my music album art and pictures (.jpgs and ect.)&nbsp;from my music folder and my documents folder&nbsp;when I clicked on "Photos" in my onedrive.</p>
<p>Is there a way to stop that and show only pictures from my pictures folder?</p>

            <p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for delay in replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this issue occur in OneDrive folder in File Explorer/Web Browser?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Change the OneDrive Location in Windows&nbsp;10
</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>and check if that behavior occurs the same.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>To change the OneDrive folder location in Windows 10, you have unlink OneDrive from your account and then repeat the setup process:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span>Right-click on the
<strong>OneDrive </strong>icon in the notification area and then select <strong>Settings</strong></span></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Select "<strong>Settings</strong>" and then select "<strong>Unlink OneDrive</strong>"</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Follow the setup process again and ensure to select the new drive or location to have OneDrive sync to; you must wait for your files to download again to the new location</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please note:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">if you've connected your Windows 10 user account with your Microsoft account, OneDrive won't let you unlink the application. You'll have to unlink your Microsoft account from your Windows account first.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>I don't think the response address the question asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience all jpgs show up as photos in the OneDrive web view as well as the the Windows 10 Photos app. So if you have music albums or books with covers OneDrive treats these as photos.</p>

            I agree that the response didn't answer the question.&nbsp; This started happening to me after I updated a PC to Windows 10, but now it happens everywhere.&nbsp; After updating my laptop to Windows 10, I manually selected and deleted all the music albums in Photos.&nbsp;
 This didn't solve the problem though, because I'm still seeing music albums in my OneDrive app on my phone and online.

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the GeForce 7600 GS video card in my Windows 10 64-bit system. &nbsp;I had the same problem and found a work-around here:&nbsp;https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/862015/geforce-drivers/windows-10-upgrade-for-geforce-7600-gt-graphics-card-/post/4623899/#4623899</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed Windows 10, I manually downloaded and installed the 309.08 driver from the NVIDIA page. &nbsp;Everything is working fine (and with beautiful resolution) now!</p>

            <p>I found this on another page and he said he found it on another page so someone found this somewhere. Anyway this worked for me&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run Regedit.exe</p>
<p>2. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones</p>
<p>3. Is there a subkey&nbsp;called "Armenian Standard Time"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If Yes: delete&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Armenian Standard Time" key (and only that key)</p>
<p>5. Try launching the calendar again - This fixed the issue for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the answer to #3 is&nbsp;"No" then you likely are encountering a different issue that I do not have a solution for."</p>

<h2>            How to change from counterfeit copy of Windows 7 to legal copy of Windows XP&#63;</h2>
                    Original Title: Got a bad deal and found out too late.<br />
<br />
<i>In about October of 2012 I was living in California and&nbsp;received&nbsp;a copy of Windows 7 upgrade to install in my desktop. I moved to Alaska and just recently found that the disc was counterfeit. It is functional but I would rather not deal with having a counterfeit
 program running my system. Is there anyway I can get the program out of my system and get back to using XP without having problems with my system and not losing any of my old files??? I used my computer to record music that I created and performed and I don't
 want to lose any of the files or have any of them&nbsp;corrupted. Is there a way???</i>

            <p>Its gonna be hard to find a Windows XP disc for your computer, especially if its an OEM copy that came with the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you make the sacrifice for the sake of simplicity and convenience and purchase a genuine product key and convert the installation to genuine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because if you were to get XP right now, you would have to format the drive and reinstall Windows XP, backup files manually, reinstall programs. Its like you are going 12 years back in time.

<h2>            Random Blue Screens and Crashes &#40;DirectX&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <div>Note: The graphics card IS a "Sapphire Radeon HD 7950", not a 7970. *facepalm*</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Hi there everyone.
<div>I've recently assembled a wonderful build for my new gaming needs, but I have yet to have it running stable. For the past week, I have been having nothing but random crashes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Current Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit)</div>
<div><br />
I've re-installed Windows so many times now in attempts to resolve the issues assuming it's related to drivers (terrified of the fact that it might be hardware). I have also attempted to stress-test out the graphics processing unit, have run many tests on the
 RAM, and have tested the CPU as much as physically possible. No errors have shown up here, but on each installation of Windows, I've found myself with blue screens.</div>
<div>I have ALSO updated my graphics drivers from the AMD website, specifically for my Radeon 7950.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently, I'm getting blue screens and random freeze-ups (a little information provided below).</div>
<div>I'm unsure if any of this is particular special or needed, but I posted it anyways.</div>
<div>I do remember two of the bluescreens.</div>
<div>One is "PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA", stop code of 50, and a blame on "dxgmms1.sys", which I've read up may be DirectX.</div>
<div>The other is "IQRL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL", stop code of A, and no file blame.</div>
<div>There are so many different combinations of issues that I've become fed-up with playing it by what I read, so I came here.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I've posted any and all of the contents from my "C:\Windows\Minidumps" directory onto my Skydrive, which you may find in the link right below.</div>
<div>http://sdrv.ms/1bfFTpu</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You can also find a report in the link below.</div>
<div>http://sdrv.ms/14302MZ<br />
<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd also like to add that it may not actually be the graphics processing unit, as much as I'd like to think. I've had blue screens ever since I first assembled the computer, which at first, I used the integrated Intel chip.</div>
<div>I still found myself with random blue screens since day one. Though now, it seems to only be at fault of the GPU. That's where the blue screens are most common</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, for a quick note, the power supply is an OCZ ModXStream Pro (80 Plus) of the 600W variant.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
Please assist me at your earliest convenience, I'm very worried that I may have faulty hardware and wish not to replace it if I can avoid it.</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>- Lildirt</div>
                </div>

            <i>"There are so many different combinations of issues that I've become fed-up with playing it"</i><br />
Yes, Windows does often seem to be pretty much grasping at straws when BSOD happens.<br />
More of an Hardware and Drivers forum question at this stage, but -<br />
<br />
I only have the free&nbsp; version of&nbsp; Who Crashed, but the conclusion is software<br />
rather than hardware and specifically the ATI Radeon drivers, but the other unfortunate thing<br />
about BSOD and TDR errrors is the graphics drivers very often get the blame simply because they<br />
are active at the time of whatever really causes the crash, and are the last man standing, so to speak.<br />
<br />
You should also upload a copy of you <i>System information</i> report so it can be investigated,<br />
by those who may follow.<br />
Type&nbsp; msinfo32&nbsp; into the Run command and&nbsp; then 'export' the report.<br />
<br />
Curious - how did you manage a good long RAM test if the machine is BSODing even when<br />
on the Intel HD graphics ? No graphics drivers installed at the time ? The machine does have<br />
periods of at least four hours when it does not crash ?<br />
<br />
- Meanwhile, you may want to uninstall the AMD graphics drivers and remove your HD7970 to
<br />
see what sort of dump file results&nbsp; when you are running on the Intel HD graphics, and upload
<br />
that as well.<br />
<br />
-&nbsp; Also list your power supply brand and watts in your next post, as that does not show<br />
on the system report.<br />
<br />
- You could also check for a BIOS update for the motherboard.<br />
- If you have done any custom settings in BIOS&nbsp; change them back to default. Particularly the<br />
RAM settings.<br />
- If you are using a BETA AMD driver, don't. Stick with WHQL .&nbsp; I've had no issues with 13.1 on<br />
my 7970, but 12.11 is good to ( I think&nbsp; 'Stumped' on the AMD forum prefers 12.11, but has also<br />
&nbsp; recommended the current BETA, but as BETA is still not a final version I've never trusted them ).<br />
- I wouldn't be stress testing the gpu when there are problems. Actually I'm not a believer in<br />
stress testing gpu's full stop.<br />
- While troubleshooting a new machine - Don't have anyting installed that you do not absolutely need, including Anti-Virus, extra HDD's and peripherals.<br />
<br />

            <div><i>conclusion is software&nbsp;rather than hardware and specifically the ATI Radeon drivers</i></div>
<div>Okay, that's reassuring to hear.</div>
<div><br />
<i>Curious - how did you manage a good long RAM test if the machine is BSODing even when<br />
on the Intel HD graphics?</i>
<div>Actually, to the contrary to what I was saying, I did have the driver in, it was inactive though. I had it in position and didn't add any cables from the PSU to the GPU (and had it turned off, there's a button to switch it on-and-off), so it was technically
 connected to the motherboard, but it wasn't doing anything at all.
<div><br />
<i>Meanwhile, you may want to uninstall the AMD graphics drivers and remove your HD7970 to&nbsp;<br />
see what sort of dump file results&nbsp; when you are running on the Intel HD graphics, and upload&nbsp;<br />
that as well.</i></div>
<div>Well, I've nowhere safe to store the GPU. As of now, I'll be reverting to the Intel HD chip.</div>
<div><br />
<i>List your power supply brand and watts in your next post, as that does not show&nbsp;on the system report.</i></div>
<div>The power supply is an OCZ ModXStream-Pro, which is a 600 watt unit. I've done a little thinking before hand and came to the conclusion with combined numbers, that I will not reach over 600w, or even 500w for that matter. I've given myself an extremely
 high lee-way just in case I did my math and rounding incorrect somewhere, which doesn't seem to be the case.<br />
<br />
<i>You could also check for a BIOS update for the motherboard.</i></div>
<div>I'll be sure to check that out. If this solves the issue, I'll be sure to say something.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>If you have done any custom settings in BIOS&nbsp; change them back to default. Particularly the&nbsp;RAM settings.</i></div>
<div>My "GIGABYTE" motherboards' BIOS has not been tampered with by me in the slightest. I have modified one thing on the Memory tab that I would hope not be the case. It was a factory setting, actually, to "increase" the performance of the RAM. I'll disable
 it for now and see what happens.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><i>If you are using a BETA AMD driver, don't. Stick with WHQL.</i></div>
<div>Found the update through the Control Center. The downloader had the text of "whql" in the filename, so I'm fairly certain it's not BETA. I'd never trust BETA-anything that I'm relying on to begin with.</div>
<div><i><br />
I wouldn't be stress testing the gpu when there are problems.</i></div>
<div>I'm respectably curious of why you wouldn't. I figure that getting some action out of the GPU and finding out if it's the issue might be a decent way of solving it. I suppose I can see why it's generally not the most intelligent thing to do, but I'd love
 to hear your opinion on that.</div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i><br />
While troubleshooting a new machine - don't have anyting installed that you do not absolutely need, including Anti-Virus, extra HDD's and peripherals.</i><br />
<div>Funny you should mention that, I've had an issue with DAEMON Tools Lite causing a BSOD that would be so variant and vague that there would actually be no solution to it. I did uninstall it and have lost A LOT of the random BSoD's that I've had beforehand,
 besides the three I've posted here.</div>
<div>I do have "avast!" which has never caused me any issues beforehand, but I'll definitely uninstall it and see if I can't go without for a while. I also have an external USB device (3TB) that I feel isn't causing the problems, as I find myself with a blue
 screen with or without it. Other then "extra things", I've a USB keyboard and a LogiTech mouse that connects through the mouse port on my tower.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Ah, well, that's one wall of text.</div>
<div>I'll be sure to check for a BIOS update right now and flip back to the Intel HD chip.</div>
<div>Oh, I also added a bit of information to a text file to my SkyDrive. The link will be in the original post whenever I can get to it.</div>

            <p>Looking at your Skydrive minidumps, the two 0x50 crashes are related to the file
<strong>atikmdag.sys</strong> (time stamp: 12/19/2012, looks a bit outdated). So, of three possible causes mentioned in the MSDN Bugcheck Reference -
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume."</p>
<p>(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559023(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559023(v=vs.85).aspx</a>) -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first one is the most suspect. Either the video driver doesn't match the hardware or was wrongly installed (-&gt; uninstall [delete!] and reinstall video driver), or the video card has any defects or was wrongly installed (-&gt; remove and reinsert video card
 to see results). Let's hope the other two memory faults (main RAM, L2 CPU RAM cache) are not involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third error code 0xA is related to <strong>ntoskrnl.exe</strong> (apparently from Win 7 SP1) and may support the idea of a faulty or at least incompatible driver:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS. If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver,
 a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides these additions, I agree with BossDweebe's recommendations.</p>

And my fear is now restored.
<div><br />
<div>Well, I'll be sure to test swapping out the graphics card with the Intel HD graphics.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I've read up on the link you have posted many times, but have worried myself with ANY of them being true about my hardware, which seems to be the problem as of now.</div>

            I have not had a machine that has a physical switch for the gpu, but the crash dumps mentioned the<br />
AMD drivers so, whatever it takes to make the AMD drivers and anything AMD graphics go away would<br />
help troubleshoot why the machine is also not stable on the Intel HD.<br />
EDIT: First check out Daemon down near the bottom-<br />
<br />
"<i>OCZ ModXStream-Pro, which is a 600 watt"</i><br />
<br />
Had to ask because a lot of people don't recognise the importance of either<br />
adequate power or a quality psu, and inadequate power is a fairly common source of 'random'<br />
reboots.<br />
Obviously your card would not have been drawing much power when it is basically at idle.<br />
However, I am a bit confused by the add for your psu. They mention four rails, but in the specs<br />
show two +12V rails @ 25 Amps (25Amps = around 300W). <br />
In either case you will want to make sure you are distributing the load evenly across the +12V rails.
<br />
Using one of each of the PCI-e connectors for the card on separate rails may be a good idea, or
<br />
experiment with the system on one rail and the card on the other (keeping the potential peak<br />
load in mind for future reference).<br />
<br />
- AMD recommend a 500W minimum for the HD7970, but it can draw a fair bit of power when<br />
under heavy load. I reckon a 500W would struggle, especially as it ages -<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/555c75da-c82b-47e2-8047-6baac2cda9a2" /><br />
<br />
On the stress testing - It's mainly based on two things.<br />
1) Nvidia don't recommend using Furmark on their gpu's because it has been known to fry them.<br />
This is supposed to only apply to Nvidia and I don't recall the reason why, but -<br />
2) I killed an ATI 1950XT which was my first high end card, using the Furmark benchmark that they
<br />
used to bundle in with CCC.&nbsp; That is the only card out of eight that I've used since '03 that has died.<br />
- If the machine is unstable already it can be counter productive to put it under stress.&nbsp; I reckon<br />
that is when you least want to run any heavy stressing benchmark tools.<br />
Call me biased, I don't think gpu's or cpu's need a 'burn in' or any of that, and really, the games are the benchmark that matters. My current benchmarks are games like Crysis, or BF3 in summer temps of<br />
up to 30+ C on air cooling.<br />
<br />
<i>"<b>DAEMON</b> Tools Lite causing a BSOD that would be so variant and vague that there would actually be no solution to it. I did uninstall it and have lost A LOT of the random BSoD's that I've had beforehand, besides the three I've posted here."<br />
</i><br />
Ah ha ! The dread Daemon Tools - Just uninstalling the program may not be enough.<br />
It installs a driver which has to be removed by other means. You may already know about that though.<br />
I thought I had a link to a thread and reply from Zig-zag on how to remove this wicked driver,<br />
but can't seem to find it. There is no doubt an article or three out in the wild that you can chase up if
<br />
you need it.<br />
<br />
- Yes, Avast has generally been OK for me. A few false positives over the years, but it also slowed<br />
loading my 3D settings in Nvidia Control Panel to a crawl a couple of years ago, and up until the past<br />
few weeks, was slowing Window Explorer when loading some windows, including things<br />
such as the Programs and Features list. On both occasions this went on for several months before<br />
they sorted it out.<br />
<br />
- Obviously mouse and keyboard should not be an issue, but while troubleshooting less is best<br />
regardless of perception of something not interfering, so do leave the HDD out of the mix.<br />
<br />
<i>"I have modified one thing on the Memory tab that I would hope"</i><br />
Not sure what you are speaking of here, but my main concern was that some people will<br />
try to run RAM at speeds above the default for the motherboard, not realising their RAM's labelled<br />
speed is in fact an OC speed (a shameful bit of RAM marketing which sucked me a a few years ago too ). - The Bios will generally default to the cpu's standard memory controller speed, or one below
<br />
eg - i5 3570's&nbsp; memory controller max&nbsp; non-OC speed is 1600Mhz, but mobo may set it to 1333Mhz -
<br />
no real world difference btw. In fact a high speed RAM will have a lower latency when set to lower<br />
speeds, which theoretically is better for games.<br />
Higher speeds get better synthetic benchmarks (Am I saying something biased against benchmarking again ?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70e12e57-0394-4ed8-8491-e52dac484b70" />&nbsp; ) But you would never see the difference in real world performance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>"Ah, well, that's one wall of text."</i><br />
lol - I write books all the time. Probably scare people off with too much rambling and info they<br />
don't care about. ( 'I just want my PC to work....' )<br />
<br />
Anyway - It's late here in Oz so I try and check out your new files tomorrow. Someone else may<br />
come by in the meantime with something more&nbsp; helpful as well. <br />
<br />
-Cheers ....<br />

            You caught my post at a bad time.
<div>Let me correct..</div>
<div><i>"I have modified one thing on the Memory tab that I would hope"</i></div>
<div><br />
<div>I have modified one thing on the Memory tab that I would hope not be the case. It was a factory setting, actually, to "increase" the performance of the RAM. I'll disable it for now and see what happens.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pardon that, I recently rose from a nap when I posted that.</div>
<div>As for the Memory tab, I modified an option that said "Performance Enhance". There are three options; "normal", "turbo", and "extreme". By default, it was set to "turbo". I brought it down to "normal" assuming it was the machine RAM, not the GPU.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Oh yeah, I found another Blue Screen. I just turned on my machine and logged in, right when I clicked "Uninstall" in the Intel HD driver, I BSoD'd. I severely doubt this applies, as I didn't have the AMD driver at the time, and the Intel driver was obviously
 still installed.</div>
<div>Regardless, minidump has been uploaded to my Skydrive, which you can find at this friendly link.</div>
<div>http://sdrv.ms/18CYtqO</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>From .. "<i>OCZ ModXStream-Pro, which is a 600 watt"</i>&nbsp;.. to ..&nbsp;<i><b>DAEMON</b>&nbsp;Tools Lite</i>&nbsp;.. you completely lost me. I've absolutely no idea what you're speaking of.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>Had to ask because a lot of people don't recognise the importance of either<br />
adequate power or a quality psu, and inadequate power is a fairly common source of 'random'<br />
reboots.</i></div>
<div>Okay, so does my PSU suffice? I'm assuming so due to ..&nbsp;<i>AMD recommend a 500W minimum for the HD7970, but it can draw a fair bit of power when&nbsp;under heavy load. I reckon a 500W would struggle, especially as it ages.</i></div>
<div><i><br />

Confused. "by the add for your PSU"? "they mention four rails"? What is this madness? Er, I might want to add that it is a "80 Plus" as well, which may be what they call "Silver Edition", I can't say, as they've labelled it so many things now.</div>
<div>I wish I had some sort of wattage benchmarking and whatnot to assist in this, I'd go play a marathon of League and Magicka and see how it goes .. but that isn't going to happen unless someone could grant this power to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<br />
<div><i>It's late here in Oz so I try and check out your new files tomorrow. Someone else may<br />

<div>Alrighty then, thanks for your help so far. I look forward onto hearing from more on this issue.</div>

            The second of your minidumps shows an old error (0xA). The first is something new, but again pointing to a driver error, this time to
<strong>USBPORT.SYS</strong> (USB 1.1 &amp; 2.0 driver). As the errors are going to spread out and touch too many system devices, I would really consider to disassemble and reassemble the whole computer. This may sound like a punishing strategy but if you insert
 new hardware and software step by step (on the software side: please install Windows 7 SP1 before installing any non-generic drivers) the result could be more rewarding as trying to poke around in a&nbsp; fog.

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />

<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

<p>Thank you for getting back to us with the information, Brandon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay as we are checking in your case thoroughly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error <strong>VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR</strong> bug check has a value of 0x00000119. This indicates that the video scheduler has detected a fatal violation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us run a disk <em>CHKDSK</em> on your Windows device and see if it'll fix the issue. To do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <em>Windows key</em>. This will prompt some options to display on your screen.</li><li>Type the following text in the search box: <strong>cmd</strong></li><li>Once you have entered the text in the search box, you will need to right-click on the Command Prompt.</li><li>Then, you’ll need to choose the Run as administration After doing this, you should be prompted to agree to get administrator permission.</li><li>Click on the yes option when prompted. The command window will then display.</li><li>Next, once the command window displays, type the following text into the command window:
<strong>chkdsk c: /f /r</strong> (</li><li>Once you have entered that text, make sure that you typed it correctly. Once you are satisfied that you entered the text correctly, hit the
<strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>You should then find the following text at the Command Prompt: “<em>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</em>.” Type&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>.
 You need to do this so the check takes place next time your computer starts.</li><li>Restart your device. While the computer is being restarted, Windows will check your hard disk and if it finds a problem, it will try to sort it out.</li><li>Wait until the computer restarts fully and when it does you should go back to step 2 but type in the following text:
<strong>sfc /</strong><strong>scannow</strong>.</li><li>Press the <strong>Enter.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your update so we can further assist you.</p>

OpenGL support is *entirely* a function of the video card drivers, <br />

            Hi Matúš, according to HP this is a known issue with that printer model . . .
<br />
<br />The solution from the HP website:
<br />
<br />Unplug the USB cable from the printer and computer if present.
<br />
<br />Go to Control panel – Programs and feature – Select all the HP LaserJet printer entries and uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Go to:
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/vn-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-color-laserjet-pro-mfp-m477-series/7326560/model/7326579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/vn-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br />And download and install the printer drivers
<br />
<br />Connect the USB cable if prompted and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation

            Hi Matus,
<br />
<br />Sure, it is the same way, instead of disconnecting the printer cable, just turn the printer off until prompted to turn it on by the installation routine . . .

<h2>            Accidentally Extracted Too Many Files to Desktop</h2>
                    Okay so basically, I dowloaded a zip file, and without noticing, I extracted every file to my desktop. Now, I cannot use my desktop at all (its completely blank), but I can still open applications. I’m unsure of what to do in order to fix this issue.

<h2>            BSoD kernel data inpage error</h2>
                    <p>Thank you in advance for any help given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had any problems with my desktop for some time. This morning i boot up and it just hangs, for a long time. Eventually it gives me a BSoD; Kernal data inpage error i believe it said rt640x64.sys.</p>
<p>I'm not very knowledgeable about the workings of computers, I just use them and hope for no problems. I have spent all morning trying to google my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only load my PC in safe mode, if i try to boot up normally it hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out my drivers and downloaded the newest from another computer and installed them. I have learned that it might have something to do with my realtek PCIe GBE Family controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going into event viewer it gives me a warning event.</p>
<p>Realtek PCIe GBE Family controller is disconnected from network. source rt640x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to realteks website:&nbsp;http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=13&amp;PFid=5&amp;Level=5&amp;Conn=4&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false</p>
<p>downloaded the latest drivers and installed them. I am still getting system hangs and I have left it hang for awhile and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded the last minidump. Thank you for help and please forgive me my ignorance.</p>

            HI Dmitry . I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
