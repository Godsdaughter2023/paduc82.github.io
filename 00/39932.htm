<h2>            KB2919355 Update installation - error code of 80070005.</h2>
                    <p>Originak title:&nbsp; Update installation - </p>
<p>Hello, I currently have my&nbsp;laptop set to automatically download and install of windows updates. Whenever I try to install the update of KB2919355&nbsp;it keeps saying that updates ran into a problem. When I go to "more help in fixing this problem" it shows me
 the error code of 80070005. Does anybody know about this situation I keep getting into? This is a very new pc for me and I am really new to windows 8.1, as no documentation really came with my pc about the system and the OS. Please someone help me. My pc works
 but I really think that I'm needing more input into the system and feel very helpless as I'm flying blind.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp;
</p>

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why technology stinks at times.</p>
<p>I have a windows 8 sony vaio computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need help getting my old hotmail password in order to get into the main screen of my computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My computer after starting up asks for my hotmail password so i type it in and i am able to access my computer. Normally this is not a problem but since i have been using my windows phone to get my emails via syncronizing, I can't remember my hotmail password.
 So i just now had to changed it to something new.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now my computer won't let me access anything without having me type in the old password. The problem is I can't remember the old password so that is why i changed it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is frustrating. Can anyone provide suggestions or tips? i have tried the community but i can't seem to find answers. Please?</p>

            If you rightclick on a file, choose Properties, click the Security tab, and click the name of your account that you are using, do you have checkmarks all in the Allow column?&nbsp; You can change permissions by clicking the Edit button and clicking things --
 but if the clicks don't make checkmarks appear, then the folder that contains the file needs to have its permissions changed in the same manner (or the folder that contains that folder...).

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It's pretty frustrating to have to wait hours even days for games to be installed on these modern day gaming systems. It's even more frustrating to have to sit through the wait again any time a game needs an update. Why
 aren't we able to simply put the</span></span><span><span><span> game in and play? Also if the games are going to be as big as they are why not release a system with enough memory to allow it not to get full after installing 10-20 games?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>They are offering systems with more storage these days but they also offer systems with less storage that are more economical. &nbsp;The games are getting larger due mostly to the demands of the public. &nbsp;Unfortunately, you can't have one without the other. &nbsp;If
 you want the great graphics and functionality it does come at a price. &nbsp;You can eliminate a lot of the waiting by putting your system in instant on mode where it will install updates in the off hours so you are not constantly waiting on something to update.</p>

<p>Here are some solutions for you, boss... set your console power options to always on and the updates will download &nbsp;as they are released. &nbsp;As for the storage issues, I went out and picked up a 4tb external Seagate hard drive for around $100.00. &nbsp;I know it
 doesn't really help your current concerns but it's a start. &nbsp;Plus, with an external that size, you can buy the cheapest system due to its HD size but have double the space of Microsoft's flagship console for the same price. &nbsp;The auto update will help with
 time also. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about this Krazy, on the 360 you had WAY less space to install ANYTHING. &nbsp;Everything was basically based on physical copies. &nbsp;Now, you don't even have to leave your house to grab a game...even pre-orders! &nbsp;Yeah you might only have enough space to hobserve
 5-8 games at a time, but it's not like if you delete them you have to buy them all over again. &nbsp;Inconvenient, yes but raging over it won't help either. &nbsp;I hope this helps a little, man. &nbsp;I feel your pain!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4, overheating flickering of screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4, overheating flickering of screen</h2>
                    I have a surface pro 4 that has always had an issue with overheating ans low battery life. I totally ignored all the signs of an internal issue while under warrenty fast forward now my surface pro 4 has some flickering of the screen and then went to a
 blank screen. I contacted microsoft on multiple occasions about this issue and the only thing that was offered was for me to purchase a refurbished surface pro 4 for an additional fee which is totally unacceptable beings though multiple people are having this
 issue. Microsoft has poor customer satisfaction and reliablity of its products. Ive had a technician admit to me that this was an internal issue nothing that I could have caused but still can’t fix the issue without me paying an additional fee because my computer
 is out of warranty.&nbsp;

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f10b2b24-eb5b-40fa-925e-811a9b768dfc" title="ashleydrain">
<p>
</p><p>I will do my best to help with your&nbsp;issue&nbsp;and some facts&nbsp;about&nbsp;benefits of having a&nbsp;replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your surface device has a setting that will turn off your Surface at a certain temperature so we can confirm overheating if not we might check your background tasks and close the ones you are not using it, &nbsp;delete unnecessary programs and clean cache.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I will recommend to back up your files first and if you have bitlocker enable, please get your bitlocker password

<p>
</p><p>Also&nbsp;thank you for sharing your concern in regards to the flickering your device is presenting and your warranty claim experience you had. Unfortunately because your Surface is more than three years old, it is no longer under warranty, and Microsoft do not
 stock that particular model anymore. They do however carry certified Surface Pro4s devices at a reasonably prices, one of which I am sure will suit your need also an additional warranty will be provided. Please call or set up an appointment in the store to
 receive assistance and confirm device availability: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/answer-desk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I already had an appointment and it eas nothing Microsoft over league but Supe and additional $450 for a refurbished surface pro. I also was in contact with Microsoft in reference to this issue before my three years of my purchase but you guys told me
 that there was nothing you could do but then put up a forum about the Flickering issue and replacing models.

<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid if you got in contact with Surface support within your warranty period after all the troubleshooting applied you should have received an offer&nbsp;for replacement. I would recommend to check your email and search for any reference number you had received
 after your case was created. You should have a reference for each contact. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct, there is an article about a stock of Surface pro 4 devices with a known issue related to scramble, but they have to determine&nbsp;from the wide variety of&nbsp;flickering&nbsp;scenarios how to proceed with regular troubleshooting, depending on the case
 and the final results they should inform you if you will need a replacement. Hope that clarifies your concerns.</p>

<p>Wow, this sounds exactly like what happened to me. By the time I started experiencing the problem, I was out of warranty. So I took my&nbsp;devices to a uFixIt store and they&nbsp;advised that I contact Microsoft, since it appeared to them that it was a battery overheating
 issue that could lead to an eventual lawsuit. I now limit my usage on my devices to around 4/5 hours per day, then I power it down.</p>

            Hi. Pamela
<br />My name is Mila

<br />I hope to help.

<br />	To work around this problem, change the search settings on the desktop through group policy. To do this, follow the following steps:
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows + R key to open the Run box.
<br />
<br />2. Type gpedit.msc, and then press ENTER.
<br />
<br />3. In the Group Policy Editor, navigate to the following location: Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Search
<br /> 
<br />4. In the panel on the right, double click on not search the web or display web results in search.
<br />
<br />5. Select enabled.
<br />
<br />6. Click Apply and then OK.
<br />
<br />	Search on the desktop now avoid using any of the APIs of the Web platform to acquire content from the web. This also reduces the impact of disabling Web and database caching.
<br />
<br />	Note: Windows Desktop Search, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft warehouse applications use a feature called application cache (AppCache), which allows the creation of offline web applications and caching of the Web page. AppCache also allows applications that use increase web content performance by reducing the number of requests made to the hosting server.

<h2>            Banned.. Lost DLC &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I am writing regards to my son's Xbox live account. He made a racist gamertag which I was not aware of and I got an email today that he was permanently banned. Although I believe he deserves to be punished, the issue remains about all the DLC I have
 purchased for him. In your terms of service it says that all DLC will be forfeit of an account is permanently banned. This is no better than coming into my house and pysically taking games away that I bought. This is unacceptable and not right. I do believe
 my son did something wrong, and I apologize for anyone offended by his gamertag, but punishing me by taking away many purchased DLC items is not right. I expect to be reimbursed for the DLC items OR have my account reinstated with a changed gamertag. If the
 gamertag is reinstated, I will promise I will be closely monitoring all his online interactions and can gaurentee this will never happen again. If you refuse to allow access to the DLC I have paid for, then I will NEVER and I mean NEVER purchase another Xbox
 game / Microsoft product in my life. His gamertag is <span>
[<strong>Gt Removed]&nbsp;</strong></span>&nbsp;I made the font size small to minimize offended anyone.<br />
<br />
I expect a prompt response soon either by post here, or by email.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Randall.</p>

<p>You should of reviewed the Code of Conduct (<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/legal/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>). Racism is not only illegal, its absolutely vulgar. It offends people on the service, it offends people on the forums and it offends those who manage
 and run the service.&nbsp;Below you will&nbsp;find a copy and pasted section from the CoC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't create a gamertag, profile content, Avatar action, Avatar content, or in-game content that other users may be offended by. This includes, without limitation, anything related to or suggestive of: profane words/phrases, topics or content of
 a sexual nature, hate speech (including but not limited to racial, ethnic, or religious slurs), illegal drugs/controlled substances, or illegal activities.</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't use the Services to do anything illegal. You are responsible for your actions and the consequences of your actions on the service, not Microsoft.
</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Not monitoring your sons activity whilst he used the service is not Microsofts fault.&nbsp;Microsoft monitor the service to flush out users (such as your son) who breach the Usage Agreement and taint the service by breaking the rules and upsetting other 'rule
 abiding' users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this clears everything up. If you decide to start afresh and come back to the service with a new account, be sure to read the CoC and ToU and relay the rules to your son so that he is clear on what is (and is not) acceptable as a member of the service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just an addition to the above listed posts to your comment. &nbsp;If your son was banned for his gamertag then you should know that this will not have been his first offense. &nbsp;The PET team do give ample warnings to change the tag (eg. &nbsp;You make a tag they give you an FNC - Forced Name Chage - warning making you create a new tag). &nbsp;If you choose to create a tag against the ToU or CoC of the Live service on a continuing basis then they have no option but to ban the offending tag from the Live service.</p>
<p>Now, as for the games/DLC purchased. &nbsp;Although anyone will be able to access the content on the console it was originally downloaded to at the moment. &nbsp;If you ever have a need to change your console then the content is gone.</p>

    <title>Server 2012 Suddenly cannot upload files to server from remote or even - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krammig_333  say:</h3>
<h2>            Server 2012 Suddenly cannot upload files to server from remote or even download files to server in DTP or Plesk File Manager</h2>
                    I have a dedicated Windows 2012 server at Godaddy which has been running fine.
<br />
I regularly ftp files to the server using cuteFTP. <br />
<br />
Last Thursday I was unable to upload files. By this I mean, I can connect fine, rename files, do whatever, however if I try to send a file it starts and then just times out after a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I can download files without any problem at all at roughly 3Mbps. <br />
<br />
I can upload a 1Kb file, even a 10Kb file, but anything in the Mb's just stalls and times out.
<br />
<br />
This is very strange, nothing has been touched on the server nor the Cisco firewall not at this end.<br />
Godaddy reflashed the Cisco firewall just on case but still no go. <br />
<br />
The ISP at my end says there is nothing wrong here. <br />
My general speed test comes out fine. <br />
I can Upload to another server I have at Jodohost at 740Kbps and another site at Godaddy fine at 740Kbps<br />
<br />
But whatever I try I just cannot upload to this dedicated server at Godaddy. They say there is nothing wrong they can see at their end.
<br />
<br />
I also cannot transfer files via Plesk File Manager, same thing, super slow and then times out.
<br />
Same thing with DTP, super slow and times out after 15 seconds or so. <br />
<br />
As I say prior to about Wed/Thur last week everything was fine. <br />
<br />
I have Superantispyware on the server which&nbsp; just run from time to time. I tried to do an update for that having connected via DTP and running the app, and even that cannot download the update files from their corporate website.
<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is there was a Windows update that ran last week. Coincidence maybe ?<br />
<br />
This is really urgent (and baffling) as I just cannot get any work done on the server and I would really appreciate any help / thoughts.<br />
<br />
thanks&nbsp;

Go to control panel - performance and options (Find this by typing it&nbsp;in the search box) - and set for "Best appearance"<br />
I had set it for "Best performance" which apparently turns aero peek off.<br />

 it loading? I have a ATI Radeon HD 3870 graphics card, and the OS is Windows 7. I&nbsp;am trying to run it on a 37 in Sansui through HDMI cable. I don't know what to do, because I don't even see anything loading, and that means I can't get back to safe mode. Help

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Are you using a laptop or a desktop?<br />
2. Does your computer boot to the desktop when you do not connect to the external monitor?<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if they help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disconnect it from the Sansui monitor and boot your computer normally, visit the manufacturer's website, download and install the latest display drivers and then connect your external monitor.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it boots to the desktop but does not work when connected to external monitor, you may uninstall and reinstall the display drivers and check.
<div><br />
a. Click Start, type Device Manager in the Start search box and hit Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Locate Display adapter and expand the same.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. Select the display adapter you wish to uninstall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d. Right-click and select Uninstall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the on-screen instructions. Restart the computer, if prompted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            Hi, <br />
This is sounding to me like there is some application, driver, or something launching during start up that is causing this issue. That would explain why it's working in Safe Mode. Basically by starting in Safe Mode you've disabled whatever is causing the issue.
 So the next step is to identify what exactly it is. <br />
<br />
Please read this article and try a clean boot to identify where the trouble is originating.

<p><span>Hello kaddu,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What version of Vista are you running?<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you recently installed any new hardware or device drivers?<span>&nbsp;
</span>How often are you getting this BSOD error?<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you viewed the entire dump to see what driver is indicated as causing the error?<span>&nbsp;
</span>There should have been more information provided with this error and the additional information would be helpful in narrowing down what triggered the error.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Generally, this error is caused when a driver calls a location in memory that is either not available or not in “range’.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It could be caused by a bad device driver, bad RAM, or even just a plain old everyday transient glitch.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Without being able to see the information contained in the dump there really is no way of knowing the cause and without the cause we can’t really suggest a fix.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That being the case let’s start with something really basic.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can boot with your Vista DVD in the drive.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure that your DVD drive is set to be the first boot device in BIOS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are not sure how to do this consult your computers documentation or contact your manufacturer for instructions on how to make the DVD drive the first boot device.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When you boot with the Vista DVD in the drive when you get to the language selection screen choose the “Repair” option.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will take you to the Windows Recovery Environment.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Select the Memory Checker from the menu and let the diagnostics run on your memory.
<span>&nbsp;</span>This will at least let you know if there is an issue with your RAM.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let us know the results along with the rest of the info contained in the dump file about this error in your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Jack
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h3> jasonunderwood1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skullcandy HESH 3 Bluetooth</h2>
                    I use a Lenovo P50 that does not come readily equipped with Bluetooth connections.&nbsp; I am using an INSIGNIA USB Bluetooth adapter.&nbsp; I have used this adapter on a previously own pair of Bluetooth headphones.&nbsp; I recently purchased a brand new pair of Skullcandy
 HESH 3 headphones with Bluetooth connection.&nbsp; The problem I am experiencing is that these headphones are not showing up in the list of devices that can be connected via Bluetooth.&nbsp; I have tried resetting my computer with the head phones turned off, then restarting
 the computer, then turning on the headphones and checking for the headphones in the list.&nbsp; NOTHING.&nbsp; This is crazy.&nbsp; I really want to use my new headphones that I just bought, and it just seems like there is always something going wrong!

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once you insert the DVD into the drive, what is the status of the drive, what does it show under the properties?</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following troubleshooting steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1.</span></p>
<p><span>These steps are for Vista, but still you can use it for windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>“The only change is Upper Filters and Lower Filters listed below are invalid registry entries, please remove them after completion of this process.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1. Click Start and then click All Programs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2. Click Accessories, and then click Run.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3. Type regedit, and then click OK. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>5. In the right pane, click UpperFilters.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click UpperFilters only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have
 to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to step 8.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>6. On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>8. In the right pane, click LowerFilters.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Note If you do not see the LowerFilters registry entry, unfortunately this content cannot help you any further. Go to the section for information about how you can find more solutions or more
 help on the Microsoft Web site.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>9. On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>10. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>11. Exit Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>12. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps
 carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in
 the Microsoft Knowledge Base: </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3. Uninstall and re-install the Cd-DVD drive:</span></p>
<p><span>If the drive is not listed, remove and reinstall the existing drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start and then click Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>Note If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In Device Manager, expland DVD/CD-ROM drives, right-click the CD and DVD devices, and then click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>5. When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click OK and Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Method 3 Firmware update:</span></p>
<p><span>I would also recommend you to update the CD-DVD drive firmware.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to contact the manufacturer for that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please post back if you have any questions regarding Windows. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue resolved.</span></p>

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set<br />
VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft drivers - update those&nbsp;with&nbsp;Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also <br />
update the BIOS&nbsp;and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />
