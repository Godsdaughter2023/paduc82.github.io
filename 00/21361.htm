<p>I am having problems with Outlook retrieving messages from hotmail. I have deleted and re-installed outlook connector. I have tried deleting the account and setting it up as a new account. It will send messages but not retrieve messages. I have no problem
 on mobile devices. I have 4 mailboxes setup in outlook. My company .com email, gmail, hotmail and a comcast.net account, It was working fine until a few weeks ago. Any Ideas. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Raymond,<br />
<br />
I am having the same problem currently, I have tested Outlook.com and it is working fine. I also work as a computer technician and I have just had someone come in with the same problem. Seems like the server settings are now incorrect (Or so I assume). Both
 computers where connected to Hotmail through the Hotmail connector for Outlook 2010, Perhaps this is the problem? If you know anything about it, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

Seems like the issue actually solved itself after a while. I figure it was something to do with server migration, or something else external. Anyway thanks for your response but everything is fine now.<br />

<h2>            Important information about Ovi Mail</h2>
                    
<p>About the email below - why don't you fix your existing problems before embarking on some useless project to enhance a service no-one should be using anyway?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Nokia is partnering with Yahoo! to power and enhance your Ovi Mail experience.&nbsp; In the coming weeks you can enjoy an easier and faster Ovi Mail website, the integration of instant messaging into the mail web experience, and the ability to import your friends’
 email addresses from other email services you might already use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re all set to enjoy these service enhancements very soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important to know</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the transition starts, you will immediately begin receiving new emails into your updated Ovi Mail account, but you may not see your old emails for several days until the transition has finished.&nbsp; Don’t worry because your emails are safe and are being
 moved to Yahoo!.&nbsp; You will see them in your inbox again once the transfer is complete.&nbsp; We will confirm the completion of the transfer in a separate email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re sorry for any inconvenience that this might cause, but we assure you that this is a temporary situation that will be resolved as soon as the move to Yahoo! is complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us in using the updated Ovi Mail service.&nbsp; We look forward to bringing you further enhancements in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Nokia"</p>

            does this just mean that they are closing ovi mail and moving it all to yahoo?<br />

one would have thought that a more joined up approach would have involved some kind of MS solution.

<h2>            Office365 Shared mailbox &#47; outlook web app &#47; rules</h2>
                    <p>After accessing Outlook through login.microsoftonline.com, I see my work email and my departments shared mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on the gear at the upper right, I can access Inbox Rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting Inbox and Sweep Rules, I click on the + to create a new rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name the rule, and set the first condition - It was sent or received &gt; Received through this account</p>
<p>At this point, I expected to be able to choose between my work email and the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Select Account popup appears but the are no accounts available-You haven't connected to any other accounts yet. To create a connection, go to the Connected Accounts option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm friends with one of the IT guys who told me that Rules can't be created for shared mailboxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, someone in the shared mailbox group&nbsp;must have (or can be given) proper administrative rights to create rules for a shared mailbox. This shared mailbox is strictly used by my department and I'm the lead.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After some digging I found that you can log directly into the shared mailbox in OWA. You need to point to:</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/___@___.___/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/owa/*** Email address is removed for privacy ***/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when you get to the O365 login, just use your own credentials. Once logged in you will be in the shared mailbox (only) and then can process rules as normal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me just now, so hopefully will help you too.</p>

            Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
If Mark's suggestions don't work (deleting the account, toggling 2SA regardless of whether you used it or not), you may be encountering Google's decision to remove Exchange ActiveSync support from free accounts. If you cannot get your Google account syncing
 in any other way, you may have to delete the account and set it up manually as an IMAP account. This will exclude Google Contacts and Calendars.<br />

            <p>Dear Everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your diagnoses, practical tips and (latterly from Janice) encouragement. It all worked - eventually!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, for anyone else with similar glitches, I had two problems: the password problems for&nbsp; Googlemail on my Lumia 800 and a subsequent stmp server problem with the Outlook Googlemail I have on my home computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patience, and following the instructions above, is important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past couple of days I went through various 2-step verification procedures ,obtained verication codes for my phone, updated recovery options, generated new application specific passwords. To correspond here I even had to reset my Microsoft password.
 I followed all of the instructions above. In the case of the phone that included deleting the Googlemail account and deleting the history as described above&nbsp;(both seemed mad and nerve-wracking) and setting up Googlemail afresh. Even that didn't work initially.
 So I created an IMAP account as suggested. That didn't work. Then I keyed in something I'd generated earlier (and which hadn't worked at the time ironically), an application-specific password. It worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, with perseverance,&nbsp;I got there.&nbsp;And I really am <u>not</u> tech-savvy. So thank you all for your help&nbsp;- and to others with similar problems, take heart. It is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Access Tables &#38; Relationships - moving info and preventing auto-fill&#63;</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;an employee relations database that tracks employee relations issues. There is a form and a sub-form that users complete in order to track events. In the beginning, the DB was just used to track the events&nbsp;and a new record was added for each one.
 We recently changed it to track by employee (main form) and have all the events for that employee (sub-form)&nbsp;in&nbsp;that same record. I had to move some "dynamic" fields (supervisor, department, etc.) from the main form to the sub-form, and because they were not
 originally tracked for each event entry, they are blank in the sub-form. I ran a query to get the most recent info, and manually completed those fields in the query for the past year so we'd be able to view historical data. The issue - as I type in some of
 the cells, Access 'auto-fills' all the cells that apply to that same record. For instance, one field is "WhoWorkedCase". Once I add a name to that field, that name pops up in every cell for that field that&nbsp;

            Hi. I am guessing it might actually have something to do with your table structure. All the fields in the subform should be stored in the same table. It sounds like some of those "dynamic" fields are still stored with the main form's table. Can you post
 your table structure, so we can see if that is the case? Thanks.

            <p>My suspicion is that you are using a continuous form for your subform and your combobox to select WhoWorkedCase is unbound. A Continuous form is ONE set of controls that is displayed multiple times. If the control is unbound then the same value is going
 to display in each row.</p>

            <p>You are right in a sense - they are stored in both. The 'new' dynamic fields are stored within the subform's table (tblResolutions), BUT - I also left the fields in the main form's (frmEmployeeRelations) table (tblEmployeeRelations) as well so I'd keep the
 historical data there. I'm sure I did this all wrong? I will try to explain my thinking. Because I changed the database from tracking each employee relations issue (created a new record for each event), to tracking by employee with all events in one record,
 I thought I couldn't just 'move' the dynamic fields to the subform (frmResolutions) because they were single bits of info going into multiple lines of data. And I didn't know how to do that - could not get my head around it. So I just added the same fields
 to the subform so the new data would be in that table from here on out, and left the main table the way it was. I created a query that included the fields from both tables and manually filled in the blanks on the Resolution table with one year's worth of data
 (this is where I was having the auto-fill issue - but only in a few of the fields). Then I had to create a query for historical data if the consultants need to check older records. I'm guessing there was a way easier way to do this? Yikes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sub-form IS a continuous form because once a record is completed, a new line pops up for a new entry. One of the fields I have been having a problem (Who Worked Case) with (auto-filling) is bound to a query (qryWhoWorkedCase). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your assistance! Sorry I'm such a novice. Let me know if you still want to see the table structure.&nbsp;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>What you are referring to as "dynamic" fields are a misnomer. One of the main concepts of relational design is called Entity/Attribute. This is one of the harder concepts to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically you have entities that have attributes. So one of your entities is employees, another is issues and a third is actions. Each of these entities has attributes. Employees have names, date of hire, department, supervisor, etc. as attributes. Issues
 have the employee, date, type of issue, etc. as attributes. Actions have the issue, actions taken and when taken, etc. I can't tell you you all the attributes of each entity, that's based on your workflow and business rules. But you have to determine which
 attributes belong to which entity. Where there is overlap, is generally where your key fields are. In a well designed database there will be very little overlap. Valid overlaps are key fields and time sensitive data. For example, the dept an employee works
 for is clearly an attribute of the employee. However, since employees may be able to change depts, it may also be an attribute of the issue. In a case like that, you usually populate the issue in the dept entity with the current dept from the employee entity
 to preserve the dept at the time the issue occurred. But there is another way to do this. You maintain a history of the employee. Therefore the employee history becomes a sub entity of the employee. Each change in department requires a new record with an effective
 date. So an employee worked in Shipping on 4/1/14, but transferred to Warehouse on 4/1/15. So, an issue that occurred on 7/1/14, can be determined to involve Shipping since that's the dept of record at the time of the issue. You need to decide which method
 works best for you.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks so much, Scott! I think I see what you are saying - each entity should have been a table then? I have only two main tables - employee and issue/resolution. The issues AND actions taken are in the issue/resolution table. Totally makes sense to have
 three. Darn. I think my recent update idea was a bit closer to your final suggestion with maintaining the history. With the recent changes in duplicating the fields such as department, supervisor, who worked case, issue, etc., to the issue/resolution table,
 there's a new record created each time (in that table) the consultant adds a new event so I thought it would make everything more accurate. I guess that's what you mean by overlaps - and I have quite a few them. &nbsp;Not sure how I would create a new record for
 each time a department (or supervisor, etc.) changes? I'll have to get my head around everything and try to figure it out. I so appreciate your input and knowledge! &nbsp;Thank you.

            <p>Right. Generally each entity translates to a table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, how you determine the entities and attributes is up to your work flow. But i think its clear that you have three entities. An employee can have multiple issues and an issue can have multiple actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But be careful of overlaps. I wouldn't imagine that something like dept would be an attribute of the Action. if you find yourself just duplicating data in both the issue and the action its probable that it is an attribute of the issue not the action.</p>

<h2>            Can I tell excel to not round my numbers when I change the decimal places I want&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to select the number of decimal places that I need, without having the number rounded.&nbsp; For instance 48.825 would be 48.82 (two decimal places) instead of the number being rounded to 48.83.

<p>I just realized that the number that I was trying to round down was actually rounding down to the correct number.&nbsp; I thought the number I was rounding down was 48.80, but when you add more decimal places it is actually 48.7997.&nbsp; Now I am starting to think
 that the software program in which I am trying to duplicate the calculations for is actually rounding up at the third decimal place and then only reporting out to the second decimal place which is what we told it to do.&nbsp; I am sorry to have wasted all of your
 time and I may have more questions later once I get to the bottom of what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Android Nokia 5 - unable to sign in to One Drive app or run other Microsoft apps on phone</h2>
                    <p>I have just switched from Windows Phone and Windows tablets to a new Android Nokia 5 mobile and new Android tablet. I can log in to my Microsoft account in the One Drive app without a problem on my Yoga Book Android tablet (running Android 7.1.1). I have
 also installed 2 other Microsoft apps on the tablet so far, namely Word and Excel, and again both apps run without issue on the tablet, and log in successfully to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am having a nightmare with the Microsoft apps on the Nokia 5 (Android 7.1.2). I have tried installing and reinstalling the Microsoft apps, restarting the phone, as well as forcing stop and clearing the apps' cache and data on the phone till I'm
 blue in the face, but I still can't use the MIcrosoft apps on the phone. The problems I am having on the phone are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot sign in to my MIcrosoft account in the One Drive app, despite using the correct log in details. Every time I enter the password, the&nbsp; phone just shows a message saying that there is no Internet connection, which is not the case ( I have tried numerous
 Broadband connections, as well as mobile data, and the phone is definitely connected to the Internet). I can, however, successfully log in to my One Drive account on the phone if I use the browser instead of the One Drive app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to install other Microsoft apps on the phone, including Word, Excel, Powerpoint and office Lens, However, none of these apps will even open for a split second on the phone. All that happens is that I get a message that the app keeps stopping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, the phone has an SD card installed as internal memory. I have tried installing the MS apps to the phone's usual internal memory and to the SD card. Neither work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss. I have spent days trying to sort this problem with Microsoft apps on my phone. I hope someone can help me. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Esther,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be the phone itself that is causing the issue. You mentioned that you've already tried different broadband connections to no avail. Kindly answer the following questions for clarification:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from connecting to different broadband connections, have you tried to use a different phone and see if the issue persists?</li><li>Have you tried logging into a different account on the application as well?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we suggest that you perform a hard reset on your phone. Before the hard reset, make sure to
<strong>remove your SIM and SD card</strong> from your mobile. Also make sure to <strong>
backup all important files</strong> from your phone, such as your contacts or other notepad data. This process needs at least
<strong>80% battery charge</strong>. If everything is better, then&nbsp; you can start your mobile hard reset. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Power off</strong> your mobile by pressing the <strong>power button</strong>.</li><li>Press <strong>volume down</strong> or <strong>power button</strong>, then after a few seconds,
<strong>release all buttons</strong>.</li><li>You'll see the Android logo on your mobile display.</li><li>Press the <strong>volume down</strong> button, then you should see the <strong>
boot mode menu</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>recovery mode</strong>, then go to <strong>recovery options</strong>.</li><li>Press volume button and power button <strong>together</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Yes – delete all user data, </strong>then confirm it by the power button.</li><li>Choose <strong>reboot system now</strong> and confirm it by the power button.</li><li>After completing these steps, the hard reset will be done.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Very many thanks for your advice. Apologies for the delay in responding. Christmas got in the way!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your 2 questions:</p>
<p>1. I confirm that I can successfully log in to my Microsoft account in the Android One Drive app in other Android phones and tablets.</p>
<p>2. I confirm that I can successfully log in to other &amp; new accounts on the Nokia 5 in the One Drive app. I can also log in to my MS account and use One Drive using the browser rather than app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had an opportunity to try a hard reset on the Nokia 5 as yet. Not looking forward to reinstalling everything! Would be good if something else would solve the problem first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            Hello Esther,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate your response. Office Mobile apps has worked properly on Marshmallow and lower versions of Android. Since Nokia 5 runs on a newer version which is Nougat, it is likely that Office Mobile apps have compatibility issues with this version. From a
 different thread with a similar issue as yours, which you can find <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_amobile-mso_mobapps/unable-to-open-any-office-apps-since-nougat/a8da1737-722d-483c-be89-09796f5862d8">here</a></strong>,
 an Android phone manufacturer actually suggested to perform a reset. To confirm if resetting your phone is the solution, and for other options, we advise that you contact your phone manufacturer.<br />
<br />
If you require further assistance, feel free to reach out.

Hello,<br />
<br />
To me that happened in my Nokia 5, this error is due to change storage of the office app unfortunately did not find the only solution that worked was to restore factory and leave the app where they are installed without moving them.

<p>Thank you all for your comments and help. It sounds like the MS apps would need to be installed AFTER migrating data from internal memory to SD card then, or it may cause problems with MS software on phone. Still odd that One Drive and other MS apps work
 flawlessly on tablet running Nougat! I can also see now that One Drive DiD actually back up on my phone until I migrated the data to SD card. It has worked since, and no other MS apps&nbsp; will even open. As you say, I need to do a reset. This is frustrating,
 coming from Window Phones! Thank you all again.&nbsp;</p>

            I had the same issues with my Nokia 5 phone. The solution for me was to upgrade the Android version to Oreo using the beta program. The Oreo version works like a charm on my Nokia 5 and all the Microsoft office apps are now working again without problems.

<p>Thank you so much. That is REALLY good to hear! It would be much easier to upgrade to Oreo than do a factory reset and start from scratch. ☺️</p>

<p>Redemption is a leading MAPI wrapper used by countless&nbsp;third party programs involving Outlook (either as addins or stand-alone - as a for instance,&nbsp;All ContactGenie programs also use the redemption library). Any issues that may result is the responsibility

<h2>            Formatting Changes Between Word 2013 and 2016</h2>
                    <p>Need assistance with the following problem....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work remotely and use SharePoint for document sharing and collaborative projects. My Dell PC contains Word 2013, and my supervisor's HP has Word 2016. When I edit a Word document and save to our SharePoint site, page formatting properties change when shep
 opens and views the document. For example, a nested table within a page may be purposefully place at the top of page, but when she opens it in 2016, the table is not in the same location and has been significantly moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise on what may be the cause of this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are on Windows 7 Enterprise OS.</p>

            This issue probably has nothing to do with differences between Word 2013 and Word 2016, but everything to do with the use of different active printers on the systems concerned. That's because Word optimises the page layout for the currently-active printer.
 If you want to guarantee a consistent layout on all systems that might need to read whatever the document contains, distribute in the PDF format; otherwise, you'll need to ensure all parties are using the same active printer (and printer driver).

<p>Paul has pointed out the most likely cause of your problem. So start by installing the same printer driver as your boss is using.&nbsp; Even if you don't have the printer connected to your computer you can install the driver.

</span>Have you noticed page layout differences when you open a document on different systems? There are a number of reasons why this occurs, all discussed in this tip.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another cause can be the "autoupdate" attribute on styles. That can cause style changes to cascade through the document when moved between systems.</p>

</span>When you add formatting to some text in your document, Word may apply your formatting to every other part of your document as well. If you don’t want this to happen, here’s a way around it.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>Another possibility is "font substitution". If you use fonts in the document that are not installed on both computers, Word will pick another font to use in it's place. In
 my experience the "substitution" is often not very successful. <strong>Font substitution is done without any indication to the user!</strong> If you are using Win 7 Enterprise at home and at work, so that the only difference is Office version then this problem
 is not likely, unless your boss has installed and used non standard fonts ... </span>

<span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span>When your document uses fonts that are not available on your computer system, Word substitutes other fonts that it feels are close to what the document calls for. This can cause problems, as outlined in this tip.<br />
<br />

</span><span><br />
</span>Different machines can have different fonts installed on them. Because of this, it is possible for a document that looks fine on one machine to look entirely different on another, if that other machine doesn’t have the same fonts installed. When this
 occurs, Word substitutes fonts of its choosing for the missing fonts. Here’s how to discover what Word is doing behind the scenes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in">This macro will generate a list of fonts used in the document. You can compare the names to the fonts installed on the system</p>

</span>Getting a list of fonts available in a document is not something you can easily do in Word. That is, unless you put the macro in this tip to work.</span></p>

</strong>When you open documents that were created a long time ago on a system far, far away (sounds almost epic, doesn't it?), you may discover that the documents contain fonts you no longer have installed on your system. You'll obviously want to change those
 fonts to new formatting, and doing so in a reasonable manner is the subject of this tip.</span></p>

 the use of Times New Roman. The width of all lowercase letters has been increased by about 5%. Certain letters that can be widened easily, like the "n", "u", "v", "y", among others, have been edited manually. The size of punctuation has been increased by 15%

    <title>outlook.com contacts will only sync one way with android and outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nutmix  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook.com contacts will  only sync one way with android and outlook app</h2>
                    <p>I have added my hotmail.com account as exchange in outlook app on android (nexus 6).</p>
<p>Contacts sync one way only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any new contact added via the android native contacts app to the "hotmail.com" account is deleted without warning on next sync.</li><li>Edits made to hotmail.com contacts in native android contacts app are overwritten and lost on next sync.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this problem for more than 1 year. I have now spent about 50 man hours trying to find a solution. &nbsp;Because the phone is unusable without the ability to add or edit contacts, I have been using my partners old iphone 5c, which syncs contacts both
 ways flawlessly but means I cant use my smart watch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail account was "upgraded" to exchange some months back, but the result before and after is the same (after removing and re-adding of course)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent probably 5 hours with MS support teams. &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First I tried the outlook android app &nbsp;"in-app" support. They got me to reinstall outlook and my account, and checked various things were ok, then said there was nothing wrong with my setup, and it must be an issue with the account itself. They sent me
 to the MS account support eam.</li><li>The MS account support team said my account was fine, and it was nothing to do with them, and sent me to the desktop outlook support team.</li><li>The desktop account team sent me back to the account support team.</li><li>The account support team told me to go back to the android outlook in-app support team. they told me to get an apple phone instead.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like the 100 or so people who have the same problem have no support, and no solution, other than to switch to iPhone.</p>

<p>This is exactly what I have done, probably 20 times in the last year. Always same result - one way sync only. &nbsp;To be clear:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>take a brand new nexus 6</li><li>installed outlook app from play store (did this last time 5 days ago)</li><li>Add your hotmail account as an exchange accout.</li><li>Go to conacts tab in outlook, it them asks you if it can access phones contacts, you say yes.</li><li>Wait</li><li>Go to phones native contact app, see 0 contacts.</li><li>go to android settings-&gt;accounts-&gt;hotmail-&gt;sync now</li><li>Wait</li><li>Now all 1000 of the contacts are in both outlook app and the native contacts app.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good, but now:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the android contacts app, add a new contact in the hotmail account.</li><li>Wait some time.</li><li>Check outlook.com web people view - no new contact.</li><li>go to android settings-&gt;accounts-&gt;hotmail-&gt;sync now</li><li>See contact has been deleted by the sync, and now exists neither on phone nor in hotmail.</li><li>Edit a hotmail contact on phones contacts app.</li><li>Do a sync.</li><li>See that your change has been overwritten.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have had MS support look at my phone, they say its setup perfectly, so it must be a problem with my outlook.com account. I spent hours with the outlook.com account team, they say nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, the account syncs all contacts two ways flawlessly on my old iphone, but I want to use android as it is the only platform which has the apps I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are people with the same issue, but no solution.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have the same problem with a Sony Experia X Compact and the Outlook application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New contacts added using the Android Contacts application don't sync to Outlook.com even though the application is configured to save the new contacts to the Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't the contacts section in the Outlook application not provide an option to add or edit contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just moved from an iPhone where two-way contact sync worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently decided to use the Outlook.com account as my main email, calendar and contact cloud source but after having numerous issues with the Outlook 2016 PC app and now the Android Outlook app I'm beginning to wonder if I've made the right choice.</p>

            <p>Yes, This has been frustrating to say the least. Not sure how any company can release an app that doesn't do basic two-way sync. I am surprised that Microsoft hasn't even cared to acknowledge the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company implemented Office 360 recently and contacts sync with Android has been a huge issue. We are contemplating to move back to Google Apps.</p>

<p>One solution is to switch your staff to iphones which sync flawlessly in both directions with outlook, hotmail, exchange and 365 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or purchase a 3rd party app to sync contacts (which is a big step backwards).</p>

</p><p>Seriously ? Android is the largest mobile OS (in any country). Why would I spend money on expensive iPhones to solve a stupid problem. Will check if MSFT would solve this. If not, cheaper &amp; easier to move to Google Apps.</p>

                    i have just registered my Nokia lumia 635.I've then gone abroad and tried to use the phone and the front page with all the apps will not appear. I thought this may be because I was overseas and would remedy when I returned. However the screen is still
 black with the arrow , windows logo and search logo showing at the base. Have tried the buttons but no response. Having taken sim out and battery which is fully charged. Any ideas?

<p>If I go to <strong>Picture tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Text wrapping</strong> &gt; <strong>
More layout options</strong> &gt; <strong>Object position</strong> &gt; <strong>Exact</strong></p>
<p>then after that &nbsp;the Caption function works fine.</p>

            <blockquote>Now my pictures have captions as I wanted, but another issue has arisen.
<div><br />
<div>Now that the pics are 'exact' rather than 'inline' it seems that they are effectively floating 'in front of text' and I cannot select any text wrapping (e.g. square or tight) that works. So now the pictures are hiding the text.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div>thanks</div>

<p><br />
You might try changing your workflow. Insert your image into a picture box, add the caption,&nbsp;drag the edited picture into the text box and&nbsp;text will wrap, but it appears you loose the options under Format picture &gt; Layout tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or insert your image into a picture box, add the caption, select edited picture and caption (hold shift key down&nbsp;and left click both, or draw rectangle around both with mouse), right click and save as image. Then insert that edited image with the caption
 into the text and you get the options under the Layout tab.</p>

 so we had to modify the SSL Cipher Settings on our Domino server so that only 4 methods of encryption are used. They are AES encryption with 128-bit key and SHA-1 MAC, AES encryption with 256-bit key and SHA-1 MAC,&nbsp;RC4 encryption with 128-bit key and SHA-1
 MAC, and Triple DES&nbsp;encryption with 168-bit key and SHA-1 MAC.&nbsp;Before we changed to only these 4 options, we also had&nbsp;RC4 encryption with 128-bit key and&nbsp;MD5 MAC and&nbsp;RC4 encryption with 40-bit key and&nbsp;MD5 MAC.&nbsp;Before the change I was able to connect to our
 webmail server using my Windows Mobile phone with no problem using our mail address in Internet Explorer, mail.mycompany.com.&nbsp;However, since the change, I get the following message ever

<h2>            Geomean function vs Product function in calculating index performance</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told to use a product function to calculate the returns for an index, say S&amp;P 500, for periods 1 year or less.&nbsp; Such as 1mth, 3mth, 9th, YTD and 1 year.&nbsp; For longer periods, I'm told to use a Geomean function.&nbsp; ex. 2 years, 5 years and 7 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=PRODUCT(1+D88:D99)-1</p>
<p>
</p><p>=GEOMEAN(1+D76:D99)^12-1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person left the company so I can't follow up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked Bloomberg, it looks like it's only using the product function for all periods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>AFAIK...you can you both product as well as geomean to calculate the returns for an index. The difference between these 2 fuctions are the product function multiplies the values and the geomean actually uses the average. But the sum result would be the same,
 its just a different way of doing it. </p>

            <p>For Index growth, 0 values will not matter as 1 gets added negating the impact of 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 0 and &lt;0 values GEOMEAN will not give a valid answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I googeled and found out that in case &lt;=0 values, people adopt various hacks like replace 0 with some other values and so on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my view - To handle &lt;=0, we will have to ignore them in our formula. Hence, if there is one 0 and if we ignore that -</p>
<p>
</p><p>=PRODUCT(1,2,3)^(1/3) and =GEOMEAN(1,2,3) will give same answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, if A1, A2, A3 and A4 have 1,0,-2,3, then if we array enter the below formulas and we will get same result -</p>
<p>
</p><p>=GEOMEAN(IF(A1:A4&gt;0,A1:A4))</p>
<p>
</p><p>=PRODUCT(IF(A1:A4&gt;0,A1:A4))^(1/COUNT(IF(A1:A4&gt;0,A1:A4)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if we are choosing to ignore or replacing that with some other value or taking any other approach, all have pros and cons. It depends upon case to case and every case should be analyzed to see what is the suitable approach for that.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have monthly rates of return, and:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. For 1 year or less, you want to calculate the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
simple</span> rate of return <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">for the period</span>, not annualized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. For longer periods, you want to calculate the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
annual</span> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">compound average</span> rate of return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose you have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">monthly</span> rates of return r1, r2, ... rN.&nbsp; The monthly return r1 was calculated by y1/y0 - 1, where y0 and y1 are the prices at times t0 and t1 (e.g. end of each month).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">monthly</span> prices y0, y1, ... yN, the
for the period</span> would be:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>y1/y0 * y1/y2 * ... * yN/y[N-1] - 1, which can be simplified to yN/y0 - 1<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But if you only have the rates of return r1, r2, ... rN, the calculation is:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(r1+1) * (r2+1) * ... * (rN+1) - 1, which cannot be simplified.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">monthly</span> rates r1 to r12 are in D88:D99, the Excel calculation is =PRODUCT(1+D88:D99) - 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; The PRODUCT formula must be <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">array-entered</span> (press
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">monthly</span> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
compound average</span> rate of return (r) would be:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>r = (yN/y0)^(1/N) - 1 <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>or equivalently:</p>
<p>
</p><p>r = ( (r1+1) * (r2+1) * ... * (rN+1) )^(1/N) - 1<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">annual</span> compound average rate of return would be (1+r)^12 - 1.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">monthly</span> rates r1 to r24 are in D76:D99, the Excel calculation is =GEOMEAN(1+D76:D99)^12 - 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note&nbsp; The GEOMEAN formula must be <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">array-entered</span> (press
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>[EDIT] For the simple rate using PRODUCT, the frequency of rate data can be any subdivision of the period you want to calculate.&nbsp; For the compound average rate using GEOMEAN, if the frequency is not monthly, the exponential compounding factor (12) must
 change accordingly, e.g. 365 for daily returns and 52 for weekly.&nbsp; In any case, if the number of returns is large, PRODUCT and GEOMEAN might overflow.&nbsp; Then, it is more reliable to make the following substitutions:&nbsp; PRODUCT(1+D88:D99) = 10^SUM(LOG(1+D88:D99)),
 and GEOMEAN(1+D76:D99) = 10^AVERAGE(LOG(1+</em><em>D76:D99</em><em>)).</em></p>

            <p>Windows is intentionally built to consume as much memory as possible by using smart caching (known as prefetch) in a similar way that all modern operating systems use.&nbsp; If you open your resource monitor, you'll notice that used memory is not actually used,
 it's marked as "standby" so that it can be recycled in one refresh (a hundred thousandth of a second).&nbsp;

            Are you using Heading 1 for the "chapter" part of numbering? In that case, your description suggests that there is a blank Heading 1 paragraph somewhere at the beginning of the document. Find that heading and delete it, or at the very least apply Normal

<p>I downloaded &nbsp;Open Office and have no problems at all except for the fact I do not have Microsoft Exchange. &nbsp;</p>
