            <p>Even though you had to uninstall those programs you mentioned to facilitate the upgrade, it does not mean you can't reinstall them. Why Windows 10 recommends removing security utilities and backup software, they can sometimes interfere with the setup program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually a reinstall or download of the latest revision can resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.groovypost.com/howto/install-or-reinstall-desktop-programs-and-apps-in-windows-10/
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, some of those programs you mentioned such as Malwarebytes and Crashplan can be replaced by whats already built into Windows 10 such as Windows Defender and File History/OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time, you are not prevented from using an alternative. </p>

            <p>thanx for the reply. what you posted was, very much, the learning curve i have been on over the last few months. we are in a windows world where you "can't go back to the good old days". you have to go forward with all of it and make it work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think i'll just run windows as is for awhile and try to re-d-ld bitdef in a week or so. but i'll be doing a bit of googling on that before i take the leap. the new re-install of win 10 (testerday) also seemed to be quite a leap forward. it is working ok,
 now, but i wanted bitdef and malwarebytes both back on. usually better than win defndr. maybe not, anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>crash plan was getting complaints all over the world. dashlane was expensive but last pass does as much w/ the free d-load. but it seems like win 10 is "trying to tell you" to only use win 10 "stuff"..... somehow.... thnx again....<br />
</p>
<p>not having restarts, freezes, failing updates, disk to 100%, browser crashes..... on and on and on....</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh! i've also shied away from c-cleaner, too... seems to mess things up... (??)</p>

            If programs are causing issues, then that's nothing to do with the OS. Personally I use Windows Defender with the PUA registry tweak and run Malwarebytes Free once a week just to be sure, other security programs actually running can cause problems. Windows
 Defender is a sufficient AV and shouldn't cause many (if any) problems, and don't forget, you already own it (no charges, no ads, no installs and no bloatware).

            <p>1. came w/ win 8.1. did free upgrade to win 10 sometime later in 2016. very problematic. did a whole bunch of things a few days ago including fresh reinstall of win 10.</p>

            <p>well... i'm proud to report the following... my pc being set up with all these new changes, simplifications, uninstalls of anything even remotely suspect that might interfere. the, literal scrapping of all these program i'd purchased, just on the whim they
 might be interfering with anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>the pc did an update at shutdown yesterday. </p>
<p>
</p><p>i worked my nightshift and checked on them this A.M. and they all DID INSTALL!! this is an absolute win 10 FIRST!!.... none of this has ever ever worked until i checked and saw they actually went thru.... this A.M. (!!!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am going forward as super super carefully as possible for awhile.... just to keep this thing, hopefully, running w/ win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>thing is, i'd really like bitdefender back because of some of the features it had. there were some features i couldn't stand... but there WERE a few that i liked....</p>
<p>
</p><p>but like i say, i am literally terrified to change, even simple, things on the pc, as of now, move icons around, unin crapware, games, the stuff i hate, etc. i dont even want to change background colors on the start screen!! just LEAVE THE WHOLE THING TOTALLY
 ALONE IN EVERY WAY!!! &nbsp;and run what i do off the desktop and THAT'S IT!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just leave every single thing alone, work off the desktop with my stuff, and i won't even touch any of the rest!! for fear this whole thing will reel off into months and months of bizarre instability, again!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have never been thru any pc product like this and the world should never forget this time period in windows history!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been on computers since the 80's!! win 10 terrifies me more than anything i have ever done on pc's!!! there is so much that is suspect about it!!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like the "fresh reinstall" fixed everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Chances are the HP computer came with a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. (Doesn't matter if you never used it.) Fact: Norton and McAfee applications are
<em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may have been your problem all along. If you'd run the Norton or McAfee removal tool prior to upgrading to Win10, chances are all would have been well from Day One.</p>

            i would have to think that would imply these things are still on my machine. i wouldn't know how to drill down and see if they are there. i sure don't see anything obvious in tsk manager or device mgr.... searches have always been clunky for me....

            well.... then that would be a good thing, i would have to think.... it is all running so good w/ just win defender and letting win 10 "do it's own thing" that i'm, literally, terrified to change even simple little things! i just work off the desktop w/
 my stuff and leave... every... single... other... thing as is!!! but i lost some of those bitdefender features i kinda liked to have.... bitdef wallet and password manager i despised.... but a couple little things i kinda wanted back... but, as i say.. too
 &nbsp;scared to go ahead with it!!.....

                    <p>Original Title: Windows freezes 20 seconds after logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah. It started like two days after i've installed AMD's 14.4 driver for my HD8970M. I have a MSI GX70.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open up my computer, login my credentials. After i log in, it'll freeze no matter what i do. Exactly around 20-25 seconds. My mouse won't move, screen won't change, keyboard doesn't work. All i can do is reseting the computer through power button. Nothing
 works. Any help?</p>

            <p>Hi Arteleon,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For a better understanding of the issue, I would need more information from your end.</span></strong></p>
<p>1. Where did you install the AMD driver from?</p>
<p>2. What is the complete model number of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred if the display driver was not installed completely or if the installation was corrupt.
</span>Try the steps listed here and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to perform System Restore to an earlier point when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>To perform System Restore follow these steps.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows and R</strong>&nbsp;key to open run box.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type&nbsp;<strong>rstrui&nbsp;</strong>and hit&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Perform System restore to a restore point before the recent Windows Update was installed. Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Now you may set the computer in clean boot and then try to install latest display driver from the computer manufacturer website. Check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;Perform a Clean Boot.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />

<h2>            This PC won&#39;t load, PC settings hangs</h2>
                    <p>I'm sorry, this is fairly disjointed, I don't know enough to put this an obvious category of whats wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started on 4/2, I was able to restore back to prior to the 4/1 windows update, which didn't fix it. &nbsp;I tried going back to the 3/24 update, and it says that i couldn't be completed, possibly due to antivirus software, so I disabled and tried again with
 the same (unable to complete) result.</p>
<p>
-if I open a windows explorer window, the "This PC" folder never finishes loading and has to be forced quit<br />
-at networked folder I use will not load, however, I can access a different part of the network through RDC like normal<br />
-internet connection works fine, chrome, quickbooks all seem to work fine.<br />
-there is a notification for the action center that says "click here to enter you most recent windows password", which takes me to the PC Settings App. &nbsp;it starts to open, but hangs at the blue backdrop for the app, with "PC Settings" at the top. &nbsp;no other
 text or graphics. &nbsp;doesn't finish opening. &nbsp;alt-tabbing to other applications works for half a second and then it PC settings comes back on top. &nbsp;so i can't get to task manager to end it.<br />
(I'm not sure what it wants a password for, but its been there for a couple weeks and I've kinda ignored it because the app crashed when I tried to go to it-although prior to 4/2 it was a crash i was able to end in task manager)<br />
-going to PC settings manually does the same<br />
<br />
I tried sfc /scannow and it never seems to do anything. &nbsp;i've let it run for hours and nothing prints out in the command display. &nbsp;it doesn't say its started or let me know that its running at all.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>I took this laptop home and found that everything seemed to work ok, but its a different network. &nbsp;the other 2 laptops that are configured the same, all seem to be doing just fine.</p>

<p>Don't&nbsp;know if this matters but it was a DCOM 10001, not 10010 or 10016.&nbsp; Also, this is a brand new windows load. Less than 24 hours old.&nbsp; Why would I be getting an error like this?</p>

 and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive

 and my computer IS AN HP!! All I can think is that this stupid computer is fine: It's WIndows 10's fault. Whose idea was this, anyway? If someone could tell me how this thing works, I would much indebted to them.

    <title>How to... Customize a folder&#39;s default view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awgie dawgie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to... Customize a folder&#39;s default view</h2>
                    
<p>I know the desktop.ini file is a very versatile and powerful tool, and can be used to modify the way a folder looks, feels, smells, etc.&nbsp; So what I want to know is this:&nbsp; How can I use this tool to define the default view of a folder's contents - specifically
 I want to specify visible columns, column widths, and&nbsp;icon/thumbnail size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My query is twofold in its intent.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I have already increased my MRU value to as high a number as I want, and I have a lot more folders than that, taking into account I have several external hard drives in addition to the internal drive.&nbsp; For some folders, I couldn't care less - I just
 set the default for that folder type, and let them all use that. </li><li>Others, however - and this is the second part - I wind up having to re-adjust the view nearly every time I open them, in some cases because there is no default folder type that matches my desired settings, and there is no way for me to create a new folder
 type (or is there?), and in other cases, I visit the folder only occasionally, so by the time I revisit again, that folder has been pushed off the edge of the Earth and has reverted to the default view for the type either assigned to it, or it has been reassessed
 and given a new type if none was assigned. </li></ul>
<p>I would like to be able, for those folders, to create a custom desktop.ini file, or use some other means if it is better suited to the task, so that every time I open that folder, the initial settings are the same, regardless of whether that folder has been
 shoved off the MRU pile, and regardless of whether I adjusted the view the last time I used it.</p>

<p>You can't create a new folder type, but you can adjust the settings for the current folder types (documents, music, pictures, video, and something else I forget) in many ways to perhaps meet your needs.&nbsp; These procedures will reset the templates so they
 will always be the same (just as occurs now with the current templates).&nbsp; I think these articles will help you achieve most of your goals.</p>
<p><span>Here's how to change the default template for a folder:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/70819-windows-explorer-folder-view-settings.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/70819-windows-explorer-folder-view-settings.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Default behaviour is to select the template based on the first type of file placed in the folder (it has to choose something).&nbsp; Vista sets the Explorer window view settings and
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/77444-windows-explorer-folder-type-templates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>folder
 type template</span></span></strong></a><span> according to what folder types are in the window. This will show you how to reset the
<strong>Windows Explorer folder view settings</strong>, turn off <strong>Automatic Folder Type Discovery</strong> and increase the
<strong>folder view cache</strong> to have Vista remember the view settings, folder type template, size, or position of a specific window for when it was last closed at the specific path location.<br />
<br />
This does not work with the sub <strong>Save As</strong>, <strong>Open With</strong>,
<strong>Open in New Tab</strong> (Internet Explorer), etc.... type dialog windows through the
<strong>File</strong> </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/92073-menu-bar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>menu
 bar</span></span></strong></a><span> item though. These do not seem to be able to have their size or position remembered. For these, you can use the free program
</span><a href="http://autosizer.en.softonic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://autosizer.en.softonic.com/</span></span></a><span>
<span>to resize them.<br />
<br />
Here's another article on how to change the Windows Explorer columns and sort order in Vista:
</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/108665-column-customize.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/108665-column-customize.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 This will show you how to <strong>add</strong>, <strong>remove</strong>, <strong>
move</strong>, change the <strong>width</strong>, and change the <strong>sort order</strong> of Windows Explorer columns to how you want them.<br />
<br />
Here's another article on how to change the default folder view in Vista (but it claims it isn't a perfect solution and may revert to prior behavior so it's not as good as the two prior links provided:
</span><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13880_3-10019957-68.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.cnet.com/8301-13880_3-10019957-68.html</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps with your situation.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<p>Well, thanks for all the links and stuff, but it does nothing for me.&nbsp; I realize not everyone is a rocket surgeon, so you don't want to give them info that's over their heads, but I thought I was pretty specific about what I wanted to know, and you gave
 me grade-school stuff.&nbsp; Really, my son knew how to do all that stuff when he was ten!</p>
<p>Incidentally, I looked up that last link in your post, just because you piqued my curiosity.&nbsp; I don't know what that guy sprinkles on his cereal in the morning, but it's killing brain cells.&nbsp; From the article, I assumed he was a newbie, not a seasoned veteran,
 because he didn't know how to do a basic Windows task, or rather he didn't understand how it worked.&nbsp; If you set the default view for 'Documents' then every folder that has either a perceived type or a user-defined type 'Documents' is going to look like that.&nbsp;
 But it is not safe to assume that a folder you think should have the 'Documents' type, really has it.&nbsp; It may have been perceived as 'Pictures' for whatever reason.&nbsp; Sure, fine, he explains how to turn off "folder sniffing" but he fails to explain that if
 a folder's last perceived type was 'Pictures' and you change the default template for folders of the 'Document' type, of course it's not going to make the folder typed 'Pictures' look any different.&nbsp; If he had to change the views of eight different folders
 to finally get all his template controlled folders looking like the templates, he was doing something wrong.&nbsp; And if you turn off folder sniffing,&nbsp;you will have to manually change the type of every folder you create, because unless you changed it in the registry,
 the default starting type is 'All Items' - basically a useless setting, but like you said, it has to pick something.&nbsp; It won't assign a perceived type until you put something in it, and if you turn off folder sniffing, it won't assign a perceived type at all.&nbsp;
 But... enough about him - let him get back to his oatmeal.</p>
<p>The four types that are pre-defined and that you can assign to a folder&nbsp;are: Documents, Pictures &amp; Videos, Music Details, Music Icons.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;also predefined views for Contacts and Internet Shortcuts (Favourites), but those two are not selectable for
 the purpose of assigning a folder type.&nbsp; Why MS thought it was a good idea to put Pictures &amp; Videos together in one folder type is beyond me.&nbsp; They have entirely different properties.&nbsp; So if you finally get your Pictures folder looking the way you want it,
 then your Videos folder makes no sense, and vice versa.&nbsp; They set up different folders for each of them, so there should be separate folder types.&nbsp; And there should have been a way to define new folder types.&nbsp; What do you do if you have more than one type
 of document stored in subfolders below Documents (I do)?&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like to be able to customize my computer exactly the way I want it, and MS seems dead-set at preventing just that.&nbsp; But again, I digress.</p>
<p>Back to my original question.&nbsp; From what I <em><strong>have</strong></em> been able to find out about it, the desktop.ini file is capable of changing the way a folder appears, and in fact could even make a folder full of files appear completely empty.&nbsp; What
 I have <strong><em>not</em></strong> been able to find - not even at the local bookstore - is what is the syntax?&nbsp; Why is this little file so bloody secret?&nbsp; Will lightning strike and my head turn around and around if I say desktop.ini three times?&nbsp; I already
 know how to manually adjust column widths, how to make columns visible or not, how to set the folder cache size, and how to set the default view for any one of the folder types.&nbsp; That's all Intro to Computers 101 stuff.&nbsp; What I don't know is how to modify&nbsp;the
 default appearance of <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">individual folders</span></em>, and to make it permanent.&nbsp; And don't tell me it can't be done, because Microsoft did it.&nbsp; You ever click on the Program Files folder? Unless you change it, that
 little warning about not modifying the contents of this folder is going to pop up every single time you browse to that folder, even if the folder
<em>has </em>been thrown off the MRU Mountain.&nbsp; And don't tell me that it's different because it's a system folder, either.&nbsp; It's only a system folder because someone made it that way.&nbsp; What I want to know is
<strong>how did they make it that way?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it's my handwriting, I don't know, but this is the second time I've gotten an answer to a question I did not ask.&nbsp; So I'll ask it again, with a little rewording, and a little clarification.&nbsp; And if you don't know, that's fine - nobody's an expert in
 everything.&nbsp; If they were, they'd have found a way to depose Billy Boy and take his place as chief cook and bottlewasher.&nbsp; But somebody out there knows either the answer or where to find it.</p>
<p>What syntax do I use in the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">desktop.ini file for an individual folder</span></em> - not a file type or a folder type - to make that folder look exactly the same every time I open it from now until the end of time,
 no matter what its contents are?&nbsp; I don't want to change the folder templates, because I have them all just the way I want them, and as I said before,&nbsp;the folders in question don't fit into any of those folder types.&nbsp; And I had already said that I don't want
 to increase my BagMRU any higher, so don't give meany more&nbsp;information on how to do it.&nbsp; It's at 10,000 now, and every time I have&nbsp;increased it, my computer gets bogged down just a little more.</p>

<p>I didn't give you the information you want to know because it is not available to anyone outside of Microsoft development (and probably only a few people there) - probably not even their system engineers (and I'm a systems engineer though I don't work for
 Microsoft and have access to a lot of information).&nbsp; They do not publish the procedures or the syntax ANYWHERE that can be found (I've looked several times because this is not the first time I've seen this question).&nbsp; What I gave you is the best that's available
 to the general public for dealing with folders (even if it is just basic - it isn't all that basic for a lot of other people {I've often had to give further clarification of the instructions beyond what was written} but you seem more technically savvy than
 most).</p>
<p>I agree with you that it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">can</span> be done - of course, it can be done (almost anything can be done if they want to and this should be a relatively easy fix and a rather simple procedure if released).&nbsp; The problem
 is we need the knowledge and the tools to do so and these are held tightly by Microsoft.&nbsp; They've decided this is how they want their destop to appear and how they want their folders managed and they've seen to it that we have little choice in the matter by
 holding back the information required to make the changes ourselves.&nbsp; For most users, this is probably wise as they'd probably mess it up so bad they'd need to do a system repair/upgrade or a clean re-installation to undo the mess they made.&nbsp; For those few
 who could use the process correctly, we're not given the option.</p>
<p>It's not that I don't know the answer - it's that you don't like the answer (and frankly, neither do I).&nbsp; I'd much prefer to be able to adjust each folder to my own specifications - but&nbsp;we have to live with the limitations Microsoft has placed on the process.&nbsp;
 Perhaps some developer will break his or her oath of silence and publish the information (if any one person knows it all) - but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting.&nbsp; The same holds true for Windows7 by the way - so we won't be seeing any changes in this anytime
 soon (the pattern has been set).</p>
<p>I know this doesn't really help, but I hope it at least explains the reality of things as they are known even to us (though most of us don't work for Microsoft and do this freely in our free time just to help other people with their computer problems - we
 do see many questions and issues here and as I said before, this certainly isn't the first time someone wanted more control over their folders).&nbsp; Not even those here who do work for Microsoft will have the information you need (or if somehow they do, I doubt
 they are permitted to reveal it to the general public - meaning us here).</p>
<p>I'm sorry we can't help you further, but it is impossible without more proprietary information released by Microsoft Development.&nbsp; It is simply not available.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            After Windows 8.1 upgrade, WiDi function no longer works</h2>
                    <p><b>Original Title: </b>Problems with windows 8.1 update</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have an HP ENVY 14 Touch Screen Computer which I purchased about 2 month ago. It came pre loaded with Windows 8.</p>
<p>One of its capability which I used a lot was WiDi to connect to my TV set. It worked very well.</p>
<p>Last weekend I updated the operating system to 8.1 as all the writ ups were positive. But since then the WiDi function no longer works.</p>
<p>First of all during the 8.1 update I lost all drivers for the NVIDIA GeForce graphics card which are required/used by the WiDi adaptor ( not sure if adaptor is the right name to use for this)., I then reloaded the latest version of the graphic card drivers.
 But WiDi is still not working. As per Intel's information the interface between the WiDi adapter and windows 8.1 has changed. That is now in order to connect with the external monitor I am to go to the chimes, select devices, select project and a charm is
 supposed to show up saying "add device" that charm is not showing up on my system.</p>
<p>Can you please advise what I have to do or what I may be doing wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Rudi</p>

            <p>Thank you for your prompt response. I followed your instructions, but it did not resolve my problem. I am reasonable certain that I have installed the latest versions of Intel Graphics drivers, as well as the GeForce graphic drivers. But when I follow the
 instructions for the new WiDi / Windows 8.1 interface/connections I do not get the Windows charm " Add New Device" which I understand I now need to connect my Laptop to the TV.
</p>
<p>I can follow the instructions a far as : Open devices charm, open Project Charm, but then all I see is ( PC Screen Only, Duplicate, Extend, Second Screen Only). I understands that this list should also include a " Add Device Charm",&nbsp; To me this seem to indicate
 to be Windows 8.1 related, but that is only a guess on my part.</p>
<p>Thanks for you help Rudi</p>

            I Have an HP Envy 17 Touch screen as well and had the same problems as you. Here's how I fixed it. Since you already have reached the black screen, before connecting to widi go to the hot tray. Right click on the intel graphics icon. You will find the
 set-up for the widi display. There you can choose an option to get rid of the black screen. I chose the clone option. Your notebook screen will still go black but your desktop will&nbsp;show on your T.V. I also used the intel widi remote download to bring back
 the desktop screen on my notebook. The program allows you to do other things while videos are playing on your T.V.

<p>I fixed the problem by re-installing Windows 8, i.e. I reverted to the manufacture's original version of&nbsp;OS ( Windows 8)&nbsp;and drivers. After that WIDI worked as before.
</p>
<p>Then I upgraded the video card drivers ( Intel and NVIDiA) as per HP's suggestion for my Envy 14 TS. As the system remained stable and I was still able to use WIDI, I upgraded to Windows 8.1. After that upgrade the video drivers were not lost, unlike the
 original update. WIDI worked, but the interface ( access to WIDI) is different from the Windows 8 interface, but that was well explained on Intel's website.</p>
<p>So all problems re resolved.</p>

            If you have any window that appears 'thrown' off the desktop, right-click a blank area of the Taskbar and choose
<i>Cascade Windows</i>. This should effectively place all active windows on the desktop where you can reach then to reorganize them as you see fit.

    <title>Windows 7 &#47; 8 &#47; 8.1 System Image Size Increase - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jandiscart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 &#47; 8 &#47; 8.1 System Image Size Increase</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to sketch my situation. Instead of re-formatting my entire PC once in a while, I decided to make use of System Images.</p>
<p>When I did a clean install of Windows, I made a System Image of my PC, installed my most used programs on it (development tools and a few games I play regularly) and updated Windows to its maximum extent possible at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, every time I apply my System Image again to my computer, I again update Windows and all of my programs as far as possible up to that moment, and create a new System Image. Thus, I delete my old System Image and create a new one after updating everything
 (because I know Windows creates an iterative version when one is already available of the system). However, I noticed the System Image keeps getting bigger every time I re-create it, sometimes by a few hundreds of megabytes (could be due to the updates), but
 sometimes even up to 10GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please believe me when I tell you that I did every possible check I know of on where this extra space could come from. I removed update data from drivers (NVIDIA and Intel), old Windows Update data by using Disk Cleanup, Caching data and the likes with CCleaner,
 disable System Security settings such as Restore Points, Page Files and removing reserved space for the hibernate function, ... When, however, I do re-format my PC, and install the exact same programs, games and let them fully update, it takes up far less
 disk size than using the System Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example:</p>
<p>Reformatted, pre-System Image disk usage: 45GB,</p>
<p>After several iterations of using the System Image as described above: 63GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where does the extra System Image data come from? And is there a way to delete this data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jan.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jan, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which application or software are you using to create the system image?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The System Image backup all the changes made to the computer the programs installed to files copied. Since it backups up everything it is normal that it would consume space. A system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes
 the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer if your hard disk or computer ever stops working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The system image will be as big as all the files you have on the partition you are backing up. There might also be multiple copies of the same file which could explain the increase in the system image size.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To store restore points, you need at least 300 MB of free space on each disk that is 500 MB or larger. By default, system protection might use between 3-5 percent of the space on each disk that system protection is turned on for restore points. As
 the amount of space fills up with restore points, Windows automatically deletes older restore points to make room for new ones. System protection doesn't run on disks smaller than 1 GB.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This same setting also determines the maximum disk space that can be used to store system images on a drive letter. The size of a system image can be quite large since it will include all system drives in the image by default plus any drives you have
 included. If you want to keep multiple system images, be sure to increase the max size accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Dear Srimadhwa</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking your time to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the File History application of Windows 8.1 to create my System Images for my Windows 8.1 machine, and used the standard application delivered with Windows 7 and 8 to create it on my previous Windows 7 and 8&nbsp;machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that a System Image includes everything that is on the partition(s) or disk(s) that is being copied. The problem that I have is that when creating a new System Image when recovering from an old one,&nbsp;it increases in size, sometimes with unexplainable
 huge amounts, without installing anything else besides program updates&nbsp;and Windows&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I find this size increase a problem is that I&nbsp;install Windows on a fairly small SSD, and with the&nbsp;ever increasing System Image size of that drive, it quickly becomes more&nbsp;full, and I eventually have to re-format my PC again, repeating the
 whole process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jan.</p>

<p>Hello feisalvisram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure that you are signed in to Skype on only one account on one device only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an account on multiple devices can cause problems of contacts not seeing on your iPhone 6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if the issue still persists, uninstall and reinstall Skype on Apple Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps us. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> cyborg5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Java error 1618. Cannot change Windows installer status</h2>
                    I recently had to reinstall Windows 10 using the "Reset the PC" option. I retained all my data that I had to reinstall everything from scratch. At some point I realized I should install Java but the regular Java install never completes. If I tried to install
 the off-line Java runtime I get an error message 1618. I discovered that's because the Windows installer is still running. I've been to many help forums where they tell you how to register and reregister the installer. That did not work. I've run sfc and found
 no errors. When I go to services.msc it says that Windows installer is running in manual mode. When I double-click on it or right-click and select properties all of the options are grayed out. I cannot start, stop, restart or in any way change the installer.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At one point I completely uninstalled by Norton Internet security and tried all the above to no avail. I put Norton back on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Okay, so far updates have not been an issue, however this update has removed access to my apps. They are not uninstalled as I found them still on the add/remove program list, but they are no longer visible in my all apps list and over 75% were removed from
 my start menu. Apps such as Google Drive, Audible, Dropbox, Kindle, Hulu and Netflix just to name a few. Without having to uninstall from the add/remove program and then reinstall the very same apps,&nbsp; how do I access them again?</p>

<p>John Ado, thank you for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the first two suggestions and this is what I got;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update:</p>
<p>Potential Windows Update Database error detected&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Not fixed</strong><br />
Possible issues may prevent Windows Update from keeping your system up to date.<br />
Windows Update components must be repaired&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Fixed</strong><br />
Check for pending updates&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Fixed</strong></p>
<p>Windows Store Apps:</p>
<p>Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then I tried the next set of steps you suggested. After typing in the command I got this response:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.19]</em><br />
<em>(c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</em><br />
<br />
<em>C:\Users\xxxxx&gt;dism.exe/online/cleanup-image/restorehealth</em><br />
<br />
<em>Error: 740</em><br />
<br />
<em>Elevated permissions are required to run DISM.</em><br />
<em>Use an elevated command prompt to complete these tasks.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So after some research I found that in order to open an elevated command prompt (administrator) I had to do the following.</p>
<p><span>Press&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows key</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>+</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>S</strong><span>&nbsp;and
 type&nbsp;</span><strong>cmd</strong><span>&nbsp;then press
<strong>control + shift + enter.&nbsp;</strong>Then I typed in the command and this is what I got:</span></p>
<p><em>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.16299.19]</em><br />
<em>(c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;dism.exe/online/cleanup-image/restorehealth</em><br />
<br />
<em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</em><br />
<em>Version: 10.0.16299.15</em><br />
<br />
<em>Error: 87</em><br />
<br />
<em>The online/cleanup-image/restorehealth option is unknown.</em><br />
<em>For more information, refer to the help by running DISM.exe /?.</em><br />
<br />
<em>The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, needless to say, none of the above worked to correct the problem of no access to apps that are installed. I did try going to the Windows Store and on each of the apps I am missing there is a launch button and the message, "installed". I searched
 for updates for the apps, there were none. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did discover a new problem after following the "corrective" steps. 2 more apps have become grayed out:</p>
<p><strong>Get Office</strong><br />
Check the Windows Store for more info about Get Office.<br />
<strong>People</strong> (just installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have office so really isn't a big issue and as to the other, not an app I want or will use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New suggestions would be appreciated. As a consumer I shouldn't have to do any of this.</p>
<p>

<p>I tried it with the spaces (thank you btw) and access to the apps was not restored. I created a test account and the same apps were not accessible in the program menu, but do show up in settings&gt;apps&gt;apps &amp; features in that profile as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? I have found that if I uninstall and reinstall the app the icons do show up.</p>

<p>It's quite weird. Were you able to pull up the apps from Cortana search?</p>

</p><p>What does your Start menu look like? You may use the Print Screen button and paste the image on Paint. Review your Start menu settings and check if it will make a difference.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience in dealing with a high end user. I am very frustrated by this. Updates should not take up this much of my time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what my start screen looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8accacb9-f088-4a6d-b812-670edb3fad31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8accacb9-f088-4a6d-b812-670edb3fad31" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday I made a list of missing apps, it was quite long. in total there were 48. (Not all were on my start menu). While making this list, I did search them using Cortana and was directed to the store to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a1eb2b2-620d-4b0e-acb6-e0fb5f609c13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a1eb2b2-620d-4b0e-acb6-e0fb5f609c13" /></a></p>
<p>And this is what I see in the store.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f28f21b-07e4-42ba-8d62-a9fd6d229b81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f28f21b-07e4-42ba-8d62-a9fd6d229b81" /></a></p>
<p>Searching an app everytime I want to use it defeats the purpose of all these updates which is to make Windows so much easier to use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stumbled on this post which says "<span>Microsoft is investigating reports of missing apps after installing the Fall Creators Update.</span><span>" Meliton Dec replied on October 20, 2017</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-win_menu/missing-apps-after-installing-windows-10-fall/955dfeb0-ecda-4d52-b61c-bc20211c97a0</p>
<p>
</p><p>It suggests re-registering the apps using the powershell which I will try and if that should fail I will uninstall the update. Thank you for your effort in trying to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Using the powershell only provided about 40% recovery of apps, mostly Microsoft apps. I have uninstalled the update and I have back everything that had been changed by the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i.e. my start screen</p>
