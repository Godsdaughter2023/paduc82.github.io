<h2>            Sent emails not reaching destination</h2>
                    <p>I have a strange situation going on. &nbsp;It appears for some weeks now some of the emails I have sent are not reaching their destination, whilst other are. &nbsp;All emails appear in the sent box and I get no notification that they have not been delivered - they
 just seem to disappear in to thin air..... can someone advise (in layman speak) what I can do to stop this happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I won't be touching anything ever again. &nbsp;When I said following your instructions made no difference - I was very wrong. &nbsp;The next day I tried to switch on my PC and found I was completely locked out. &nbsp;I had to put in my microsoft log in details that it
 then didn't recognise. &nbsp;Managed to sort that out - but thanks I won't be following your advice again. &nbsp;I now send a bcc back to me - if that doesn't arrive I resend. &nbsp;May not be the best solution but I can't afford to loose another day locked out of my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the up side I did learn a lot about medieval crime and punishment as my daughter couldn't finish a history essay due to computer lock out, so I had to finish for her the next day!</p>

</p><p>Hello Mrinalini,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, there is no way to remove a profile photo completely from the User Interface once you've chosen to upload one. You can revert back to the default profile image by downloading the no_photo attachment image from your pivate message to your computer
 and uploading it as your new profile image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps to change the profile pic in yammer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close all open browsers, then open an inprivate session in any browser<br />
Login to your yammer account <br />
Click on the gear symbol at the top left&gt;Edit Setting&gt;Nex to photo click on browse
<br />
Locate the no_photo image from your computer and upload the pic. Click the "Save" button to save your changes and you're done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logout from Ymmer completely and close the browser window, reopen the browser and login to yammer and check if the no_image photo was been saved or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then change the profile pic to what you want in yammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find my reply useful, would appreciate if you can click it as helpful.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Where are midlets saved on a Series 60 3rd device&#63;</h2>
                    I found this post here:<br />
<br />
/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;message.id=79942&amp;query.id=622287#M79942<br />
<br />
Its a bit similar to my question:<br />
<br />
I bought a few games using the preinstalled "download app" on my new nokia phone 5320 (some games from Glu, some from EA, there was quite a bit of stuff available).<br />
<br />
All games are java. When I should update my firmware in the future, or for any reason reformat my memory card or whatever.<br />
How do I make a copy of the games so i can reinstall them afterwards?<br />
<br />
The game costs came on my monthly statement so this is my proof of purchase but I dont have any install files or jars, also no serial. I installed all games over the air automatically.<br />
<br />
I dont know where the games are saved. The J2me folder that I found only has some preinstalled games in it. I used Y-browser to view the files. Where are these apps normally stored. How can i find them and make a copy of them?

            Provided that you ave a valid licence for the software, if it is lost you should be able to recover it from the provider of the software (note that although they are downloaded through a Nokia service, Nokia is not always considered to be the provider
 - it may in some cases be the author/producer of the software who provides their products to be downloaded via the Nokia download service).<br />

<p>after you've hard reset your device, all your personal datas including all your apps will be deleted. The only way to get it back is just by downloading it from the internet eg:ovi.</p>

<p>2. your calendar entries in the phone get written to your outlook, and your outlook entries get written to your phone.</p>
<p>3. make sure that your sync profile is set to update in both directions.</p>
<p>4. if your phone calendar is more up to date and important, make sure that your phone overrides your pc calendar.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm facing problems syncing my&nbsp;E63 to PC Suite Ver 7.1 as well.</p>
<p>I've narrowed the problem down to&nbsp;PC Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;My bluetooth dongle can&nbsp;detect and pair with my phone; but somehow PC Suite cannot "authenticate" my phone. What does it mean by&nbsp;not being able to&nbsp;"authenticate" the&nbsp;phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I'm using a 3rd party USB cable. I know the&nbsp;cable works because the phone detects&nbsp;the cable and&nbsp;I can select "Sync with PC Suite" on the phone; but again the phone&nbsp;is unable to detect the phone. What's going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are some specs on my laptop (IBM X31).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What version of Windows is being used? - Windows XP ran on IBM X31<br />
What Service Pack is installed? - SP2<br />
What version of PC Suite is installed? - PC Suite 7.1 (latest)<br />
What is the connection method, cable, bluetooth or IR? - Tried Cable and Bluetooth</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done everything from resetting the phone, reformatting my laptop, un-installing, re-installing my PC Suite. Nothing is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone pls help me...my E63 is only 7 days old and the experience so far has been frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Just in case...when PC Suite asked to "Authenticate" the phone, I did key in the same "Pairing code" on both the phone and the PC Suite. So i know i'm following the correct procedure for pairing the 2 things.

<p>I face the same problem too....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connect my phone using the cable to the PC - in mass storage it does read my Memory card. however, in PC Suite mode the damn PC suite just does not wish to detect it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could somebody guide me? When I checked back in the store I got my phone from, it worked on his machine, why not on mine?????? WE BOTH USED THE SAME PC SUIET VER. 7.1.26!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any inputs are highly appreciated pleaseeeeeeeeee.. Thanks!</p>

<p>Not sure if this will be useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a dell laptop(Windows XP) with toshiba bluetooth stack and Nokia N73. Earlier, the PC suite used to work with bluetooth until recently i reinstalled the bluetooth stack and upgraded to PC suite 7.1.26. I got the same "unable to authenticate phone"
 from the pc suite get connected wizard. I can pair the phone using the settings wizard of the bluetooth stack but not the PC suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After lots of permutations and combinations i installed a earlier BlueSoleil(2.3) bluetooth dongle driver and tried again.Now after installing bluesoleil drivers i am able to connect with my toshiba stack too. Must be some bluetooth driver issue with PC
 suite 7.1.26</p>

            I had the same issue - "Unable to Authenticate."&nbsp; I was able to resolve the issue by updating the driver software for my Kensington Blue Tooth dongle device.

    <title>Remove .DS_Store Files to Resolve Sync Errors on OneDrive for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove .DS_Store Files to Resolve Sync Errors on OneDrive for Mac Clients Workstations</h2>
                    <p>My organization has several Mac users that I support, and many report issues with .DS_Store sync errors. There seems to have been an issue where some .DS_Store files were uploaded to OneDrive, and they now cause a sync error when they try to sync down to
 a client machine. Not sure if this is due to the special nature of .DS_Store files or what. I am looking for a way to remove all .DS_Store files from OneDrive organization wide. I don't have immediate access to the admin portal, but I am able to request changes
 through another IT team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be feasible to ask users to delete the .DS_Store files in their individual OneDrive accounts, except that when you search in OneDrive online, there is no way to select all files and delete them - we would have to ask them to open each .DS_Store
 file one-by-one and select the Delete option that appears when you open the file. A delete option from the search results page would work just fine, but that's a feature Microsoft would have to develop/release, and I'm looking for a more immediate solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">We have blocked the syncing of .DS_Store files, as suggested by __a comment__ in this post (https://joshheffner.com/mac_onedrive_ds_store/). The solution in the article itself is temporary, since the sync issues re-appear when Finder
 re-creates the .DS_Store file later on. The comment (by G Baker) says "<span style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">If you have Office 365 Admin access, In the OneDrive Admin Centre (</span><a href="https://admin.onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://admin.onedrive.com/</a><span style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">)
 Go to Sync Settings. Tick ‘Block Syncing of Specific File Types’ and enter .ds_store in the box. If you can’t get this done, the next steps might still eliminate the problem."</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">The issue appears does not affect all Mac users. It's as if the OneDrive sync client was misconfigured to include the syncing of .DS_Store files, and anyone who
 happened to accidentally get some .DS_Store files synced to&nbsp;the cloud now has a lot of work to remove them all. We are trying to get&nbsp;people to use OneDrive :)</span></span></p>

<h3> stsimpson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Venue 8 Pro screen flash</h2>
                    Uploaded Win 10 to try it out. My Dell Venue 8 Pro now just flickers between the desktop and a blank screen non-stop. It won't allow you to control anything. It logs in OK then go right to flipping between two screens. It does not give you enough time
 to do anything. When I first installed it, it seemed to be working. But now that it is doing this it is unusable. Any ideas what is going on? How to fix? Or how to get back to Win 8.1?

    <title>Impossible to sign in in Office on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiril b.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Impossible to sign in in Office on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Since the latest update (15.29 - 161209), it has become <strong>impossible</strong> to sign in in some of the Office applications on Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that <em>after</em> installing the update, Word, Excel and OneNote would continuously ask me to sign in (despite
<em>never</em> having signed out in the first place <em>(are you serious, Microsoft?)</em>). Clicking the "sign in" lets me type my username and my password, but when I need to confirm via my phone (I have two-steps authentication enabled), I get
<strong>stuck in an endless loop</strong> and <em>cannot</em> complete the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7800bec2-a0fb-421d-a65a-268584a4dafa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7800bec2-a0fb-421d-a65a-268584a4dafa" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that although I use OneNote as an example here, the <em>same thing</em> happens when trying to sign in in Word and Excel.</p>
<p>I also show the entire process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAmssQuZ8E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
in this video.</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/IIAmssQuZ8E?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/IIAmssQuZ8E?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, at least the editing capabilities of Word and Excel have not been locked (that would have been
<em>outrageous</em>), however, I'm no longer able to sync my notes in OneNote unless Microsoft comes up with a fix. Ironically, as before, these inconveniences come at a time where I desperately need to use these programs and make me question
<strong>why paying for a subscription when we are being treated as guinea pigs</strong> by releasing updates that have not been thoroughly tested and that obviously break more things than they fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before someone makes some <em>ridiculous</em> suggestions, yes, I have the most up-do-date version of Office (Insider Preview, slow ring) and yes, I have sent feedback to Microsoft before posting here. The latter is just done for achieving some publicity
 in the hope that they would actually pay more attention to their users.</p>

                    <p>My computer just automatically updated Windows 10 on Saturday night. When it was all done, my MS Outlook icon that I had pinned to the taskbar was replaced by "Mail." When I click on mail, it asks me to add an account.&nbsp;I can't find my Outlook program anywhere
 and I had a lot of email saved in there. Is there a way to get it back without having to restore to a point before the update? I am panicking here...</p>

            So...it seems that the update replaced my Outlook icon on my taskbar with the Microsoft Mail icon. I finally found my Outlook 2013 in the Microsoft Office folder, but for some reason it made me reinstall. Once I reinstalled, it found my .ost files and
 I got all my email back. I hate it when they make these kinds of changes. I had to reset a bunch of my defaults back to the programs I wanted to use and had to pin all of my icons back to the taskbar. I keep finding little things that have been changed which
 is really irritating.

            I have just checked those two's comparison.<br />
The main difference is E61/E61i has keyboard that e65 lacks.<br />
But E65 tends to be crashing less than E61/E61i.<br />
So, if y like qwerty keyboard then go for E61/E61i.

            Had my E65 two days now and everything seems pretty good to me. I upgraded from the N73 which has been pretty poor from start to finish. The only theing as already mentioned are the camera resolution and no camera on the front for video calls but TBH I've
 probably only ever made 4 video calls in the last two years so not guna miss that too much. Apart from that I'm just struggling to find much out about the Navigator program.

<p>hi! sorry in advance if i make any english mistakes since it's not my first language.</p>
<p>now, to my problem. is it just me or it doesn't seem to be possible to create a ''dropdown menu'' with my pages on onenote 2016 for mac?</p>
<p>the next two pictures are taken from my friend's windows computer. he has the possibility to create the ''dropdown menu'' i'm talking about by clicking on the little arrow next to the page.</p>

<p>i, on the other hand, don't have this arrow (see picture below).</p>

<p>is this really a missing feature on the mac version of onenote 2016 or am i doing something wrong? i searched on some forums and no one seems to complain about that... if it is missing, would it be possible for the microsoft team to add this feature? i think
 it would be really useful.</p>
<p>it's kind of weird that the mac version doesn't have that simple feature but the windows one has it...</p>
<p>thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Frederick,</p>
<p>Collapsible pages feature is not available on OneNote for Mac 2016. The best way to improve the product is to submit your feedback and vote through the link below:</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. It's nice that the OneNote Team is taking suggestions for the software, but do they actually do something about them? The reason why I'm asking this is because the link you gave me is referring to a suggestion that was shared in
 2014. Now it's 2016 and we still don't have collapsible pages...</p>

<h2>            Outlook webmail not allowing login from tor&#47;VPN</h2>
                    <p>I cannot login to my outlook account from the tor network (or using another vpn) since my ip would be changed to something from another country. It would demand a security code but the problem is my alternative email is also blocked for the same reason (ip
 from different country).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable the security code step in some security setting?</p>

 logon. &nbsp;Such a policy decreases my security even though it is intended to increase my security. &nbsp;I should be allowed to take responsibility for choosing how I balance the two possibilities. &nbsp;This makes me suspect that such a logon policy was not designed only

            <p>I seem to have the same problem. Using tor (the only acceptable browser) starts a fit from outlook (formerly hotmail) and i am having to answer with a code sent to my telephone to make sure I am me. All fine and good, but immediately after I am forced to
 change my password to something entirely new and shiny, and to be frank it is quite exhausting to come up with something you can remember every time you accidentally log in safely using tor.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. &nbsp;This appears to be a security feature for the masses that are not attempting to take their own security into account and using methods to secure their anonymity and encrypt their traffic at the same time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agreed there should be an opt out feature of the security rules if you are using VPN and an additional option for using TOR browsers. &nbsp; I will use alternative service that are more configurable, or does not have the masses security in mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to Google for anyone security aware is counter intuitive.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; I may have discovered a way to sign in while using TOR that DIDN'T force me to verify my Outlook account and force me to change my password.&nbsp; When the MSN.com page came up it said "Sign In" at the middle, top of page.&nbsp; I used my email address and password
 there.&nbsp; It signed me in, but left me on the MSN.com page.&nbsp; The "Sign In" now had my name.&nbsp; Next, I clicked on Outlook at the top of the page and it took me to my email WITHOUT asking me to verify or change my password!!!&nbsp; LIFE IS GOOD AGAIN!!!&nbsp; (Picture me
 dancing around like Snoopy does when he's happy!)&nbsp; I hope this works for everyone else.&nbsp; SO...try going to MSN.com first and start Outlook login from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT...I did see that when I signed out of my Outlook email that the MSN.com page still had my name at the top.&nbsp; I was still signed in at Microsoft account.&nbsp; I clicked on the emoticon to the right of my name and clicked "Sign out"&nbsp; NOW I was totally signed
 out.&nbsp; A few more steps to take, but at least it looks like you won't need to verify your account and change your password each time you logon.</p>

            Hi Craig
<br />
<br />Pop-ups can appear independently of a legitimate website. Here are some things you can try:
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: internet options
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click the Advanced tab
<br />Click Reset
<br />Click Reset again
<br />
<br />Check if its working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Uncheck Internet Explorer
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Check Internet Explorer
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />
<br />Check if its working again.
<br />
<br />If not, I recommend you install a third party ad blocker for Internet Explorer.

<p>Hi Manuel,</p>
<p>The Next Gen sync client for OneDrive for Business doesn’t support sync library by initiating the sync from the browser. And, currently, it only supports sync user’s own OneDrive for Business library. That means, we cannot sync other user’s OneDrive for
 Business library and team site library. See: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202
</p>
<p>When we click into files in Shared with me, it redirects to other user’s OneDrive for Business library or team site library.</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding about this. For this, you may consider submitting feedback via
<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice</a> to our related team directly pass your comment. Our product team will collect all your valuable opinions, and based on them, try making the product more user-friendly.</p>
<p>To achieve your requirement, I'd suggest you install the previous OneDrive for Business application:

            Kendra,<br />
Lots of good information below.<br />
<br />
<b>The Contacts pages have been updated to People, a modern experience for managing your address book and helping you stay in touch with the people you care about most.</b>&nbsp;
<br />
People, as a web service, mirrors the features and functions of other recent Microsoft products such as the People hub for Windows Phone, the People app for Windows 8, and the People experience in Outlook 2013.
<br />
The new People experience will provide the features that you’ve always used, integration with Hotmail, Messenger, and the new Outlook.com web mail service.&nbsp;
<br />
Third party integration with Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and more are available as well.<br />
<br />
The redesign of the contacts pages is being rolled out to all customers, and is intended to be faster and easier to use than the older experience that could not handle the demands of our users.
<br />
<b>While this change may be frustrating at first, if you bear with us, we think you will find that the new layout is a better experience than the previous version.
</b><br />
<br />
<b>We’ve outlined some common “How-To’s” of People below.</b><br />
<br />
Viewing the Contacts page on People:<br />
http://people.live.com<br />
<br />
<b>To access People from Hotmail, click on the Contacts link. </b><br />
To access People from Outlook.com, hover the cursor over the Outlook logo in the top left and click on the down-arrow that appears to the right of the Outlook logo. Select People.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<b>Returning to your Inbox from People:</b><br />
Hover the cursor over the People logo and click on the down-arrow that appears on the right of the People logo. Select Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also get to Calendar or Skydrive in the same manner.<br />
<br />
<b>Filtering your list:</b><br />
Above the search box at the top of the Contact list on the left, is a filter option which says "All ".&nbsp; If you click on this you should see the groups you created in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on any of these to filter your list to just the contacts in that group.<br />
<b><br />
Selecting one or many Contacts:</b><br />
If you click on a contact name in the list, the details for that contact will appear on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, if you click on the check box to the left of the contact picture, you can build up a list of selected contacts on the right by clicking on the
 check box to the left of multiple contacts.<br />
<b><br />
Adding/Removing from Group membership:</b><br />
Whether you select one or many contacts, you will see a top menu bar option for Groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you click on this, then it will display the list of groups with a check box checked for each group that the contact(s) is/are a member of.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can uncheck to remove or check to add, the selection of contact(s) to the chosen groups, and then click on Apply to apply the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your selected contacts will then be updated to be added or removed from the groups you chose as appropriate.<br />
<br />
<b>Delete</b><br />
When you select one or many contacts, you will see a top menu bar option for Delete.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you click on Delete and click Delete in the confirmation box, the selected contacts will be deleted.<br />
<br />
<b>Edit:</b><br />
You can choose edit if you have clicked on a single contact (name or picture) in the list on the left to see their details on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp; When viewing their details, click on Edit in the top menu bar to edit or add details.<br />
<br />
<b>Browsers:</b><br />
We recommend that you keep your web browser up to date to get the most out of the People experience.
<br />
If you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of People might not work and it might not display properly.
<br />
<b>&nbsp;To update your brower, click here:</b><br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/supported-browsers<br />
If you are unable to upgrade your browser then you can view your contacts using the mobile link:&nbsp;

<h2>            Paragraph marks will not disappear</h2>
                    I have found that paragraph marks remain visible in my word documents and that the paragraph mark button has disappeared from the tool bar. I have found using word generally harder since I started using it on a Mac two years ago but this is just weird.
 May I have suggestions to try to make the paragraph marks disappear.<br />

            The keyboard shortcut Cmd+8 will toggle the non-printing characters on and off. Try that and see if if you can get the paragraph marks to show/hide while viewing the document on the screen.
<div><br />
<div>For restoring the non-printing character button to your Standard toolbar you can do one of two things.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Go to View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize Toolbars… then select the Standard toolbar and use the Reset button to return it to default settings.</li><li>From the same dialog select the Commands tab, which is located at the top of the dialog, and then from the Category column select View and from the Commands column drag the Show icon back onto your Standard toolbar.</li></ol>

<p>£12,096.77 divided by 70% (30% mark up) = £17,281.10</p>
<p>
</p><p>W now are in a position that we find ourselves quoting for our distributors when in fact we would rather give them a price list that has a live feed to it and they can work the price out</p>
<p>
</p><p>can anyone help??? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Gord,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get that formula to work in a new spreadsheet but what I am finding is that on every conversion I seem to need a new column for each product (The spreadsheet I am trying to work on in particular has 30 different types of machines with varying optional
 extras)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to work a sum / formula that converts existing cells into £ from Euros &amp; adds mark up - it's driving me insane all I want to do is give a few distributors a spreadsheet that when they open it and refresh it gives them an up to date price on what they
 can purchase the machinery from me at (after conversion from Eur&gt;Stg &amp; then with our mark up on)</p>

<p>Jio has decided not to support Windows phones. That is an discision that is going on for a while now.</p>
<p>Do a search on this community and you'll find many other threads about this.</p>
<p>And Jio only has Android an IOS apps available, and both version are not compatible.</p>

<h2>            Lock button spoilt  How else to unlock phone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My power button is spoilt and I am planning to send it for repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However since my power button is spoilt, how else can i unlock my phone? I read some threads and they say they could use the camera button to unlock the phone but I have no idea how to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can plug it in to a charger to bring up the screen but other than that I have no way to unlock it. Could someone teach me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pressing and holding the camera button will start the camera. Once the camera starts you cab back out from that which brings you to the lock screen.</p>

<h2>            Enabling Cortana on phones with 10059 &#40;10 April release enabling many more phone models&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my Lumia 535 I couldn't figure out initially how to get cortana to work. I opened the search app and was prompted by cortana that she needs permission to access location data, and clicking the button to do so caused the screen to dim slightly
 as though an overlay was placed on-top of the app with a semi-transparent background but no contents. I tried several ways to get around this and found that the following steps enabled cortana to become active:</p>
<ol>
<li>open settings</li><li>goto privacy-&gt;location</li><li>turn off the option for sharing with the search app and then re-enable</li><li>turn off the location feature entirely and then re-enable</li><li>go back to the search app</li><li>select the hamburger icon on the top-left and choose settings</li><li>finally toggle the switch to enable cortana</li></ol>
<p>These steps enabled cortana and she now works correctly.</p>
