<h2>            Some emails are not sending&#47;receiving.  Hit and Miss with certain addresses.</h2>
                    I use a Cox server and several fellow customers (friends/business associates)&nbsp;are many times not receiving my emails and theirs are not going through to me.&nbsp; It is hit and miss; sometimes they do go through.&nbsp; They are not on any "Blocked" list.&nbsp; Is there
 a way to ensure delivery on both sides?&nbsp; (BTW:&nbsp; On the Outlook Express 'sent' email folder, it shows it was sent, but they never receive it).&nbsp; Thank you!

    <title>Access error message&#58; Compile error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve_886  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access error message&#58; Compile error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
An access database was working as required several days ago. On opening the database today some of the functionality has been corrupted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For example the database was set up for a contact name to be entered by the user in a combo box (the row source refers to a query that selects various properties relating to the contact).&nbsp;<br />
Using an 'after update' event code 2 text boxes used to have contact properties (e.g. role and company) automatically completed. this functionality no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other examples as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On attempting to use the database's functionality I get a compile error: Method or data member is not found.<br />
<br />
On surfing the web I learnt that this might be to do with a Microsoft upgrade and *.exd files needs to be deleted. This I have duly done but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice and help would be gratefully received.</p>

            The error message indicates that Something is missing. Have you tried to Compile the file (in VBE select Debug&gt;compile). This will search out and identify the lines of code causing the problem. Another possibility is a missing Reference. Have you checked for those?

            <p>In HD, it should come across, still somewhat fast and not in 24 hours time. &nbsp;That part will depend on what the download speed of your Internet connection but I think that the main problem in that is the Xbox Live Video servers. &nbsp;They could experience heavy
 traffic which bogs the site down. &nbsp;It doesn't happen all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do buy or rent a movie, it stays linked to your account. &nbsp;You can try to redo the download on another computer as long as you log into it with the same account. &nbsp;You have to wait a moment or two but it will show up in "My Movies" category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you buy or rent a movie and the download backfires or it will not stream across for some reason, not to worry, you can try again later. &nbsp;That is one of the reasons why rentals give you a day or two before they expire.</p>

                    &nbsp;I really think that the windows phone 8.1 OS is kind of limited, mictosoft should add &nbsp;features in a update such as third party launchers, third party lock screens, third party keyboards, third party app stores, adobe flash player, Google chrome, text
 message themes, ability to install APKS, and just not limit the OS SDK. I think windows phone users would like that. I would really like If you took consideration and make it happen and it will make people happy. And the update should apply to all of the windows
 phone 8.1 devices , and if you decide to put a windows 10 software for windows phone, you should implement those features too. Microsoft, make it happen.

            <p>Uh no offence, but you want Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flash Player for mobile devices is dead. Adobe stopped it in 2011.</p>
<p>Google doesn't want to make apps for Microsoft's platforms. There won't be a Google Chrome until Google changes this attitude.</p>
<p>As for third-party launchers and stuff... That's exactly what MIcrosoft built Windows Phone to avoid. It's built around a seamless, unified design, not a mish-mash of broken code that will just destabilize your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And install APKs? Yeah, those are Android apps. If you want to run those apps, you should get an Android phone. There's a lot of reasons why no one should try to run APKs, but the best one is that it kills native development of your platform. Just ask BlackBerry.
 In chasing Android compatiblity, all native development of BlackBerry apps has stopped. And what do you get? The half-done Amazon store, since lots of apps are built against Google Play Services, which aren't available anywhere else than Android.</p>

            <p>I am a normal windows phone user..I want to suggest few things.. which are pretty basic</p>
<ul>
<li>Add user album support i.e. users should be able to sort out photos &amp; put them in the album created by them ..not just standard available albums..</li><li>Improve native file manager ..users should be able to see pdfs, docs, you tube downloaded videos directly in mobile's native file manager..without the need to open them by gng into specific app</li><li>the action centre should show all the background downloading that is gng on..through&nbsp; windows app store &nbsp;or any other third party app</li><li>Multitasking should be made more "real"&nbsp;apps should get continued from where user had left them, clipboard text should not get wiped out when you turn back to to clipboard etc.</li><li>I don't want android apps I want an OS as polished and mature as&nbsp;Android..&amp; apps as powerful as&nbsp; android apps</li></ul>
<p>I don't know how much of concerns I mentioned&nbsp;above are already addressed in coming WP OS 10 . Please make me know. And if u cant do that by putting **** reasons like "</p>
built around a seamless, unified design, not a mish-mash of broken code that will just destabilize your phone." don't dream of competing with Android. Or accept that Microsoft doesn't have enough wisdom &amp; ability to build a good smartphone OS. An OS is not

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;I really think that the windows phone 8.1 OS is kind of limited, mictosoft should add &nbsp;features in a update such as third party launchers, third party lock screens, third party keyboards, third party app
 stores, adobe flash player, Google chrome, text message themes, ability to install APKS, and just not limit the OS SDK. I think windows phone users would like that. I would really like If you took consideration and make it happen and it will make people happy.
 And the update should apply to all of the windows phone 8.1 devices , and if you decide to put a windows 10 software for windows phone, you should implement those features too. Microsoft, make it happen.

Yes I would like to upgrade my phone to Windows 10

<h2>            Using Onenote 2016 &#40;app&#41; with 2 Office 365 Account, within a a private hotmail Account login</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am faceing a issue with Onenote 2016, the app who comes with Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First i need to tell you about my PC who is affecting the issue.</p>
<p>I am using a brand new Surface 2017, it is my private one, therefore it got`s installed for myself with my private (@hotmail) account</p>
<p>but because the Lenovo devices from our company are poor in performance, i intend to use my private Tablet for work too.</p>
<p>It is not domain joined or branded anyhow .</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company is providing two Office 365 Accounts (an old one and a new one on different tenant, they will migrate them to a later time)</p>
<p>and i have installed the Office 2016 Products who cames within the newer Account, put in the company credentials and everything seems to be working, except Onenote 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i Start Onenote 2016, it runs under the Context of my private Hotmail Account (without Office 365!, i can send screenshots if you like), everytime i try to change the logged in user (remember, in Onenote 2016) i can put in the new Mailadress, but the
 usually appearing "asking for password" Dialog Window is not appearing. Instead of this window i see just a little "flicker" in a shape of the Password window and then i am logged in as my hotmail user again... The log-in window i gave in my Mailadress some
 seconds ago is disappeared and there is no login at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Steps i made for Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled Office 2016 (from view of the correct, new Account)</p>
<p>Cleared local Credentials Store from all Passwords / credentials who are coresponding to the Situation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me an advice how i can use at least the new O365 Account on my private device.</p>
<p>I have to move some Onedrive Notebooks soon and therefore i need to get logged in as apropriate user as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much, best regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>

                    hey i decided to to factory reset my phone. i backed everything up onto my email before i did it. when i turned my phone on, i carried on with the normal procedure but i cant log in to my microsoft account to back up my settings and information. it keeps

<h2>            activate Office 2003</h2>
                    Recently my 32 bit machine with Windows XP on it crashed. I had to reload the OS and all the programs had to be re done. I re installed my copy of Office 2003 and that went fine. Now every time I start WORD it asks to activate the software. I enter the
 Code and press enter but nothing happens, because the ned time I start WORD it asks again. How can I re activate this software? Thanks

            Well....... I used one of my older computers and searched the web and found a MS activation site. They gave me a telephone number to call (888) 571-2048. Here an automated guy took my 25 character code and gave me the activation code to enter. I did so
 and now my Office 2003 is activated. He also said that these same numbers can be used in the future if needed. Thanks for all the help. I'm back up and running. Mike<br />

                    <p>why is this proces running when i dont use my pc for photo's anyway ???? this process started running at boot , using 16% cpu for over 15 minutes allready , cpu @ 4.02 GHz....</p>
<p>
</p><p>i find often that something is running which i have no use for.&nbsp; this so called automatic maintenance looks like it is doing alot of malware actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>running stuff or parts i dont use in an os. this costs me money for energy cost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>your windows OS seems to head more and more into obscurity whitout letting the pc owner know what the pc is doing, users have to guess as to what the **** is actually doing. making expensiv distributed calculations for microsoft ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is not new in windows 10 but has been happening for quite some time now. i would not be surprised if companys covertly use our pc hardware and energy for their profit.
</p>
<p>Thats' what i start to think when an&nbsp;OS does things without letting the user know what it is doing. And thinking about all the non savvy computer users not noticing anything this could make a company some real money at our expens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hate an OS that does everything to not let me know what or why it is doing. I AM SUPPOSED TO BE THE OWNER OF MY COMPUTER, NOT YOU MICROSOFT.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed Word 2016 and for misspelled words, the spellchecker is now popping up with 'definitions' below each suggested word. I would love to turn this off! Step-by-step on how to do this would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The spell checker in Word&nbsp; is an excellent tool to spot typographical mistakes. The suggested spelling option is set by default if you'll be using the spell checker. To personalize grammar and writing style in Word 2016, you can check this

<p>Thanks for your reply. I don't want to turn off the suggested spelling feature, I want to turn of the 'definitions'/thesaurus that appears below each suggested word (e.g., 'meanings, clarities, delineations' in the image in my original post) as I know what
 the words mean. I could not find anything in the article you referred me to that says how to do this. If someone could cut/paste the list of steps that would be most helpful.</p>

<p>What you are seeing is the so-called Editor feature, which is the new design&nbsp;for the right-click/context menu when right-clicking a spelling error&nbsp;in Word. As far as I know, you can't turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do is turn off the spellchecking as you write. Click to deselect "Check spelling as you type" at File&nbsp;| Options | Proofing. You will then have to run spellcheck manually, for example with F7.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t print from Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>My computer runs Windows 7 and is running Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>My problem is that my printer won't print anything from Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Everything else can print: Microsoft Word, Excel, and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>I even tried printing the Windows Test Print Page and it printed perfectly.</p>
<p>I have Google'd it. I have tried finding a Youtube video to help. Nothing.</p>
<p>I have tried everything. I have tried running as an administrator, I have tried time and time again. Nothing.</p>
<p>Help!!!!</p>

</p><p>I have same problem but **not with autocorrect** so that isn't the issue. </p>
<p>I customize my styles and use a dozen personal keyboard shortcuts--all lost.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend saving customizations that you want to save in one or more separate
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm#Global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Global Template</a> stored in Word's <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/startup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Startup Folder</a>. Keyboard shortcuts can be stored there but the template must be open for editing or attached to the current document to store the shortcut. This does not solve the problem but lessens the pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Styles can also be stored in document templates.</p>

<p>Are you trying to open Excel files in Adobe?&nbsp; If so you need to save the Excel files in a format the Adobe understands.</p>
<p>If on the other hand you are trying to open XLSX files in Excel 2003:</p>
<p>1. Save the file attachement to the desktop</p>
<p>2. Open Excel 2003 and choose File, Open.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Change the files of type to All Files and locate and open the xlsx file on your desktop.</p>
<p>If the converter is not installed, Excel will try to download it and then open your file.</p>

            <p>If the special characters are those found in ordinary Unicode fonts (accented letters, for example), you can save the word as an unformatted AutoCorrect entry; when you insert this, it will be inserted using the font at the insertion point. If, however,
 the word includes characters from more than one font or characters with special font formatting (italic, superscript, etc.), then it will have to be saved as a formatted AutoCorrect entry and may not match the font at the insertion point.</p>

<p>I am running on windows 10.&nbsp; After installing office, when i try to open any of the applications, i get an error message that says the application has stopped working.&nbsp; I have tried the online repair that has been suggested to people experiencing similar
 issues to me.&nbsp; I get the same message, that it has stopped working.&nbsp; I have uninstalled an reinstalled, I have done a complete update on my computer. I do not know where to go from here.

<h2>            CrawlScopeManager &#38; Gather - Registry Mechanic finds problems</h2>
                    Hi - I'm a new Windows 7 user, and have been experiencing alot of freezing on my pc lately.&nbsp; I run Registry Mechanic and seem to get most of the same messages over and over - even though Registry Mechanic says they're "repaired," restarting and running
 the Mechanic again finds the problems again.&nbsp; The issues have to do with WindowsSearch CrawlScopeManager Default Rules and Working Set Rules, and WindowsSearch/Gather/Windows/SystemIndex/Sites/LocalHost/Paths/7.&nbsp; How can I permanently fix these issues (Registry
 Mechanic says they're either "missing or invalid."&nbsp; thanks!

<h2>            Installing Technical preview prompted OneDrive to download everything again</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I noticed that after installing the preview, my OneDrive online content is being downloaded--apparently all of it. 36GB as of now and counting and it was likely a lot more before I noticed it. It must have lost 'sync' or something and so is downloading everything
 again. Hope this does not happen with future updates.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Did you upgrade or clean install Windows 10 Technical Preview?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>We checked this on one of Windows 10 Technical Preview computers, the files in OneDrive folder that shows as Online-only should not download on the computer unless you use it or try to open the file.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example if you have photo folder, change it to
<strong>details view</strong> by right clicking &gt; View &gt; details. <span>&nbsp;</span>The availability column will show
<strong>Online-only</strong>. When you click on any one picture the status changes to
<strong>Available Offline.</strong> This also happens to next picture in the folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to make all the files from OneDrive folder Online.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press and hold or right-click the file, and then choose Make available Online-Only. To make your entire OneDrive available online, press and hold or right-click OneDrive in the left pane, and then
 choose Make available Online-Only.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>I did an upgrade over Windows 8.1. Before the upgrade, all OneDrive folders were already off-line and the content was fully synced.&nbsp;This is what I want as this is a laptop with large storage. The OneDrive files weren't changed after the upgrade by me, it
 appears the OS upgrade just triggered everything to be downloaded again, which should not be the case.</p>

<p>This is a very common scam at the moment. It was not sent from your account. The scammer simply placed your address in the From field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing your password was a good thing to do, but there is nothing else you need to do with this message. Delete it and any similar messages you receive in the future.</p>

<br />
<br />Hi CourtneyEllis1
<br />
<br />This is a running scam that has been going on for several months. Have personally now rec'd more then a couple of hundred of these.
<br />
<br />You can safely ignore and delete the messages. The scammers have accessed your email address from a compromised database where you subscribed to something. In many of these cases, the messages include a password for your account which would be the password used when you subscribed to "whatever".
<br />
<br />What you need to do
<br />
<br />#1 - Make sure that you change your password anywhere that the one included i the email has been used
<br />#2 - Do not use the same password twice especially when involving things like credit/card, banking, PayPal, Amazon, Apple, Netflix sites etc etct
<br />#3 - Ignore any demand for payment
<br />
<br />You can check to see if your email address comes up on a compromised database by checking it on the following website (created by a Microsoft MVP so can definitely be trusted)
<br />
<br />';--have i been pwned?
<br /><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>
<br />
<br />*** while the spammer/hacker has gained access to your email address and the password that was used to sign up to the applicable website where the database has been breached, they would not get access to your email account unless it's using the same password as that shown in the email message. Also, you should not assume that the above website is a comprehensive list of every site that has been breached.

<p>Recently I replaced my N79 with a HTC Desire S and the first time I listened to music on the HTC it seemed OK.... but not really good. Playing with the equalizer settings didn't help, nor did the installation of the "PowerAmp" App..</p>
<p>I concluded that the music wasn't going to get any better on the HTC and&nbsp;since the iPod 4 of my wife does have a pretty satisfactory sound, I planned to get me one too.</p>
<p>Yet I remembered being extremely satisfied with the music quality of the N79, so I put the iPod and the N79 to the test.... I am not an audiophile so I don't qualify for a very thourough analyses. (Although I play FLAC over the home amplifier, on a mobile
 device I cannot hear the difference between FLAC and 320kb/s&nbsp;AAC) &nbsp;</p>
<p>To my own very big surprise, I found the N79 more engaging than the iPod 4... In fact I was flabbergasted: the iPod is supposed to be&nbsp;the newest dedicated&nbsp;top of the bill audio device, while my 3 years old N79 is essentially a phone which plays music...</p>
<p>Using my Grado headphones and playing the Canon of Pachelbel, both devices seemed to be equally detailed, however&nbsp;on the iPod the Cello's sound like an undefined base, while on the N79 they sound like... well... Cello's! The violins sound find on the iPod,
 but on the N79 they sound engaging! Some may consider the iPod sound more 'warm' and the N79 more 'clear'. To me the iPod sound is slightly more soft, even dull and the N79 sound slightly more open. I also tested with Duffy's 'Syrup and honey' and again, the
 iPod sounds fine, but the N79 sounds exiting!</p>
<p>Now my big problem is, that the N79 only supports 8GB of flash memory, while I have 21GB of AAC music... What's more, the navigation of the N79 music player isn't really competative....</p>
<p>So my question is, which Nokia sounds equal to the N79 (has the same D/A converter) and does support a lot of flash memory? The option of a more sophisticated player is also very welcome....</p>

            Well, as a friend of mine who uses HTC told me, HTC sucks at media (camera, music) compared to say, Nokia.<br />
<br />
The iPod never really equaled Nokia as well in terms of music quality. They have a louder device though. If you wanted something with great audio quality, you should have went Samsung or SE (if you wanted an Android).<br />
<br />
The cheapest Nokia phone I can think of with really good audio is the 5530, or the 5800 (5800 supports lyrics as well), and though I am not sure with 5530, the 5800 supports 32gb micro sd cards. It still is one of the best in terms of audio quality, as it was
 in fact the flagship Xpressmusic device during its time, the same time the N79 was released/available.

            I've given away a Samsung Omnia HD for the empty and thin sound, and when it comes to iPhone 3Gs I definitely know that my N95 sounds clearer than that. I am pretty confident my Nokia N8 outperforms them both.<br />
When it's down to components quality Nokia still rule the scene.

            Nokia has consistently been on top of their game in terms of sound quality and such. i think any current model with equal or better your n79 ie: n8, E7, and such. also when you finally decide to go with a nokia phone google it and read some reviews AAS
 is one good site to check out when looking for a new devices.

<p>Just so you know, in case you still have your n79: I have an n79 with a 16 GB card installed, and it seems to work without problems. I know, it's still not 21 GB. It's possible that a 32 GB card might work as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I'm a cellist by profession, so I know what you mean in terms of sound preference: You really have to listen for yourself and decide which unit reproduces the "right" sound.&nbsp; Perhaps different phone models have slightly different biases in terms of
 frequency range.</p>

<p>While some are self-explanatory, some could use more information. For example:</p>
<p>- In Groups.csv, when is "updated_at" triggered? Is that when someone posts a message? Likes a message? What triggers this?</p>
<p>- When I try to see how many messages were posted by our Yammer users, do I utilize the "sender_name" field in Messages.csv, or do I utilize "Participants" in Messages.csv, linking it with the "Name" in Users.csv?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the groups.csv, updated_at column means if there is some changes done by group administrator by changing the group name or image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the messages.csv if you want to see by which particular user posting has been done than kindly refer to the sender_name or sender email address column, because participants means the sender has send the private message to some other user or user has been

<p>2. Groups.csv- You will find the columns as (i) id, (ii) name, (iii) private, (iv)moderated, (v) api_url, (vi) created_by_id, (vii) created_by_type, (viii) created_at, (ix)updated_at, (x) deleted, (xi)external<br />
&nbsp;i. Id:- that is the group id for that group<br />
&nbsp;ii. Name:- This will indicate name of group<br />
&nbsp;iii. Private:- If the group is private than the value will be true under this column<br />
&nbsp;iv. Moderated :- If any changed done than value will be there <br />
&nbsp;v. Api_url:- This contains the URL which you can use in the API.<br />
&nbsp;vi. Created_by_id:- ID of the user will be mentioned who created the group, and in the users.csv we can find the same user who created the group<br />
&nbsp;vii. Create_at:- Time of the group creation<br />
&nbsp;viii. Deleted :- if the group is deleted then the value will be true and the group is active than value will be false.<br />
&nbsp;ix. External:- if the group is external then the value will be true and if the value is false than the group is false.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
3. Message.csv :- There will be all the messages with the message id and sender name and if its deleted then in deleted at column.
<br />
&nbsp;i. Id:- this is the message ID<br />
&nbsp;ii. Thread_id:- This column is relate to thread of a post<br />
&nbsp;iii. Group_name:- In this column group name will be shown in which group the message is posted&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;iv. In_private_group:- If the posted message group is private then value will be TRUE in this coulmn, for private group will be FALSE<br />

&nbsp;viii. Sender_email:- Email ID of the sender <br />
&nbsp;ix. Body:- This coulmn contains entire message which is posted<br />
&nbsp;x. Attachments:- If any file attached to the post then it will have file value<br />
&nbsp;xi. Deleted_by_id:- If the message is deleted then this coulmn will have ID of the deleted user<br />
&nbsp;xii. Created_at:- This shows creation time of the message<br />
&nbsp;xiii. Deleted_at:- If the message is deleted then it will show the time when its deleted</p>
<p>4. Network.csv:- List of all network with there ID will be mentioned in this file.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
5. Users.csv:- In this file all users email id and joined at date with the name, email address, suspended at, deleted at and deleted by with state of the users mentioned.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;• We can differentiate in users.csv by Filter with column “state” and select soft_delete. Uncheck the box of “active”. Applying this filter would give us only soft_delete users.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Filter “joined_at” column which contains only blank value.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Filter “deleted_at” column which contains only blank value.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ Filter “suspended_at” column which contains only blank value.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ By doing above steps we can differentiate the users are currently in deleted state if they have “deleted_at” time stamp.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ If the user with “suspended_at”&nbsp; than that user is suspended or in block state.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;○ If the user is having none of the states “deleted_at” and “suspended_at” then the user is in pending state.</p>

<p>Are you sure this (above) is correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my recent experience, I am finding that the "updated_at" column seems to get updated whenever someone just looks at the Group. Not necessarily when the group admin goes in, but anyone. Are you sure that isn't the case?</p>

</p>

    <title>Preview Link in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwwv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preview Link in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>First, I have a basic computer knowledge, but am not an expert in codes, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a small business.&nbsp; I use Hostinger to host my website and Zyro to build my website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Outlook 2013 in my Browser to send emails regarding my business. When I type in my business name, it creates a preview link, which I like.&nbsp; The problem is the Preview Link shows the wrong picture and the text, while accurate, isn't what I want for
 this link.&nbsp; I have changed the SEO settings in Zyro for each "page" or "tab" on my website, and it links properly using social media.&nbsp; However, when Outlook creates the Preview Link, it continues to bring up the wrong information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Micorsoft... they referred me to my web host.&nbsp; My web host says it has no idea what data Outlook uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how I can edit the Preview LInk to show the picture I want, as well as the text I want?&nbsp; I have been trying to resolve this for a few days and I'm out of options, other than to ask the experts here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>GREG</p>
