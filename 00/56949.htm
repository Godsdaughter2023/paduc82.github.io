<h2>            Screen brightness keeps dipping to very low &#40;around 20&#126;27&#37;&#41; own its own</h2>
                    <p>Screen brightness keeps dipping to very low (around 20~27%) own its own ever since I have upgraded to Windows 10. This is very irritating. Can anyone help in resolving the issue. Upgrade was done only after Microsoft did the checks on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Battery is charging to 100%, Cord is properly fixed, no lose connection, Sometimes the brightness increases also.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Katherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Depending on how low the battery is, you may see a battery icon on the screen for 10 to 15 minutes before Windows starts. To assist you better, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>What happens when you press the power button?</li><li>Your Surface could be in a power-saving state. Have you done any recent changes on your Surface?</li><li>Have you done any troubleshooting? If not, you might want to perform a two button shutdown.
<span>To do this, press and hold the <strong>Volume-up</strong> button and the
<strong>Power </strong>button on the Surface at the same time for 15 seconds and then release both of them. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but remember to continue holding down the buttons for 15 seconds.</span></li></ul>

                    <p>I can't log into my skype on my new phone because the text message for my secondary verification is not getting through</p>
<p>I think this is because the number has not got a "+" before the country code</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have mistakenly provided an incorrect security info <strong><em>(email address or phone number</em>)</strong> on your account, we cannot change it unless you have another security info where you can receive the verification code. Once you were able
 to access the account, you can modify, add or delete these security information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another, you can also recover your account by filling out the <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account recovery form</a> for verification purposes. If you failed to recover your account, our last option is to
<em>create new Skype account.</em></p>

<p>Hi Aljon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to access my skype and email account on a computer as I know my password. however, I cannot sign into my skype&nbsp;account on my phone because of the secondary verification step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise where I can change my security info now that I am logged in on a computer? I only see the option to change the password, which is NOT the problem.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>And I did try to apply a change to my phone number (but I've done this before and it wasn't changed) and it says that it takes a WHOLE month to do this. Does this mean I can't use Skype on my phone for a month?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the changes made on the security info, the <strong>30-day waiting period</strong> helps keep hackers from changing an accounts security info as a way to completely take over that account. This waiting period gives the real account owner enough time to
 be alerted of the change and to cancel it in case they didn't start it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for you to access your Skype account using the new mobile device, you can <strong>
turn the two-step verification off</strong> and then enable it again after the changes
<em>(modified number)</em> take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Does this mean I can't use Skype on my phone for a month?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>No, you can still access your Skype account to <strong>
all trusted devices </strong>like your computer. These devices have been set or added to your Microsoft account. Once you were able to verify your account using your new mobile device, it will be added to the trusted devices that you can use Skype on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to these steps on how disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to the <strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Security basics</span></a></strong> page, and sign in with your Microsoft account.</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>more security options</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Two-step verification</strong>, choose <strong>Set up two-step verification</strong> to turn it on, or choose
<strong>Turn off two-step verification</strong> to turn it off.</p>

<p>Hello Aljon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot turn off the<em>&nbsp;two-step verification</em> until the changes have come into effect. From what you have replied, I also
<strong>CANNOT</strong> use Skype on my new phone as I <strong>CANNOT </strong>turn off two-step verification, and I cannot receive the verification code so there is no way for me to be a trusted device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my email and the phone number it says that I have requested to change my 2nd step verification to
<strong>again</strong> does not have the "+" sign before the country code. When the change is finally made, I still won't be able to get the verification text messages so I this was all a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I tried to cancel the request for security update, however to confirm this cancellation, Microsoft wants to send me a code via text to the number without a plus sign before the country code (which obviously won't work) or call me (which
 also isn't working). I hope you can see how I am stuck in a loop because of this
<span>plus sign before the country code</span> issue and I need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a third option when i try to change or cancel security info, which is "I have a code", so can you please provide me a code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I am very frustrated that there is no solution and I think this is an issue that Microsoft needs to address how this loop keeps going and country codes disappear from phone numbers, rendering them useless</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have an option to manually generate a code and provide it to you. However, if you were able to update the security info, I suggest to wait till it has been fully updated then change it immediately.</p>

<p>Hi Karen</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I do NOT have option for using another number. There is only one verification number, and it does not work because Skype did not put a&nbsp;"+" sign before the country code so can't call or text me.</li><li>When I made a security update request, I did specify the country of my phone number. However, according to the email that I was was sent to me after I made the request,&nbsp;the number is missing the "+" sign before the country code according AGAIN.</li></ol>
<p>What is wrong with the system that it keeps forgetting the "+" sign?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I escalate this issue, because I feel like this is going in circles. I can keep trying to change my number, but Skype seems to be determined to keep getting this wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The easiest way is with a cross-over cable - a special wire to connect just two systems.<br />
You can get one at your local computer store - they are not expensive.</p>
<p>You can also setup an ad-hoc network which is similar to using the cable above in that it<br />
only connects the two machines directly however by&nbsp;wireless.</p>
<p>Do you already use a router?&nbsp; If so you can network through it.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 slideshow stops changing pictures after sleep</h2>
                    <p>After computer startup, the slideshow works fine, and changes the pictures every x minutes.&nbsp; However, when it wakes from sleep, the picture no longer changes -- the picture that was displayed when it was put to sleep now displays forever. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi msuth
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Is this happening on battery power or while plugged in?
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock screen &gt; Advanced slideshow settings
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Play a slideshow when using battery power' is toggled on
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type: powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Exit

<p>Thanks for the reply Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a desktop pc -- no battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try restoring default schemes, but the problem still occurs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovering from sleep seems to not recover the picture change interval.&nbsp; Sounds like a bug to me.&nbsp; Can anyone duplicate it?&nbsp; I have the same behavior on two different pc's.</p>

            I don't see it on either my Surface Pro or my HP Workstation. 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />If its a custom built computer, what is the make and model of the motherboard?

<p>Interesting...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's odd that I can reproduce it on 3 computers now, and your two both work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my process:</p>
<p>1:&nbsp; select a theme with several pictures</p>
<p>2:&nbsp; set the slide show for 1 minute intervals</p>
<p>3:&nbsp; observe that the pictures change after one minute</p>
<p>4:&nbsp; put the computer to sleep</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; wake up the computer</p>
<p>6:&nbsp; observe whether or when the picture changes</p>

            I noticed your installation is missing some cumulative updates. Could you check Windows Update and download the latest updates? You should be at 17763.348.
<br />
<br />I would also try the following:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.â€ 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to sign out, close Microsoft Store app and then open it again, sign in now. See if this resolves the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.<br />
<br />
2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.<br />
<br />
3. Then type following command and press Enter key:<br />
<br />
Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />
Let the command complete.<br />
<br />
4. Close Windows PowerShell.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps! </p>

</span><span><span>I purchased a&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Lenovo</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;N23
 N</span></span><span><span>etbook for my daughter and during the windows update I started to have problems I'</span></span><span><span>m</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;not
 exactly sure how to deal with.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>The main issue is that it
</span></span><span><span>comes with only 32GB SDD storage &amp; of that only 10.5GB is available so&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>its
 update is running out of storage space before the updates can be</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>download
 or installed, given my situation.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>To compound the issue my modem crashes during&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>heavy
 traffic which is&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>causing</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;the
 update to fail then restart which appears to be leaving huge</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>files
 behind, at one point it&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>was down to 1.5GB of available space and the update could not continue.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><span>After
 some research I found I could remove the downloaded files which did work and released the</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>10.5GB&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>but
 now this has happened</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>second
 time Its doesn’t&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>seem to be getting anywhere.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>Any ideas w</span></span><span><span>hat
 can I do?&nbsp; Should windows 10 Professional be taking up 20GB</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>or
 is there something I am overlooking, trying a different more stable internet connection is all I can think of perhaps if it can di on the first shot it might work... I have done dozens of updates and never seen an issue like this.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>I did install an additional 32G SDHC card thinking that might help,</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;but
 windows&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>do</span></span><span><span>n’t</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;have
 the option to use alternative&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>storage for updates, I can use it with Apps and videos I download but it appears updates go to
 the system drive leaving me in this situation.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

            Hi Akamolik.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Akamolik, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question every day here on Community . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>
</p><p>Yes.&nbsp; There is a designed feature.&nbsp; A prompt which requests that you provide more space by allowing an external drive to be attached and used for temporary storage. &nbsp; I'm not sure what qualifies as "an external drive" but I would try a 32 GB Flash drive
 for a start.</p>

</p><p>yeah I thought the same thing, I have both a 32GB SDHC card plus I have a 500GB external USB Hard Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that windows has a specified folder named "Software Distribution" that it downloads updates &amp; keeps a log of in, there is no apparent way to change the target path that I can see, perhaps somewhere in the registry but that's a dangerous game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could try changing the "APPS" directive in storage option but I'm pretty confident that windows does NOT consider updates as APPS, it might be worth a shot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record I never tried the 500GB external yet, I did add the 32GB SD card but windows just sees it as portable storage so I didn't think it would make any difference..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the media creation tool but it crashed while creating... go figure! I posted a separate question about that to make that question less confusing, if you think you can help read my other post
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/need-help-media-creation-tool-failed-part-2/8a57b96c-a079-4e0b-9733-c56894079724" title="Click here to see additional post">
[here]</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I shut down updates in gpedit since we cant even turn it on without it trying to update &amp; she wants to play with it understandably</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I can find a solution before it gets really far behind right now its sitting at 1703</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>That was my original thought when I first formatted the SD card that Windows would share the extended storage space but even when empty it treated the card as just external storage with no hint of offering it for system resources/files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a programmer I can understand why since its declared as "removable", if windows did use it for system files and it were removed that's asking for problems, imagine Windows storing the registry on the SD then I pull it out and boot the system!, I'm willing
 to bet windows would have a stroke!<br />
<br />
Android 7+ has the option of mounting storage as "extended" saves the data in a different format that traditional FAT32 &amp; I know with XP Professional in order to save EFS files on a flash drive it needed to be formatted as NTFS, I wonder if I format the card
 using NTFS (and leave it there) if windows would see it as a compatible drive to extend primary storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have disabled the update services until I can get it done right... I was hopeful with the creation tool but when it crashed I was really left with few options, one thing I did notices that with those services off it runs noticeably faster
 and is more responsive!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that Microsoft offer to download individual smaller updates... what ever happened to redistribution files? If I could download a service pack and manually update Im betting it would solve my issues!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>Sorry but it's the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">prompt for more storage</span> that I was trying to understand better and it's not clear you even see the prompt let alone if WU would mention that SD card space as one of the potential sources that
 you could try to give it.&nbsp; Otherwise, do you have a reasonably large sized USB "flash" stick that you could keep attached?&nbsp; I think it will have to be storage that is attached, e.g. I found that it was not enough just to have a .vhdx mounted (even though that
 could give it a new letter); it ignored that and I didn't know how to attach another drive to my VM "on the fly". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned first having not enough space to do the download but the feature sounds like it addresses that case by</p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p><span><strong>Before downloading the update</strong>, Windows runs a scan to make sure there’s enough space. If there isn’t, you’ll see a message asking you to free up some.<br />
</span>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe you wouldn't be seeing the prompt if you had so much storage that WU thought it had enough to try to squeak by?&nbsp; Then in that case, instead of clearing things out perhaps you would need to be adding stuff to make such a decision impossible
 for it to make and thus force it to give you the prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I wanted to avoid you trying to use your 500 GB USB drive in case it doesn't pay any attention to existing partitions but I suppose you could make sure that a piece of that was available for the prompt to see, just don't choose it until we
 have a better idea of what it would try to do with it--unless you have it already sufficiently backed up that it wouldn't matter what happened to it.</span></p>

<h3> koppite412  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email sent from Windows 10 Mail shows senders email address, not name, in recipient &#39;From&#39; column</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just tried to start using Windows 10 Mail and set up a new account exactly as it is on my very old Outlook 2003 client. &nbsp;It works in that emails are sent and received. &nbsp;I have also set the email settings so that the 'Send messages using this name' is
 correct as my name, not my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, whenever I send a message, either to say Outlook (cloud) or another email address on the old Outlook 2003 client, the 'From' is now showing the email address it's sent from instead of the name of the person sending it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I switch back to the old Outlook 2003 client and do the same emails ( to Outlook cloud and to another account on Outlook 2003), the name of the sender is correctly displayed in the recipient 'From' column and not the email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any ideas on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
</p>

    <title>Surface Laptop USB not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Laptop USB not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface laptop with an obnoxious USB issue.&nbsp; the xHCI controller in device manager is Code 10 (Cannot Start)<br />
<br />
This persists through restoring the unit via a freshly downloaded ISO file using the official Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; I can only restore from within Windows as I have to mount an ISO rather than using the non working USB.&nbsp; I know the port itself physically works.&nbsp;
 I can boot from the Windows 10 Installation USB just fine, but when I try to start the install it says that it can't find the USB stick (even though it JUST booted from it 2 seconds before.)&nbsp; I have tried multiple USB drives, all known working (I have installed
 using them on 10+ PC's).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the official Microsoft recovery USB image for my device as well.&nbsp; It appears to work initially, but then after selecting my language etc. it eventually kicks me back to the standard Win10 recovery menu (the same one as if I had held shift while
 restarting.)&nbsp; Using the "restore from recovery image" option results in an error about files not found 0x80070002 or something like that.&nbsp; I don't know what else to do&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My Prediction for Xbox One Marketing 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ma8688  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Prediction for Xbox One Marketing 2013</h2>
                    
<p>I just want something on record. Please note the keyword here: <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Prediction"</span></strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox was launched in November 2001. Microsoft strategy was to take over the living room environment. They wanted a gaming console to put their foot into the market.
</li><li>Xbox Live (XBL) was launched in November 2002. Microsoft strategy to introduce online services for gaming proved to be a incredibly key feature and success story.
</li><li>Xbox 360 was launched in November 2005. It was a far more successful console than its predecessor&nbsp; and thanks to XBL, started a incredibly robust digital environment for digital consumption (games, dlcs, movies, tv shows and music) within the video gaming
 industry. </li><li>Kinect was launched in November 2010 as a peripheral addition to the Xbox platform. It became one of the fastest selling peripheral of all time with its promise of motion gaming and interaction.
</li><li>XBL during 2005-2013 evolved into a distribution platform in its own right. <strong>
This is ultimately what Microsoft is selling now. And it's no longer just for the gamers. They're looking at the key tech demographic of 18-35 enthusiast. These are the same people who are purchasing content on iTunes, paying for a brand new smartphone with
 apps, subscribing to Netflix-like services and tied into a variety of ecosystems developed by Apple and Google. The average gamer is also between the age of 18-35. The average gamer also falls into these particular categories. The Xbox One also happens to
 provide video games.</strong> </li></ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>Chronology:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>May/June/July 2013</strong>. The product announcement and E3 focuses was to gauge the general opinion of the ardent tech community and specifically the traditional gaming crowd. As demonstrated in past upheavals (see Diablo 3 and Sim City), huge
 surges of negativity concerning DRM practices quietens down over the course of a few months. But they're never forgotten. It's also prudent not to fully announce any specific details in regards to plans not yet finalized. There's plenty of work to get publishers
 and retailers on board with a new business model.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft will simply take the flak from the very vocal gaming community until a time where it is perceived that emotions are no longer running high.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Nearer the release of the console, around <strong>August &amp; September 2013</strong>, Microsoft will begin finalizing some details of business models. They will trickle specifics down through tech media outlets (Engadget, The Verge etc.) and internet gaming
 sites. Most importantly, they'll be sharing these information to specific gaming YouTube channels. The key component messages will be relating wholly to the gaming aspect of the machine in regards to the industry. A concrete launch list would also be expected
 around this time or by the end of October.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It's also possible that we will see heavy Q&amp;A sessions and much more details about compelling arguments for their digital philosophy in regards to ownership rights and management of purchases (e.g. the Circle of 10, sharing/lending, renting and selling -
 things no other company has done in regards to digital content). Gamers will be able to decide with a lot more information at hand if they'd want to buy into this new philosophy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the message of a "All in One" box must be established into a gamer's mind in order to understand this philosophy. Arguments like: "A video game console should be a video game console." should be equated to "A phone should just be a phone." Fine
 arguments and a right of any consumer to buy what they <em>want</em>. However, Microsoft will market the Xbox One as more than a video game console. Just like Samsung Galaxy S4 is more than just a phone.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>October - December 2013</strong>. Microsoft's Xbox One marketing strategy will heavily target the core demographic of tech enthusiast. Most, if not all their advertisement for the Xbox One, will feature the non-gaming related functionality of the
 system: Kinect 2.0, Skype &amp; Sports will play a heavy part in these advertisement.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Xbox One advertisement will just be about the system itself. Launch games adverts will just be about the launch games with targeted unique selling messages (e.g. Forza adverts will openly express the capability of Microsoft's Cloud computing in regards to
 player-like AI behaviour and learning).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The mentality attempted to be establish from these marketing campaigns: a video game console like the PS4 is a console for the teenage brat screaming at their parents to buy them a new toy. A multimedia box like the Xbox One is specifically designed for
 your 18-35 year old tech users of iTunes &amp; Netflix.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>However, that market of parents buying expensive toys for their children is incredibly lucrative and Microsoft certainly wouldn't want to miss out on that. Regardless of whether or not the 14 yea old wants the Xbox One, why would a parent pay $100 for essentially
 the same toy? So Microsoft will switch the actual target: The parents.</p>
<p>Marriage of Parental Locks capabilities with Kinect 2.0 technology as a viral advert on YouTube and social media. Example YouTube ad video: Kid is playing a videogame. Mom walks in and tells the kids to do his homework. Kid says, "No". Mom says "Xbox, off!"
 Xbox One requires the Mom to unlock console with a passcode or facial recognition - this feature only available to the Xbox One because of the Kinect being able to recognise the mom's face and having parental lock authority which is very easy to set up once
 you buy the console. Distribute links of this viral ad to parent social networks and general/traditional media outlets that household mums may watch on TV who will pick up on this new feature like a forest fire. Microsoft won't have to waste much money on
 this feature and its advertisement but still makes an incredibly compelling argument for parents to spend that $100 more for Kinect 2.0.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the new shiny is: Kinect 2.0. Not as a gaming feature but a user interface method in the same way of touch screen was for phones. Another simple advert for the masses: flicking through YouTube with your hands whilst lying down on your couch,
 telling it to pause/play/share specific media content. Add to this Smartglass (second screen experience) and exclusive movie/tv/music content for your tech enthusiast, Microsoft will have a very compelling argument to lock their systems into the always connected
 and digital world with the capacity to still own content and share/sell said content albeit in a limited capacity.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Xbox One</strong></p>
<p><strong>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>If Microsoft is successful, the next system they'll bring about won't be important. What's really important is XBL. Their marketing will be concentrated only on that: They are giving you a all in one
<em>service</em>. The box is just a transportation medium with compelling technology to assist in said service. It may also mean a completely change of digital ownership across many different industries. You may be able to share/trade you iTunes library or
 your apps on your phone.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I will not be purchasing a Xbox One at launch. Reason: No real compelling launch games for me to warrant the purchase. This may change in the future when we have a bigger and better and more secure list. This is also the exact same reason why
 I'm not buying the PS4 at launch, either. I highly suspect I'll still be gaming on my PC, 360 and PS3 come Jan 2014. But I'd love to be pleasantly surprised. As a gamer, I want to play games. I'll base my purchasing decisions on either consoles on that sole
 basis: games.</p>
