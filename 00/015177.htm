                    Got new MacBook retina display, running 10.8.2&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;the Office files "migrated" to the new machine, there was no installation "on top of " another install.
<div>14.2.3 installed fine</div>
<div>at least 10 tries following advice on the forum and no success with 10.4.2 &nbsp;on the new MacBook Pro, the old one, MacBook Pro, mid-2009, installed same update ok<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I changed name of Automator file as suggested which has &nbsp;has not worked,</div>
<div>Office icons are different and&nbsp;</div>
<div>Version indicated is 14.2.4 but it says the one Installed is 14.2.3</div>
<div>the Mac itself hangs on occasion and must use force quit to shut down </div>

            Hey&nbsp;annv840,
<div><br />
<div>I've just sent you a private message to gather some logs from you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if you're in need of a quick solution and renaming the Automator folder didn't resolve the issue for you, the quickest solution I can recommend is to reinstall Office 2011. The links below explain how to properly uninstall Office 2011:</div>

<h2>            Attaching tables from Azure SQL database to Access 2013 with vba Error 3170 Could not find installable ISAM</h2>
                    <p>I have the following code to attempt to attach Azure SQL tables to Access front end.&nbsp; I get the "Could not find installable ISAM error".&nbsp; I have researched extensively and can't find what I'm doing wrong.&nbsp; This code works perfectly with an older Access database
 2010 I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose for me trying to link my tables directly and bypassing the DSN file is to try and increase the speed.&nbsp; The database currently doesn't have that much data but one form takes nearly 2 minutes to open now.&nbsp; The form was based on a 'one table' query
 with criteria on one field only.&nbsp; In SQL we wrote several views to reduce the output in size but this has not made any difference to the speed.&nbsp; I am now setting the recordsource of the form with code on the OnLoad event.&nbsp; Once I've analysed which 'view' I
 need I'm then assigning that view to the recordsource.&nbsp; Still no improvement in speed.&nbsp; So now I'm trying to attach tables directly rather than through ODBC.&nbsp; Any other suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the connection string is OK - it works in passthrough queries.&nbsp; but I'm wondering about the ODBC Driver 13 for Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to admit that this is beyond my ability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the references I have active:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the code I'm using:</p>

<p><span>Probably because you do not have Option Explicit at the top of EVERY code module (in addition to Option Compare Database). Do it right now, and also set it to be the default for new modules in Code window &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Require variable

<p>I agree, and that is not the normal performance of an Azure database, regardless of how bad the database design may be.</p>
<p>First question: has the issue "Could not find installable ISAM" evaporated? It's in your subject line so I thought I would ask. The subject line does not say anything about slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming slow is your issue, then we can ask some follow-up questions:</p>
<p>1. When issuing the same query in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), do we see the same performance?</p>
<p>2. Do other users around you see the same performance?</p>
<p>3. Do you see the same performance at another location (e.g. at home)?</p>

<p>Option Explicit is there.&nbsp; That's why the code wouldn't run.&nbsp; I think the person who sent me this code probably had the gDbapp set as a global variable.</p>

<p>Firstly the ISAM error has not evaporated but I have been trialing two lots of code.&nbsp; I couldn't get the code to work that was giving the ISAM error.&nbsp; This is the code in the original message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a colleague found this other code (without the database declared) that I did manage to get running once I had declared the database.&nbsp; The code ran without error but I'm not sure if I should notice anything different in the tables.&nbsp; When I hover on a table
 the string text displayed is the same before running the code as it is after running the code.&nbsp; So the only difference is that running this code is bypassing using a DSN file.&nbsp; I was told this would help with the speed.&nbsp; Hasn't made any difference.&nbsp; This is
 the code in my second message but with the addition of the database declared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one form that is causing this delay.&nbsp; Originally it was based on a one table query with criteria set on an ID field that equals a number between 1 and 7.&nbsp; The number is identified when the user logs in - the number relates to a programme.&nbsp; There are
 7 programmes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try and get around the delay, I created a pass-through query as a test and the result is instant.&nbsp; As I can't base my data entry form on a pass-through query my colleague created 7 views in SQL (1 for each programme) so now I have removed the RecordSource
 from the form and am assigning the appropriate view as the RecordSource in the OnOpen event.&nbsp; This works but the speed has not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each user is experiencing the same delay, as am I at home.&nbsp; The problem is definitely in the way Access is talking to the SQL.&nbsp; Running queries in SQL returns an instant result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was then advised to bypass using a DSN and connect directly to the SQL.&nbsp; Thus the code above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least four of the reports are also slow but I have set up pass-through queries for those today and that has solved that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been researching this online for nearly 2 weeks and have tried all manner of things.&nbsp; My knowledge in Access is passable but I have very little knowledge in SQL.&nbsp; I'm working with a colleague who has reasonable SQL knowledge but no Access knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have experimented with using Stored Procedures and using a parameter to pass the variable 1-7 ID # through to the stored procedure but again, the form needs to be updateable so a stored procedure won't work with a data entry form.&nbsp; The Stored Procedures
 may work with the reports but it bombed out on the final step of assigning the RecordSource, being a recordset.&nbsp; This is an aside and I don't want to focus on this as using thepass-through queries has solved this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time we have used an Azure SQL backend and we are on the verge on returning to an Access backend.&nbsp; But we have a couple of web portals which pull information through from the SQL database which we will have to do away with if we can't get
 this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth adding that if I open any of the linked tables directly and use the find button to find a value (other than primary key value) the same delay is experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Azure SQL is set to Standard (S3) with 100 DTU's for a single database.&nbsp; We've increased the DTU's several times thinking this may be the issue but has made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance you may be able to offer.</p>

<p>OK, good to know you have already covered some of the level-1 debugging scenarios. So far I don't see any obvious mistakes in your approach.</p>
<p>Since your original premise is so unusual (42 records in 2 minutes), maybe it's time to hire an outside consultant to delve deeper into this. As I said before, this is not normal. You can probably TYPE 42 records in less time than querying them.</p>

</p><p>This is not the forum to discuss commercial engagements, but people typically find the professional assistance they need when they are ready to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I considered suggesting to you to open a trouble ticket with MSFT, and although this remains an option, I am not too optimistic it will result in the solution you're looking for, because of the inter-disciplinary nature of your problem. I am convinced it
 requires a seasoned developer to get to the bottom of this. Your #1 interview question would be: "given an Azure BE, and observing PT queries are fast while local queries are slow by 2-3 orders of magnitude, what are the first things you will look into?"</p>

<p>Well we did actually seek professional assistance and paid for the advise to create views and link tables directly by bypassing the DSN.&nbsp; Both of which haven't helped.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure where to go next. I'm based in New Zealand but I'm sure this could be done remotely but would want to guarantee that the person taking it on knew what they were talking about.&nbsp; Everyone approached here just asks why do we want to continue
 with Access as the front end and is not interested in finding the solution that I believe must be out there.&nbsp; Other organisations are using Azure successfully surely.</p>

<p>Another point, once the form has opened (which takes 3 minutes 19 seconds - I timed it after I had written 2 minutes initially) as long as it remains opened it can be used all day without experiencing further delays.&nbsp; I was originally getting the users to
 open the form through a switchboard and close it to return to the switchboard.&nbsp; I've now given them Tabbed Windows with the instruction to leave this offending form open but I'm skeptical as to whether they will do this and also there's a strong possibility
 that they will end up with lots of forms open.&nbsp; This form was taking 45 seconds to load when I first started looking into the speed of it.&nbsp; As data is being entered so it is taking longer to load.</p>
<p>The form itself has quite a few controls that run query's to return data, but they seem to run ok once the initial delay has been experienced.&nbsp; When the form opens does it look at all the queries in the combo boxes within the form when it loads?&nbsp; Would I
 be advised to change each of them?&nbsp; I assumed not, as the delay occurs before we get to touch them.</p>
<p>It is just this form that is causing an issue (at the moment) so it has to be something within this one form.</p>
<p>The 42 records is the dynaset, the table has about 300 records.</p>

<p>Yes this can be done remotely. Being in NZ brings interesting complexities because you are not in a US-based data center but in ??? in the Southern hemisphere, most likely. The consultant would be wise to use your account, and your data center. "It works
 fine in US-West" does not help you, although that is one of the things I would verify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have modest expectations in terms of success: although the current performance is abysmal, the chance this is an Access issue we can control programmatically is somewhat slim, in my estimation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I think we no longer have an Access MVP in NZ. Have you been in touch with former MVP

<p>

<br />
If you have not closed the document, Ctrl-Z should step you back through. If you click and hold on the UnDo button you can back up.<br />
<br />
Saved means you put a current copy on the disk. Closed means that the document had to be reopened for you to edit it.<br />

    <title>N80 battery life&#43; charging probs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chriso---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N80 battery life&#43; charging probs</h2>
                    I've had my N80 for a week. In that time I've made 120 minutes worth of calls in total. I've used the camera a little, not a huge amount as I have a separate digital camera. But I've had to recharge the battery almost every day!<br />
<br />
I'm not getting nearly the published 3 hrs talk time and no where close to the 8 days standby time! What's going on? Have I got a faulty battery? I've had various "latest" Nokia phones up to now and none of them have been this bad!<br />
<br />
By the way... switching to the small charging jack.. what a pain in the neck! The supplied charging adapter only seems to work with a small selection of chargers.. it wont work with either of the 2 car chargers I have. Why change a system that worked so well?

            Welcome to our world. You need to put yourself into an early 90s mindset: if it's at all likely you're going to be away from a charger for more than 12 hours, plan on buying a spare battery.<br />
<br />
Re the 8 days, it must be something to do with much shorter days up there in Finland.

            Hi Chriso,<br />
<br />
There should be a pin adapter supplied. So as long as your car charger is listed among the supported ones, just plug in the pin adapter between your charger and mobile, and it should do the trick.<br />
<br />
For the short batt life, you're not alone. I'm currently working with Nokia AP and will post as I progress. You may want to notify Nokia on the short life. The higher the volume, the easier this issue will get through to them.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Cheers. ^_^;

<h2>            Changing Skype Name</h2>
                    When I went to create a Skype account, I entered in my phone number and name and it created an account. I didn't have an opportunity to enter a Skype name or a password, and it won't provide me with a chance to now. It gave me a random Skype username.
 How can I change this? If I try to set up a new account, how can I make sure I have a chance to choose my Skype name.

<h2>            Bing Rewards account closed with no explanation</h2>
                    <p><span>Your Bing Rewards account has been closed because it doesn't conform to the
<a href="https://www.bing.com/rewards/tou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bing Rewards Terms of Use</a>, which you accepted when joining.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told that in order to contest this decision to contact support, which i clicked on the link and was given a 404 error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how will I know what I did wrong without any explanation or option to contact you besides through a forum? I have seen this post many times on your forum and would rather talk through other methods, but don't see any way besides using this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks, <br />
Frank</p>

            <p>I had a similar question and was informed, but yet, they gave me a very vague answer saying that my account could have been closed for 6 very different reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that's unfortunate truly.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of microsoft products, but will be avoiding this branch of the corporation due to the very generic replies one has specially when one is banned from an account..

            <p>Very vague because you did nothing wrong. seriously, how can so many members suddenly start violating the terms at the exact same time? &nbsp;Yet never once cna Bing Rewards specify precisely what we did wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they truly reviewed our accounts, and if we truly did violate the terms (of &nbsp;course we did not), then they'd happily tell us what we did wrong. Not just say they stand by their decision. &nbsp;The truth is, they're just kicking active users out. First our
 points earned get halved, now this. &nbsp;Shame on us for cashing out and costing them money. We're supposed to enter contests only.</p>

</p><p>It's all intentional. They'll always say the same thing. We violated their terms. How? They cannot say. But they know we totally did, honest. &nbsp;Think about it. How is it all of us are just suddenly violating their terms, at the same time? What plausible explanation
 is there for a terms violation en mass? Must be some conspiracy to make all of us users suddenly decide to risk losing our accounts to violate their terms. &nbsp;Oh how fortunate Microsoft managed to catch each and every one of us violators. &nbsp;Praise the Almighty

            <p>Thanks for the reply (again) but really, all I asked for was an answer, and I was told that they were standing by it, not answering the original question. This showed a lack of understanding as a consumer what I wanted to know from a standpoint without having
 to shove legal matters down their throat to find out.&nbsp; I am not that interested in carrying this account especially having to go through all that trouble.&nbsp; If my own money was involved, I would have pushed.

<p>
</p><p>Don't worry, I won't continue this argument here, and I do like my other Microsoft products very much (Using a Surface Pro 3 to type this)&nbsp; but like subsidiaries, Bing is separated and will be treated as such.</p>

            <p>Of course they won't provide a reason. There is none. &nbsp;There can't be. How can so many of us, around the same exact time, all suddenly start violating their Terms of Use? &nbsp;It's a pattern with them. &nbsp;First they cut your points. Then they kick you out. Shame
 on us for using Bing Rewards. Shame on us for using Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there really was a problem, Microsoft would happily explain why. The fact they flat out refuse to give a reason shows there is no reason. &nbsp;It's how they get away with this stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disputed. Haven't heard back since. &nbsp;2 months already (Just tried again. Can't even submittt. keep getting an error message: Oops, we’ve encountered a temporary technical problem. We’re working on resolving this right away but in the meantime, please try
 again! Big surprise. I've been blocked from even trying again). If such a thing actually happened (and I doubt it. Just a Microsoft plant), rest assured, Microsoft made an exception to feign a willingness to work with us. Most won't win. They can't. Microsoft
 wouldn't be kicking people out of the program for no reason if they could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said before. we are continually punished for using Bing (by the very people who allegedly want us to use Bing.) &nbsp;As such, I shall abide by their wishes and not use Bing. &nbsp;As well as encourage others to avoid Bing at all costs. &nbsp;It's what Microsoft
 wants, after all. &nbsp;Best to let them have their non-Bing use desires fulfilled.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920, screen rotation not working, loosen object within, burning hot, screen getting scratched from normal use and many software issues....</h2>
                    
<p>I have pre-ordered the lovely yellow 920 from Telstra Australia, in November, arrived around start of December. It is a fantastic phone to use, however there are several hardware and software issues influencing this experience in a bad way. Anyone have the
 same experiences with the folloing issues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, I have noticed only in just a few days of using it, the screen can get obvious scratches very easily from normal use without screen protector film. Now, there is a &nbsp;pattern of many scratches from swipe up to unlock gesture. I though it would be
 as least do better than iphones</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, I have noticed what feels like a chunk of loose object inside the phone, as I shake it quickly left and right, which could even be heard, as two hard object in contact with each other. I have no Idea what could that be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, the screen rotation simply stopped working one day without notice. Tried soft reset a dozen times and even hard reset to factory status did not fix the issue. This get me thinking, it might have been a serious hardware issue, or perhaps the accelorometer/gyroscope
 was damaged by that loose object inside the phone. However, today, all of a sudden it starts to work again.........Brilliant!.......not...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue is that it could get Literally Burning Hot on the top right corner(front) of the phone in some circumstances. I understand electronic devices can get warm while operating, my Nokia N8 gets warm during intense operation such as multi-tasking
 Map, Drive etc, But it never gets to a point when you have to consider whether it is still safe to use or not, sadly, I have to do that with my 920 while video chatting,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are even more issue with the software. A few random mornings in the past month, I wake up to a dead 920 on a wireless charging pad, only to be able to recover through soft reset procedure (Volum down + power). &nbsp;No idea why....</p>
<p>and sometimes as I accept an incoming call, the phone freezes on that screen. The call still goes through, three buttons are still alight and vibrates, but not functional. Again, only recoveralbe by soft reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Does anyone have the same experiences with these issues?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what might caused these issues, to have all these occuring within a flagship smartphone, Me as a loyal Nokia fan (3210,6600,6220,3220,6300,N95,N8) is very disappointed.</p>

            Mine stopped rotation yesterday. Going to take it to an authorized service early Monday. I've had a black matte Lumia 920 since July 1, 2013 and literally love the phone. I Carrie it In a specialized silicon case and I only dropped it twice from 1 foot
 high on a carpet.<br />
it just stopped rotating for no apparent reason. Soft reset and factory reset didn't solve anything.<br />
<br />
very disappointed.<br />
<br />
also the accelerometer doesn't show signs of life

<p><span>Does anyone have the same experiences with these issues?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what might caused these issues, to have all these occuring within a flagship smartphone, Me as a loyal Nokia fan (3210,6600,6220,3220,6300,N95,N8) is very disappointed.</p>

This would probably best be provided as a suggestion to the UserVoice forum for Windows Phone 7.&nbsp; We here are just phone users helping each other and don't have any knowledge/input to MS' future plans or directions.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Access Hotmail - Login Caught in Loop&#63;  Interface Issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Beginning about 12 noon EDT on 7-4-2019, I stopped being able to access Hotmail.&nbsp; Running updated Win 7, Chrome, MS Office, Outlook Web Application (OWA) on a laptop (i7).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After entering my login and password on hotmail.com, the next screen loops back to my login, which does not allow any text re-entry.&nbsp; Nothing happens when I click on the password after trying to re-enter text in the login (but it doesn't take an).&nbsp; This
 has never happened before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do you suggest I start to try to fix this problem??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did MS update its Outlook interface to the web?&nbsp; &nbsp;This wrecking my life.</p>

<br />Did you try using a different browser or a private browser session?  If it works, the problem is with your browser cache.

<p>Alleluia!!&nbsp; I thought that I would pursue the issue as a problem with the browser, which I really don't want to change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I clicked on the three dots on the upper right-hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; Then selected Settings, then went to the bottom of the screen and selected Advanced.&nbsp; Then, again went to the bottom of the screen and clicked on "Restore settings to their original
 defaults."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have thousands of emails and my computer is slow anyway so it took 52 minutes.&nbsp; Then I closed the browser.&nbsp; Opened a new browser window and typed in hotmail.com which changes to :https://outlook.live/mail/inbox.&nbsp; My hotmail displayed on the screen!!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, am trying to see what was deleted (e.g., extensions) and what was changed.&nbsp; Have to google that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<br />Not exactly sure what you mean, but if you are using Gmail account ( or any other account ) in Outlook app or Office Outlook you will always authorize with the same credentials - for the specific account.
<br />
<br />If you are looking for something else, please provide more detailed explanation of you question.

<p>I have had it for 2 weeks and the right hand side of the case is&nbsp;squeaking&nbsp;and physically moving. The left side/ other parts are completely solid. This also happens when touching the bottom right hand part of screen. It is as though the case has not been
 fitted properly on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is there anything i can do to fix it?</p>
<p>Or, should i return under the 30 days policy?&nbsp;</p>

 the next one will bring&nbsp;

            Would never have expected that from an n97. I hate creaky phones, or anything that&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;fell solid. Gotta remove my data, does anybody know an easy way to wipe the phone data or reset it?&nbsp;

<p>the last option will wipe it all off just remove your memory card read carefully you will do it with the phone turned off&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With all these operations I recommend you <strong>
<em>TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD</em></strong> and <em><strong>DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the code does not work.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">1</font>.</span></strong>.<font color="#0000FF"><strong><span>
</span><span>*#7780#</span></strong></font> - <strong>
Restore factory settings</strong> - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for ALL operations listed here
 is <strong><font color="#FF0000">12345</font><font color="#993300">.</font></strong><span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><font color="#0000FF"><span><font color="#800080">2</font>.*#7370#
</span></font></strong>-<strong> Reformat </strong>your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer nokia phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea
 to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the
 default code is <font color="#FF0000"><strong>12345</strong></font>)</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your&nbsp;in-depth&nbsp;advice, gotta call up virgin now later today and see what happens. If it happens again. i guess that it is just the phone and should just live with it.</p>

<p>Spending all that money on a n97 should ensure that it built solid.&nbsp;</p>

            too bad...mine has the exact same "problem" which I didn't notice until I read your text...when I gently press the plastic which you call "display" on the right lower edge I can feel it sinks a bit but it's not just the "display"...it's the whole case
 in that area. The "display" itself is not loose...it's strongly glued to the "case". In fact the left side also has the same problem but to a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't know what I will I do about it or if I even do a anything at all. I have the phone for almost one week now and I could return it but I'm not sure if the "other" phone will be any better regarding quality :). I mean, it's not a bug or something
 else...it's just the phone you get for approx. 200 EUR. I have a blackberry curve 8310 at work which is at approx. 300 EUR and the whole device feels "cheap" regarding the plastic and squeaks.<br />
<br />
But mmh...what would you do?

<p>Nice to see i am not the only one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, same case for me, the phone sinks on both sides. But on the right side, for me, it SQUEAKS and CREAKS. Its like a&nbsp;sew saw&nbsp;and the fat guy sat on the left side which causes it to lift up the right side and therefore when putting any tiny amount of preasure
 on right causes creaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also with me is that the screen sinks and creaks in that area&nbsp;as well, above the right&nbsp;soft key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked nokia using email&nbsp;support&nbsp;and they said::::::::: "&nbsp;<span>I hope all is well with you. Based on the issues you are experiencing with your brand new Nokia E63, Andrew, I would suggest that if the phone is applicable to be
 returned under the 30 day policy, please do so."::::::::::</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, virgin customers service sucks, first time i called them &nbsp;(10p a call), i explained the problem and was&nbsp;pressing&nbsp;down on the moving part to make it&nbsp;squeak (habbit), so i accidentally pressed the call end key. They never bothered calling back, probably
 thought it was a prank call, how would you react to "my phone is&nbsp;squeaking".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd time i called (another 10p), they said to me to push the case down&nbsp;until&nbsp;it clicks into place??? after that&nbsp;failure they then strangely&nbsp;said&nbsp;remove the battery. I said to them "why?" they didnt say anything and just told me to give them a phone number
 to call back. So i&nbsp;happily did so and they never called me back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third time i called (10p) i &nbsp;barely began to speak before accidentally pressing the call end key, instead of the loudspeaker key which is 1mm away (bad&nbsp;design).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth time (10p) i told them everything again including what the official nokia advice was and they then said they would arrange a pick up and return and that they would call me back in 48 hours before putting the phone down. (they also asked me where did
 i purchase the phone, It was virgin&nbsp;of course&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;why would i be calling them?.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now i am 40p worse off and have to expect a call in the next 48 hours and i have both college&nbsp;tomorrow&nbsp;and work the day after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe i am making a big deal out of nothing, but that creak is going to annoy and distract me till the day i change phone. It is like having a dead pixel, although very tiny and insignificant it is very annoying, like a fly sitting there which you cannot
 remove.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Oh great...amazon only will return my money. They won't get me a replacement...hrm...

<p>Good luck on your replacement, yeah same with me, if you can get a replacement do so as you have nothing to lose. It took me two days of thinking to pluck up the courage and ask for a replacement on a annoyingly&nbsp;squeaky&nbsp;but otherwise great phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30 day return policies might as well be used, what else are they there for?&nbsp;<i>😃</i></p>

    <title>Nokia 6300 contacts directory - Sim &#38;amp&#59; phone memory problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patsor---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6300 contacts directory - Sim &#38;amp&#59; phone memory problem</h2>
                    I recently bought a Nokia 6300, the one I had before was a 7250i.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when I try to copy a contact from the sim card to the telephone, or from the phone to the sim card, I always receive a message "Sim memory is protected" or "Phone memory is protected".<br />
<br />
I never had any problem with my 7250i, so I wonder if someone already encountered the same problem, and if anyone has found the solution.<br />
<br />
I must add that the phone software version I have is 05.00.<br />
<br />
I know there is a new version 05.50 which I downloaded, but could not install because it needs an USB cable which I don't have (I thought it could work with bluetooth, but it doesn't... :-( ).<br />
<br />
I'd be really greatful if anyone could help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Patrick

            Got the solution to this problem by upgrading Nokia 6300 software, from v5.00 up to v5.50.<br />

<h2>            Specifying first page number when printing Excel spreadsheets</h2>
                    I have an &nbsp;Excel workbook where I specify the First Page number in Page Stup for printing each sheet in the workbook. This no longer seems to work in Excel 2016. A sheet where the first page number is "7", shows "Page 7" on the screen as specified in the
 Page Setup dialog but still only prints a page "1" on the sheet.

            <p>This is a known bug that has been discussed before but I'm afraid I can't locate the conversation. AFAIK there was no solution &amp; it has not been corrected by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No disrespect for your need, but in consideration of all the other issues with Excel 2016 I imagine this one ranks rather low on the list of priorities. Still, I'd suggest that you submit it to Microsoft using the ☺︎ at the right end of the Ribbon in Excel...
 The more they hear about it the sooner it is likely to be addressed.<br />

<p>Hi MJbarentine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The workaround for this issue is to type "+n " (n is the number of pages) after the &amp;[Page] or &amp;[Pages] code in the header or footer.&nbsp; Excel will add this amount to the page number.&nbsp; For example, if you want the first page to start at page 4, the header/footer
 code would be "Page &amp;[Page]+4 of &amp;[Pages]+4 ". It's important that the number of pages to add must not be the last character in the string that makes up the header/footer.&nbsp; Even if you just include a space at the end, it will work. If you don't include the
 space, it would print something like "Page 5 of 54" (if there are 5 pages), appending the "4" rather than adding 4 to the number of pages. If you put a space at the end, it would print "Page 5 of 9".</p>

            Hello. Can you please try to repair your Office installation and then try to sync? If this is a new Office install and your Outlook profile is empty, please backup your PIM info on the phone before syncing. You should be able to do this with the MyPhone
 service.&nbsp;Sometimes syncing to an empty profile deletes info from the phone.

<p>Hello. No, the PIMBackup won't work with Windows Mobile Standard (non-touch screen). Try the MyPhone service:</p>
<p><a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com/mkweb/Install.po?mkt=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myphone.microsoft.com/mkweb/Install.po?mkt=en-US</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, there is a file PIM.vol in the root directory of the phone. Copy that to a storage card. To restore, you have to go through a renaming process, e.g. rename the file on the phone to PIMold.vol, copy over the one from the storage card, wait
 60 sec., and do a soft reset. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello. Hmmm. So MyPhone won't sync your phone? I actually haven't used MyPhone so you might have to post in the MyPhone forum to get it to work. If you back out of this forum you will see it. Were you able to find the PIM.vol file on your phone and copy
 it to your storage card? &nbsp;You didn't have to uninstall Outlook at this point, just repair the installation. You mentioned that you have a non-functioning exchange account. Were you syncing that to your Outlook&nbsp;profile? &nbsp;That is probably the root of your problem.
 Unfortunately, I'm not an exchange user either. Have you deleted that account from the phone yet? If you want to keep this information, you have to backup the phone 'cuz I'm pretty sure the sync will want to delete that. So backup the phone first. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, yes, uninstall WMDC. Then reinstall Outlook (make sure it is configured with your profile or .pst file) and&nbsp;reinstall WMDC on the PC. Reboot the PC. On the phone, &nbsp;delete the partnership to the PC (Start&gt;programs&gt;activesync&gt;menu&gt;options&gt; select PC
 and delete). Soft reset the phone. Plug in the phone and remake the partnership and select your sync options.</p>

<p>I tried to move the sync partnerships from exchange server to pc in active sync/options, but it then said it would delete all the information from my phone, which is not what I want, as everything is on there.</p>
<p>As I cannot access my old exchange server and there was no pst file in outlook, I guess I need to figure out how to get everything from my phone..</p>
<p>...if you could help me, you'll save my life!&nbsp; there are 4200 business contacts in the phone!</p>
<p>Also, it seems like the phone is about to die any day!!</p>
<p>I have bought a new phone to transfer everything onto once we have figured this out...many thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Resourceful...think we have cracked it!&nbsp; OK, here goes!&nbsp; You need a new phone (which arrived today).</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Back up pim from old phone on the storage card</p>
<p>- Rename pim on new phone 'pim2'</p>
<p>- copy pim from storage card onto new phone (it needs to be named pim).</p>
<p>- Do a soft reset</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Contacts will be on new phone</p>
<p>- Set up partnerships with my phone/windows live/outlook etc</p>
<p>Your help + 1 week of searches + a few bottles of wine = success!&nbsp; Many thanks for your help!!!!!!</p>

            So many people have experienced this (myself included) that I believe is a bug. Microsoft almost never fixes bugs in current products, but maybe the next version will have a fix. I'm able to temporarily fix it by switching to Read mode, then back to Edit.
 Sorry there isn't a better answer.

<p>Adding a number to an existing contact is not possible on this new Skype v8.14. If the contact has more than one number, you may need to add it as a new contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Call the other number.</p>
<p>2. Right-click on the number and select <strong>View profile</strong></p>
<p>3. Scroll down and select <strong>Add contact</strong>. </p>
<p>4. Click on the pencil icon to rename it like Contact_1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you activate caller ID on your account, your friends and family contacts know you're calling them as you mobile number or Skype Number (if you have) is displayed when you call mobiles and landlines from Skype. Caller ID is free to set up and use.</p>

<h2>            battery starting to drain quicker</h2>
                    <p>I've notice my phone is starting to drain off quicker.</p>
<p>not lasting 24 hrs now, phone is getting issues where you tap a icon and it goes to swipe right listings.</p>
<p>getting a long delay in touch operation, ending calls is difficult.</p>
<p>email has its issue now choose from my contacts, then type in subject end up deleting contact so you have to put back in contact.</p>
<p>I also notice an issue with Bluetooth.</p>
<p>I use a parrot kit 9200 mkiv an when using it,hands free &nbsp;voice crackles and parrot kit screen freezes with voice recognition issue.</p>
<p>have re loaded win 8.1 on phone and that issue is not there.</p>
<p>and win phone is not on there site for compatibility even thou it works fine on 8.1</p>
<p>anyone else with faults appearing on there phone</p>

            <p>I would venture to guess that a good part of the battery usage problem is "THE METRO" and how it handles 'wait for something'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"the METRO" apps(sic) tend to use 100% CPU all of the time when they're running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will throw off the 'idle time' CPU throttle-down logic that is SUPPOSED to be a part of the energy reduction capabilities of the CPU. &nbsp;Usually these are built into the ACPI code on PCs, but I'm not sure how phones do it though. &nbsp;ACPI BIOS tables have
 allowed CPU frequency tables and info on switching to them, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in any case, it seems that throttle-down doesn't work too well for Windows 10. &nbsp;Using lower cpu frequencies during 'idle' time GREATLY reduces battery consumption. &nbsp;But if W10 can NOT detect 'idle' because "the METRO" apps(sic) are SPINNING AT 100% for NO
 GOOD REASON, the end result is it EATS your battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) explain WHY</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) kick the engineers again to make them FIX the "the METRO" code so it STOPS DOING THIS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not like I haven't mentioned it since 9926. &nbsp;It's just that nobody seems to CARE.</p>

            <p>well thank you for ALL that info.</p>
<p>that is the first time whilst testing win 10 that I had had a reply that gives you a bit of info on what is actually happening in background of my phone.</p>
<p>and not just told to soft reset and if that doesn't work get back to us.{and then nothing happens}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love window system and will stand by it !!!!!!&nbsp;even thou everyone has ios/android phone and calls mine&nbsp; for not doing this and that, being slow freezing I still love it</p>
<p>
</p><p>but come on let sort out some basics</p>
<p>yes all phone cant have super speed, all mod cons, but get software to run and operate like it is on all my 3 laptops running win 10 build 11082 with consistancy</p>

<h2>            Countif Yes and subtotal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 columns in my table: </p>
<p>A, B &amp; C.&nbsp; which have the following data:&nbsp; Name, A or P, Yes or No.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my total I am using =countif(C1:C100,"Yes").&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I would like to filter the total by column B options (A or P).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This would be a great opportunity to lean about pivot tables. Search the web using "Excel 2010 Pivot Table" ; there are many good tutorials including some you-tube videos.</p>
<p>If you email me at bliengme at stfx dot ca and send a sample file, I will make a video of how to make a PT from your data. Look at this video PivotTableX.mp4 I have just made; you can find it at
