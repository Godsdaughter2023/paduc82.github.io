<h2>            Outlook resolving email as &#64;domain.onmicrosoft.com</h2>
                    <p>I've got two users that I'm having issues with, both same issue.&nbsp; In Active Directly, I have their proxyaddress fields set.&nbsp; I have their primary address with SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, along with a number of aliases set.&nbsp; I've added a couple new ones and I can
 confirm it syncs through to O365.&nbsp; The primary address shows as a newly added one, which is the one I want to use.&nbsp; The problem is, when users using Outlook type her name in, it resolves to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I've waited some time, I've downloaded
 the address book via outlook Send/Receive groups thinking it was cached, all to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can make email (alias, primary email address, etc.) changes in my local AD, sync them to O365 just fine.&nbsp; It's just outlook that seems to be caching the old email somewhere.&nbsp; Anyone have any further ideas for me to try?</p>

            <p>There is no option in Outlook to enable the icons by default. Hopefully you would need to download some 3rd party software which could integrate with Outlook to provide the
 same.</p>

<h2>            Yammer All Company group</h2>
                    <p>If you post a message in the All Company group, I understood it should automatically be sent as an email alert to all employees. This function only exists for the All Company group, for the other groups - that have been created- people need to indicate whether
 they like to receive alert emails when there is a new message posted within that group.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A colleague of my posted something in the All Company group. Yet, it didn't generate an automatic alert email. Have I misunderstood? Does All Company not as default send out automatic alert emails when a new post has been shared within the All Company group?
 Is this only applicable when posting announcements - that an alert email is sent out - and not applicable for general posts?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>You can set Yammer Notifications in a variety of situations in the Gear-&gt; Edit Settings -&gt; Notifications settings of the Yammer Network. You can also specific which group sends out notifications. This setting is set by individual users. They have a choice
 to remove All Company notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, you really DO NOT want to send a email alert to all employees when someone posts in the All Company group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is that whenever someone, any employee, posts in the All Company group then a notification is sent out to all employees. This will generate a lot of email traffic if your organisation has many employees.</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 Select and Deselect Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherardelean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 Select and Deselect Bug</h2>
                    While using Excel today, I decided to try to deselect some selected columns, like I've done in past versions of Excel. &nbsp;Pressing ctrl+click in past versions would clear the selection on the cell that was clicked.<br />
<br />
Now when I press ctrl+click on any cell, the cell will become selected. &nbsp;If I ctrl+click on the cell again to deselect, it will just get visually darker rather than deselecting. &nbsp;Upon ctrl+clicking several times, the cell becomes completely black. &nbsp;This can
 be reproduced in a new blank Excel workbook.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 64-bit, with Excel 2013 Version 15.0.4569.1508. &nbsp;This is part of the Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 suite.<br />
<br />
Edit: Tried in excel 2010, and I can't deselect there either, so I may be mis-remembering deselection in the past. &nbsp;However, the graphical bug I described above still exists.<br />

            Applications that are designed to work on windows computers can not be installed on a windows mobile device.&nbsp; You'll need to find the windows mobile version of this software before you can install it to your windows mobile phone.&nbsp; This may require another
 purchase of the software, but IGO8 could provide that information.

I think most of us are waiting on the 4GB *micro* SD which are not yet available and will be restricted to the SDHC format.

            This topic is old and incorrect.<br />
<br />
You can't get 4GB cards that aren't SDHC from any of the well known manufacturers.<br />
<br />
Many cards appeared on ebay that claimed to be 4GB non-HC but they were known to either not work, fail quickly or only show as 2GB.<br />
<br />
So cards that are 2GB or less are SD, cards that are 4GB or more are SDHC.<br />

    <title>undeliverable mail retries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lissajedi  say:</h3>
<h2>            undeliverable mail retries</h2>
                    I recently sent an email with an attachment from my phone to a family member. &nbsp; Unfortunately, &nbsp;I had their email address wrong or something, because it came back as undeliverable. &nbsp; Ok, no big deal. &nbsp;Problem is, Outlook (Hotmail) keeps trying to resend
 it, and it keeps coming back from tge Hotmail Postmaster as undeliverable. &nbsp; I don't see any options in the Postmaster emails to stop trying to resend the em ail. &nbsp;I checked my drafts and outbox foldrrs to make sure the email is not trying to resend from there,
 but it's not in either folder. &nbsp;How do I get this email to stop trying to be delivered? &nbsp;I have since given my family member the information they wanted, &nbsp;so I don't need this email to go through anymore. &nbsp;I just want it to stop trying to resend and filling
 up my inbox with the delivery failure messages.

            <p>Hi Lissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the email that you have sent to a wrong email account keeps resending resulting to the undeliverable emails you receive and I'm here to assist you. If you don't see the email message on the outbox or drafts but still encounter the issue, it
 is recommended that you remove your account and reconfigure it to see if the problem would persist. For steps on how to configure your account to a mobile phone such as Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone, please refer to the link below:</p>

            Hi AdamKatzMusic, 
<br />
<br />You should change your password (if you haven't already), as this will prevent further access to devices that are already connected (essentially logging them out). 
<br />
<br />I would also advise to check the following to see your account activity (if people are still trying to login to your account): <a href="https://account.live.com/Activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Activity</a>
<br />
<br />Once you've got control of your account again, I would suggest enabling two-step verification. More information about this can be found here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12408/micros...</a>
<br />
<br />Note: I'm unable to see the case notes as I am a volunteer.
<br />
<br />If there's anything else I could assist with, please let me know.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Which version of Office subscription are you trying to reactivate? &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?
</span></li><li><span>Have you tried the Microsoft account that you previously used in the original installation?

    <title>Surface Pro 3 SDXC Card Driver and Icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter r cook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 SDXC Card Driver and Icon</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a Surface Pro 3. Insider Build 17101. I keep my user data (G:) on a removable 64GB SDXC card (SanDisk extreme). Initially I had the well known problem of the card dismounting randomly. However using the fix&nbsp; at http://blog.hazaveh.net/2016/06/fix-surface-pro-3-randomly-ejects-micro-sd-card/
 the problem went away.&nbsp; I have been using Insider builds and after the latest update, noticed that the icon for the G: drive had switched (back?) to an SDXC icon, and the Realtek USB drivers had been reinstalled. The dismount problem had not reappeared, however
 the read speed of the card seemed to have slowed.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>As an experiment I tested the speed using CrystalDisk, then replaced the USB driver with the Mass Storage one as before and tested again. To validate the experiment I went back to the Realtek drivers. But the SDXC icon did not reappear.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The performance difference between the two sets of drivers - particularly for sequential read is dramatic (and actually noticeable in real life when opening documents and spreadsheets.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The Realtek setup has the USB driver as a card reader version 10.0.14393.31230 and<br />
The Disk drive as an SD card with Microsoft Driver version 10.0.17101.1000<br />
The Icon looks like</div>

<h2>            Saving word documents to PDF only shows half a page</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When saving a word 2007 document as a PDF, the word document looks fine and is scaled correctly, but when saved to a PDF, it's almost as if it's supersized and it only shows half the original document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When choosing file&gt;print&gt;PDF writer then saving it to a location, it works fine.&nbsp; The user would prefer to use file&gt;save as&gt;PDF though (I know, I know)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to attach an example document on this post, but if anyone would like one, let me know.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Link Access to hidden table in SQL</h2>
                    I am trying to link a table from MS SQL to MS Access using a DSN. The DSN creation is successful and I can see dozens of tables. However, I can't see the one that I want to connect to. When I log onto the server I can view the table as long as I am the
 administrator. How do I connect to a table that I cannot see in Access?

<p>Well that gives you a clue. The DSN needs to use an loginID that has administrator privileges.</p>

<p>Hi Hubert, <br />
<br />
<br />
You're welcome, Hubert. The option to turn off the proximity sensor is currently unavailable. The function of it is to detect the presence of a human ear and disable the touch screen. This is to reduce the power consumption by turning off the LCD backlight
 and to avoid inadvertent touches by the cheek that may result of a call interruption. Microsoft is always open for any suggestions you may have. You may send us a feedback through the Feedback Hub app.</p>

How did you deal with your trojan?&nbsp; I prefer to play it safe and simply do a Windows re-install (after first doing a full image copy backup).&nbsp; That is the safest way to deal with known malware infestations. Malware is getting trickier all the time, you can
 never be sure you have cleaned it all up.<br />
<br />
Many problems are caused by 3rd party addins.<br />
<br />
I have found on my computer, I often get temporary "hangs" while timed autorecovery backups are being made.&nbsp; I doubt that is your problem, but ... maybe.
<br />
<br />
<br />
A "normal" uninstall using Programs and Features leaves a bunch of configuration files, like normal.dot, and registry entries behind. That is on the assumption you have done an uninstall and reinstall for trouble shooting.&nbsp; A more thorough uninstall can be
 done using Method 2 in this tip:<br />

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>NOTE: </b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble
 shooting process. Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>Don’t Assume ANYTHING! </div>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have an unwanted app
 installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. </p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>Uninstall Recent Software </div>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

<p>&lt;snip&gt; While I couldn't precisely say whether the problems from Office stemmed from the iCloud Panel software, I decided to uninstall the software as I don't use it anyway. After doing that, Office is now working perfectly fine. No more re-starting or crashing
 when I'm running IE at the back, nor trying to copy something in Word or Excel. It looks like the iCloud Panel software does have some compatibility issues with Office. &lt;/snip&gt;

</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>

<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came across a feature
 I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste. Info only,
 it case it helps anyone.</p>

<div>Cannot select text – “Synergy” </div>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning of the text and dragging
 the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse. However, as soon as I type
 anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>

<div>Black Blob during Copy / Paste </div>
<div>
<p>My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the
 better option)</span></p>

<div>Additional tip - Remove Older Printer Drivers </div>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <span>Step 3</span> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing the applications to
 crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p><i>Office 2013 instead.&nbsp; I am having problems with Excel, Word and Outlook printing to two separate HP laserjet printers, models 1522nf and model 3015.&nbsp; I can print one file from these applications.&nbsp; The second file locks up the Excel, Word or Outlook program
 and the only solution that I have found is to close out of the program.&nbsp; If I restart my computer, I can then print one file before it locks up again.&nbsp; This only happens with my HP Laserjet Printers.&nbsp; I have a HP Officejet 8600 printer that does not&nbsp;have any
 problems printing in Office 2013 Excel, Word or Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of my Laserjet printers will print anything on Internet Explorer or non Office based programs without any issues.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest drivers for these printers and looked for any latest
 updates to Office 2013 and made sure that I had the most recent.</i></p>
<p>I installed the printer driver Vista version for my HP Laserjet 1522 and that fixed the problem with the Spooling / Cache issue with Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy and HP via phone could not come up with this answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>

<div>Win 7 / Office 2013 / HP Printing problem / HP MFP Printer </div>
<p><i><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 1, 1)">have latest version of Office 2013 installed Windows 7-32bit. I can only print one time (one print job sent) from any Office app, if I try printing again (sending another print job to the printer from the same office app or
 even non-office apps like Adobe PDF) the job gets stuck spooling, never progresses or prints. I can only print again if I reboot my computer, and then only once if I print from an Office 2013 app.
<br />
<br />
I have confirmed this is an Office 2013 bug because I have Office 2010 still installed so the very same document will print on the same printer fine and I can print after that just fine. So once I try to print from any Office 2013 app, the print spooler hangs.</span></i></p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>After the problem occurred again even though I disabled Windows Defender, I have now confirmed it is the Printer driver (HP MFP printer). I determined this by setting up a "virtual" printer and was able to print to it consistently &nbsp; with no problem. Interestingly,
 that printer was one from the Windows 7 normal selections and probably older than the printer I am trying to print to. Unfortunately HP has not updated my printer's driver since 2009 and I doubt they will at this point. I still don't know what has changed
 in Office 2013 vs. 2010 that would cause a working printer driver to have this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Word 2013 Crashes “All the time” - PS CS3 Fonts not compatible with Word 2013: Found out after many test that there's an incompatibility between Adobe PS CS3 and Word 2013 fonts causing the Word to crash. No clue about a solution except not using Adobe fonts
 on Word.</p>

<div><span>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</span> </div>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that you want to try that
 have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something
 up. Each time the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

            the trojan was removed successfully. but left me with a .dll&nbsp; reminder window which kept popping up everytime i logged on. so i tried ccleaner, which probably removed more registry than it should.&nbsp; and since then, i cannot use office 2010 at all. now this
 .dll window is also removed.<br />
<br />
as far as i understood from first suggestion, i should only uninstall-reinstall office 2010, but not window starter, right?<br />
<br />
greetings!<br />

            OK, it sounds to me like you have not yet completely dealt with the infestation.&nbsp; You already have identified one remnant, why do you think there may not be others just waiting to be activated by some trigger?&nbsp; The specific situation you've identified
 would encourage me to do a full windows re-install.&nbsp; But it is your choice.<br />
<br />
How much you uninstall and re-install is entirely up to you. Your purchased copy of Office 2010 is easiest to uninstall/re-install.&nbsp; Starter can also be uninstalled and re-installed, but the required process to re-install is not obvious.&nbsp; And it is not really
 necessary. Since it is in a "Virtual computer", it is isolated from malware on your computer (as I understand the situation).<br />

            well.. it was the update-registry problem which kept popping up everytime i switched on, and so.. stupid me used the registry cleaning tool.&nbsp; after which i had uninstalled ccleaner, so.. i cant revert the changes.<br />

            i took the word from the person who helped me. after a few days of running many programmes, that the notebook should be cleared of any other infestation. otherwise, he who read all the .exe, would have kept me going on with scanning for more ****.  the copy of office 2010 came with the notebook.

            If it is activated tell the provider to download the configuration to your phone or ask them how to configure it manually giving the model of your Nokia phone, it differs a little bit from one model to the other.

                    I'm very very disappointed with Microsoft, I bought Lumia 535 and two days after that the screen went blank, I sent it to Nokia service center, I had to wait for two freakin months to get it fixed. Now I'm faced with this touch issue. Installed the fix
 update, it only improves a LITTLE bit. I still experience some issues such as "ghost touch" sometimes when I press backspace letter V or C will be typed, can't use swipe gesture at all!, pinching and zooming work only half of the times, scrolling with a finger
 in contact to the scree in very bumpy and swiping is sometimes registered as a selection.&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft please be honest, is this software or hardware issue?. If it's software issue please release a PROPER fix update AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, if it's hardware issue, first of all deal with your quality control team, how can they release such defective product
 and then of course let those with defective L535 get a hardware replacement AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

<p>install a screen guard on your phone. it works like a charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;touch screen is somehow too sensitive to moist and dirt.&nbsp; that should fix your problem. it will only cost you around a couple dollars</p>

<p>There is definitely room for improvement. Also needed urgently is Silverlight for this smartphone. I can watch tv on my iPod but not on my Lumia 535. I dont understand why Microsoft made it available for Android and iOS but not for their own sistem Windows!&nbsp;</p>
