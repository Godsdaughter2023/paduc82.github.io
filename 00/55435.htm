<h2>            Video output to a networked TV&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having major surgery next week and will be laid up for several weeks recovering at home.&nbsp; Sitting at my computer won't be much of an option.&nbsp; But I do have a wireless keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; My home network has a smart TV on it and I can already stream
 video from my computer to my TV using the 'Play To' command.&nbsp; Which is very nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I really want to be able to do is to use my smart TV as a monitor via my home network.&nbsp; That way I can recover and use my computer at the same time.&nbsp; So, is it possible to send the video output from my computer to my smart TV via my network instead
 of/in addition to my monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you...</p>

            <p>My TV (Panasonic Viera) is internet capable on its own and has a hard wired connection to the internet via its connection to my home computer network.&nbsp; For example, I am able to play access Netflix and Youtube videos directly, without having to go through
 my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me try to re-explain.&nbsp; My computer is connected to my router.&nbsp; My TV is also connected to my router.&nbsp; Via that connection I can currently stream video from my computer to my TV.&nbsp; I need to know if I can send my computer's video output ( in other words,
 what appears on my monitor) to my television, via the mutual connection my TV and my Computer share to my router.&nbsp; This can either be in addition to, or instead of, sending the video output to my monitor.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Having too many CD/DVD programs can cause strange issues, especially if they load parts of
<br />
themselves at StartUp as they will compete for resources. This does not mean this issue was
<br />
caused by those however it is a possibility depending on which and how many you have installed.<br />
<br />
You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and<br />
CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others&nbsp;do so<br />
properly.<br />
<br />
Burning at slower speeds or using the Master Format might help.&nbsp;A CD/DVD cleaner might help.<br />
<br />
Brand of CD or DVD disk can also be the issue. Low quality (cheap brands) are always problematic.<br />
<br />
CD/DVD's have a +- tolerance and yours might read/write on the edge outside of those discs&nbsp;<br />
tolerances. They can be realigned however it is usually more economical to replace the drive.<br />

<p>==========================================================<br />
<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />

<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            can you win a 9 nine man morris in the inn at the homestead&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>i can not beat that fat guy in the inn at the homestead at 9 man morris. i won bowls and i beat the old man at the other game in the manor. it seems no matter what i do, this guy in the inn beats me every time. i can go first, i can let him go first, no
 matter where i put my chips in response to his moves, he always beats me every single freaking time. he always winds up setting up this thing where he moves one chip back and forth between the 2 same spots over and over until he takes all my chips. or he blocks
 me from moving my chips. i try and try and try to do the thing where he sets up moving one chip back and forth in the same two spots over and over. that never ever works out for me, but it always works out for him. i even try blocking him from being able to
 move and that never work's. it's like the game is designed for you to lose 100% of the time. i just see no way to win. is there a way? if so, HOW?</p>

<p>i follow the video but it don't work. the computer always does a different move at some point and wins. there is no way to win. i tried other videos and got the same result, the computer makes a different move from what the video shows and winds up winning.
 this game is designed for you to lose every single time. i don't see why UBIsoft would make an achievement you can't get.

<p>Now, whatever move the AI makes in-game, you make on the site.&nbsp;Whatever move the site makes, you make in-game.</p>

<p>Anyway, is this game glitched? The game doesn't let me put the third checker to complete a line, nor move it in the position to do so, while on the countrary the opponent keeps moving the same checker forward and backword to reform again and again the same
 line.</p>
<p>The point is that the opponent can line-up checkers, while I can't... I'm forced to put the checkers wherever I want but to the right place to form a line.... why?</p>

<h2>            WHY DO WINDOWS 7 UPDATES TAKE SO LONG&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Seriously. &nbsp;This is an absolute joke. &nbsp;Windows 7 updates take forever. &nbsp;I have hundreds of machines that need administration and it's to the point where I had to post here!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If enough people complained about this (many have) then we'd get an answer quicker. &nbsp;So if you're one of those experiencing this issues then please post to this thread and show Microsoft that there's a huge issue here.<br />

<h2>            Unable to play Fallout 3 on Windows 8 - Ordinal 42 not found in xlive.dll</h2>
                    Hello, I just bought Fallout 3 and Oblivion Double Pack and I'm trying to run Fallout 3 on Windows 8. &nbsp;I've installed it, but when I click "play" I get an error stating "The ordinal 42 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\xlive.dll".
 &nbsp; Now, I've been trying to get this to work for almost 3 hours now. &nbsp;I've researched this problem on the internet, which suggested I should download GFWL. &nbsp;I tried that. &nbsp;I ran the installer, but I get another error code: 0x800b0003. &nbsp;Please help. :(

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;INVALID IP CONFIGURATION&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I work for an ISP and we are getting a ton of customers today (Dec. 6th, 2016) that are getting an invalid IP configuration error using multiple types of routers and/or DSL, cable, or fiber internet connections. &nbsp;I have only seen one trend and that is they
 are using Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some known update or glitch that is causing this? &nbsp;It seems to fix it when we do IP release/renew but it has come back for a couple people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY help would be greatly appreciated....</p>

            <p>I've seen heaps of this over the last few days.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The solution is to RESTART the computer, not shut down.&nbsp; A Windows 10 shutdown isn't a full shut down but more of a deep sleep/hibernation.&nbsp; Restarting will fully shut down the computer and restart and the problem should be fixed..</p>

</p><p>All you will need to do is download the installer for use on another computer and put it to a thumb drive. &nbsp; Boot off that thumb drive and proceed to custom install.&nbsp; Just choose your new drive and it will automatically make the correct partitions and formats
 and install. &nbsp; You probably want to shrink your C drive maybe from Drive Manager once your on your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you install the windows version you had originally &amp; it will automatically activate once you get online within a day or two, if not instantly. &nbsp; If it asks for a key you can skip the key.</p>

</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be

<br />
Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.<br />
<br />
BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card<br />
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/</a><br />
<br />
Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/<br />
<br />
<br />
The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.<br />
<br />
Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.<br />
<br />
Click Install now<br />
<br />
Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed
 to enter it.<br />
<br />
Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.<br />
<br />
The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro<br />
<br />
Wait while setup prepares to copy files<br />
<br />
Accept the license terms then click Next<br />
<br />
Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then
 go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select the drive then click New<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.<br />
<br />
Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK<br />
<br />
This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Wait while Windows installs<br />
<br />
When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.<br />
<br />
Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.<br />
<br />

    <title>HP Envy on 8.1 Losing WiFi Connection on Lid Close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> endahood  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Envy on 8.1 Losing WiFi Connection on Lid Close</h2>
                    <p>I bought an HP Envy TouchSmart m6-n012dx earlier this summer and have been experiencing some issues with WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use WiFi for connecting to the internet at my home but I've been having an issue with it where if I close the lid and reopen it again, I lose the connection and the computer refuses to reconnect. I know this is not an issue with the router itself
 because all of our other devices are still connected with no issues (other PCs running Windows 7, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, iPhone, Smart TVs, etc. all over WiFi connections). Attempting to reconnect gives me an error saying that it cannot
 reconnect. If I reboot my computer, it will reconnect with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed all the available Windows Updates as of today and at least two of the updates in the past have been for the WiFi card (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160). One of the updates also included software specifically for Intel that works side-by-side
 with Windows' default connecting program to connect to WiFi services. I previously had an issue attempting to update this card because I was on WiFi and it tried updating the card while on WiFi which caused it to malfunction and not work at all. My solution
 to this was to revert to the older driver then update over Ethernet connection which worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also experiencing another issue where my computer sometimes will not connect to a certain WiFi hotspot no matter what I do. What's odd is that I can reboot the router, check other devices and make sure they're also connected (which they are), and check
 if my computer can connect to other hotspots, like my portable one on my phone, and it will connect. But for some reason, it just has a problem connecting to this one hotspot. These are always hotspots that I have been connected to with this machine in the
 past too, so it's not an issue of not having the right password, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend of mine has a similar issue with his HP Envy where it won't connect to hotspots even though the router is working just fine. His and mine will sometimes not even connect after rebooting the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think these WiFi issues are the result of Windows 8.1, the HP Envy line, or our WiFi cards, or maybe even the driver? And what sorts of things do you think I should do to correct these issues? I have been experiencing these issues since before using
 Windows Update for the first time on the machine as well as more recently with the latest updates installed. Nothing seems to correct the issue. What's also odd is that closing the lid only sometimes seems to disable the current connection. I'd say, maybe
 90% of the time, the connection will be disabled, and the other 10%, it will still be connected with no issue.</p>

====================================================<br />
<br />
It is possible that the drivers you are using, even if the latest now available, are not<br />
100% Windows 8.1 compliant. Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard<br />
Maker for custom systems) and/or the actual device maker. The latter, such as Intel,<br />
RealTek, Atheros and others may have newer versions not available at the System/Mother<br />
-board Maker's site. And continue to check with them regularly over the next year +.
<br />
Also update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers.<br />

<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite effect<br />
on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the System Maker's Support (Motherboard&nbsp;Maker for custom systems) and/or
<br />
the actual&nbsp;device maker for driver updates. If there are no newer versions&nbsp;re-install the same<br />
ones. Ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) about any known issues.<br />

Your router and that HotSpot would be suspect here, have you updated its firm-<br />
ware as a possible&nbsp;solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.
<br />
How far are&nbsp;you positioned from the router and the Hotspot? Are there obstructions
<br />
in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />

<h2>            How to downgrade to Windows 10 version 1703&#63;</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/spatial-sound-not-working-despite-being-selected/509e7965-3496-4907-a5e6-02406a16efce" title="Split from this thread">
this thread</a>. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>May i ask, is there any 'official' way to downgrade to build 1703? Like a Microsoft iso or something. I dont believe that there is anything i run that REQUIRES anything newer. Although why i should have to go to that trouble i dont know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft support rang me, they told me Dolby Atmos for Headphones isn't supported on Windows 10, even insisting that after i told them its built in to windows 10!!! I have the exact same problems with the inferior Windows Sonic by the way. Can anyone
 else confirm that? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The mention of Microsoft's own Windows Sonic is what made them hang up on me. Like they suddenly panicked and thought, "Damn, this guy's on to us!" Hehe.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's important to get your system to the most updated version of Windows 10 to enjoy the latest feature improvements and fixes for your system. You can always rollback to a previous version whenever there are issues using
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery options</a>. If it's not available, you may opt to perform a re-installation of a previous version of Windows 10 using Media Creation Tool. I will share the details on how to perform this procedure via private message.
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 anniversary update - Try saying Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed the Windows 10 anniversary update - now when I start or restart my system, prior to being asked for my login PIN I get a message to say the laptop is restarting and also one displayed along the lines of "Try saying Hey Cortana......"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all for Microsoft to help promote new features and would not object to this message being displayed for a few reboots/restarts after the Windows 10 anniversary update had been applied but it seems like this is now a permanent startup message and as an
 IT professional it looks like I am now running with the modern equivalent of the Microsoft Office Assistant paperclip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can suppress this Informational/Helpful/Promotional messages? &nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just a few days ago, My Windows Defender can't be turned on. Then I went to Action Center but still cannot.</div>
<div>Then, I went to Control Panel and try to open Windows Defender, but what is happening is a small notification window appear then disappear at once</div>
<div>I had checked every questions in here regarding about the problem, but my difference is that NO ERROR CODE</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Peoples said that this might becaue of worm/virus/etc. , if so does anybody know how to fix it?</div>
<div>If not, then how to fix it too? (Even when I try to uninstall Defender, I can't because it's included in my system)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any kind of help, and by the way, my computer is Windows 7 Home Premium 32bit</div>

            <p><span>Hi Muhamad,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when you try to open Windows Defender?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error code or error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Try the following method and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the service for Windows Defender is started or not. To check that follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>Ensure that the Windows Defender service is started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Open Run and type in services.msc then press Enter.</p>
<p>b) In services window, locate Windows Defender service in the services list.</p>
<p>c) Verify that the Status is started. If the Status column is blank, right click on Windows Installer and select Start.</p>
<p>d) If you get error trying to force start the Windows Defender service, try to change the Startup Type to Manual, and then restart the computer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You can also perform system restore to restore your system to a time when everything was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on how to perform System Restore refer to the link provided below:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore</a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall Avira antivirus and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform virus scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner to check if there are any threats.</span></p>

<p>Hi DailyPLANIT,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your child uses multiple devices, they each track time separately, so 1 hour of screen time means 1 hour per device. Idle time counts towards screen time, but not as usage.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, </span><span>make sure your family’s devices have the latest Windows updates by selecting the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Start<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>button, then selecting</span><strong> Settings<span>
</span></strong><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Windows Update</strong><span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Check for updates<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>and installing any available updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest </span>rebooting your family’s devices to shake things loose. Select the
<strong>Start </strong>button, then select <strong>Power </strong>&gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Hibernating unexpectedly</h2>
                    <p>Recently my Dell T1700 workstation has started going into hibernation mode even though it is set to never go to sleep.&nbsp; I believe it started after a recent Windows update but am not certain as it took a week or more to determine what was happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked all power setting and do not see anything wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC sites idle for some period of time it generally shut down when I return.&nbsp; Powering back up returns to prior state from what I can tell.&nbsp; The shut downs only seemed to happen overnight earlier but are occurring with shorter intervals during the
 day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today the PC power button started flashing with a power supply code but after reboot it did not show same.&nbsp; Bios has been updated to most current available from Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run powercfg to pull stats on the configuration and shows errors but not ones that would explain this.</p>
<p>

<p>Sorry but hit the wrong selection - it certainly is not helpful.&nbsp; I cannot send to any groups I have set up and would like to see my contact list beside my email.&nbsp; I cannot believe with the "amazing" changes to Windows that this very meaningful association
 with one's email could be left out and am also disappointed that one is not able to advust the columns to shrink or increase or change how one can view their email.&nbsp;

    <title>HKLM Registry Read Access locked for one user only at Windows Creators - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evgeniy mishustin  say:</h3>
<h2>            HKLM Registry Read Access locked for one user only at Windows Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.<br />
There is a 32-bit JavaFX bundled application that comes with own JRE and uses HKLM/Software/JavaSoft/Prefs for storing system-wide preferences. It worked well on many Windows versions but the last creators update
<strong>sometimes</strong> is throwing error - "Error invoking method -&gt; Failed to launch JVM". The cause is the line where the application tries to
<strong>read</strong>&nbsp;value from HKLM (no administrator privileges). In some cases, appears that one user of the system may read the value and all the others can not. In several cases we observed the issue when the administrator was unable neither read or write
 to HKLM but some other user could. Seems like something is locking the registry for specific user and doesn't let the others to operate it. For all cases running application with compatibility mode Windows 8 helped.</p>
<p>Please advice, what can be the root cause.</p>

<p>Hi Jose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern regarding the installation of your v380 camera is product specific, and we may not have the exact set of steps on how to install it. Please note that most of computer peripherals should have a software/driver for it to work with your PC. Your
 camera device should have an installation media for you to load in the computer. If it doesn't have any installation disc along with the package, you may try to visit the device manufacturer's website if there are any latest drivers available for download.
 Or better yet, you might want to contact the device manufacturer itself for installation assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there is anything else we can do to help.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Please see the instructions in the below article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-your-keyboard-layout-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-your-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that leads you to the same Tamil keyboard you've already tried, then you may need to explore other third-party options for a Tamil keyboard in Windows 10, as what you see in the link above is all that Windows 10 provides. You could search for "tamil keyboard Windows 10" and see what results appear, but just be aware of adware that may come with downloads from third-party sites.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further advice! Thanks!

<h2>            New update killed my surround sound</h2>
                    The overnight Windows 10 update (December 15, 2015) disabled my Surround Sound system.&nbsp; I cannot figure out how to restore.&nbsp; System is no longer being recognized on the computer, only stereo speakers.&nbsp; When I run the Sony test from the install dvd, every
 single speaker sounds the same (each one&nbsp;is supposed to&nbsp;respond one at a time but now they all respond the same) except the woofer which does not make any sound at all.&nbsp; I hope someone can help me fix this. Unfortunately I am not tech savvy.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hello Jessen P, thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>However it appears my System Protection had been totally configured OFF. No restore points are available.</p>
<p>I have now remedied this for future needs, but I guess it doesn't help me right now.</p>
<p>An aside: I did a successful System Restore about a week ago, to get rid of a horrible adware virus/Trojan/malware thing that had imbedded itself, and perhaps this&nbsp;restore has eliminated restore points&nbsp;and/or reset the configurations, I don't know.</p>
<p>How do I find the KB number of the update? It took place after midnight this morning, and the update restarted my computer (Asus laptop).&nbsp;&nbsp;I could tell immediately the sound system had changed when I opened my iTunes to listen to my music.&nbsp; (The radio option
 still sounds perfect, so I know it's the computer.) </p>
<p>Would it help if I gave you a picture of anything?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi Jessen P. Thanks&nbsp;for some additional feedback.</p>
<p>Since our last communication I've had at least another&nbsp;5 or&nbsp;20 updates (I lose track, they are frequent) and somewhere along the line the audio appears to have reset itself.&nbsp; I still don't think it's perfect, but it's much better than it was when I started
 complaining and I can live with it now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

 1803, however I have some shaded letters in the bottom right corner that says to "activate windows go to settings" when I attempt to go to the settings/activate page I see error message : 0x803F7001 saying that windows can not be activated because I do not

            You have the wrong edition installed. You need to perform a clean install, to make sure you have Windows 10 Home installed. 
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Shaun
<br />
<br />If I understand correctly:
<br />
<br />You were running Windows 10 Home - was that pre-installed and activated on your PC?
<br />
<br />Then you purchased an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro form the Microsoft Store?
<br />
<br />How long did that upgrade take once you purchased the upgrade and did it happen autpmatically
<br />
<br />Now for some unknown reason you have Windows 10 Enterprise installed - is that correct?
<br />
<br />Sign into <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/account</a>?
<br />
<br />Do you see your Windows 10 Pro upgrade listed there?

            Other people have reported similar problems. During an update or upgrade they get the wrong version of Windows installed.  Windows Product Keys are edition specific. A Home key will only work on a Home installation. Same with Pro and Enterprise. 
<br />
<br />The only fix I know of is the one Andre suggested, doing a clean install of the proper Edition of WIndows.

<p>Hi Margot,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error "The code execution cannot proceed because BugSplat.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem" can happen if you still have corrupted or remaining registry keys of these programs in your computer.
 We suggest that you download and use this automatic <a href="http://aka.ms/Program_Install_and_Uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
troubleshooter</a> that was specifically created to repair issues regarding remaining or corrupted registry keys from programs that were installed in your computer in the past.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the error message disappears after using the troubleshooter. </p>
<p>

 una finestrella rossa e mi spunta questo codice&nbsp;0x80270300 con tanto di scritta &nbsp;che dice che " Forza motorsport 6 deve &nbsp;terminare l'installazione o mostrare la dicitura pronto per iniziare prima che io possa avviarlo " il problema è che io a forza ci ho giocato
 gia altre volte e non mi ha mai dato problemi e adesso di punto in bianco mi fa uno scherzo del genere?? Qualcuno sa per caso come districarsi da sta cosa o &nbsp;devo obbligatoriamente disinstallare il gioco e reinstallarlo??<br />
<br />
Grazie in anticipo delle eventuali risposte/aiuti !!</p>
