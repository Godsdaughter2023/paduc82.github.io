            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

            I had the same problem. My shift key was stuck on, so I just tapped both of them a few times and they were released. There&nbsp;are lots of really annoying behaviours such as opening links in new windows, Excel selecting ranges and not letting you choose a
 cell and the mouse wheel not scrolling. Trying to close everything down to reboot probably wouldn't be much fun either.

            This is right answer. Mash the shift keys a whole bunch. Most painful experience ever let me tell you, I ended up deleting half of my stuff because I kept on highlighting things and then trying to type.&nbsp;

<p>Hallo zusammen,</p>
<p>ich bin zwangsweise leider bei UM und habe in Verbindung mit meinem Router nichts als Probleme.</p>
<p>IPV4 habe ich, aber mein Router blockt mit der Firewall die Verbindung zu Xbox-Live. Bedeutet, dass ich immer wieder gekickt werden. -.-</p>
<p>Schalte ich sie aus, dann läuft alles ohne Probleme... das kann doch nicht im Sinne des Erfinders sein?!</p>
<p>Portweiterleitung, UPNP und DMZ-Host bringen keine Lösung... weder einzeln noch alle zusammen.</p>

<p>Hat jemand eine Idee?</p>
<p>LG nrgracer17</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Doch. Firewalls bei (Heim-)Routern sind eigentlich "nur" Marketing-Blödsinn. </p>
<p>Der Router ist auch mit ausgeschalteter Firewall IMMER NOCH eine Firewall, da ungefragt ankommende Pakete ohne Weiterleitungsregel GENERELL immer geblockt werden.
</p>
<p>Eine Firewall bräuchtest Du eigentlich nur, wenn Du beispielsweise in einem Firmenumfeld einen Server hinter dem Router stehen hast, der NUR für eine Zweigstelle Deiner Tochterfirma zugägnlich sein soll, aber für andere Internetteilnehmer gesperrt sein soll
 (also eine Regel wie: "Öffne Port 4711 und leite das an den Server weiter, aber erlaube NUR der IP 123.45.67.89 den Zugriff auf diesen Server, sonst niemand".
</p>
<p>Im Heimbereich möchtest Du aber quasi "mit der ganzen Welt" spielen. Also richtest Du eine Portweiterleitung ein, die es "der ganzen Welt" erlaubt NUR Xbox Live Daten NUR an Deine Konsole zu schicken. Alles Andere wird auch ohne Firewall von dem Router geblockt,
 weil Du dem Router nicht ausdrücklich gesagt hast, was er mit "fremden" eingehenden Paketen tun soll.</p>
<p>Also: Ruhigen Gewissens die Firewall des Routers abschalten. Solange Du nicht den Datenverkehr auf BEKANNTE statische IP Adressen im Internet einschränken willst, bringt Dir die Firewall am Router keine sinnvolle zusätzliche Sicherheit.</p>
<p>Lies dazu auch den kleinen Absatz "Zu restriktive Firewall oder IDS (Intrusion Detection System)" in meinem NAT Post unten in meiner Signatur.</p>

    <title>Problem with 7.1 in my USB headset &#91;WIN.10&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with 7.1 in my USB headset &#91;WIN.10&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently happened to buy a SADES SA 710 headset - &nbsp;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B019PYQ7YY?ref_=pe_385721_51767431_TE_dp_1 - It is indeed a 7.1 surround headset, but windows doesn't seem to be letting me configure it for 7.1, when I go into the
 configuration of this particular audio device, the only sound channel available is stereo. The headset is connected to the PC using a USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried downloading the drivers from SADES website -&nbsp;http://www.sades.cc/downlist/?109_1.html - But as I run the setup of the driver, the setup is interrupted and a message saying "SADES 7.1 Sound Effect Gaming Headset does not exist, the installation
 program will be terminated now.".</p>
<p>I've tried running the setup as admin. and also in different compatibility modes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also heard that it might be an issue with the USB port, since some devices don't seem to work properly using 3.0, so I've plugged it into 2.0 with no difference, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, I am currently using Windows 10, may that be the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as I've noticed, the driver setup doesn't seem to be working because it doesn't detect any of SADES'
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">7.1 HEADSETS</span>, But as mentioned previously, the 7.1 Stereo channels are not available for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every comment will be highly appreciated. I really need to get this headset working as best as possible, and as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />

Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Please provide more information to help you better:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some sound card might not support 571 output. Anyway, I suggest you to go to sound settings and select speaker type as 7.1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so you may follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and select <strong>control panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then clicking <strong>
Sound</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Playback tab</strong>, select <strong>Speakers</strong>, and then click
<strong>Configure</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Audio Channels, select which&nbsp;headphones are present in your headphone configuration, and then click
<strong>test</strong>. You should hear a tone play in each speaker. Click <strong>
next</strong>, and then follow the directions to continue the configuration process.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select 7.1 surround in the option and click on <strong>OK.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Your sound card determines which options you see during the speaker configuration process. For example, if you're using a mobile PC with internal speakers, you might only see Stereo in the Audio Channels section.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>Run the Playing audio troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a)&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Type <strong><span>Troubleshooter</span></strong> in the

<p><span>b) Select <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>. Click on <strong>
<span>View All </span></strong>and select <strong><span>Playing audio.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>c) Click <strong><span>Next</span></strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Matt,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please provide more information to help you better:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the sound card? </span>
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some sound card might not support 571 output. Anyway, I suggest you to go to sound settings and select speaker type as 7.1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so you may follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and select <strong>control panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then clicking <strong>
Sound</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Playback tab</strong>, select <strong>Speakers</strong>, and then click
<strong>Configure</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Audio Channels, select which&nbsp;headphones are present in your headphone configuration, and then click
<strong>test</strong>. You should hear a tone play in each speaker. Click <strong>
next</strong>, and then follow the directions to continue the configuration process.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select 7.1 surround in the option and click on <strong>OK.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Your sound card determines which options you see during the speaker configuration process. For example, if you're using a mobile PC with internal speakers, you might only see Stereo in the Audio Channels section.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>Run the Playing audio troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a)&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;Type <strong><span>Troubleshooter</span></strong> in the

<p><span>c) Click <strong><span>Next</span></strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay in response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check the compatibility of the headset with Windows 10. Sometimes it may be the reason that you were not able to work with the headset.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly ensure that the appropriate audio software is installed on the pc.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>I suggest you to plug in any other headset with 7.1 Stereo to this pc to check if that helps. You may also plug in this headset into another pc to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the headset is connecting through the USB port you may also update the Mother board chipset drivers from the OEM website to check if that helps.</span><span><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></span></p>

</p><p>OMG I never thought to check the disk files for the windows 10 drivers I tried everything else running the drivers in compatibility mode and downloading the windows&nbsp;10 drivers from the website but the only thing that worked was the windows 10 drivers on

            That ok. they should say something in the instructions took my few hours to work out. other people on here go on about trying&nbsp; all sort of rubbish compatible mode, sound drivers , etc, etc&nbsp; non of them work they just make it harder to see what the right

    <title>Win 8.1 RT, File Explorer and general configuration personalization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianhoyle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 RT, File Explorer and general configuration personalization</h2>
                    <p>I bought a (Lenovo) Win 8 RT notepad as it seemed great for work on the move: Office included, long battery life etc.&nbsp;But Win 8 RT UI appears inflexible, clumsy and very difficult to use and I find that I can’t see
 how configure it to be useful – so I hope others can help..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Others seem to have problems sorting the Metro ‘tiles’ into useful orderings.&nbsp;<span>
</span>For a notepad with a set of Office apps the ‘Metro’ interface is poor for me – the desktop is much better.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>In terms of the Metro tiles it’s frustrating to put a tile down and find that it’s moved but this is a tiny point.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I commonly use it ‘on the move’ and/or offline.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t want internet access bandwidth tied up refreshing loads of apps which I don’t need and use – hence I’ve deleted all the weather, places and other ‘fluff’ apps.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I now find it better to start and use it in Desktop mode as I want to work with multiple files etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I have several related UI issues.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I’ve tried the RT-Help and the MS Help website but this has no details on these at all.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) The File Explorer is my first problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I can’t set multiple File Explorer icons (on the Start-Metro) or on Taskbar which reference a specific folder and so I’ve got to ripple through and set up a ‘work view’ every time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can this be done?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) I’m usually interested in viewing files – and the names and dates are critical – which are current for specific needs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However when I select “View.. Details”<span>&nbsp; </span>I find that RT randomly changes my ‘View’ – often to large icons – masking the Details I want.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s frustrating to have to go back and re-set the “View” to <span>
&nbsp;</span>“Details” again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ve tried setting the File Window to "All sub-folders" etc but this seems to make no difference to this random change mechanism.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is it possible to control/change/configure/stop this apparently automatic (unwanted) behavior?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) I find that if I ‘mouse-over’ a file it often 'opens' – flipping to one of the ‘Metro-apps’ – so an image file that I accidentally move over will suddenly swap out of Desktop to ‘Metro mode’.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I find that I then can’t close the app/file easily.<span>&nbsp; </span>
My current solution is to find the Windows (lower LHS) ‘Start’ icon, find the desktop icon, and use the Task Manager to shut the unwanted ‘viewer’.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Using a mouse-pad this is tedious, inefficient and very annoying.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example when looking for a photo file to insert in a document, the Photos app pops up linking to all the pictures in the folder! This unwanted action is extremely irritating when working on a document.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can anyone advise how to disable this action, or perhaps implement a ‘double-click’ requirement so I don’t get the unwanted action?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4) I want to see the whole File Explorer (FE) "View.. Detail" – but almost half of the its file data window is taken up with the “File Review” space.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I’m not interested in having a File Review at all – and I would prefer to have the FE space to show all data without having the use the horizontal scroll-bar (with a touch-pad mouse) which working on the move.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Can anyone tell me: i) how to disable File Preview and ii) how to recover the File Preview space in File Explorer if it’s disabled?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5) I find that many apps don’t work in the RT desktop – for example if I make a call using Skype I want to see a set of files and perhaps a document that I'm talking about.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the RT version of Skype appears not to support this – its only works in the Metro format – this is useless for me – can anyone tell me how I can configure
<span>&nbsp;</span>Skype for desktop use in RT – with Taskbar access?</p>

</p>
<p>I think I know what you want so I'll give this&nbsp;a try.&nbsp; I read your 1 and tried this and it worked for me.&nbsp;The quick way is just select&nbsp;the folder in file explorer that you want on Start-Metro,&nbsp;right click on it, and select pin to start.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; The "shortcut"
 way with menu is...&nbsp;I opened "This PC" folder, then in order to get the menu ribbon to change, I opened "Pictures" folder( or any subfolder)&nbsp;and when selecting this subfolder the "new" category of the home menu shows up..&nbsp; Then in the menu ribbon in the category
 "new" I clicked on "New Item" which produces list to choose from.&nbsp; The second one is "shortcut" which I clicked on.&nbsp; The dialogue to make a shortcut&nbsp;lets you&nbsp;browse for any folder you want.&nbsp; Once you've selected it, same thing of right click on it and select
 "pin to start"&nbsp; Is that what you want?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>2) I’m usually interested in viewing files – and the names and dates are critical – which are current for specific needs.<span>&nbsp;

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Had the same problem at first.&nbsp; Seems to have been updated or I set my sensitivities on touchpad better.&nbsp; When I tap touchpad on keyboard on details it is on.&nbsp; then if I move my cursor to hover over any other view options like large icons, then large icons
 appear as if to show me what file explorer would look like if I click on it.&nbsp; Hover over others and the view switches to what I'm hovering over.&nbsp; Move cursor away from ribbon and "details", which I had clicked on, takes precedence again.&nbsp; May have been my
 touchpad settings got fixed.&nbsp; Also in your control panels folder, open the folder "All control panels", and then run "Folder Options" control panel.&nbsp; Click view tab and after making selections, click on use these settings for all folders of this type.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) I find that if I ‘mouse-over’ a file it often 'opens' – flipping to one of the ‘Metro-apps’ – so an image file that I accidentally move over will suddenly swap out of Desktop to ‘Metro mode’.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I find that I then can’t close the app/file easily.<span>&nbsp; </span>My current solution is to find the Windows (lower LHS) ‘Start’ icon, find the desktop icon, and use the Task Manager to shut the unwanted ‘viewer’.<span>&nbsp;

</span>Can anyone advise how to disable this action, or perhaps implement a ‘double-click’ requirement so I don’t get the unwanted action?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Metro apps are closed by swiping in from the top, all the way&nbsp;to bottom of screen&nbsp;while metro app is on display.&nbsp; Run your finger all the way down to the bottom and metro app will shrink and quit running.&nbsp; You also probably know if running metro app, swipe
 in from bottom and see wrench charm.&nbsp; Touch wrench, select "view in desktop" and it will switch to desktop app version.&nbsp; For programs like IE anyway.&nbsp; Also worth looking at your sensitivities on touchpad in the control panel for "Pen and Touch" and also make
 sure in the upper right corner of the Word document window in the title bar area is the "quick access toolbar" If you don't have your "touch/mouse mode" icon available on the toolbar, click the down arrow and select it and make sure it is toggled for mouse
 if you're using a mouse.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4) I want to see the whole File Explorer (FE) "View.. Detail" – but almost half of the its file data window is taken up with the “File Review” space.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I’m not interested in having a File Review at all – and I would prefer to have the FE space to show all data without having the use the horizontal scroll-bar (with a touch-pad mouse) which working on the move.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Can anyone tell me: i) how to disable File Preview and ii) how to recover the File Preview space in File Explorer if it’s disabled?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think what you want is open FE, just above the menu ribbon are the text menus for different ribbon menus.&nbsp; When open FE you see "FILE&nbsp; COMPUTER&nbsp; VIEW" and if in a subfolder you see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FILE &nbsp;HOME &nbsp;SHARE &nbsp;VIEW" either way, click "View" and the left most
 options in the "View" ribbon are Navigation Preview and Details panes.&nbsp; The "Preview Pane" is a toggle, so click and you get the whole FE window for files, click it again and you have preview back.&nbsp; Preview helps me with photos when in detail view.&nbsp; Detail
 view shows photo icon of a metro landscape for all image files, so I usually turn on "Preview pane" which gives me thumbnails if I've turned on thumbnails in the control panel for "Folder Options"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5) I find that many apps don’t work in the RT desktop – for example if I make a call using Skype I want to see a set of files and perhaps a document that I'm talking about.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the RT version of Skype appears not to support this – its only works in the Metro format – this is useless for me – can anyone tell me how I can configure
<span>&nbsp;</span>Skype for desktop use in RT – with Taskbar access?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Haven't tried Skype yet with anyone.&nbsp; Skype me if you want.&nbsp; Chris_top_he_r which is the same for my Hotmail.com account.&nbsp; Most likely they haven't ported Skype for the n non-Intel processor yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be my guess.&nbsp; My understanding is Microsoft wrote
 the code to run windows, office, etc, and some 3rd party people also, for the unique processors in these RTs&nbsp; I</p>
<p>&nbsp;have an Nvidia processor.&nbsp; So you can't go buy any windows compatible program and expect it to run on your RT.&nbsp; It has to be for RT.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The thing that gets me is they updated so much I now can no longer find any way to turn off automatic updates.&nbsp; It has apparently been removed from the menu.&nbsp; I was working on custom icons for metro apps and they update me so much it is impossible to keep
 my settings and customize other things.&nbsp; Without being able to turn off automatic updates they've sort of turned my RT into an iPad which I don't want.&nbsp; Good computing to you.&nbsp;</p>

            Many thanks for your helpful tips - I'll try them.&nbsp; It's a shame that the MS docs have none of this user configuration info - which is limited to things like Screen pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm realizing that Win 8 RT has designed as an iPad-killer - but it is being used on super-lightweight laptops, such as the Lenovo that I bought at a massive discount - perhaps it was cheap because it isn't very useful.&nbsp; However, it is supplied with a full
 MS-Office set, including Outlook - all of which can be used seamlessly on Metro or on the Desktop. &nbsp; A problem when using it in screen/keyboard mode is that using the touchscreen is awkward when using the mouse-pad.&nbsp; Often (on my Lenovo) swiping up doesn't
 work first time.&nbsp; Its quicker to go to top LHS get the desktop back and close apps with the Task Manager - yuk but true!<br />
<br />
In general this is part of the major tension - Apple control both software and hardware - but MS provide OS software to anyone who wants to license it.&nbsp; You're right of course that the ARM chip-sets require ported code.&nbsp; At present there are many apps for Win
 8 RT but they're mostly toys and games.&nbsp; You mention the Skype appln for example which has been 'ported' but not is its standard form.&nbsp; The Win RT Skype app is completely different to the PC desktop app and can only be used in full or half screen mode in the
 Metro (Pad) interface.&nbsp; Its practically useless when you're using it in conjunction with a few other apps on a call where you want to talk about projects, etc whose details is on a few files (need to see File Explorer).&nbsp; So I deleted the Skype app after the
 first hopeless trial - if I'm using my Win 8 RT I now simply use the phone.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The major problem in a nutshell for MS - do they intend RT to be a flexible new platform or is it just a competitor for the iPad and iPhone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent cash on mine in the expectation that is was a super lightweight, fast and long battery laptop that I could
 use for work on the move: it has a full size keyboard, good size screen etc., which is much bigger than an iPad.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The ultimate 'bottom line' for MS if they're providing the RT OS for this wide range of platforms is that relevant apps should work approproately either in Metro (for 'Pad, touch screen) mode or in Desktop (Taskbar) use via a mouse-pad .&nbsp; So I still have a
 major residual problem.&nbsp; Although the MS Office suite do this - none of the associated utilities do this - as touched upon yesterday - if I do open the Photo app intentionally when in Desktop it opens in Metrol and takes over the screen - yuk again!<br />
<br />
This is really poor design - something that we never see from Apple.<br />

            <p>Wow you taught me something else.&nbsp; I was informed swiping in from the top of screen and pushing metro app all the way down to bottom of screen closed the app.&nbsp; After messing with your advice on task manager I see they are still taking memory and I have to
 close with task manager to free it up.&nbsp; No wonder I was slowing down.&nbsp; Thanks for that tip!!&nbsp; There must be a better way.&nbsp; Anyone here know?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Played with photos and docs for a while since I plan to do work on docs and emails with photos like you are doing.&nbsp; First tried opening .jpg with Word since you're using Word.&nbsp; It worked great.&nbsp; resizable photo in a Word window next to the Word doc window.&nbsp;
 Tried it a few times.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Went back to &nbsp;note my steps and cannot replicate in any way.&nbsp; So...if you right click on a photo, select "open with" and don't choose a program from the ones listed but go to the bottom and select "Choose default program" , then
 use dialogue to choose a program from that list.&nbsp; Also in that dialogue make sure checkbox is checked for use this for all .jpg files.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried "Windows Photo Viewer" which is not a metro app so stays in desktop mode.&nbsp; I will experiment with Adobe Content
 Viewer and maybe others that I downloaded from the Windows Store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget that once you've turned off the Preview Pane in FE, to stretch out your columns to utilize the freed up space, and/or list new columns.&nbsp; I think you already knew that, just making sure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm with you on what you discussed.&nbsp; However, I cannot complain that I have a computer with Office installed on it for almost the price of Office.&nbsp; Keeps me going.</p>

<p>I tried it just now.&nbsp; I hit Start to get metro. App tiles.&nbsp; Then tapped headphones for Xbox music app and it launched and displayed my albums to listen to.&nbsp; Then swiped in from the top all the way to bottom.&nbsp; I tried a few ways of holding it at the bottom,
 and anywhere from 2-5 seconds.&nbsp; I couldn't get it to do any thing different than I've always seen.&nbsp; It shrinks during swipe down into about a 1 inch by 2 inch screen of my album screen shot and if I hold it down there it just disappears after about 5 seconds.&nbsp;
 When it disappears I have my metro tiles left behind it with the icon for the headphones and it would appear that the Xbox music app is closed.&nbsp; However, as "Brian pointed out above, if I go to the&nbsp;desktop and&nbsp;launch Task Manager, I can see Xbox music app
 is still running in memory taking up about 54 MB.&nbsp; If I do this with several metro apps without rebooting, I lose quite bit of memory unless I go to Task Manager and "End Task" for the involved Metro apps.&nbsp; Have you tried looking at Task Manager yourself for
 these types of instances?&nbsp; Maybe it is because Brian and I have RTs with the non-Intel processor??</p>

            Hmmm.&nbsp; If I close an app by the method I mentioned and immediately open Task Manager, the app will show in TM for about 7-8 seconds and then disappear without me doing anything.&nbsp; I tried it with several apps including Xbox music and it worked for all of
 them.&nbsp; So when you swipe down and it shrinks at the bottom of the screen, it just disappears after a few seconds, rather than flipping over to the icon?&nbsp; I wonder if it depends on what device you're using.&nbsp; I'm using a Surface 2 with Windows 8.1 RT.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm
 certainly no expert but I would think all 8.1 RT tablets would behave the same.<br />

<p>Fairly strange.&nbsp; That's what I was doing, but it didn't work.&nbsp; However, this morning when I hold it at the bottom&nbsp;of the&nbsp;screen, it changes back to the&nbsp;Metro icon in a not very pretty image flash, rather than a smooth animated flip.&nbsp; Who cares though, since
 it is truly closed now.&nbsp; I must have been upgraded again, or the Surface Windows 8.1 RT police raided my Surface last night.&nbsp; Kudos to them.</p>
<p><br />
They upgraded me to a point that they took away my menu option to change upgrade settings.&nbsp; Any one else?&nbsp; When I used to launch the Windows Upgrade control panel, there was a list of things to click down the left margin that included "Change settings" which
 is no longer there.&nbsp; We'll see how permanent upgrade status goes I guess.&nbsp;</p>

            Here is a question for you. So Microsoft wants you to support them, but they won't let you download music you've PURCHASED unless you pay a monthly fee? Does that honestly makes sense to anyone? Please fix this immediately. Every other company that sells
 music has this option. I really need to go work for Microsoft because I just don't think you guys have a clue what you are doing. Google allows you to play back music your upload FOR FREE. Amazon allows you to play back music you upload FOR FREE!!. Microsoft
 wants $10 and you can't even download music you've purchased. If this doesn't get fixed soon I'm going to contact my credit card company to get my money back from Microsoft.

            Just how I feel too. I have downloaded an album that won't even play offline. And now I'm supposed to sign up at a tenner a month just to re-download it? This is a joke.&nbsp;Something must have gone wrong with the download so why should I have to pay to put

            So what about the items that I have purchased before.&nbsp; I'm still not seeing an answer to that.&nbsp; I paid money and all I want to do is listen to what I have purchased but now I cannot.&nbsp; I have to have a Music pass to listen to what I have purchased?

            Nope. Doesn't make any sense at all to me. I have a downloaded album I paid for which appears to have become corrupted, and it seems I have to pay to re-download it. In British parlance, that's ****.

            <p>It has just taken me 3 days of messing around with Microsoft's different support people to be able to buy an album in the first place.&nbsp; All it would tell me is Error 80151200 and apparently that's a secret.&nbsp; Shhhh..... don't tell anyone what it means!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually (like I said above, after 3 days of being messed around) I got it fixed and was finally allowed to buy an album from xbox music.&nbsp; How privileged am I?&nbsp; Actually being able to pay Microsoft £10 so I owned an album of many songs to listen to on
 my phone whenever I want..... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Err.... Well actually, no!&nbsp; You see, it only downloaded 5 songs (to be fair it downloaded them twice) and then stopped!&nbsp; There's no option to make it try again.&nbsp; If i run a search for that album it just appears with the five songs that are on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to recap, I've wasted 3 days and £10!&nbsp; All for nought!&nbsp; It would've been so much faster (like 2 days and 23 hours faster) to jump in my car and drive to the nearest store selling CD's and purchase said CD, drive home, load it onto the computer in iTunes
 and then sync'ed it to my Windows phone.&nbsp; Because we all know the WP8 does go looking for itunes music and transfers it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope when you're reading this you can sense my level of frustration (I seriously doubt you will, but try anyway) because right about now I'm thinking that it's time to retrieve my SIM card and then hurl this pathetic attempt at a phone across the room
 and put my SIM back in an iPhone because, and this is what will kill the WindowsPhone off... they work!!!&nbsp; They do what they're supposed to do!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You buy a piece of music, you are allowed to download it and play it.&nbsp; You are not told that after buying it, you should subscribe to some ridiculous service that you do not want or need if you actually want to listen to it!!!&nbsp; I do not want xbox music pass
 I just want the music I have paid for.&nbsp; Do you get that?&nbsp; Can you understand that this is not being unreasonable?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Will let's try this to help you understand.&nbsp; Imagine you go to a restaurant and order the steak, they ask you for the money up front, you
 pay them, they return with a plate with nothing on it and then tell you that although you now own the steak, if you actually want to eat your steak you need to subscribe to their "Food Eating Pass Service".&nbsp; Would you think that is fair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me, if you will, to make a suggestion or two.&nbsp; Firstly, why don't you get this message and all the other complaints up to someone in authority (ideally somebody very senior who actually cares about the company) so they can see exactly how shockingly
 bad the WindowsPhone8 really is.&nbsp; Secondly, get someone who is in authority to nip down to their nearest Apple Store and buy an iPhone, set it up and see how easy and intuitive it is to use.&nbsp; Honestly, they will be totally blown away!&nbsp; Stick your details in
 ONCE AND ONLY ONCE and you can buy apps/music/video's and I know you won't believe me but honestly it's true, everything is done on the phone itself.... Yes that's right, you don't have to visit a myriad of different web sites to accept one set of terms and
 another for a different set.&nbsp; Just click accept on the phone when it pops up and you're good to go.&nbsp; I know!!!&nbsp; Amazing!&nbsp; Can you believe it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now get the guy who has just had his sock blown off by how easy it was to use an iphone to go down to the WP8 development team and show them then make them do the same to this usless piece of rubbish that your currently flogging!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on, however, I fear I would only be wasting my keystrokes as I figure the people with the authority in the company to actually do anything are so insulated from these problems they will never get to hear about it and the one's that do hear about
 it are just in a job and couldn't give a damn about the company.&nbsp; Such a shame.&nbsp; One wonder's if there is an element of deliberate sabotage going on within Microsoft.&nbsp; Don't get me started about upgrade paths for former SBS clients.</p>

<p><strong>I DO NOT have the "Download songs" option turned on in the preferences</strong></p>

 repair it blah blah, and 'you can always download these songs later from Explore.' "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come to find out after the reset all the songs I had purchased were gone from the library, as stated.&nbsp;The number of songs in my library dropped to show only those that were in my OneDrive. Going to the Collection and choosing "Purchased" under show music
 showed 0, as in&nbsp;zero songs.&nbsp;Firing up&nbsp;the Asus tablet I saw that all my&nbsp;songs were&nbsp;there, but then disappeared after xbox music completed its sign in process.&nbsp;<em>This means the&nbsp;collection is synced across your devices. If you mess it up somewhere, it will
 mess it up&nbsp;everwhere you use xbox music.</em>&nbsp;"Explore" does absolutely nothing as far as restoring, I think that is for music pass users. After screwing around on the internet for hours trying to find a solution.&nbsp; Piecing together stuff led me to this solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a PC with enough space to download your entire purchased collection to make this work the best way.&nbsp;If you don't have that&nbsp;you will have to piecemeal&nbsp;across your machines and wait for them all to sync.&nbsp;Luckily for me, I only have about 30 songs.
 Be advised, this process kind of sucks but it is the only way I could get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This only works with music purchased from the xbox music store. If you don't remember all your purchases, head to commerce.microsoft.com and log in.&nbsp; Choose "payment and billing."&nbsp; You should see your purchases from this year. To see more, click "purchase
 history" and you will be able to select the year.&nbsp; Stupidly, you cannot download them from this interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once you know the song you want, go into xbox music and search for it (you can also put an album name in here if you like, so all the songs from that album show up, but as far as I can tell you still have to download them one by one - PITA!)&nbsp; It will
 tell you it found zero in your collection, and x number in the "Catalog."&nbsp; Go to the catalog results (this is the Store) and find your track.
<strong>The track must be the exact one you purchased, not a variant.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Swipe the track to select it (left).&nbsp; A bar will appear at the bottom of the screen with options.&nbsp; There should be an option to "download."&nbsp; Choose and go. You will see "1 file downloading" in the upper right of the screen.&nbsp;The file is now stored in your
 library under "xbox purchased music."&nbsp; You can check the file location by selecting the file in your actual collection (NOT the store selection) and holding.&nbsp; The contextual menu will allow you to see "Properties" and the file location is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Here's the cool part, after the download completes the file will be added to your "music in the cloud" which means that it will be available on other devices as a streaming file, no need to download there.&nbsp;You can tell it is streaming by seeing an icon
 to the left (((0))).&nbsp;If you wanted to, on those devices you could turn on the "download" option in preferences, and it will download to other devices automatically.&nbsp; Or, you can individually select them and use the download option there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tested this procedure across all my devices.&nbsp; It does work. Once you download everything, I recommend moving all your files to your OneDrive, which has streaming and whatnot built in and is automatically available to every device that can access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally if you just want to download a the file from a purchased song that does already appear in your library, just swipe to select the song and choose the download option at the bottom. On Windows Phone just go to your songs list and click the "select"
 icon at the bottom, once you select a song a small downward pointing arrow will appear at the end of the song name, just click to download. Given that this works I am not entirely sure what xbox music pass actually does?&nbsp; Does anyone have it who can tell me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>My story is similar to this. I bought one album through Groove Music and 2 weeks and 5 or more tech calls, remote assistance etc., and still can't download to my computer. I am not purchasing music that I can't copy, play or store where I want to. I've been
 trying 2 days to get a refund. MS Customer Service really sucks, bops you around all over the place, hold and hold and hold some more, and you still never get any results!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also appears that the computer I purchased, basically belongs to MS because its not possible to remove THEIR software that I don't use like OneDrive, Edge, Groove Music, any MS software cannot be uninstalled. Tech savvy folks can use powershell and write
 code to delete them, but why should we have to do it? Why can't I customize my computer anymore to suite my needs? I don't like windows 10, and just realized MS gives you a time limit now on reverting back and I missed it! They've never done this before. I've
 been using windows since 3.1 version. I would go back to XP in a heartbeat. Or better still, I started in computers with a MAC, even Linux is looking good.</p>
<p>Should have been leery of a FREE upgrade. Oh yes, they deactivated Windows Media Player so you have to buy rip and burn software and in it's place they gave us Groove Music?? It reorganized my music and left me with many files that are labeled: .nomedia,
 apparently overwrote mp3 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to my Amazon account today and downloaded an album I had purchased in 2005! Every song I've ever purchased is there and downloadable. When MS straightens out their chaotic customer service and make the store a little more user friendly, perhaps
 I will come back.</p>

<h2>            Problems with startup on Acer Aspire 7551-7422</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire 7551-7422. My problem is when I try to boot it up it gets to the Loading Windows screen and then just freezes. The only way I can get it to boot up completely is to hit F2 at the appropriate time and tell it to run a memory diagnostic
 scan, after which it continues booting up just fine. There is always an error in event view that I can't find any information on. " The embedded controller (EC) did not respond within the specified timeout period. This may indicate that there is an error in
 the EC hardware or firmware or that the BIOS is accessing the EC incorrectly. You should check with your computer manufacturer for an upgraded BIOS. In some situations, this error may cause the computer to function incorrectly." Source: ACPI, Event Id: 13.
 My bios is the most up to date version according to the Acer support site.

<h2>            Speech Recognition in Australia&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know (or have an idea) when Kinect Speech Recognition will be added in Australia?
</p>
<p>Dunno about the rest of you but I was kinda yawning during the X-Box E3 briefing considering so much of what they were talking about was Kinect Speech intergration into games like Mass Effect 3, that's great... but doesn't phase me seeings as we don't have
 it yet! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sick of getting left behind by Microsoft in Australia!</p>

<p>It has been ready since release. When we did the beta for Kinect with the new dash, we had an app where we were required to provide voice samples by reciting phrases shown on the screen, such as "sit girl", and "xbox off" or "fast forward".
</p>
<p>It works perfectly, and I've never had any issues. I have a pretty thick aussie accent too (which my wife describes as &nbsp;"really occa") so they can't say that it doesn't work since there were plenty of Aussies who were in the Kinect beta and contributed to
 the voice data collection. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be too worried about not having support in games anyway. Even if we don't have support in the dash, so long as we are using a supported language (such as English) then we should still be able to play the games using voice. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> buffalo law  say:</h3>
<h2>            Okidata c5300 Windows 10 PCL6 Driver Not Printing</h2>
                    I have an old Okidata c5300n printer that still functions fine, except, I can't get it to print under windows 10. &nbsp;I have loaded the Windows Update Okidata PCL6 driver. &nbsp;It finds the printer on the network, seems to be able to get all of the information
 on the printer (i.e., it has a duplexer, but no additional trays), and generally seems connected. &nbsp;But, when I try to print, nothing prints, the job goes to the queue and disappears like it made it to the printer, the printer even spins up and sounds like
 it is ready to print, but nothing. &nbsp;My old computer can still print just fine. &nbsp;Is it possible I need a firmware upgrade because my printer does not support PCL6. &nbsp;I cannot find any other drivers or any support on what is needed. &nbsp;The only information I can
 find from Okidata is that the printer is supported under windows 10 with a Windows update driver. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Anup, thank you for your reply.&nbsp; While the actions you suggested didn’t fix my problem, I have figured out what I did wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, I did not see the correct printer driver because I missed clicking on a button to get to the “windows update” print drivers and was only seeing the print drivers included with the basic Windows 10 installation.&nbsp; I figured this out when I uninstalled
 the OkiData PCL6 driver intending to reinstall the driver to see if that my fix the problem and in the process realizing I missed a critical “windows update” button on the way.&nbsp; To help out others, below is a list (from the very beginning so be patient) of
 the steps necessary to install the print driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Open the Control Panel (right click on the Windows start button on the lower left corner and select Control Panel or search for Control Panel in the search text box)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; From the Control Panel select Devices and Printers (it may take a little bit to pull this up)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; From Devices and Printers select Add a Printer from the menu near the top left hand corner of the window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; From the Add a Printer pop up window, after done searching and not finding, your older printer, select “The printer that I want isn’t listed”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; For older printers like the OkiData c5300n, select “My printer is a little older. Help me find it.” And click next.&nbsp; For me, Windows found my OkiData printer on the network at this point.&nbsp; I would assume other older printers and/or USB or parallel port
 connected printers may also be found at this point.&nbsp; Once you see the printer you want, you can click the Stop button and continue on from there.&nbsp; Note, if yours is a network connected printer, you will need to ensure that all the networking is set up correctly
 for your computer to see the printer on the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; At this point is where I made my mistake.&nbsp; The initial list of OkiData drivers I saw included several dot matrix drivers and the OkiData PCL6 driver.&nbsp; Thinking the process had gone to the Microsoft driver database already, I selected the OkiData PCL6
 driver that did not work properly.&nbsp; What I should have done is noticed the button marked “Update Windows” (or something like that, I’m doing this from memory), which will download many more drivers to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7)&nbsp; From the new drivers, select OkiData as the manufacturer and select one of the drivers listed for the c5300 printer (I actually installed both the MS PCL driver and the MS PS—Post Script—drivers and installed two printers for my one device, both drivers
 have printed correctly, so you may choose the protocol you prefer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8)&nbsp; Install the c5300 driver of your choice, follow the instructions, print the text page if you like or test with your own print job, and you are done.</p>

    <title>Inadequate low battery warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandy_hsb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inadequate low battery warning</h2>
                    When my battery levels reach low/critical levels I either get no warning or I miss it, leading to unexpected shutdowns. I have checked the levels at which the warnings are activated and have set an audible warning to be issued, but either the audible warning
 doesn't happen or it&nbsp;isn't loud enough (e.g. if I'm in a noisy environment or playing music). I need a clearly visible warning window to pop up. How do I get that to happen?

    <title>No signal to monitor. No kinect or controller input. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the lexiconical  say:</h3>
<h2>            No signal to monitor. No kinect or controller input.</h2>
                    
<p>Obviously, I'm having trouble with my Xbox One.<br />
<br />
I took the hdmi cable out the back to borrow it for a few minutes and plugged it back in when I was done. When I turn it on next I get no signal errors on my monitor. My kinect won't turn on when the console does, I absent mindedly pressed the 'connect' button
 on the back of my controller thinking what's up and now it won't reconnect.</p>
<p><br />
I wonder if it's updating, but with no way of interacting with the console I'm stumped.</p>
<p><br />
I've tried a separate hdmi cable in different ports on my monitor. I've tried leaving the console alone for an hour to see if it would update but no joy there either. I checked with a friend and it doesn't say I'm online while my console is on. And finally
 I've tried turning on the console with my router turned off but still the same problems occur.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey Lex! Have you performed a hard reset of your console? This fixes a large number of issues. I would suggest an extra step for you - disconnect your HDMI cable first. Now, hold the power sensor for 8 seconds, let go &amp; wait for the power brick to show a
 steady orange light. Now, unplug your power from the wall. Re-connect your HDMI first, then plug your console back in and power up. I'm thinking, when setting up the console, they recommend plugging all cables in first, before power, so it might help to do
 it this way.</p>

<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Since everything is in Arabic, how do I follow your instructions.&nbsp; I do not speak Arabic.&nbsp; Maybe you can create a picture with the screen in Arabic so I can find where tools is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why the language was changed from English to Arabic when I did not do anything to change it?&nbsp; Is this a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I have exactly the same issue. The language on Skype changed to what appears to be Polish, but there are no languages except English on the android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This sure appears to be a bug in Skype changing the language without anything happening on the base Android OS language...and worse, not having any means to change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't tried de-install and re-install as there are a lot of contacts I do not want to lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Went ahead and just selected Uninstall for the Skype app.</p>
<p>Then after convincing Google Play it was no longer installed by ONLY downloading it from the phone in question, managed to re-install it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The menus are now back in English and the contacts are preserved. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The base Android language setting had absolutely nothing to do with it

<h2>            High cpu usage&#58; windows-media-player and windows-media-network-sharing-service temp fix</h2>
                    <p><br />
High cpu usage for windows-media-player and&nbsp;windows-media-network-sharing-service because these apps cannot handle certain media file&nbsp;types, such as&nbsp;Audacity project files - bxxxxx.au files,&nbsp;which are 'automatically' processed by these two related applications.</p>
<p>Temp Solution-1 - delete all Audacity project files *.au files (e.g.- b00000.au),<br />
&nbsp;or the&nbsp;other troublesome files - see them listed in windows-media-player library: 'Other media'</p>
<p>** OR **</p>
<p>Temp Solution-2 (if *.au files or Other-media files are needed)<br />
Disable wmpnetwk.exe - windows-media-network-sharing-service, and set properties for file CurrentDatabase_372.wmdb to read only<br />
&nbsp;details:<br />
&nbsp; reducing&nbsp;high cpu for wmpnetwk.exe - windows-media-network-sharing-service...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop and then Disable wmpnetwk.exe - windows media network sharing service -&nbsp; can be stopped and disabled in 'Services' accessed from windows 'Task Manager'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (note&nbsp;set back to autostart-delayed after ms-fix arrives!)</p>
<p>&nbsp; reducing high cpu for windows-media-player...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Properties for file:&nbsp;CurrentDatabase_372.wmdb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; check 'read only'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (note: remove check-mark 'read-only' when microsoft sends a fix for this problem; e.g. media-player-update!)</p>

<p>Hi Vince,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us resolve your concern regarding frequent reboot. We suggest that you follow the Startup Repair steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Turn off your laptop.</li><li>&nbsp;Turn on your laptop. As soon as you see the <strong>Windows logo with the spinning dots</strong>, press and hold down the power button until your laptop turns off. Do this process
<strong>twice</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Turn on your laptop for the third time, and let it load.</li><li>&nbsp;It should give you the message: <strong>Preparing Automatic Repair</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;On the next screen that would appear, click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Go to <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Wait for the repair to finish.</li></ol>
<p>

    <title>Why does Windows 10 identify my network as &#34;Network 4&#34; instead - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Windows 10 identify my network as &#34;Network 4&#34; instead of its proper name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 computers connected to a router via Ethernet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the "Network and Sharing Center" page the Windows 8.1 computer properly identifies the network as a Private Network named "HOME-D94B." &nbsp; On the "Network and Sharing Center" page the Windows 10 computer identifies the network as a Private Network named
 "Network 4."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 computer can connect to the Internet and see other computers in the network, but I'm having "Homegroup" issues with the computer - probably caused when it got converted from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 - which need to be corrected, so I thought
 I'd start the process by asking about this obvious difference between the two computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA.</p>

            <p>There's no real shared "network name". &nbsp;Any computer that joins the wifi or network will come up with it's own name there, it's more of a local profile that remembers the topology and settings for that network "location". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more important bit is that all computers say "private network" there. &nbsp;If it doesn't, most sharing/homegroup features won't run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I'd run the built-in homegroup troubleshooter diagnostic tool from each computer, one at a time. &nbsp;The tool is actually just a collection of PowerShell commands that resets and re-initializes all the Homegroup components, network location privacy
 settings, and re-broadcasts the discovery packets to the network. &nbsp;If you're really nerdy, you can even

            <p>Commander Keen:&nbsp; (that's a blast from the past!):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; It didn't seem like the naming of the network really was important to the bigger problem of "HomeGroup" issues, but I was curious as the other computer on the network - a laptop connecting via WiFi, also upgraded from Win 8.1 to Win
 10 and having the same Homegroup issues - does properly identify the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the homegroup troubleshooter on both Win 10 machines without success but haven't tried it on the remaining Win 8.1 machine.&nbsp; I'll give that a whirl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Can I run Quicken 3 on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any way I can transfer an older version of quicken 3 from my desk top computer to my new laptop. I emailed quicken and they no longer support quicken 3 and said to buy the newer version 11.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>No, for two reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Old versions of Quicken won't run under Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. With very rare exceptions you can never transfer a program from one</div>
<div>computer to another. You need to reinstall the program on the new</div>
<div>computer from its original media.</div>

<p>It depends on many factors, including your system architecture (32,64) and your version of windows (home premium, professional, ultimate, enterprise).</p>
<p><strong>If you have a 32 bit operating system</strong> , you might be able to get by using the compatibility mode settings.</p>
<p>To use compatibility mode, follow these steps.</p>
<p>Installed but program will not run:</p>
<p>Right Click the icon of the program&gt; Go to properties&gt; go to the compatibility tab&gt; select from the options that you know will work to run the program.</p>
<p>Installation will not run:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the <span>Start</span> button, clicking<span>Control Panel</span> , clicking
<span>Programs</span> , and then clicking Run programs made for previous versions of windows</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the wizard, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The wizard is not designed to work on programs that have
 an .msi file name extension.</p>
<p><strong>If you're running a 64 bit operating system</strong> , and are running Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise, and you can verify that Quicken 3 works in Windows XP, then you can run it using Windows XP mode for Windows 7.</p>
