<p>Hi Taha,</p>
<p>Do you mean that you have customized task status column in the form in InfoPath and you need to publish the change to the task list? To do it, click the
<strong>File</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt; <strong>Quick Publish</strong>. You may refer to the following link for more detailed information:<br />

<p>hi vincent,</p>
<p>i have a request form based on <strong>infopath</strong> &amp; <strong>sp 365</strong> site.</p>
<p>beside a request form there is a <strong>work flow</strong>, requests are approve and reject (ootb) through workflow task list in sharepoint site contents as image below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ae99d495-df07-4ad2-a09f-4f854cc1a6d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dae99d495-df07-4ad2-a09f-4f854cc1a6d6" /></a></p>
<p>but i need same approve reject functionality on info path form. (example if user click on approve button work flow go to in another stage)</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7248199e-58ee-4750-ae47-a9f5f977bb86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7248199e-58ee-4750-ae47-a9f5f977bb86" /></a></p>

    <title>IB 16188 an Arduous Acquisition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drew1903  say:</h3>
<h2>            IB 16188 an Arduous Acquisition</h2>
                    This was an unusual scenario (for me)&nbsp;but, maybe, <em>you </em>can or may relate.<br />
<br />
Yesterday new Build 16188 came available to Fast Track.&nbsp; Over several hours, maybe 9, it tried countless times.&nbsp; Kept looking as it was proceeding only to repeat. Retry, countless times.&nbsp; Running Trouble-shooter, no change.&nbsp; Researching Error #, also, to no
 avail (Generic 80070002 (sic)).<br />
<br />
If you encounter this ^<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
<br />
Just do precisely what it says... Retry (button)&nbsp;&amp; "try again, later".&nbsp; Anyway, caveat here is simply stick w/ it.&nbsp; Just keep&nbsp;doing it over &amp; over... it will eventually decide to go.&nbsp; Don't give up, look how long it took for me.&nbsp; I have been working w/ 10 since
 Day 1 and never saw a new Build struggle like this one.&nbsp; I can only reckon it was so many trying to grab it simultaneously.<br />
Patience, Grasshopper LOL&nbsp; ... and persistence, persevere.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope my wee tale helps someone, maybe.<br />
<br />
BTW, 16188 is what is being used here &amp; now.&nbsp; It is noticeably fast &amp; snappy.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

(And, please, I am Drew without the suffix numbers, thanks)<br />
<br />
Like I said/suggested, just keep trying, over &amp; over... wait a bit &amp; try, again... eventually :)<br />
<br />
Of everything I tried &amp; all I researched, it is what finally worked.&nbsp; I stuck at it (attempts) until it went.<br />

 for it? Anyone have any idea on how to fix this? It's an excel 2010 worksheet on Windows 7 system with form control checkbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help in advance. It's driving my users crazy!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>OK Let me give it a try. Pls follow the instructions as given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all - take a backup of your file (just incase if you need to roll-back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the first check-box</p>
<p>2. Now keeping the CTRL button pressed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very carefully go on clicking (left click) each check-box (until all the check boxes are clicked).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this very slowly - else there are chances that suddenly all your selection may
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get lost and you may have to start all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When all the check boxes are selected ( you will observe that all the check boxes are selected )</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; release the CTRL button.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time you would also observe that a new menu-item "FORMAT" would have come-up on RIBBON.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pls see the image below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/454226f6-581d-4424-9c3b-ad5bce5bb694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/454226f6-581d-4424-9c3b-ad5bce5bb694" height="247" width="604" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This 'FORMAT' would have appeared as soon as you would have selected the first check-box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you might have not noticed it at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally this "FORMAT" menu-item is not there until one selects an object. Pls see the image below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8712b5a7-e819-4200-a8c1-80f8faf6a69a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8712b5a7-e819-4200-a8c1-80f8faf6a69a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When you have selected all the check-boxes and have released the CTRL button, after that -</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the 'FORMAT' menu-item on the Ribbon and then select the GROUP button (pls see the image below).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eed781b7-d87d-4731-afe7-16ae3e4a2429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eed781b7-d87d-4731-afe7-16ae3e4a2429" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's all - all your check-boxes are now 'grouped'.&nbsp; You can select the entire group and move it to the place
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above screen-shot, I have grouped 8 check-boxes to show you as an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The grouping of the check-boxes does not have any impact on the 'tick' and 'un-tick' functionality of the check-boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope you find this Helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that the key you entered is the 25-character key (commonly known as a 5 by 5) that you found in the product packaging. If you bought the product several years ago, the 5 by 5 could be typed in directly to the activation screen. However, in the
 newer style packaging, you have to enter the PIN (which can actually be 26 or 27 characters) into a web site which will redeem it for a 25-character key, that you can then enter in the activation screen. As part of th redemption process you'll also set up
 a Microsoft Account to retrieve the product key in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you remember setting up a Microsoft Account when you originally installed the 2011 product, head to https://office.com/MyAccount to retrieve the 5 by 5 key so you can reinstall and activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can go to https://ofice.com/setup, create a new Microsoft Account and enter the PIN from your packaging. Now, you might get an error at this stage saying that the PIN has already been redeemed, but there should be help and support links
 on that page that will help you to recover your product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this is a little confusing. Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you're using Internet Explorer, not Edge, the Send page feature will only work if you have an email program installed and set as default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default e-mail program must be installed on the computer- e.g.Outlook Express, Windows Mail (Vista), Windows Live Mail, Thunderbird, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot use a web-based e-mail service as the default. On Windows 10, you can't&nbsp;use the mail app as the default when using Internet Explorer. Edge can send a page via the Mail App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail while out of its&nbsp;Support Lifecycle&nbsp;is popular. There are links to archived installers on this page</p>

</p>
<p>Thunderbird is another popular e-mail program&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you've seen on the other computer, Microsoft Office Outlook can be set as the default e-mail program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing an e-mail program, verify that you have a default e-mail program set from Control Panel&gt; Default programs&gt; Set program access and computer defaults&gt; Custom&gt; click the down arrow.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the cause of this issue, we'd like to know the following information.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your Internet Explorer's configuration prior to this issue?
</li><li>When was the last time you are able to use the <strong>Send page by email</strong> option?

<p>
</p><p>One possible cause of this issue is the add-ons installed to your Internet Explorer. For the meantime, we recommend resetting your Internet Explorer to have it return to the state when it was first installed. For instructions, please follow the steps in

<h2>            Fill down formula in a query table</h2>
                    <p>I have used external data queries for several years, connecting to a variety of data sources, but&nbsp;most frequently to SQL server 2005&nbsp;using MS&nbsp;Query and ODBC.&nbsp;Anyway, in Excel 2007, when I refresh my queries and the data range adds new rows to the query table,&nbsp;the
 formluas do not fill down past the previous extent of the data range.&nbsp;These are not external queries converted from a previous version of Excel; I built them in Excel 2007, and the issue persists across multiple workbooks. To answer the inevitble suggestions:</p>
<p>1) The formulas are definitely in the query tables, not adjacent.</p>
<p>2) "Extend data range formats and formulas" is enabled in the advanced tab of Excel options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found threads on other sites where users had similar problems, but have not seen a satisfactory solution or even a good response to their inquiries. Any ideas?

<h2>            Partial match with conditional formatting.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i need help with matching and highlighting the result.</p>
<p>I have two sets of table. I need to match words in column&nbsp;A with the words in column D.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d4fd5c0-531c-416a-9b8a-c68822f89162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d4fd5c0-531c-416a-9b8a-c68822f89162" /></a></p>

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how i want to achieve. I need the second table to show me which of its data were matched/selected by column A.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/079751c9-9d15-40e8-863b-287ba3182ce4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/079751c9-9d15-40e8-863b-287ba3182ce4" /></a></p>
<p>Since column D has some more text other than what I am looking for, I guess I need to do partial match.
</p>
<p>I am in no way an expert in excel, so I need step by step guide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will greatly appreciate any help!</p>

<p>Hello Jen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If you use remote unlock, your logon PIN will be protected by Windows instead of your device's security system. When you signed-in to
</span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/devices</a> and selected
<strong>Lock</strong>, there should be a pop-up window as shown on the screenshot below and an email is sent once your phone is locked:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the <span>PIN is still your deviceâ€™s security system. If so, try again locking the phone remotely.</span></p>

<h2>            Importing Favorites from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I recently performed a reset on my PC as it was getting unstable.&nbsp; I was able to recover Internet Explorer with the matching favorites in my favorites bar but it was the old version.&nbsp; And I have saved the new version in OneDrive and performed an import hoping
 to replace the ones I currently have.&nbsp; But then when I performed it, it seemed that nothing happened.&nbsp; I wonder then, where could have it been saved since I couldn't find it in this PC/Documents/&nbsp; directory.</p>

            Yes, that's exactly what I did and just to make sure, I did it again. &nbsp;But then, nothing happened as my old favorites are still there. &nbsp;I was expecting it to override my old favorites.

<p>Well, I actually performed another reset as it would seem a couple of files I downloaded have been starting to cause instability.&nbsp; And then when I got Internet Explorer and was about to try importing my favourites saved in OneDrive, I donâ€™t anymore see the
 html files in File Explorer.&nbsp; It seems that my post alerted the MS guys hehe.&nbsp; They seem to be insistent with using MS Edge.&nbsp; Well, I would just have to delete a couple instead of importing it.</p>
<p>I just donâ€™t get why MS has to decide to create a new browser Edge from Internet Explorer which has been long established.&nbsp; And Iâ€™ve been so used to it.&nbsp; I tried MS Edge but then itâ€™s not at all user-friendly unlike Internet Explorer, where I could easily
 self-study it given the vast menu.&nbsp; In MS Edge, the fonts are too large, and a few descriptive menu.</p>

            <p>Thanks Joseph but I was actually doing an upgrade to Win 10 so the process you describe is not what was actually happening. After install the Outlook account and One Drive were already set up but all contacts and other mail accounts had been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up having to do a hard reset to force the backup restore. It took about two hours and multiple reboots before everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would have been nice if the upgrade process didn't necessitate this.</p>

<p>Ok, so the much awaited belle update is out, however the music player somehow STILL does not sort by album title properly. So here we are, with more than 10 gigs of music all scattered in the music library with album artists names and what not..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So guys, since NOKIA is not going to fix the issue. Can someone please...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A. Give us a hack to get the music player back to pre Anna version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B. Give everybody a workaround to SORT BY ALBUM before we pull our hair out!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upgraded to Belle yesterday and music has become wretched.....had tunewiki which is no more available for Belle....have you been able to solve your problem as you were facing the same issue. Any advice will be helpful so that music by album can be restored.</p>

            1. TuneWiki still works flawless under Belle. I have no idea why it vanished from the store.<br />
2. Music Player always sorted by Tag; under Symbian^3 and Anna as well.<br />
<br />
We'll never understand why Nokia refuses to offer basic and standard functionality like sorting by file name. Would solve so many problems.<br />
But that's Nokia: Always two steps behind.

http://katastrophos.net/quasarmx/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Both works with folders. Quasar is bit groggy and slow. Got lots of oppertunities. Music Launcher is simple and just how it should be.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Both with no equilizer, but that app in the Ovi Store :

<p>Would also recommend Tunewiki as an alternative music player, as well as QuasarXM as it does have an equalizer. Both are in Nokia Store.</p>
<p>I find Tunewiki the best music player for symbian as it both integrates with Twitter and Facebook and also downloads lyrics for most songs whilst they play, but it's not free and does need data to work properly, but worth the money in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuasarXM</p>

<p>I think the key here is that the problem only exhibits itself (at least on my E7) if one has compilation albums, with different artists. In other words, the algorithm Nokia put in place identifies an album as combinaiton of title *and* artist; that's the
 problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is curious is that (thankfully) the Nokia Suite does not have this curious effect. But this is yet another example of previously working features going backwards...</p>

<h2>            Embed Fonts - Powerpoint &#40;Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm doing a professional project and need to embed fonts into the ppt so it appears the same when opened on any machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting this error message when I try to save it (after clicking on embed fonts in Preferences&gt; Save)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/951c92e1-968b-4f11-908a-1024027030a3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/951c92e1-968b-4f11-908a-1024027030a3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'd just like to know is there anyway I can save the fonts into a file format that is supported?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also - is it even possible to embed fonts and have them appear 'as is' on another machine if that other machine doesn't have those particular fonts installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            Office comes with a Gills Sans font family by Monotype. Look for <strong>Gill Sans MT</strong>. It doesn't have the variety of weights you are using, but it is fully embeddable and free.

</p><p>In the sense that the presentation will open and all the text will be there, yes, it'll work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if the fonts you've used aren't on the other machine, some other font will be substituted. There's no sure way of knowing what other font that will be or how similar it'll be to the intended font.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 needs repair every startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike-at-gx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 needs repair every startup</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 Home from 8.1 on a Lenovo K450 computer. &nbsp; I installed a new hard disk. &nbsp; I installed 10 upgrade from 8.1 and then reset the system as I wanted a clean install with no historical baggage. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I boot the system it goes into automatic repair and then does a checkdisk. &nbsp; The repair seems to work and I get 10 booted up, but this is not good and has me worried. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while I had the Windows TEMP and TMP directories on a second disk (partition S:) as I am trying to keep my c: drive as uncluttered as possible. &nbsp; When I did this the automatic repair checked both S: and C:. &nbsp; I have since gone back to TEMP and TMP
 on the standard settings, and it only checks C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would seem to indicate that Windows 10 is not dealing with the disk cache properly when it shuts down, and is flagging an error for the next start up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this? &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyone got a fix for me?</p>

<p>Check under activation see if you have digital entitlement? if you do I suggest that you make a ISO from Windows10 media creation tool site, and do a "clean" install and let Win10 do the partitions, as I have used the reset and end up with problems, you
 are posting on the Preview forum for new version of Win10 which is not a support site &nbsp;for the public release of Windows 10 we are un paid volunteers not MS employees.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try turning off Fast Startup and see if this helps any... It can cause problems similar to what you describe if it doesn't function properly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try doing a couple of Restarts after the repair.. With Fast Startup turned on, sometimes settings don't stick unless you do a Restart first...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad that helped... Some machines are a lot faster booting with Fast Startup turned on, and others not so much...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still am not sure what is going on that would require turning it off though...</p>
<p>You might investigate some of your drivers, like graphics, SATA, and maybe USB...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I have noticed is that it sometimes requires a Restart after making a change to get a new setting to stick... Doing a Shutdown sometimes just saves the old one..</p>

<h2>            Update Installed on 2&#47;5&#47;18 Finally But Why</h2>
                    <p>This isn't really a question or a complaint. But I thought I ought to share what happened with my update because it was a little strange. I had been trying to install the latest insiders update for the last week and a half from my Windows version of the
 Fall creators build maybe it was one build after that I can't remember. Anyway, I have been trying all sorts of different things and nothing seems to work but then Monday night, I received an update that did go through.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I received Version 1709, OS Build <strong>17083</strong>. I was on build
<span><strong>16299.192&nbsp;</strong> The error was occurring as soon as the install began which was after around 5GB had been downloaded and successfully completed.&nbsp; I did not get any other error info from the update process; the Windows logs did not
<span><strong>16299.192&nbsp;</strong> The error was occurring as soon as the install began which was after around 5GB had been downloaded and successfully completed.&nbsp; I did not get any other error info from the update process; the Windows logs did not
 add any additional insights either.&nbsp; The error was:</span> <span><strong>0x80070241</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had researched the above error code but did not find anything within Microsoft's webs later than 2015 and that one did not seem related to my install problem (it's one of those very non-specific error codes).&nbsp; So I doubt anyone here will have experienced
 the same thing.&nbsp; But if you did,&nbsp; I would like to hear from you - as a sanity check if nothing else.</p>
<p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Short answer: Yes. Please be sure that you are asking about the right suite that you're looking at since Office 2016 (perpetual license which is no longer available) is not the same as Office 2019 (perpetual license currently available) is not the same as Office 365 (subscription)

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>The Windows 10 Mobile Upgrade Advisor app helps you find out if your Windows Phone 8.1 is eligible to install the upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. We understand how it could be frustrating when things do not work as expected. Please follow these
 methods to assist you better:</span><br />
<br />
<span>Method 1:</span><br />
<br />
<span>We suggest that you back up the phone. Here's how: </span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up your stuff</a></strong><br />
<span>Before you start the Upgrade Advisor app, itâ€™s important that you back up your phone data to OneDrive or another storage location.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Method 2:</span><br />
<span>The next workaround is to perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset</a></strong>. To hard reset the phone, just go to Settings &gt; under System, tap
 About &gt; Reset your phone.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Method 3:</span><br />
<span>Download the Upgrade Advisor app by opening this link: </span><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/store/p/upgrade-advisor/9nblggh0f5g4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upgrade Advisor.</a></strong><br />
<br />
<span>Method 4: Once you have successfully installed the app, you can continue the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13778/windows-10-mobile-upgrade-advisor-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">upgrade process</a></strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Method 5:</span><br />
<span>It is recommended to perform another <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10666/windows-phone-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset</a></strong>. This will clear the temporary files that may be left in the process
 of the upgrade. During the set up, you can <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027665/windows-restore-from-a-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restore the back up</a></strong> you have created from your previous version.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Feel free to get back to us for further assistance.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span>Regards.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Auto date &#47;time adjustment in OneNote for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>When you create a new note, the date is automatically entered along with the time the note is created which if you are actually in a meeting at that time and taking notes - great!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you are preparing for a meeting or taking notes later not being able to amend/adjust this manually is so frustrating and my nbr 1 frustration with OneNote - it is a notebook after all.</p>

<h2>            Contact Sync</h2>
                    I have Exchange Server configured but I sync Calendar and Email only as I don't want my personal contact goes to my company server. But in MyPhone application says that my contact list is configured to sync with Exchange Server which is not the case. This
 ALL-OR-NONE assumption does not match the real case. Hopefully this can be fixed in the coming version.

<h3> richardclarkson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2013 problem&#58; The value cannot be added to this new row until the row has been committed</h2>
                    I have created a simple database with two tables: one for managers and one for employees. One manager is responsible for many employees. I have also created a data entry form and on opening it up it shows all the current data correctly. However, when I
 go to add a new record and try to enter data into any of the fields I get a message saying 'the value cannot be added to this new row until the row has been committed. Commit the row first and then try adding the value'. Can anyone tell me what this means
 (in simple terms please) and what I can do to begin using the form to enter the data. It is driving me crazy&nbsp; as I have recreated the tables over and over again and checked the relationship and that the data types match between Primary Key and Foreign Key
 to try and solve it.

            Without being able to see how your form is set up it's difficult to comment on the error, but with your present model the obvious interface would be a form bound to Employees, in which a combo box bound to a foreign key ManagerID column has code in its
 NotInList event procedure to open a form bound to Managers in dialogue mode to allow the insertion of a new manager if necessary.<br />
<br />
You'll find examples of the use of the NotInList event procedure in various contexts in NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the frmContacts form includes a CityID combo box set up in this way.<br />
<br />
However, a better model would be to have a single Employees form, which includes all employees, including managers, and to include a foreign key ManagerID column which references the EmployeeID primary key of the same table.&nbsp; An enforced relationship on these
 columns can then be created between two instances of the table.&nbsp; This will allow you to model the complete management hierarchy from the CEO down to the most lowly employees in the organisation.<br />
<br />
It may well be that you would want to record other attributes of some or all managers which do not apply to other employees.&nbsp; This would be done by creating a further table, Managers, with a primary key ManagerID of long integer data type (NB not an autonumber).&nbsp;
 This would also be a foreign key referencing the primary key EmployeeID of Employees.&nbsp; The Managers table is consequently modelling a sub-type of Employees and would have non-key columns representing those attributes relevant only to managers.<br />
<br />
Data entry for all employees would be via a form as described above.&nbsp; Where an employee is being inserted as a manager, or there is the need to edit the manager attributes of an employee for whom a row already exists in the Managers table, a command button
 could be included in the form, whose code would (a) save the current record so as to allow a row to be inserted into the referencing Managers table, and (b) open a form bound to the Managers table in dialogue mode, filtered to the current EmployeeID value,
 passing the EmployeeID value to the managers form as the OpenArgs argument of the OpenForm method.&nbsp; Code in the managers form's Open event procedure would then assign the value of its OpenArgs property to the DefaultValue property of a bound ManagerID control.<br />

            <p>I think you need to review your Design. I would not have a separate table for Managers and Employees. A Manager is still an employee so you should have ONE table for employees. Your employee record should have 2 fields, a Yes/No field to identify an employee
 as a Manager and a ManagerID field to indicate which employee manages each employee. Note: this is how I have my HRIS system setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this setup I have a combobox for Manager with a Recordsource of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT EmployeeID, Lastname &amp; ", " &amp; Firstname AS Manager FROM tblEmployees ORDER BY Lastname, Firstname;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should eliminate your data entry problem </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also say, that without knowing what your database is used for, you probably need additional tables as well.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help on this and your prompt response,</p>
<p>You're right table design and the relationships&nbsp;are quite critical. I have redesigned my tables as you suggested and I can add a new record. However I can only get so far with filling in the fields - the form is built using the form wizard and as soon as
 I move onto a field that belongs a different table I get the same message that I have to commit the row before I can add data. If I save the data that it has accepted and then open the form again it will now allow me enter data into those fields that it blocked
 previously. Additionally although I can convert one field to a combo box on my form it doesn't populate with the data - instead it allows me to add a new&nbsp;year record&nbsp;instead of letting me select from a list of years. I know you&nbsp;haven't got my database in front
 of you&nbsp;but there is obviously something wrong - happy to send you a link to it - if that's allowed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>While it is possible in some scenarios, as a general rule data should not be inserted into more than one table via a single form bound to a query which joins the tables.&nbsp; Where it is necessary to insert data into multiple rows in another table, e.g. into
 an OrderDetails table via an Orders form a subform based on the referencing table (OrderDetails) should be embedded into a parent form based on the referenced table (Orders).&nbsp; Where it is necessary to insert a single row into a referenced table, e.g. a new
 customer in an Orders form this should be by means of the NotInList event procedure of a combo box bound to the foreign key column (CustomerID), or more crudely, by setting the combo box's ListItemsEditForm to the name of a form bound to the referenced (Customers)
 table.<br />

            <p>First, as Ken said, don't use a multi-table query as the Recordsource of a form. Instead use Subforms to enter the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another point; you don't have fields on a form, you have controls that may or may not be bound to fields in a table. This is a subtle but important distinction. The combo should be bound to a year field in Recordsource.&nbsp;</p>

1/2.&nbsp; These are closely connected as they mean there is a binary (2-way) many-to-many relationship type between&nbsp; each instance of the employees entity type.&nbsp; A binary relationship type is modelled by a table which resolves the many-to-many relationship type
 into two one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; Where the many-to-many relationship type is between two instances of the same entity type, as here, the table which models the relationship type is an
<em>'adjacency list'</em>. So the tables are:<br />
<br />
Employees<br />
â€¦.EmployeeID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
â€¦.FirstName<br />
â€¦.LastName<br />
<br />
EmployeeManagers<br />
â€¦.ManagerID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
â€¦.EmployeeID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
The primary key of the latter table is a composite one of the two foreign key columns, each of which reference the primary key of Employees.<br />
<br />
The model is therefore as follows:<br />
<br />
Employees(1)----&lt;EmployeeManagers&gt;----Employees(2)<br />
<br />
NB: Employees(1) and Employees(2) are not separate tables, but are instances of the single table Employees.&nbsp; The many-to-many relationship type between employees and roles would be modelled in the same way, but between Employees and Roles tables, not between
 two instances of a single table.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Here things are not so straightforward.&nbsp; It's not clear to me what you mean by 'record'.&nbsp; A record is a row in a relational database table, and each row represents an entity of the entity type modelled by the table.&nbsp; What entity type your EmployeeRecords
 table is modelling is unclear, partly because of its generic name.&nbsp; A table should be given a name which describes the entity type being modelled, usually as a plural or collective noun to reflect the fact that a table is a set.&nbsp; Employees is a case in point.<br />
<br />
Your EmployeeRecords table also has a fundamental design error in that you have multiple ObjMet# columns, which mean that the table is not normalized to First Normal form (1NF) whose definition is:<br />
<br />
First Normal Form: A relvar is in 1NF if and only if, in every legal value of that relvar, every tuple<br />
contains exactly one value for each attribute.<br />
<br />
Loosely speaking, in the language of the relational model, a <em>relvar </em>(relation variable) equates to a table, a
<em>tuple </em>to a row (record) and an attribute to a <em>column </em>(field).<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; In a correctly designed relational database this should be a consequence of the logical model.&nbsp; As an example you might like to take a look at StudentLog.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file you'll see that each student can be registered for one or more academic years via a subform in the main students form.&nbsp; You'll see for instance that John Brown is registered for three academic years.&nbsp; If one of those years is selected
 in the unbound combo box above the student's name the registrations and attendances subform will show the student's data for that year.<br />
<br />
Similarly in the Courses subform, if a years is selected in the unbound combo box above the course name, the form is filtered to that year and shows the students registered, and the sessions scheduled for the course for the year.&nbsp; Selecting a session shows
 the students who attended in the students subform.<br />
<br />
This is achieved by the use of the model below:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/453c2a81-659c-4909-870e-87ea2fc7c171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/453c2a81-659c-4909-870e-87ea2fc7c171" /></a><br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, the model includes no redundancies.&nbsp; Each 'fact' is represented by a value at one column position in one row in one table and nowhere else.&nbsp; This not only achieves efficiency of data input, but protects the data against update anomalies, in
 that if a 'fact' is represented once only it cannot be represented inconsistently.<br />
<br />
The above model is obviously not going to reflect the real life situation which you are modelling, and is only given here as an illustration of the modelling principles involved.&nbsp; A model for your situation would depend on what entity types are being modelled,
 what are their attributes and how the entity types are related.&nbsp; As it stands this is not readily apparent from your file, and without a full description from you of the real world situation you are aiming to model, to put forward a putative model would require
 too much crystal ball gazing to give any hope of its being an accurate representation of the reality.<br />

            <p>1. Then you have many to many relationship. To model such a relationship you need a junction table"</p>

<p>EmpRoleID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>EmployeeID (FK)</p>

<p>EmployeeID (FK)</p>

            Many thanks for your detailed responses and apologies for not acknowledging your time and efforts sooner. They have given me some pointers and I have been trying to apply your suggestions but I am struggling with creating the&nbsp; two instances of the employees
 table.&nbsp;I have thought that if I&nbsp;copy the structure and data of the employees table and re-name it to 'employees(2)' I can then use the two tables to join to a link table so allowing the two primary keys to be linked as suggested. However, I am struggling to
 make this happen so I must be doing something wrong. If you can expand on how to do this I might be able to make some more headway. As always, your time and suggestions are gratefully received.

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>My thanks to you were included in the comments that I think you see as part of this thread - just didn't want you to feel your time and efforts weren't appreciated also.</p>
