    <title>extremely slow boot and perfromance after graphics card shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybot  say:</h3>
<h2>            extremely slow boot and perfromance after graphics card shutdown during active windows session</h2>
                    <p>Once in a blue moon the graphics card in my laptop will shutdown completely, but windows will remain running, I have to usually do a power cycle of the machine because there is no way to tell what i'm doing in the windows session. Windows does record a 'bad
 shutdown' occurrence in the event viewer, but there is no event record of the graphics card shutting down. I don't think it's a hardware or driver issue as it happen so infrequently and it has occurred across multiple driver versions. I know that it's the
 graphics card shutting down, because for what ever reason, the keyboard backlight is tied the the graphics card. when i switch to an external display or the in this case the card shuts down and the display turns off, the keyboard backlight also turns off.
 This issue has occurred under windows 7,8,8.1 and 10. there is no way that i can tell to cause the issue to occur. it happens when it happens. last night it happened when i closed a game down after i was done playing. This next part is the core of my question.
 After doing a power cycle of my system after a video card shutdown, the system starts up exteremly slowly. start up programs and system services either timeout, don't start, or take forever to start. last night after I power cycled, it took almost 25 minutes
 for the system to fully come up. during this period system responsiveness is.... well... really crappy. but if i wait long enough 45minutes to an hour or more, the system recovers. without any intervention on my part. subsequent boots are normal and quick
 taking an average of less than a minute from power on, to desktop ready to go (including logon and startup programs loaded). I am really stumped as too what is causing this slowdown. could it be caused by windows dumping the the prefetch cache or another cache
 source? The slow boot and performance slowdown goes away on its own, so I don't think it's a windows, file system problem or the way windows is setup. maybe I am not trying to find out why the video card occasionally shuts down. It happens so infrequently,
 that I don't consider it an issue. I don't think it is caused by a bug or miss setting of windows or anything.&nbsp;<span>I am trying to find out the reason of the slowdown that occurs after the next boot. the slow boots have occurred on the windows versions listed
 above.</span></p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer and eight year Windows MVP who will try to help you.
<br />
<br />Since it happens regardless of the OS you have installed, it sure sounds like a hardware issue to me - either with the card or Power Supply.  Have you tried physically reinstalling the card, checking the contacts are all clean or blowing out dust?  I'd also test another PSU if you have one.
<br />
<br />I'd also run the Hardware Troubleshooter from Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  If you have any crashes run the Blue Screen troubleshooter and prepare the crash file for analysis following this link:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But to be sure go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />And remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>sorry i was called a way in the middle of finishing my post and you answered in the mean time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SInce machine is a laptop,&nbsp; the video card is a little difficult to remove for inspection. I did have the system blown out and artic silver applied by a computer shop about a year ago, after temps on two of the CPU cores shot up into dangerous levels.&nbsp; no
 temp issues have occurred since. the issue video shutdown occurred even before that however. as for the PSU. I am not sure what part would be called the PSU on my system... something internal, or the big **** power "brick" that came with it. don't know if
 it matters or not, but I did replace the original battery with duplicate one (using the OEM (Toshiba) part number on the battery.) that was done at the same time i had the system blown out. No issues with the new battery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There IS an issue with one of the laptop features which is either software, that I have had since day 1 of owndership, but was unable to correctly diagnose until after the extended warranty ran out. basically that issue is with the 'sleep and charge' feature
 of the laptop. the feature is meant to provided a powered USB port for charging or whatever even when the computer is sleeping. The problem is, when the feature is activated in BIOS, when the system goes to enter into sleep mode, the system powers completely
 down, and does not resume when you try to wake it up. when you wake the system up, the system powers up and tries to resume, but there is no data left in memory to resume from. thus resulting in a system stall of sorts. to get around the issue, i turn the
 feature off bios, and remove the power cord and battery and then hold down the power button for 45 seconds. the problem with the 'sleep and charge' does not affect hibernation or starup/shutdown of windows. it only affects system state s3 (sleep). since I
 keep the feature turned off to avoid the issue. so it likely plays no part in this I DO have the latest version of BIOS for the laptop. The issue could probably be fixed with a BIOS update, but it is unlikely that Toshiba will ever fix the issue. the issue
 with sleep and charge does go away when the production BIOS is used, but then other issues (such as the system only recognizing 4Gb of RAM) return..</p>
<p>
</p><p>when the video card shutsdown, there is no crash as i said before. thers is no BSOD. the system continues to operate as if it still had a display. I can even put the system to sleep and power it back up or even log off (Winkey+L), the only way to get the
 screen working again is to&nbsp; do a a powercycle, or i would imagine, tell windows to restart (hard to do when you cant see what your typing or where the mouse cursor is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did&nbsp; run the BSOD troubleshooter as asked, and no problems were identified (ecuase no BSOD occurred).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out the link you posted, but, some of the stuff, I do on a regular basis (sfc. dism, chkdsk, maintenance ) while other stuff in the link is not feasiable, as i can never tell when the video card is going to shutdown, and when it does, there is
 no way of getting to change the startup options without seeing whats on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would normally tend agree with you on the whole clean install vs upgrade, but when there are OEM utilities that provide access to system feature, and some if the utilities are not available on the OEM download site then upgrading or repair installs IMO
 are a better route. this is additionally so, when as with the Original OS, there is no OS install disk/files to use for clean install. The system, as setup by the OEM after windows and driver patching, ran quite well with only a few exceptions. I can count
 on a couple of fingers that number of times I have had BSOD this year. Normally I build my own desktop systems, which have no system utilities or the like to speak of. so a clean install is just the ticket. I have been running the same partition since 2012,
 starting with win7. system has remained stable aside from occasional corruptions that needed repairing here and there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>aside from everything else i have said in this post. I am only interested in finding out why there is such a slowdown (even if it was only temporary) after having to power cycle the system. i know it is not an advisable thing to do. but just doing a power
 cycle with out having an issue before hand does not result in the slowdown. it only slows down after the video system shuts down suddenly.&nbsp;the fact that the issue seems to resolve itself on its own without any user interaction is really puzzling</p>

            Be aware that the overheating you had on the one core could affect the video card.  Did the problem begin before, during or after that overheating?
<br />
<br />It could also be the OEM utilities you use, especially any that duplicate a superior feature found in Windows and can conflict.  This is remedied by the Clean Install and the reason it defeats the purpose to reinstall OEM software even though I do it myself for a battery extender and fan reversal app on my Lenovo laptop.  
<br />
<br />It will be interesting to see if the Checklist remedies the symptoms after hard shutdown which are normally only disk-related.  Perhaps you should test your hard drive with it's diagnostics.  
<br />
<br />I'd also contact the card's Support and ask if there are known issues or if they recognize the issue.  There might even be a patch.
<br />
<br />Keep us posted.

            Greg asked me to chime in here. This is a hardware issue with likely causes as :
<br />
<br />1. Power related - low power to unit or a problem internally delivering the correct volts/amps to the system. Does it do this when just on A/C without the battery in place? Do it do this is you use the unit somewhere outside your immediate area such as a library or coffee shop (thinking about a low A/C brown-out type issue)?
<br />
<br />2. A problem in the video card itself (with or without 1. in play). The Slow Boot and performance after loosing the video is an definite indication of this issue. It could be power or heat related (keep in mind that heat related does not always mean overly excessive amounts of heat as a single component could be too sensitive to even the normal levels).
<br />
<br />3. The BIOS issue really complicates the issue however it still involves hardware now. The origination of the issue now is probably the excessive heat produced back when you had the heat sink re-lubed. Some circuitry was over-heated and is not showing the signs which happens in electronics as a regular occurrence.
<br />
<br />Would not hurt to try to contact Toshiba Support (they have closed their consumer forums) and Nvidia Support and Forums.
<br />
<br />Adding more cooling might help some. I have two older Toshiba laptops and I use external fans units mounted to the vents on both. One is an Opolar and the other is a cheaper TekHome. Both were purchased on-line.

<p>it was cores 2 and 3 that were over heating and it wasn't a case of catastrophic overheating, but the system was slowing it self (lowering clockspeeds) to compensate for the issue.&nbsp; cores 0 and 1 had normal temps. that was the biggest indicator that i had
 an issue... my cpu kept down clocking to .90 Ghz (about 900 Mhz, i think). the PC it self has pretty decent built in cooling and the case design (unlike some of the other laptop models i have seen) has pretty decent ventilation. I use a high CFU fan notebook
 cooler with the laptop, and through out the life of the laptop temps never go above the 50% mark an the internal fan never goes above 60% of its full speed. that being said,
<em>IT IS</em> probably about time for another dust clean out. Better to take care of it before it starts to become an issue, right? the issue with the video card first occurred before the system needed its first servicing (thermal cleanout) but has occurred
 every once in a while since then as well. none of the OEM utilities that were included with the laptop are duplicated by native windows features. when i custom ordered my PC I ordered it with as little bloat as possible. I know software bloat is an issue on
 many other systems. what little bloat mine had has long since been dealt with (Norton software - blech!). I am perhaps fortunate that all the OEM utilities such as ECO utility, Toshiba button support, and the PC health monitor and the HDD protector still work
 under windows 10. I under stand that this is not the case for all Toshiba models, even ones that include the same software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;here's a snapshot of my computers power use and temps this is the usual state of the machine.</p>

<p>yeah, issue occurs with or with out the battery inserted. I ran the system for almost one year after the original battery gave up the ghost. the max power of the system is 120W and i average around 60W power consumption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>due to it's size, (18.4 inches) the laptop stays put in one spot. I don't know what the life span of a video card typically is, but maybe a replacement is in order? I know you can still find the cards used in the system if you need to replace it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the exhaust 'ports' on my model are along the back of the system, so i don't know if the items you suggested would work for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that when i play some of the more demanding games that pushes the limits of what the system is capable of running (bf4, planetside 2) there is a bit of detectable heat (from touching the area of heat built up where the video card heatsink/fan is).
 when this happens, the system starts to protect it self by slowing stuff down and i start to lose FPS and so on. at this point I usually just quit playing and the temps go down on their own.</p>

            Definitely add some cooling. If you can remove and reseat the video card do that. My worry would be that the video card is ok and other circuitry is the issue. If you happen to come across a compatible card to use to test that would be good.

            well, i am planning on replacing the M/B because one set of USB ports got broken at the PCB connect point last time i had it serviced. the video card, since it is discrete (something that is apparently unusual for laptops from what i have heard) is able
 to be reseated, but i don't feel comfortable disassembling it my self. all it takes is one "oops" or " oh, shoot" and then i have a paperweight. I plan on sending it into this one shop in L.A. that&nbsp; is capable of transferring the serial number of the system
 to the new board. this&nbsp; will reduce problems from replacing the M/B as i understand it. also it should keep my license for both win7 and win10&nbsp; valid since both keys are tied to the hardware. they are Toshiba certified and have apparently been around a while.
 so i feel pretty competent with that choice of service center. the main issue is while there are parts for the laptop still available to but out there, Toshiba has completely dumped all there stock of parts for the laptop.

            None works, everything worked in win 8 consumer preview. I bought win 8 pro now I have no sound and my mic&nbsp;don't&nbsp;work. since everything worked in consumer preview I would have to say its a&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;screw up, and you need to come up with something and
 quit sending it back to HP as they blame it &nbsp;on Microsoft.

<h2>            My sony cameras are no longer being &#39;read&#39; by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I read the other answers to similar questions and still don't know what to do....<br />
I installed Windows 10 a couple of months ago, and no problem - whenever I plugged in my sony digital stills cameras (DSLR-A200 &amp; Cybershot DSC-W180) via a USB cable to my computer, some kind of a wizard would pop up on my computer screen and ask me if I wanted
 to download the photos.</p>
<p>However, all of a sudden, NO wizard is being launched for EITHER camera - and my computer doesn't 'read/recognize' their presence as devices in File Explorer. I've searched to try to make a connection (e.g. Settings/Devices), but it's like the cameras don't
 exist. One camera tells me 'Initiating USB connection' and the other camera says 'USB Mode connecting - Switch on [menu]'. Note that the last one, the 'Switch on [menu]' is new, now that there are problems.</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever installed software for the cameras (I don't even have it, both were gifts) - the computer just always automatically launched its download wizard.</p>
<p>Please help me - I take a lot of photos, and may have to revert back to an old Windows if I can't get download my photos onto it...&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Recovery Drive- which Windows 10 system files does it use&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tai.s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Drive- which Windows 10 system files does it use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so if I create a Recovery Drive on a USB flash drive I've heard you can then choose to copy down Windows system files, allowing&nbsp;the Recovery Drive to re-install Windows 10 on a problematic computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Important Question</span>: What I want to know is where will the Recovery Drive be getting these system files from?&nbsp;(I.e. what build will it end up using as the "recovery").
</p>
<p>I figure the most likely possibilities are either: 1) My current system files (Build 1511 since I reverted from 1607)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) the build Microsoft is currently upgrading everyone to/the version on the Media Installation Tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondary question: Also, if I create a Recovery Drive before the Creators update, will it corrupt the current files I have (windows-bt and such) that are used to revert to previous build versions? Or will it only corrupt these files if I created the Drive
<strong>after </strong>going through with the Creators update?</p>

<p>Hello Tai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create a recovery drive using your computer's current build (1511), system files will still be coming from the build 1511. We suggest not to use the Media Creation Tool since you're using an older build of Windows 10 installed and wish to retain it
 and this process will upgrade your computer to the latest build provided by the Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will depend on how you're going to repair your Windows 10 system, kindly refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>and check the contents under Use a recovery drive to restore or reset your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>I tried that too, but the same thing happened to me that happened to Keirez.&nbsp; I got a blank (black)&nbsp;&nbsp; screen.&nbsp; I followed all the steps exactly as you presented them, but no success.&nbsp; I tried my keyboard shortcut quite a number of times, but no screensaver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was so nice years ago when all you had to do was a window S (or something like that that was quite easy) and you'd get the screensaver right away.</p>

            I bought one many years ago from a user on Ebay, it was a aftermarket power brick and had no name brand. It did not work for me. Either the power brick was bad, or that wasn't the problem that I thought it was with the Xbox One not working. But I plugged
 the new one in, and nothing happened. It wouldn't work and still wouldn't turn on. I wound up getting rid of that Xbox and getting a new one. Just be careful if you buy an aftermarket one. If you get one, I'd recommend getting a good, reliable name brand or
 a Microsoft one. Good luck!

<h2>            Samsung Odyssey Headset</h2>
                    <p>Wondering if anyone knew a fix for this issue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows detects my headset but in Device manager under Mixed Reality Headsets it shows this error with the Samsung Odyssey Headset driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)<br />
<br />
PoseThread failed to initialize presence sensor code: 0xD0000010</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the device, and uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it.</p>
<p>I have also purchased a USB 3.0 powered USB card in case it was my Motherboards USB 3.0 same issue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio works on the headset, Device manager shows the headset under monitors when i have the HDMI connected, and my PC passes the Mixed Reality ready test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MSI gaming 3 z97 Motherboard, running Windows 10 pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible my Brand new headset is defective?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Error 43 mostly is driver related. In your case, the Odyssey requires hardware specification. Check the product manual for the specification. If the problem isn't in the specification, we suggest contacting the manufacturer for&nbsp;driver
 update and the list of compatible devices for Samsung Odyssey.</p>

<p>Well the driver starts , but then stops I assume because of the Presence sensor message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I tried:</p>
<p>I totally reinstalled Windows 10,&nbsp; drive wiped - same thing</p>
<p>I went crazy and purchased new mother board, chip, ram.. Reloaded windows again... same&nbsp; message.</p>
<p>I had Microsoft 3rd support check it out,&nbsp; had no idea.&nbsp; However Microsoft support was great and timely just couldn't resolve it.</p>
<p><span>Samsung was unable to assist as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After money and time invested, I figure its best to return it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily Microsoft has a great return policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Old title: Microsoft store</p>
<p>So, there's this problem with the Store. I've upgraded my Windows to Windows 10 yesterday, and it was working perfect! I opened the Store just to see what it had in there and what could I download and that's it. But, today when I open it, it's not working
 and it says that there's a problem. The code is 0x80131500 but I don't know if that would do any help; it also says that waiting might help and I've waited all day and have been clicking the Refresh button but it's still not working.<br />
Could you help me, please?</p>

            <p>Hello Sara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to your region settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see this error code 0x80131500, when you have selected incorrect region. Ensure that your laptop Time, Date and Region settings are set accordingly. Go to
<strong>Start /&gt; Settings /&gt; Time &amp; Language </strong>and check the same. If your PC is installed with any third party Antivirus Software or Online Security Software, then ensure that they shouldn't&nbsp;be causing any issues to Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If problem still persist, then try to execute below troubleshooting steps to see if they sort out the issue. These steps will repair any missing or corrupted system files,, if they causing any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly</li></ol>
<p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run the DISM tool</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows corrupted image files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key</li><li>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Important:</strong> </span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair
 source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</strong></p>

<h2>            Bluetooth radio driver code 43 since windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My first Windows 10 upgrade. A brand new VENSMILE micro PC fully up to date Windows 8.1. I decided to upgrade to Windows 10 right out of the box. I checked everything before I started and everything was working ok but&nbsp;I didn't try the Bluetooth.</p>
<p>I did the upgrade and with minor tweeking had everything working ok however when I tried to connect a Bluetooth keyboard&nbsp;I found that in Device Manager under Bluetooth, Bluetooth Radio had an error, Windows has stopped this device because it has reported
 problems. (Code 43). I tried to update driver and was told this is the most current and working ok. I tried uninstalling the driver but when I rebooted, it was back. I heard others had this problem but I haven`t been able to find an answer yet.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thank You, George</p>

            I am still having issues with my Bluetooth constantly giving me "Error 43" errors on Windows 10. I've tried uninstalling it, and reinstalling it, and still the same end result! I need something that will work, because the driver that Windows 10 keeps putting
 on it is obviously corrupted somehow. Microsoft needs to address this issue ASAP!<br />

            My solution was to roll back the driver to the previous one. To do this I searched for "device manager" and opened that up. Then in the list click on Bluetooth. This should open up to see your Bluetooth device. Now right click on this and select "Properties".
 This pops open a window to check properties of your device. Click on the "Driver" tab. One of the options is to roll back the driver. This is what I used to get mine working again. You could also check for new drivers here if you suspect yours is downlevel.&nbsp;
 I am running on an MS Surface Pro 3. Good luck resolving your problem.

<h2>            Achievement board not working </h2>
                    <p>I'm sure I'm not the only one to notice but the monthly achievement board has not been working for getting on 4/5 days.. Typically it breaks on a month that I get my best total score. Was hoping that a new month would trigger it to working again but still popped achievements are not registered on the monthly totals.. And before I'm told that 360 games don't register. I know this.. That is another topic for discussion.. Any one got a theory to why this has stopped working? Or even an acknowledgement that the problem has been flagged?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, you can use it, but I strongly advise you have a secondary backup plan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

    <title>Unknown devices in the device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown devices in the device manager</h2>
                    Right after the December 10 update, in the device manager I found an exclamation mark on the Surface Cover Telemetry device. The driver update procedure reported an error, so I couldn't find any solution to that.<br />
After a few days I bought a Type Cover 2 and I found that the keys were not working. I reset my SP2 but nothing changed.<br />
<br />
Then, around Christmas, Windows Update re-installed the firmware update from Oct 24.<br />
Since then my Type Cover 2 started working, however in the device manager I see two "other devices": one "unknown device" and one called SurfaceTypeCover_01.
<br />
When forcing the driver update, Windows says they are successfully installed as, respectively, "Surface Cover Telemetry", and "Surface Cover Audio". Afterwards, however, the two devices are still seen as unrecognized and no driver is present for them.<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 Slim Overheating issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squee365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim Overheating issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I bought an XBOX 360 Slim 250 GB last winter, and until now have had no problems with it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Last night I tried playing Battlefield 3 and during the installation of the HD texture pack, I got this error message: "‎"The Xbox 360 is shutting down to protect the console from insufficient ventilation. You can turn the console back on after the power
 light stops flashing." The console then flashed red lights for about 3 minutes straight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave the console about a half hour to cool off. I tried again and it did the same exact thing. I cleared the shelf it was sitting on completely and made sure the power supply was well ventilated too, when I tried even signing in, it shut itself off again.
 I'm really not sure what to do, and if theres anything I can do before maybe sending it off for repairs. Any help would be extremely appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

here is the same page for the slim</a>. It has the exact same steps listed though.<br />
<br />
I forgot to ask in my last post but what colour is the light on your adapter for the console?.
<br />
I have seen a few posts with peoples consoles exhibiting similar behaviour to what you are describing, as far as I recall it always resulted in a repair being needed.<br />
<br />
Its definitely worth waiting for other replies though, its very likely there is something you could try that I have not heard of.</em></p>

<h2>            Windows will not start at all.--- &#58; A hard disk problem is preventing Windows from starting contact your system administrator or computer</h2>
                    A couple of weeks ago I began having problems with Microsoft Security Essentials. I would receive the following message: could not turn on realtime protection. This operation returned because the timeout period has expired. So, I followed the instructions
 given...Click start, in the search box type services.msc, enter, choose properties for microsoft antimalware service, ensure it is set to automatic and then restart the service. Some times this would work, however, sooner or later it would happen again.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then it started freezing up on the sign in screen and I would receive the following message: Microsoft Visual C + + runtime library: this application has requested to terminate in an unusual way. Please contact the applications support team for more information.
 I could get no further. Some times, if I took the battery out so I could get it to completely shut down, I was able to start it in safe mode. I did a couple of system restores. The first did not work at all the second one did temporarily. I noticed that when
 I could get Windows to start, the realtime protection was always off, some times I could get it to start but not always. No matter what I was able to do to fix the problems, it wasn't long before it was back to doing the same thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I finally was able to get Windows to start normally, at which time I uninstalled Microsoft Security Essentials and then re-installed it. Everything was working great but now I can not start in safe mode, can not start normally, can not get it to do the
 last known good configuration, can not get it to complete start up repair. It will get to the Microsoft Corporation screen that is black and then nothing more. I don't know where my disk is, I don't know what to do. I didn't download or install anything recently
 so I am not sure why all the problems all of a sudden.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh, I get this message now: A hard disk problem is preventing Windows from starting contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer to determine if you need to repair or replace the disk. (I have a Toshiba Satellite model #PSAG8U-02E018 running
 Vista Home Premium )</div>

</p><p><span>Thanks for the quick reply.</span><br />
<span>Unfortunately none of the solutions presented, the App Cleaner software or using Powershell, paid off.</span><br />
<span>In both solutions, only the Reader application that works is shown (in the search list).</span><br />

            Skype does not support porting in numbers as Skype numbers (except for possibly Brazil).&nbsp; Due to this, you will not be able to transfer your mobile number to Skype.<br />
