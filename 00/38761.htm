            Based on the information you provided, It turns out that it has something to do with YouTube since it doesn't happen when playing music files saved on your computer and to other websites. In this case, we recommend that you reach the support team for YouTube
 to further isolate this issue on their end.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            <p>Can you tell us about the format of the source video?&nbsp; I suspect that WLMM is having problems with that specific file type.&nbsp; If that is true, you might try a conversion to .wmv before doing any editing in WLMM.&nbsp; There are numerous conversions programs out
 there. I've used Freemake Video Converter and I've seen others recommend Prism Video Converter, yet others mentioned Handbrake.&nbsp; If you install Freemake (freemake.com), be sure to install just the program, not any add-ons.</p>
<p>Since WLMM prefers .wmv video, I think you'll have more success with that format.</p>

            The files straight from my camera are mts files. &nbsp;When I would upload the video from the camera onto the windows system on the computer I then would open windows live movie maker and drag the MTS files into movie maker. &nbsp;By doing so it would convert the
 MTS files to WMV files without having another conversion program &nbsp;on my computer or using another conversion program on my computer. &nbsp;Windows live movie maker would do all that and I had no problems doing so and then would save the video with no problems.
 &nbsp;I wiped my windows 7 operating system and then downloaded everything back onto the computer with all updated drivers. &nbsp;After I did this is when I started having problems with Movie Maker.&nbsp;

            <p>Try your sample video. Convert it to .wmv using Freemake and see if the stuttering goes away when you edit that in WLMM.&nbsp; I think it will.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could have a buggy driver.&nbsp; Sometimes the most recent drivers have problems that the prior ones didn't.&nbsp; Check the forums for your GPU manufacturer and see if anyone has noted similar problems.</p>

            After having to deal with this pixelation problem several times over the past year or so, I thought I'd chime in and offer some of my experiences on working around this problem.<br />
<br />
Sorry if my reply is a duplicate to any others on this thread but I'm not reading any replies. Just posting this same message several times around the web in the hope that it helps someone in the future.<br />
<br />
Here are some things I've tried which have helped:<br />
<br />
<br />
I used to make all my movies in the higher format but I learned that the difference between the two is negligible, in my opinion. Plus it makes for a smaller file size and helps when uploading to free video sites where there is a max size like Vimeo's 500mb
 free account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's the same clip that is always pixelated but the rest are fine. Sometimes it's more than one and it switches back and forth. But sometimes I find that on my 2nd, 5th, 7th try or whatever of saving it, the movie turns out fine. Repetition is the
 key, though time consuming (find something to do while it's saving).<br />
<br />
<br />
When it's that same clip that keeps pixelating every time you save it, I go back into the WLMM and move maybe .20 or .50 into that clip and split it. When I save it, I often find that the first .20 or .50 or whatever remains pixelated but the rest of the scene
 is fine. Sometimes I split the clip in random places like 3 times and that sometimes works if the first method doesn't. Doing this has also resulted in eliminating any pixelation at all.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget that when splitting clips that have certain effects like fading, you have to remove the fade in, or fade out, or both.<br />
<br />
<br />
I took that same clip and put it on my desktop and renamed it. Then back in WLMM, I inserted that new clip and removed the old one. This worked the first time I tried it, but also failed another time I tried it.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to apply the same effects, if any, as the original clip before s

I previously mentioned some of the tricks I do to work around the random pixelation. Those still work for me for most videos.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>However, this past week I did three videos that were 6 minutes, 3 minutes and 4 minutes. They were between 20 to 40 clips. The first two worked fine after playing around with the things I mentioned before. But the last one I spent hours of frustration and
 wasted time on trying to get it work and it never did.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>So, I had to come up with something else and it worked but it's not perfect as the quality of the saved movie is a little worse. I had 21 clips to make into a 4 minute video. And I tweaked things and saved the movie over and over again. Probably 20 times
 but there was always pixelation. But then I thought about converting each video into another format then trying the whole thing again on WLMM.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Here's what I did:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>- Open each individual clip in WLMM and save it as a movie as normal into .wmv format. I chose to do this on a high setting like 1080. And I saved these into a completely different folder to avoid confusion with the original videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>Also, of the 21 clips I did this for, five times the movie saved pixelated even though the clips were about 10 seconds long. So I had to save as movie again and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>And if the clips needed trimming for starting and end points, I did that first before saving.</p>

<p>Converted each of those newly saved clips into .mp4 format at the highest quality. The settings I used were:</p>
<p>- Apple TV III MPEG-4 Movie (*.mp4)</p>
<p>- 1920x1080</p>
<p>- Higher (Larger file size)</p>
<p>- codec was x264</p>
<p>- video bitrate 5000</p>
<p>- video aspect auto</p>
<p>- encode pass 1</p>

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>- Once all clips are saved into .mp4 format, I opened them all into WLMM and saved the movie as normal. I choose either 720 or 480 (a custom setting I made) so as to keep the file sizes down but still with fairly good quality.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>The 4 minute movie came out as I intended it to. Based on my experiences so far, for this time and for one other time, WLMM has no problems working with .mp4 files. The previous time I used .mp4, that was the original format as I downloaded those clips from
 youtube in that format.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>Now, the only problem was that when I converted to .mp4, the quality was between 80 to 90% of the original video clips, which for me, are from my JVC Everio cam in .MTS format.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>For youth sports, which is what my recent videos were for, this is not a big deal. But if it's for like a wedding or something you want to look close to professional then this might not work for you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 install stuck at getting devices ready 8&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to reinstall windows 10 from USB for a second time (first install was successful). Anyway, I got all the way to the Toshiba screen that says, 'getting devices ready. 8%. ' I left it overnight and no progress. So I started over. I noticed that
 on windows setup 'where do you want to install windows? ' screen the drive 0 partition 4 primary option doesn't have enough space. Total size is 464.7GB free space is 409.1 GB. Could that be the reason I get stuck on the getting devices ready at 8%? If so,&nbsp;
 how do I fix it?&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen imediately after starting video transfer with firewire connection</h2>
                    I have connected my Canon ZR800 with a firewire cable for several years to my laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium. Up until last week, if has worked perfectly. As of last week, the system crashes with BSOD immediately upon starting the video transfer.
 I have several different software programs for capturing the video, but I get the same result with all of them.<br />
<br />
Anyone experiencing the same thing? Any solutions available?

<p>Hi Bruce in canada,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;What is the error message you receive in the blue screen of death?<br />
•&nbsp;Have you done any recent changes on the computer?</p>
<p><br />
As you are facing similar issue while using different video capture software there may be a problem with the camcorder.</p>
<p>First I would suggest that you visit the manufacturer website and install the latest firmware update, check if it works.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=326&amp;modelid=14727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=326&amp;modelid=14727</a><br />
<br />
<br />
If you still face issue you will need to update the motherboard chipset drivers by visiting the computer manufacturer website.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

Thanks for the link to Canon's site, but I have already been there, and there are no firmware updates available for the ZR800 camera. I find it hard to believe that I need to update the motherboard chipset drivders, when the computer had no problem with transfering
 video just a couple of weeks ago. It seems to me that the latest Vista updates have a problem, as it appears that lots of other people are having the same problems.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the blue screen closes and the computer re-boots before I can get much info off of the screen.

            I managed to find out what was causing the problem this morning. I saw a post about Creative Web Cam software on another board. That person was having a similar problem. I uninstalled the creative software, and the problem is now gone. The video import
 works perfectly now.

Hi, PES3.&nbsp; Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>I have a long-time friend who is a member of the police force in the U.K.&nbsp; He advises that any resident of the U.K. who receives this sort of fraud (particularly whereby an offer is made to assist a computer user on payment of a fee) should make contact
 with the National Fraud Authority, details are on their website at:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.actionfraud.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.actionfraud.org.uk/</a><br />
<br />
He further advised that the NFA is committed to tracking down and eliminating these criminals but they need all the help that they can get to identify the scams, if they don't know about it they can't act.</p>

<h3> amber shuman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume Indicator</h2>
                    <p>So, I get this weird window on youtube (just chrome) when I adjust my volume and was wondering how to get rid of it. I did some research and there is a virus that goes undercover as chrome.exe (which is a legitimate program) and I'm not getting pop ups and
 I ran a malware scan with nothing found, so I think it's just my computer or an update. Can anyone find out a way to get rid it (and by it, I mean the right window)</p>

            Hi Amber
<br />This is a feature of google chrome, you have a tab open with media content. 
<br />saves you going to the tab to pause the media content. 
<br />it should go if you close the tab that contains media content
<br />
<br />to stop it appearing paste the following into chrome address bar
<br />chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling
<br />
<br />Set Hardware Media Key Handling to 'Disabled'
<br />
<br />restart chrome.

            Hi Amber,
<br />
<br />This is not a virus, it is just a new Feature in Chrome . . .
<br />
<br />Open Chrome
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chrome://flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />That should remove that for you . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 update boots to bios only</h2>

<p>Thanks for responding, I worked with Microsoft support last night and we initially decided to do a restore from an ISO image.&nbsp; However after I removed the second non-bootable drive and changed the bios out of secure boot mode in order to boot from a USB
 drive, the update suddenly started up again and finished.&nbsp; Afterwards I was able to put it back in secure boot mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at all sure why we stumbled on this fix, but it was less time consuming than a ISO rebuild and I was quite thrilled to avoid one.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if it's the second drive or the bios that ultimately fixed it.&nbsp; I had a problem with an update about 6 months ago that also started working correctly when the second drive wasn't in the machine, I never changed the bios for that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, it's a Gigabyte P34gv2, with a Samsung 1TB MSATA (the boot disk), and a 2TB Seagate HD (data only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 won&#39;t shut down or go to sleep</h2>
                    <p>After updating my dell 3537 15r from windows8 to 8.1 version, my laptop just won't go sleep or shut down. If I click on shut down button(from settings), screen goes black, but power indicator (light)still works and it stays there until I have to force shut
 it down by long pressing of power button on keyboard... Same if I click on sleep or hibernate. At first I tried to inspect drivers, but all drivers are up to date... So I just don't know what to do... Frustrating... On win8 i had issue with bluetooth, and
 on win8.1 it is power management... If anyone have solution, I would be thankful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I've read almost all pages on this site about this issue, but found nothing. I've tried to turn off homegroup, changed sleep timer,...but nothing</p>

            <p>Hi Dejan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for getting back to us with the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you tried updating the graphics card drivers from Device Manager and it shows that the drivers are up to date. This is because, the latest drivers for your graphics card model that is currently available in the driver cache or via Windows
 Update seems to be already installed on the computer. But, there could be some latest versions of the drivers that are released by the computer or the graphics card manufacturers and you should be able to download and install these drivers from their websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can let’s know the make and model of the Graphics Card device on the computer, so that I can help you in finding the most appropriate Windows 8.1 compatible drivers from the computer or the graphics card manufacturers’ website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell website provides 3 latest versions of the graphics card drivers on their website. You may download the correct one as according to your graphics card model and the operating system architecture from this link:<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: Make sure that you select the operating system as “Windows 8.1”, click on the option “Video” and then download and install the appropriate driver.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run the SFC Scan to check if there are any corrupted system files or integrity issues on the computer.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Ashish</p>
<p>thanks for your help. I tried all those but it didn't help me any way.</p>
<p>this happened because of SkyDrive where Microsoft save personalized setting and roll back them if we re install windows again using the same Microsoft ID.</p>
<p>I had to change my Microsoft ID during installation. The system was fixed.</p>
<p>But I didn't like this setting of Microsoft. I was using a genuine version of windows before and everything was fine until my system crashed once and i had to use pirated copy for two week and those setting were saved onto the cloud.</p>
<p>On my next installation (genuine) copy the same pre saved setting were loaded.</p>
<p>This is not at all cool,Microsoft should fix this things or create a multiple personalized settings, where user should be given a list of dates of which pre saved settings to be loaded.</p>
<p>I am very sad as I am unable to use my old Microsoft account and had to change lot of things around. I also lost my xbox games data. And my phone and laptop doesn't sync as they have different ms account.</p>
<p>this I totally ****.</p>
<p>Now I face new challenge earlier when I used to lift my screen up of my laptop the windows booted automatically,well now I don't have that feature. I purchased new windows 8.1 pro. Earlier I had 7 over which I upgrade 8 followed by 8.1 which had this feature.</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

<p>O meu teve isso de nao querer mais ligar, só dar o bip e sem ter estado no sol. sorte que estava na garantia e consegui trocar pela microsoft mesmo. Note bem: Se seu console é original, sem destraves, está na garantia e nunca foi aberto, entre em contato
 com o 0800 da Microsoft que eles te ajudam. Se é original, sem destraves e nunca foi aberto, mas nao está mais na garantia, Tente consertar com a própria microsoft que te dará mais segurança. #fica a dica</p>

<p>Thank you for Skype. I really appreciate using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have come across is that when I share my screen with people they sometimes say my screen is super small and they can't see what I am showing them. Others do not have the same complaint.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am on a hi-res monitor. I am not sure if that is impacting anything.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> reighvan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Metro Apps suddenly stopped working&#58; Tried everything I can find nothing worked</h2>
                    I booted up my new Lenovo Ideapad Y480 with Windows 8 preinstalled for the first time on Thursday, I set everything up to my liking and had been using it without a hitch for about day until yesterday (Saturday) in the afternoon a bunch of the metro apps
 just suddenly stopped working (store, mail, skype, messenger, photo...etc) They would open up on a colored background sometimes showing the logo (often times the logo would be off in a corner) and a loading circle, sometimes just a solid color screen (I should
 add that the live tiles are still updating themselves even on the apps that don't open) I've been doing a lot of research and tried most of the common fixes with no avail.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have:</div>
<div>1.Restarted computer (many many times)</div>
<div>2. Checked the resolution (1366x768)</div>
<div>3. Made sure UAC is turned on (although when I click on Change UAC settings it gives me a WerFault.exe-Application Error)</div>
<div>4. Created a Test user account</div>
<div>5. Reset IE as default browser</div>
<div>6. Clean booted</div>
<div>7. Uninstalled and Reinstalled my third party antivirus (AVG antivirus) and made sure it was updated</div>
<div>8. Checked for and installed all system and driver updates</div>
<div>9. Ran the App troubleshooter (It said said display&nbsp;adapter&nbsp;drivers might be out of date but the system said everything was up to date)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't uninstall and reinstall the apps because the store app itself doesn't work. And the only applications I was using at the time they all stopped working was Microsoft Word, Google Chrome and iTunes. And the only other thing I can think of is that
 I've been getting a WerFault.exe- Application Error on&nbsp;occasion&nbsp;since this all happened (sometimes on startup) that I'm not sure is related.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think the only thing I haven't tried is refreshing or resetting Windows 8 which I really don't want to do... =/ Anyone have any more ideas?</div>

            <p>Hi Reighvan,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Community. Appreciate the detailed explanation of the issue you are facing. Sorry to know that it has caused so much inconvenience
 to you.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>If there is an issue with Metro apps then the “app troubleshooter” would be the first troubleshooting which you have already tried. I would suggest
 that as mentioned by the troubleshooter you try and update the drivers for the Display adapters and check.
<span>Follow the steps to update drivers.</span></p>
<p>a) Move the mouse to bottom left corner and right-click on the ‘Start’ icon.</p>
<p>b) Select
<b>‘device manager’</b>.</p>
<p>c) Expand ‘<b>Display adapter”</b>, right-click on the adapter and select update ‘<b>update driver software’</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><span>The
<strong><span>werfault.exe</span></strong> is used for
<strong><span>Windows Error Reporting</span></strong>. It is a feature that allows Microsoft to track and address errors relating to the operating system, Windows features, and applications.
 It gives you the option to send data about errors to Microsoft and to receive information about solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the method provided and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Windows+R.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the search bar type “services.msc” and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Scroll the list and right click on “Windows error reporting service”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose Stop.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists and let us know.</span></p>

            <p>I&nbsp;also got the device driver update, but still getting the same error after updating also. I refreshed my pc 2 times. They were working initially after both the refreshes but after few restarts they stop working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also tried to change my user acc to local and again back to ms but after changing back to local it wont change back saying that it cant connect to its servers.</p>

            hi Vinod Archak,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Let you know that Problem found is "Display adapter might be out-of-date" is JUST AN BUG: False negative because there is WDDM 1.1 on Intel Series 4 Family Express including GMA 4500MHD, which is updated on March 2012 on my laptop., In fact, It's still
 "up to date", not outdated. &nbsp; I prove that it works fine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I'm very frustrated to fix XboxLive App after repeatedly crashing few sec for no reasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Don't tell me sorry, but please reconsider carefully how to resolve issues If all other methods are failed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lists of methods since I clicked Refresh once since two days ago:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>#1:</div>
<div>I switched to Local Account from MS Account &amp; MSconfig: All applications including third-party softwares on Startup are disabled, except for MS programs, and unchecked Safe Boot &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>#2 I ran SFC on Command Prompt with Admin. It showed "Windows REsource Protection did not find any integrity violations". &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>#3 I updated all apps through Windows Store Setting. I also did wsreset.exe before XboxLiveApp still crashes after opening every times.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>All methods are unhelpful to fix Apps to prevent crashing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You know, I tried to uninstall XboxLive App via PowerShell, but I don't know well how to manage, it showed many invalid or errors, after I follow tutorial. &nbsp;I did refresh once two days ago. &nbsp;It's VERY UNHELPFUL.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;As customer, we strongly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;that MS Windows Team should creating App Tool Software which allows uninstalling or&nbsp;re-installing bulti-in apps such as Xbox, Store, etc. &nbsp;You should talk with your MS&nbsp;colleagues about App Tool Software for&nbsp;ultimate&nbsp;solution
 instead of all failed methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>AppStore Troubleshooter need redo all bugs avoid false alerts such as outdated display adapter. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any final solution?????????????????????????</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for understanding!&nbsp;</div>

            Hey buddy,<br />
I faced same issue last week. But now everything is fine.<br />
Do you have any anti virus software installed ?<br />
&nbsp;In my case issues were sorted out after formatting machine and installing windows without antivirus.<br />
<br />
Try it. If you face the same issue again. Please let me know.<br />

            Hey buddy,<br />
Do you have any 3rd party anti virus software installed ?<br />
If yes then Format your pc and reinstall windows.<br />
This time do not install 3rd party antivirus.<br />
use windows defender to protect your pc.<br />

i have tried both the methods as mentioned by you..<br />
when i ran the troubleshooter it said some files are missing or corrupt and it said the problem has been repaired..<br />
i followed the other solution of&nbsp;stopping&nbsp;the windows error reporting service too and also all the methods as mentioned by the person who asked the question..<br />
i would like to know what i can do and if there is any other solution..

            <p>I have same issue,&nbsp; metro apps lose internet connection resulting in app errors as described above.&nbsp; I tried to do a chat session with Microsoft support.. they wanted $99.00 to $149.00 for out of warranty service... I have owned software for 95 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worked
 great&nbsp;for 91 days...then just lost interent connection to metro apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have to pay for&nbsp;operating software again for only 30 day warranty...LOL you go microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have refrehed 4 times...metro apps work until pc sleeps or hibernates, then when I wake it and relog on no internet for metro apps,&nbsp; desktop works fine......That is not a user induced problem or driver problem..it is flaw in operating system inteligent
 plug and play or something...app troubleshooter is of no use.&nbsp;&nbsp; says it finds stuff, but then fixes nothing,&nbsp; tried&nbsp;all the setting fixes suggested...nothing bring metro apps back to life except refresh, but only until pc&nbsp;sleeps, hibernater or restarts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Installing updates did not help either.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no software on&nbsp;PC&nbsp;excepts&nbsp;microsoft store&nbsp;game apps&nbsp;and skype for desk top...PC is my 4 year old son's for Disney, NICkJR, metro educational apps,&nbsp;&nbsp; now he can not play several of his apps...Daddy fix it...fix
 it...fix it.....MICROSOFT LISTEN YOU HAVE A MAJOR FLAW...I geting a android tablet for him for apps&nbsp;and installing windows XP pro.&nbsp; NO way paying for flawed operating system again, when i just spent $100 upgrading 95 days ago...Now spend 99 for 30 days support
 on $149.00 for 90 days....LOL&nbsp; what a bargin,&nbsp; I can go to walmart and buy another licence for 99 bucks gettin 90 days warranty....</p>

            <p>Try resetting after backing up your files.&nbsp; The apps probably have corrupted files in the AppData folder in your user account, and those do not get deleted in a refresh.&nbsp; Also, if you had McAfee or Norton, these can cause this kind of problems, and you may
 not have fully uninstalled them.&nbsp; You will need to run the MCPR Tool to remove McAfee products, and a different tool to remove Norton products.&nbsp; Use these links to find the appropriate tool (they are located under the Remove [name] Automatically section an
 inch or two of scroll bar down the page):</p>

<h2>            Probleme mit Win. 8.1</h2>
                    <p>.</p>
<p>Mein&nbsp; Acer Aspire E 1 - 571 G Laptop arbeitet mit Windows 8.1 und IE 11 und ist sehr langsam. Ich habe 3 verschiedene Virusscanner laufen lassen, es wurde nichts gefunden. Den Scanner AdAware, traue ich mir nicht herunterladen, da kommt in der Zeile ganz
 unten, dies ist ein schädliches Programm. &nbsp;Das mit der Langsamkeit&nbsp;ist erst seit gestern der Fall. Ich konnte den Originalen NVIDIA Treiber laden, aber&nbsp;nicht installieren.</p>
<p>Daraufhin ging es nicht mehr vor und zurück. Dann habe ich das Win. um 5 Tage zurückgesetzt und ich werde nie mehr versuchen hier einen neuen Treiber zu laden, dieser Fall ist mir jetzt schon das zweite mal passiert, auch anderen wie ich im I. gelesen habe.&nbsp;Seit
 dem Zurücksetzen&nbsp;läuft es nicht mehr gut.</p>
<p>Ich weiß es wird nicht einfach sein mir zu helfen, trotzdem im Voraus Danke</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Correct, that you can buy it from any other online sales portal, than Microsoft Store. When you as end-user buy a package of games, then you expect to get 100 % and not only 75 % :)</p>
<p><br /></p><p>I as affected end-user have the feeling that Microsoft did not handle the issue fair.</p>
<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Note:</b>
  </p>
<p>I´m not sure if Microsoft`s current marketing for “Games with Gold” is in the line of the laws of EU concerning marketing, due to that you cannot promise end-users 4 games per month, if they can only get 3 of 4. Then they have to correct it to example “You can <b><u>maybe</u></b> get 4 games per months, depending on where you register your account”.</p><p><br /></p>

<h3> jonnynewb  say:</h3>
<h2>            folder&#47;files labled in green text</h2>
                    <p>when I browse it in Windows Explorer, the folder name appears in green type, rather than black type like the rest of the folders/files in that directory. If I open the folder, all of the filenames inside are in green.</p>
<p>Also under "users" my name is in black letters but the public account is in green and when i browse the "windows" and i scroll down to "remote packages" i see the folders "remote apps" and "remote desktops" both of which are empty when io click on them but
 when i look at their properties is see 3 unkown accounts and "trusted installer" and "authenticated users" and they were written or installed or whatever on dates that were before i even wiped my surface and installed windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone explain to me whats going on here..if this is normal or what? I have had an ongoing issue and im thjinking this is some footprints or something left by a hacker.</p>
