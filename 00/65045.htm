            Hi monzermansour, this is generally caused by your display device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager - Accessible by right clicking your Start Button 
<br />Expand the Display Devices section 
<br />Right click your graphics card and choose properties 
<br />On the driver tab, choose 'Roll Back Driver' 
<br />If the Roll back option is grayed out, right click the device and choose Uninstall 
<br />Confirm deletion of the driver files 
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC . . .

<p>
</p><p><span>I am just lost for words.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A few days ago I posted an issue I was having. Windows back up kept trying to back up a folder that was deleted. You asked for system logs and event logs and pointed out that an
<span>experienced eye can pick out the needles in the haystack and see more clearly the precise nature of the problem or problems.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I uploaded all this stuff and you come back telling me t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">he problems are with Harddisk2 (controller error) and Harddisk3 (bad sector).<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ok great, but I asked for help with windows back up and explained to you that

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You then reply saying my </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">explanation may cover the errors referencing Harddisk3 but I am not sure it does for those relating to Harddisk2 (controller error).</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ok great. I explain to you again that those drives were not being used for the backups and the backup drive was a sata 3.5, not the Seagate 1.5tb.&nbsp; I question you again and go over everything I did again, so you can better understand.
 I also tell you I tried a different target drive and got the same result. So that ruled out controller issues again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You then tell me” “I am being too defensive. &nbsp;It is not helpful to go over what you have deleted and what might be the consequences. To troubleshoot computer problems you need to determine the problem and then fix it. Deleting
 files that are a problem is not the only way to resolve the problem. Your speculation about the cause of the backup problem is equally not helpful as there is likely to be two or more factors contributing to the failure. Checking the process of backing up
 is secondary to checking that both drives / partitions are working correctly. There is no evidence so far that there are any problems with the drive containing your C partition. There is a question mark over your e partition. We need to resolve this issue
 before we try to unravel why the backup software is not working correctly. The backup software will not work correctly if the drive it is writing to is malfunctioning”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Trouble shooting a drive that has errors that’s not being used will not fix the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When error messages are saying they cant find something on “c”, that tells me the problem is with “c”, not the target drive or controllers on the e drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You also wrote back “</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Stop deleting things you probably do not fully understand. You will make the situation worse. You are using the wrong methods to correct problems.</span> And again, ask for
 more logs and event files. You say you do not delete the programme from the programme folder. If you do that, you leave system errors behind to progressively destroy system performance”.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hmm&nbsp;&nbsp; again, I deleted a folder that I created. Not software. Me, I made the folder. I reset a windows index. I deleted a value that used to say a folder was on the desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You wrote “<span>Checking</span> the process of backing up is secondary to checking that both drives / partitions are working correctly.</span>”</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Yes true, if you were getting specific errors that pointed you in that direction.&nbsp; But I was not. My error was saying all along it could not find a folder on the c drive. Error:(The system cannot find the file specified. (0x80070002))</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Despite what needle in a haystack you found in my log files the fact remains that you did not understand what was going on and whenever I questioned that, &nbsp;you would try to pass blame onto me. I&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">am
 42 and have been messing around with computers since right before windows 3.1 and have been using win xp for the last 12 years and never used win backup win 7, or vista. &nbsp;So I really do not know much about how the backup software works. &nbsp;And thats pretty much
 what I have been asking the whole time..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I did post my e check disk and its was clean, like I originally told you that the drive in the report was another drive. I also asked if it could have been related to a snapshot system restore may have done and said if my problem
 was out of your league to let me know.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Well guess what, I backed up my system, because I don’t understand things, and created a restore point. I then deleted all previous restore points that may have had that folder showing on the desktop, and guess what, windows backup
 worked perfectly. And my pc seems to be performing fine.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Just because it works on a test camera site does not necessarily mean your camera drivers are fully installed properly or compatible with any Windows 10 Apps like the Skype for Windows 10 App (11.x/12.x). In that state it might still be functional in standard
 desktop applications like classic Skype (7.x) or the new Skype for Desktop (8.x). Does you camera function in the Windows 10 Camera App (as displayed below)?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck, I've also checked the software of the camera and it hasn't been updated for a while so I think it's now obsolete and with the last Windows 10 update it no longer works.</p>

<h2>            CPU and GPU Temperatures increasing after installing Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing Windows 8 I have noticed a significant increase in CPU/GPU idle&nbsp;temps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System:<br />
Win8 Pro<br />
CM Storm Trooper<br />
OCZ Stealth 600W PSU<br />
Asus M4A87TD Evo<br />
965 BE (Corsair H60)<br />
8GB Gskillz 12800<br />
MSI 7950 Twin Frozr<br />
2 X 1TB Seagate Barracude 7200RPM RAID 0<br />
</p>
<p>No OC on anything. GPU idle is at 50*C and CPU 41*C (used to be 30-35*)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers Gav</p>

            <p>Fixed... Re-install windows idle temps now sitting at 34*C CPU and 34*C&nbsp;GPU </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Correction temps were fine for a day and a half now they have gone back up to 44*C CPU and 50*C GPU idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it was after some updates installed. I removed all the updates but the temps stayed high.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 clean install hangs during expanding windows files</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>alright, so this is what I have done so far, I downloaded the student package from digital river, I was originally running 32 bit win xp, so when I first ran the exe file from the download, it gave me the error about not being able to save in a read only
 folder and what not, but I followed the suggestions on the forums to go ahead an burn the expandedsetup folder onto a boot disc by converting it to an iso, which I did, I installed the first time but missed the option to format my harddrive so my old files
 were still on there, however once win 7 got installed I wasn't able to connect to the internet for some odd reason and I couldn't figure it out, so I decided to take the 3 files I had originally downloaded from digital river and try unpacking them on the 64bit
 OS I now had installed, it worked fine this time with no error, so I moved the expandedsetup folder to my laptop and burned them onto a dvd as before, this time I boot from the dvd and do a clean install, it installs fine again, but once I actually log into
 the OS and think I'm getting started with things again everything is grinding along, I tried rebooting and that didn't work, this time it just froze at a black screen before the log in, so I once again booted from the dvd and tried to do a clean install, but
 this time it begins to hang during the expanding windows files part, so I decide to make another disc using the second expandedsetup folder thinking that maybe the new one was a bad burn, this didn't work either, it got to about 14% complete on expanding the
 windows files and then it told me that files could not be found, so I tried the second disc again, that one only got to 4% before it gave me the error about files not being found, so I put the first one from the very beginning in and try it, and its hanging
 at 4% right now and I expect it to give me the same error, I really have no idea what is going on, there are too many variables, but I tried to evaluate them all, could it be hardware related? my computer is compatible for the win 7 64 bit, I ran the upgrade
 advisor before purchasing, so I know that my hardware can run it, I'm thinking that it is either my dvd drive or the harddrive but they both seem to run fine otherwise, any help would be appreciated</p>

<p><span>Hello Impoc,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for Posting on the Microsoft Vista Community Forums.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Installation might stop if the system cannot copy files. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this
 problem:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Your Windows installation disc is scratched, smudged, or dirty. Clean the disc with a soft cloth, insert it in the CD or DVD drive, and then begin the Windows installation
 again. If your installation disc is damaged, you might need to replace it. For more information, go to
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=77005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>How to replace lost, broken, or missing Microsoft software or hardware</span></a> on the Microsoft website.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Your CD or DVD drive is not working properly, or the disc might be vibrating too much for the laser to accurately read the data. For more information about this
 problem, consult your hardware documentation, or contact the CD or DVD drive manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If your computer has multiple CD or DVD drives, your computer might be trying to locate files on the wrong drive. If your computer has a feature to disable CD or
 DVD drives that are not being used, disable the drives that you aren't using. Otherwise, try inserting the disc into a different drive, and then start the installation again.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>There is a virus on your computer. Run an antivirus program to scan your system and identify needed repairs. Be sure to disable the antivirus program before beginning
 the installation again.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also this is usually caused by hardware or software that is incompatible with Windows&nbsp;7. If you have this problem, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait about 10 minutes to see if the installation continues. Watch the hard disk indicator (often a small light on your computer that blinks when your hard disk is running) to
 see if there is any activity. If your hard disk appears to be working, the installation should be in progress. If your hard disk does not appear to be working, go to step 2.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the installation fails again, there might be a hardware incompatibility problem. Go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=60497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Windows Upgrade Advisor</span></a> on the Microsoft website to see if your computer can run Windows&nbsp;7.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network
 adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you have more than 1 Memory stick on your computer, try to remove the all the RAM stick except for one and try installing Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the computer still stops responding during installation, you may have to contact your computer manufacturer or retailer to verify if the computer is compatible with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also refer the link below to know more about troubleshooting Windows installation issue:

<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Note: This article is related to Windows Vista. However you can follow the same steps with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If the installation fails after following the above steps, try to make a note of the exact error messsage and provide the same.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.

You hear an echo or noise during gameplay
<div>
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you hear an echo effect, it often originates from the person who is talking and not necessarily from the person who hears the echo. For example, if you hear an echo only when someone else talks, the problem may be with the headset connection
 of the person who is talking.</p>
<p>The following conditions may cause an echo or noise during gameplay:</p>
<ul>
<li>The microphone detects ambient noises. This includes voice transmission that comes from the earpiece.
</li><li>The headset plug is not fully inserted into the controller. </li><li>You are using the Xbox One Wireless Controller, and the battery levels in the unit are low.
</li></ul>
<p>If you or other players hear an echo or other noise during gameplay, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the volume down on your TV or stereo. </li><li>Disconnect the headset, and then reconnect it firmly to the controller's expansion port.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;Never pull on the headset cable when removing it from your controller. Remove your headset from your controller by pulling on the body of the headset plug.
</li><li>Clean the plug on the headset cable with a clean cloth, and then reconnect the headset to the controller.
</li><li>Test the headset by connecting it to a different controller. </li><li>If you’re using an Xbox One Wireless Controller, replace the AA batteries or recharge the Xbox One rechargeable battery.
</li></ul>
<p>Note Never pull on the headset cable when removing it from your controller. Remove your headset from your controller by pulling on the body of the headset plug.</p>

    <title>SSD Migration issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markimeerkat  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD Migration issues</h2>
                    
<p>G'Day All.</p>
<p>The System is a very stable machine with the following:</p>
<p>- Mobo: Asus P5Q3 Deluxe latest BIOS 2105;<br />
- DDR: 4GB DDR3 1333 G.Skill Ripjaws;<br />
- GPU: Asus 9800GT 1GB;<br />
- HDD: All SATA<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WD VelociRaptor 150GB (OS)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 x WD Green 808.8GB in RAID 1 Mirror (Data)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 x Seagate 500GB standalone spare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patriot Inferno SSD 100GB (new for OS)<br />
- OPT: Pioneer SATA DVD-RW &amp; LG EIDE CD-RW.</p>
<p>The system runs Windows 7 Professional 32bit without a hitch (love W7), just decided to upgrade HDD.</p>
<p>A first migration was performed last month from a 5 years old WD Velociraptor 36GB to the new VelociRaptor 150GB: no problems there with copying partitions across in DOS using Aeseus Disk Copy 2.3 and Windows was happy as larry (did not even request re-activation).</p>
<p>Wanting to take a leap into SSD, I just bought this Patriot Inferno 100GB SF-1222 (5yrs warranty) and proceeded to do exactly what I did last month, thinking it would have worked fine.</p>
<p>Started the machine and booted into the current W7 install to load the drivers for the Patriot; once that was done, I booted into DOS and used Aeseus Disk Copy 2.3 to copy the W7 partition across to the SSD, no issues.&nbsp; Then installed a fresh BCD store on
 the SSD drive and managed to boot from it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>To help with the first boot process I disconnected all other HDD; when Windows started, stopped on "Preparing your Desktop" for a while and then reported as not Genuine.&nbsp; All I could get was the blue background screen with "Windows 7 - Version 7600 - This
 copy of Windows is not genuine" in the bottom right hand corner, no Explorer, nothing.</p>
<p>I therefore reconnected all HDD and changed BIOS to boot from the SSD: Windows started, asked for "Get Genuine" and re-activated ok.&nbsp; But it is terribly, incredibly sluggish and slow!&nbsp; To the point that Control Panel does not work, and many other functions
 and routines do not respond, stall or simply cannot be clicked.</p>
<p>To troubleshoot, I swapped the SATA ports between the current WD and the Patriot SSD: it is very interesting the SSD installation will report "not genuine" and not even allow for re-validation when plugged into the SATA port of the WD, while it starts ok
 (albeit incredibly slow and unresponsive) when plugged into a free SATA port.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any help to sort out why I cannot get the machine to work correctly with the SSD as the primary drive.</p>
<p>Also, the mobo has an AHCI option but W7 will give me BSOD and never starts.&nbsp; Does that mean I will never be able to use TRIM in W7 with my new SSD?</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do rather than a clean install?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            <p>In my educated opinion Microsoft does not intend to solve this problem THEY CREATED.&nbsp; I believe they are weeding out non-paying users on their site.&nbsp; My paid for computer tech team agreed.&nbsp; I contacted my states Attorney General and then informed Microsoft.&nbsp;
 The problem went away as mysteriously as it appeared.&nbsp; This is not a computer issue, it is a greed issue.&nbsp; Contact your AG and report Microsoft.&nbsp; Mike</p>

<h2>            Lockscreen image is wrong on reboot but correct after first log-in.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">This bug has been present in windows 10 for years, however ms devs have never addressed it. Seeing the same problem in build 1903 has finally driven me nuts.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The bug:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I am the only user and have administrator rights. However on boot-up winlogon shows the default lockscreen image instead of the one I have set in settings. After logging in and then locking the correct lockscreen image
 is displayed. This is NOT a problem with group policy overrides and occurs on both Win 10 Home and Pro.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">How to replicate:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">(This is where I think I have found a breakthrough in determining the cause of this bug as no-one mentions it in linked articles below.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Create a fresh install of windows 10 Home (I used a VM purposely created to chase down this bug) with a single offline admin account (we'll call it Account).</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Set the lockscreen to a non default image (anything to differentiate it from built in windows images).</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Create a new offline user account (we'll call it Test).</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Give Test admin rights.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Sign out of Account and log in to Test.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
From Test set a lockscreen image different to Account or just leave it as default.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Log out of test.</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
The lockscreen will now be that of the Test account. Select Account, the background will now change to that of Account. All is well...</p>
</li><li>
<p class="contentStandard">
Sign in to Account and delete the Test account. Reboot and voila, there is the lockscreen image from the supposedly deleted Test account.</p>
</li></ol>
<p class="contentStandard">After pouring over two registry backups I found that
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">"Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\DefaultUserName=Account"</p>
<p class="contentStandard">had been changed to</p>
<p class="contentStandard">"Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\DefaultUserName=". The string had been scraped.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Likewise with "Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon".</p>
<p class="contentStandard">After changing the values of the strings back to "Account" I expected the issue to be fixed but no luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 UI just started lagging, context menus etc very slow to respond</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly my Win 10 UI has started lagging very badly, context menus might take over 30 seconds to respond, menus and dialogs disappear, mouseover events don't appear. This happens a short while after starting, everything works well after startup, then a
 few minutes later it breaks. The only way to temporarily fix this is to go to Display Settings - I have two monitors - and disable one of the monitors, and then re-enable this. After that everything is fine until I sign out and sign back in again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have finally got to the bottom of this problem, and I'm very surprised no one else has the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has something to do with the gaming settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Game Bar was switched on. I noticed if I had a browser window open during start up that the Game Bar shortcut briefly flashed in the window before the context menus stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into Settings Gaming and disabled the Game Bar. Problem solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is a workaround, it's up to Microsoft to fix it. But of course it's doubtful that they ever will. It will just go down among the many other problems that Microsoft never bothers to fix - like the drop shadows that appear on the desktop icon
 labels after using Task View - that thousands of users have complained about and MS haven't fixed yet, since Windows 7!</p>

                    <p>For some weeks I have experienced an extremely slow system start up, on checking the Event Mgr log, the following is displayed frequently everyday I log on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I elected to opt out of Windows Search updates some six months ago as they were zapping my machine for overly long periods before I could access anything.

            You can reinstall your OS if you want to but I would never recommend that for any problem - I would rather figure them out and fix them.&nbsp; Actually, there might be
<i>one </i>problem where I might recommend that but you don't have it.<br />
<br />
WSearch is the name given to the Windows Desktop Search Service (aka KB940157).<br />
<br />
If you did not install WDS on purpose, it may have been offered to you in a Windows Update.&nbsp; Just because MS Update offers you something doesn't mean you have to install it.&nbsp; If Windows update offers you WDS in the future, I would decline it and tell Windows
 Update to never offer it to you again.<br />
<br />
I am of the belief that WDS is problematic and troublesome and know that installing it and it's many adjunct components have a negative effect on your system performance.&nbsp; Look in Task Manager at all the junk that is running from WDS.<br />
<br />
WDS depends on the Terminal Services Service to be running and that depends on a couple other things to be running.<br />
<br />
When WDS is afflicted, the usual DCOM errors look like this (but there could be and are others):<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DCOM<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10005<br />
Description:<br />
DCOM got error "The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion. " attempting to start the service WSearch with arguments "" in order to run the server:<br />
{7D096C5F-AC08-4F1F-BEB7-5C22C517CE39}<br />
<br />
That looks close enough to your error message.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to figure out the exact issue and trying things that might fix it maybe, if I were you, I would look in Add/Remove Programs and uninstall Windows Search 4.0, reboot (it will ask you) and then see how things look.<br />
<br />
If things look okay you can always reinstall WDS if you are compelled to to so, right?<br />
<br />
I would not reinstall WDS if I were you and your system will reward you with better performance if you do NOT have WDS installed.<br />
<br />
Then having WDS will also cause you to see a message like this once in a while:<br />
<br />
<i>To free up disk space, Outlook Express can compact messages. This may take up to a few minutes.</i><br />
<br />
Even if you are not using Outlook Express, you will see that message if you have WDS installed (that is the way it works).&nbsp; You can fix that part if you are compelled to keep WDS installed (but I wouldn't).<br />
<br />
You will also not be able to have your system automatically Hibernate or Stand By while WDS is doing it's thing.<br />
<br />
There are just no good reasons I can think of to have WDS installed.<br />
<br />
If you did not install WDS on purpose, it may have been offered to you in a Windows Update.&nbsp; Just because MS Update offers you something doesn't mean you have to install it.&nbsp; If Windows update offers you WDS in the future, I would decline it and tell Windows
 Update to never offer it to you again.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your response &amp; I take what you say, however as I no longer use Windows Desktop Search Service, nor the Indexing (which was a real bind).&nbsp; I disabled the indexing function some 6 months ago and things were ok until a recently when I suspect a
 MS auto update scuppered this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried today to&nbsp;remove Windows Search 4.0 from my add/remove programs list, however&nbsp;a warning msg Ref KB2296199 came up telling me that
<strong>'Set up detected the following programs on your computer. If KB2296199 is removed, some programs will not run properly after it is&nbsp;removed. Do you wish to continue?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have <strong>not</strong> uninstalled as there is a huge list of programs which I use daily and would not wish to loose functionality under the threat of uninstalling WS 4.0. There must be a way around this highjacking by Windows of my programs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this?</p>

            I installed WDS on two different XP systems, rebooted and let them sit for a while and when I choose to uninstall I don't get those messages like you describe (but it sounds familiar for some other things I may have seen in the last decade of working on
 XP).<br />
<br />
Maybe it has something to do with programs that get installed or updated after WDS has been installed - like if WDS has been installed for a long time, maybe it somehow keeps track of new things added since it was originally installed (just a theory).<br />
<br />
Looks like a straight install, reboot, wait a while and uninstall does not give me those messages.<br />
<br />
Didn't see anything about it in Google search either.<br />
<br />
Perhaps someone else will help with some ideas.<br />
<br />
The daredevil that I am, I would go for it!<br />

    <title>making a disk image windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vths  say:</h3>
<h2>            making a disk image windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I want to backup a windows 10 HD before the computer is sent to the manufacturer for repair. Most of the data is from games saved, I assume, in the data files specific to each game. I don't know where to find all that data (note; this isn't my computer).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i make a backup that will keep all that data, and possibly configurations, for the different games?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer crashes often so it may be necessary to take the drive out of the computer and use it as an external drive. I do know how to do that. I still wouldn't know how to back up and restore the data.</p>

            <p>You can't backup individual programs, like games. You can backup game data, if you know which files store the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you're sending your computer away for repair, what you really want to do is make a disk image. An image is an exact copy of your hard disk, stored in a single file. You'll need disk imaging software to do this, and the technique takes a while
 to master. But it's well worth the effort. No matter what happens to your computer while it's out of your sight, you still have an exact copy of your hard disk that you can restore at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else you should definitely do if you're sending your computer for repairs is to backup all your personal data. That means all your documents, pictures, music, videos, email, favorites ... everything that's personal to you. Once you've backed up
 your personal data, and tested your backup to make sure you can still access it, then you should erase everything that you backed up. Do not allow your personal information to fall into unknown hands.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. As there are so many questions within my question I was waiting for more replies before I responded but apparently this isn't as exciting a topic as I thought it would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; How can I find the data files for the games. That was part of my original question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I believe windows 10 has disk image software. If I make a disk image will I be able to restore just the apps and data without overwriting the new installation of the OS installed by the manufacturer?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I understand privacy issues and backing up personal data. I doubt there is very much personal data on the one month old computer owned be a 13 year old who likes to play games and does his homework using Google Docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; again the computer crashes frequently so I may not be able to copy the HD without taking it out and running it as an external drive. Any suggestions on how to get what I need to off the drive if this is the case?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I've noticed that alot of files and folders are administrator protected. I can get through that on some but others I can't find a way to access the data. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

I used it to make a image of my windows 7 os before
 I upgraded to windows 10, and I just restored windows 7 just as it was ,with all my apps, and all the updates and all, it makes a complete disk image&nbsp;, without a hitch, it worked fine. when you fist run the program it will ask to make a repair cd, DO IT, you
 can use a simple cd for it. if you need to restore your pc, just boot from that cd and the program will walk you thru the steps. I had my recovery&nbsp; image on my hd, you might want to put in on an external drive or a flash drive.

<p>My hope is to make both a system image and copies of files. According to Lenovo the computer is crashing because of a hardware problem (based on the error message, probably the video card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I made file copies using the buckshot approach. Since I wasn't sure what files I was after I copied everything that allowed me access. I did it by removing the hard drive and running it as an external drive on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I'll put the hard drive back into the computer and try to make a disk image using the utility suggested by Skyrover1961. I'll only use it if I really have to as I'm not entirely confident in Lenovo's diagnosis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'll leave the discussion open for a while to see if any more good ideas come through.</p>

<h2>            Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard - Capital &#34;C&#34; not working.</h2>
                    <p>I have had this desktop set for about 4-6 months.</p>
<p>It works great. The only problem is that the letter "C" can not be capitalized with either the left or right shift key.</p>
<p>The only way that I can get a capital "C" is to use the CapsLock key, and then it will type a capital "C".</p>
<p>It does not appear to be a hardware issue, it almost acts like a software/firmware issue.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Enterprise 64 bit version.</p>
<p>I have switched this keyboard to a different computer with the same symptoms.</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I had the same problem.<br />
Neither updating the software of removing the battery did work for me. <br />
<br />
However, after a while I figured out that one of the function keys (F2) was tilted. I fixed that and now it works.
<br />
<br />
Actually you can reproduce the problem. Press down a function key and try typing. Everything works except for capital c.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
Best<br />
Konstantin<br />

            Update: I did update the software but no change. Called Microsoft to get a replacement and had to pop the batteries out to get the product ID # to process the replacement. Would you believe once I did that and put them back in, it started working? Seriously,
 I used it all day with no issues.&nbsp;

<h2>            Rare replay achievement not working </h2>
                    
<p>Recently purchased rare replay and none of the achievements are unlocking. I've tried the xbox solutions on there support page but still nothing. I've tried different games and the achievements work for that but not rare replay. It's been 4 days now and
 still nothing. Has this happened to anyone before?</p>

<p>You're not alone Chewy - <strong>lots of folks with unlocking issues affecting a lot of various games.</strong></p>
<p>Xbox Live support's solution is telling people to post in the forums, expecting other users to sort problems caused by xbox live
<strong>themselves</strong> - it's not good enough!</p>
