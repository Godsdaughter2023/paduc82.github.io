<h2>            Computer hangs at logon - if workstation service is enabled.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Computer hangs with workstation service enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm currently running Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
I had trouble at the logon screen where you select your user and it says welcome but nothing happens. Alternatively, my cursor will come up, but I cannot do anything and ctrl-alt-del does not work either.<br />
<br />
I did safe mode, turned off the services, and isolated the problem to be the microsoft service workstation. I understand that workstation is essential for a few components, such as connecting to a network drive or a network printer.<br />
<br />
Now I have to work with workstation service disabled, and it is very troublesome for my work. Is there any way around it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Were there any changes or updates made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run Microsoft Safety Scanner for any spyware or malware infection and check if it helps.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing problems while trying to eject my hard disk by clicking the safely remove icon from the notification area. This problem persists only for the hard disk as my pen drives work fine. I tried all solutions available &amp; known to me e.g checking active
 processes that might be using the drive, disabling indexing service on the drive, using process explorer to check for processes that may be using the drive &amp; so on. It says "problem ejecting the drive".</p>
<p>Please provide some help.</p>

<p>Hello !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry but I have&nbsp; already tried that solution but the problem persists.</p>
<p>I am using Microsoft SysInternals Process Explorer to send you exactly what processes are keeping the drive from getting ejected. Request you to find that as an attachment.</p>
<p>Hope it helps. Soliciting a reply.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your decision not to change any services was wise. If you have doubts about any piece of software that you are thinking about removing, please reply with details of that program for further guidance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Start button</li><li>Click Control Panel</li><li>In Control Panel open Add/Remove Programs</li></ul>
<p>This will display a list of all software installed on your PC. Some may be obvious to you whether you need them and some may not. Any that you can say that you definitely do not need can be uninstalled from this window. In general, if you are not sure, it
 will be best to leave Microsoft programs installed. The same applies (though possibly to a lesser extent) to any programs that can be identified as being&nbsp;associated with your PCs manufacturer.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could Google each piece of software for more information about it so that you could make a more informed decision.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the please let us know if you are using two printers.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Meanwhile I would suggest you to open the photo app and select a photo to print and the printer which you want to print from and press ok to print.</div>
<div><br />
Now close the app and restart it and try to print once again and see if the same printer comes as default.</div>
<div>If the issue still persist I would suggest you to run an <strong>app troubleshooter
</strong>and see if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
Please follow the link below to run the troubleshooter:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Excel supports saving directly as a csv file without the need to go via notepad. In the Save As box select the csv file type from the Save as type dropdown box.</p>
<p>You can also remove all the spaces in Excel with the SUBSTITUTE function, e.g.</p>
<p>=SUBSTITUTE(A1," ","")</p>

    <title>ME1 Hidden save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ii the bouk ii  say:</h3>
<h2>            ME1 Hidden save</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, so yesterday I deleted all my ME 1&amp;2 saves because I wanted to start from a clean slate and have solid playthroughs for the imports I would use. However, I noticed after deleting every single ME related save on my Memory Card and HDD, that when
 I went to start a new playthough on ME1 it was still using some sort of save information because it was giving me the option to select an existing character for my new playthrough. Might sound like a stupid question / obvious answer, but I am just assuming
 it's the hidden save file that the&nbsp;Importers use?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install apps after download in Windows 10 store</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone! I just bought my 2-in-1 5 days ago. I've been trying to install applications since then. They download&nbsp;correctly but do not install. When I press&nbsp;install it says completed and then&nbsp;restarts the download.&nbsp;The ones I have on my laptop downloaded
 perfectly without any trouble. I tried everything and I still can't fix this.</p>
<p>I'm using an Iconz E-101 windows 10 2-in-1 2.4 quad core, 2 gb ram and 32 gb internal.
</p>
<p>Low end but very good quality tablet.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help I could get!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Only changes made were via Windows Update, so as it was only the system image that wasn't working, I backed up all my data&nbsp;then&nbsp;recovered &nbsp;back to my last successful system image copy on 11th June 2012, which was just before&nbsp;15 windows update were installed.
 Then I recovered all the data and did a complete backup, without any issues.</p>
<p>I'm now about to re-install the windows updates to try and find out which one caused the problem. Not sure what to do then to get Microsoft to do anything but at lease I'll be happy I have&nbsp;found a reason for the problem.</p>

    <title>Very confused WGA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kj4ips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very confused WGA</h2>
                    It seems I have somehow managed to confuse WGA, my system was activated normally, (the license was purchased directly from micro soft, as part of the ultimate steal program). When I go to download XP Mode (I am running 7 Pro x64) it tells me that my installation
 could not be validated, yet the diagnostics utility says that my install is genuine. Any Ideas?<br />
<br />
The system recently went through a major upgrade, that required a reinstall (UEFI anyone?) and I was wondering if there is some difference from the WGA that the site uses, and the WGA that the diagnostics utility looks at.<br />

            Figured it out! Seems that WGA does not like the user account (I probably missed a junction when re-creating them) Creating a new user fixed the issue.
<div><br />
<div>This is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;a bug in either the activeX control used for WGA or in the Diag utility, as they provide differing results in this scenario.</div>

<p><strong>My computer is a Medion Akoya and only 1 year. Now it recently began freezing the machine, so nothing could be used. This morning it started normally, but after only 5 minutes it crached with a screen first with a lot of colours
 and then the blue screen with white text came up.</strong></p>

<p>"Technical information:</p>
<p>** STOP: 0x0000008E (0xC0000005, 0x8BF8AE5F base at 8BF6C000, &nbsp;Datestamp 4a5bbf11)</p>
<p>Collecting data for crash dump ...</p>
<p>Initializing disk for crash dump ...</p>
<p>Beginning dump for physical memory.</p>
<p>Dumping physical memory to disk&gt; 100"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then started again with F8 and tried to find these numbers - one in a tour, but did'nt get any answears.</p>
<p>I have'nt done any changes on my computer lately, and use a System Mechanic 10 program to keep the computer in good health.</p>
<p>Could you give me a solution please.</p>
</span>

<p>Regards GINIS</p>

<p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>

<p>Can you locate any minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder?</p>
<p>If so, can you copy a few of the minidump files to the Desktop and make available via Windows Live SkyDrive?</p>
<p>One thing you could try is, in Safe Mode, configure the computer to "clean boot" and then see if you can start in Normal Mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Follow Step 1 to clean boot and Step 7 to return to a normal startup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey auggy</p>
<p>Yesterday I got the Akoy up again and there were a lot of updates from Microsoft, which were downloaded. But when it was nearly finished with this, there came a message, that there was a fault and it could'nt put all af the updates in. I copyed then all
 my important files on an external harddisk.</p>
<p>This morning when I started Akoya up - it crached after loading the half of the icons. I then started up in safe mode.</p>
<p>I then used your information and here is the web adress on my folder with the minidump file:</p>

<p>The minidump file showed an IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a) stop error but no third party driver was named as causing the crash.</p>
<p>This may indicate a hardware problem.</p>
<p>However, I would suggest to uninstall both ZoneAlarm and System Mechanic as both of these programs have been known to cause issues in Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>More help with Toshiba WebCams :</p>
<p>Run your mouse around the outside edges of the monitor to see if the camera software is
<br />
running (usually on the left side is a slide out though it can be in other places). Also check
<br />
in the notification area near the clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
On my Toshiba, which is a different model, the camera software is located here :<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Camera Assistant Software for Toshiba\traybar.exe"<br />
<br />
You can use Start - Computer&nbsp; &nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Explorer to navigate to it. That loads the
<br />
slide out on the left edge on monitor and the icon in the notification area.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Be sure to check with your System Maker's Support, on-line documentation and&nbsp;drivers, and
<br />
ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) where there would be others with the same model&nbsp;if a built-in
<br />
WebCam&nbsp;or the actual WebCam Maker if a separate device. Links to Toshiba&nbsp;Support below.<br />
<br />
Check the Start - All Programs Menu for&nbsp;Camera,&nbsp;WebCam, a Folder/Program with the<br />
System Maker's name or similar to see if you can locate the WebCam software.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Sony VAIO - HDMI output spontaneously stopped working - no troubleshooting method has worked</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I realize there are dozens of posts throughout the Web about problems superficially similar to mine. I have spent the last three weeks attempting to resolve this issue by, among other things, consulting forums like this one, yet I have not once found a person
 with the very same problem as myself. I will be as concise and to-the-point as possible.<br />
<br />
I have a Sony VAIO (model VPCEE32FX) laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 installed as the OS, and ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 for graphics. For the last five years, that is, since the day I got this laptop, I have connected the latter to a Panasonic Viera
 TV via the HDMI output on the laptop, to the first of three HDMI inputs on the TV. Since the first day, setting this connection up was as simple as attached the two devices via the HDMI cable, then selecting the external monitor as the display to use via right-click
 on the Desktop and selecting "Screen Resolution." I have never had even the hint of a problem.<br />
<br />
About three weeks ago, my computer was running and the connected TV was displaying the screen as usual. I went outside for about twenty minutes, returned, and found that the TV was off due to a lack of signal (automatic shut-off). I turned it back on without
 the image returning, and thence began my troubles. I did not put my computer into Sleep mode, or do anything whatsoever when I left the room; that never would have caused a problem in the past, but I want to emphasize the bewildering nature of this problem.<br />
<br />
I immediately began running through every troubleshooting step I knew, then researching online for other methods I did not know of. The first thing I did was to unplug and replug the HDMI cable, since sometimes the computer would list the TV as "not plugged
 in" when I would restore my computer from Sleep mode (although I hadn't put it in Sleep mode this time). Next, I tried a different (unused) HDMI cable, with no success. In addition to the HDMI output on my laptop, there is also a VGA output, so I then tried
 a VGA-out to component-in, with no success. I never neglected to adjust the input setting on the TV appropriately. I tried the other two HDMI inputs on the TV with both HDMI cables -- no go. I tried every possible combination of settings in the Screen Resolution
 section of Control Panel, and attempted to switch the screen via Fn+F7 (which always worked in the past) -- no luck.<br />
<br />
I then moved on to drivers. Although there had been no significant change of any kind -- no installations, uninstallations, etc. -- I tried updating, rolling back, uninstalling, reinstalling, deleting, etc. the relevant drivers. No success. I have tried the
 latest drivers available through both the Sony VAIO driver Web page, and the AMD Web page, without success. I tried using Secunia PSI, next, to see if that would detect anything, which it did not.<br />
<br />
I then tried a System Restore point. Restoring the computer to an earlier point did not resolve the problem either. I then tried reinstalling Windows 7 with a clean install. The computer would still not detect the monitor, although when I originally bought
 the laptop, and had a fresh installation of Windows 7 to work with, it immediately detected it. I then tried a factory reset, using the "Assist" button at boot, which restores the computer to its original condition (i.e., with the Sony bloatware) from the
 Recovery partition. No luck. The first time I reinstalled Windows 7, it was truly clean, and without the Sony bloatware, so these were two separate attempts. On each of the Windows 7 reinstallations I went through all of the above steps again, without luck.<br />
<br />
I don't think anything is wrong with the TV itself, as it still displays "snow" when I set it to TV input. At no point was there any trauma of any sort to either the TV or the PC, in the past or recently. Besides, as I mentioned, the strange "disappearance"
 of the monitor from the computer's detected devices occurred suddenly and seemingly without cause.<br />
<br />
I still have the option of spending more money to try a VGA-out to S-Video-in, and a VGA-out to RCA-in with my TV, though I hesitate to do that, as I don't see any chance of that working, since none of the three HDMI inputs nor the component input works. The
 conclusion I am beginning to come to is that the graphics outputs on the GPU itself have spontaneously "gone bad." I'm not an expert, but I do consider myself a competent user, so I have really reached the limit of troubleshooting steps that I can think of.<br />
<br />
I am truly at my wit's end, and have not found any solution on any Web forum or page. Then again, I never found anyone else with the very same problem or who had troubleshooted it as thoroughly as I have. Unless I am overlooking some extremely obvious thing,
 which I doubt, I have no idea what to do. Neither hardware nor software methods have worked so far, but if anyone out there has an idea of what to do, I would be extremely grateful to know about it. My computer works fine without the monitor, but the audio/video
 output to the TV was so clear and good through HDMI that I regret not being able to use it anymore. I have no other use for my TV, so it is now just sitting next to my laptop, gathering dust.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, anyone?<br />
<br />
With sincere thanks,<br />
<br />
Gavin<br />
<br />
p.s. I can provide any additional information, including hardware/software, if needed.

<h2>            Diskpart partitioning disk 0 with Gpt</h2>
                    I am reinstalling Windows 8.1 on an Acer that received a free Windows 10 upgrade. Ran into several errors. I'm afraid I might have a bad hard drive, but the PC does not have on-board diagnostics. While attempting to do a clean install, I received error
 code that Windows cannot be installed on the drive. I believe I can possibly resolve my issue by partitioning disk 0 using diskpart but not sure how to partition disk 0 with Gpt. Can you install the O/S on disk 0?&nbsp; If so, should I clean it first?&nbsp;

<h2>            Can Not Login to Windows 10 after Cleaqn Boot</h2>
                    <p>I have been unable to update my Windows 10 installation to the last two major updates despite multiple tries.&nbsp; Today I tried to update to the Creators Update and got almost all the way through before the update failed (81%).&nbsp; I tried to install by doing
 a clean boot</p>
<p>following&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></p>
<p>When I restarted to start the update&nbsp; I got to the opening login screen but could not login.&nbsp; There were three icons at the bottom right - connect to internet, ease of access, and shut down.&nbsp; Internet access was disabled and I could not do anything at that
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I recover from the clean boot and get back to a normal start?&nbsp; I would appreciate any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that my current windows 10 version number is 1607. I have not been able to update to 1703 nor 1709.</p>

            Hi Michael, <br />
<br />
It seems that your Windows 10 got corrupted due to failed installation of Windows 10 1709. In the meantime, please boot your computer in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode
</a></strong>to check if you can login. <br />
<br />
We would appreciate an update about how it went.

<p>Thank you for your reply. <br />
<br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will not affect the performance of your computer. Since you can't even boot your computer in safe mode, we suggest performing a System Restore to get your
 computer back to its previous state. To do so, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the lock screen, click the <strong>Power</strong> icon.</li><li>While pressing the <strong>Shift</strong> key, click <strong>Restart</strong> to boot your computer to the
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong> screen.</li><li>Under <strong>Choose an option</strong>, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Advanced options</strong>, select <strong>System Restore</strong>.</li><li>Follow the instructions.</li><li>Choose a restore point to get your computer back to its previous states. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.&nbsp; </p>

<h3> human &#40;level 24&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Horrendous frame rate playing Arma 3&#58; Related to System and Compressed Memory&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The last two days I've been seeing horrendous lag when playing Arma 3 (around 5FPS much of the time), which I am pretty much ruling out as being a network connection issue (the problem appeared in an offline scenario also, but it seems worse in Multiplayer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly it comes in 'bursts'. Frame rate will drop to 5fps for say 20 seconds, then I'll have a couple of seconds of smooth play before it drops again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Dell Inspiron 15 with intel i7 and have recently upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have noticed that "System and Compressed memory" is running very high memory consumption (in the region of 1,000mB/s and wondered if this was related.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When just browsing chrome the process is running at about 67mB/ but things seem relatively smooth. I've noticed maybe that some things aren't as quick as I would expect (startup for example) though</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various approaches to fixing this, including;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Complete shut down of system</p>
<p>- Updating drivers for Intel Rapid Storage, nVidia Graphics and BIOS</p>
<p>- Running System File Checker (returned no errors)</p>
<p>- Running a Virus/Malware scan</p>
<p>- Re-Installing Arma 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now clueless about what to do next and very frustrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for the advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have performed a clean boot as suggested but unfortunately the issue has persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a short while (say 15 minutes) the game was pretty low (at around 12 FPS) but was just about playable.</p>
<p>Things later deteriorated to a point where the game was unplayable (around 6FPS).</p>

            <p>Hello Sangeeta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to run the program in compatibility mode, however frame rate was still shockingly bad (perhaps even worse than before) and still unplayable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth noting that the game is being launched via the <strong>steam </strong>
gaming platform, and as such I am not aware whether it is possible to install the game in compatibility mode as such, since the install works through steam. I did however run in compatibility mode by finding the .exe files for the game and modifying its properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It may also be worth noting that the game is launched through more than one .exe file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game first initiates the Arma 3 launcher, in which settings for the game launch are specified.</p>
<p>Then the game itself is run, alongside battleye anti-cheat software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had attempted to run all of these in compatibility mode without any success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human<br />

<h2>            windows types 1s</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting today my windows 10 started randomly typing 1s.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disconnect keyboard, typing stops.&nbsp; If I connect another keyboard, typing starts again.&nbsp; Both keyboards are USB (one keyboard is Perixx PERIBOARD-512, another is standard dell keyboard).&nbsp; I tried to uninstall/update drivers, different USB ports (ports
 are directly on motherboard), nothing helps.&nbsp; For the last hour there was no other characters typed but 1s (I have notebook open, to see what is typing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi VadimKutsyy 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There are three actions which I can recommend. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1903 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4498140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4498140</a>
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hi Vadim
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC

<h2>            Creators Edition&#58;  Problem with Graphics on HP Folio 9480m business-class laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to the Creators Edition last week on an HP Folio 9480m. &nbsp;Over the few days I used it, I started to notice that the graphics were not quite right. &nbsp;There was a bit of a red shift to the colors, especially noticeable in a darkened room, and especially
 when looking at the LCD screen from an oblique angle. &nbsp;It appears when using it in normal laptop mode, and when on a docking station with external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading/installing the Intel graphics driver for this system from HP.com, and saw no change to the look of my screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I reverted back to 1607, and the graphics returned to what I expect as "normal."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone noticed anything like this? &nbsp;Besides tweaking the color settings in the Intel toolbox, are there any corrective actions available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>On your Intel graphic settings, you have to ensure that you are currently on 32bit Color and not the x16 or x8bit color.<br />
<br />
In a few Driver, including intel, a freshly installed GPU driver will default-ly show the lower bit color rate.<br />

            <p>Thanks, this was helpful... I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I went ahead and re-installed the Creators Edition with Gina's advice in mind. &nbsp;After the install was done, the graphics looked normal, and sure enough, the Intel graphics tool told me that I'm on 32-bit color. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure that when I went into the tool when I was having the problem that the setting was 32-bit... but I can't swear to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, my screen is pretty again, and I'm continuing on to try out the new OS. &nbsp;Seems great so far!</p>

<p>Repeat: There is not a Service Pack 1 for Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;last build of Windows 7 RTM came with a version number of <strong>7600</strong></p>
<p>There was a long list of Builds after this from May till June, 2009. Leading the way was<strong>Build 7127
</strong>which was available to Microsoft Connect Testers. It’s 32-bit and 64-bit versions were leaked to Torrent sites. It was built on May 7, 2009. Then came the first known Service Pack 1 build – 7138 – which was released on May 23, 2009. After that the
<strong>Build 7137 </strong>was leaked on May 28. Build 7201 leaked on June 3, 2009 in both versions after it was built on June 1, 2009.</p>
<p>The <strong>Build 7229 </strong>followed, which came with Language Packs on Torrent sites was built on June 4, 2009 and leaked on June 11, 2009 in both the versions. The next build was attached to the Winmain sp branch. It was a precursor to the Service
 Pack 1 build as it made preliminary changes on it. This build, <strong>Build 7227</strong>, was built on June 2, 2009. It was, later, leaked in VHD formats in its x86 version on June 9, 2009. Soon after, the latest available Service Pack 1 build came into
 being in the form of Build 7230. It was built on June 9, 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Build 7231 </strong>and <strong>7232</strong> built on June 8 and June 10, 2009 respectively were both leaked in the x86 and x64 versions through the VHD formats. The latter replaced the betta fish wallpaper with a new one. The betta fish wallpaper
 was the default wallpaper in both the Beta and RC. Another build to leak through the VHD format was<strong>Build 7260</strong>. Built on June 12, 2009, it was leaked on June 17. Yet another build that came with Language Packs on Torrent sites was Build 7264.
 It also leaked in both the x86 and x64 versions on June 30, 2009 after it was built on June 22, 2009.</p>
<p>The Build <strong>7600.16384 </strong>was an important one built on July, 2009. It was leaked two days later in both the x86 and x64 versions when it was uploaded on an OEM copy. This was a copy given to Lenovo of the Windows 7 Ultimate Edition build 7600.
 The copy had a disc image which had the important boot.wim file. It is usually given to PC manufacturers who pre-activate PC’s in a factory. The OEM Activation certificate and the product key were both attached with the file. These two have the ability to
 activate Windows 7 Build in many computer brands like Dell and HP.</p>
<p>However, the authenticity of the product key and the question on if it would be able to make a safe passage from Microsoft’s Genuine Advantage check is uncertain as it could be blacklisted. If this problem arises, then there will be a huge task on the hands
 of OEMs as they will have no option but to recollect all manufactured PCs that have been installed and activated with the blacklisted product key and they would have to install it altogether with a different key.</p>
