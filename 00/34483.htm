<p>Hi Joanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When encountering errors with updating, the Windows Update troubleshooter should always be the first step. Download and run the troubleshooter through this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Just to confirm, do you have trouble when opening Microsoft Edge? If so, can you give us any error messages
 or codes that it shows? Knowing this will give us the troubleshooting to be given that will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>

            Hi marilynwynn, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known SCAM - Microsoft will NEVER phone you . . .
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!
<br />
<br />Do not give them Remote Access to your PC 
<br />Do not give them any personal details 
<br />Do not pay them
<br />
<br />You should hang up on them or possibly threaten them with legal action, then they won't phone you again . . .

<h3> fnewler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect via Ethernet or wirelessly with Vista 32 on laptop, error 814</h2>
                    Hopefully someone can help, I've tried everything I could find online to no avail.<br />
<br />
I have a Gateway laptop MT6458 which I am trying to connect to a wireless Linksys router WRT54GL.&nbsp; I have been able to get the cable modem connected to the router, and its working on my desktop computer running XP without any problems.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've contacted Linksys support and they say it's the laptop, so they can't help.&nbsp; Cable internet provider also said it's probably the laptop.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I try connecting wireless on the laptop, it always says "connecting to the network is taking longer than usual" and results in connection unsuccessful.&nbsp; When clicking Diagnose - options are Low wireless signal, which is not likely I'm right next to the
 router.&nbsp; The network adapter "Marvell TOPDOG (TM) PCI-Express 802.11n Wireless (EC85) is experienceing Driver or hardware related issues, or Make sure your Internet Protocol Bindings are corect, ensure that Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4) and Internet
 Protocol Version 6(TCP/IPv6) are slected in the confuration for the&nbsp;network adapter "Wireless Network Connection".<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled&nbsp;the&nbsp;wireless card and Marvell Yukon 88E8038 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller and rebooted and tried to reconnect, but no luck.&nbsp; In Device Manager, it says both devices are working properly.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I also tried another identical wireless card and getting the same result.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any other suggestions to try?

            Ok, after struggling for several weeks, including replacing the wireless card and trying a new Notebook Adapter, with nothing working...&nbsp; I was able to get this resovled&nbsp;by reinstalling Windows Vista and it worked without any further adjustment or changing
 of settings.&nbsp; Yeaah!

            If you're trying to add your account to another Xbox you only need to login with your Microsoft account and everything syncs. If you're trying to add another account to your Xbox it'd be the same. Just login to that account on your Xbox. If you're attempting
 to accomplish something else we'd need more information about what you're trying to do.

    <title>Unplayable Halo 5 MP, latency issues. Lag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcadamstry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unplayable Halo 5 MP, latency issues. Lag</h2>
                    
<p>I play a lot of online MP games and whilst I don't have great internet, latency has never been a big issue and games like BF4, Destiny, COD have been ok. BUT Halo 5 is completely unplayable. Throw a grenade, it leaves my hand half to a second later. I can
 stand behind someone and unload with head shots and it takes (forever) for any hits to make a mark, but I can instantly be down with no hit shots registering. Regardless, it's completely frustrating and I cannot continue to play unless I find a fix. So far
 I have tried:</p>
<p>Port Forwarding</p>
<p>Calling ISP to have line checkd</p>
<p>Tried Wired and Wireless connections</p>
<p>Changing Modem</p>
<p>- all give the same result. A Mate says it is all to do with how I connect to the servers and there is nothing I can do about it. He is probably right but I am just reaching out to see if anyone else has the issues and can help.</p>
<p>My speed is 10mbs DL 0.9mbs UL with Ping 7. Not great but like I said, I don't have issues with any other game. Telstra is my ISP here in Australia.</p>
<p>Any help would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My best guess is there is no dedicated server near your location.</p>
<p>You've already tried wired so know its not a wifi problem</p>
<p>And port forwarding wont help because dedicated servers don't care if your NAT is open or not.</p>
<p>You may be better of posting in the official forums at halowaypoint.com as 343 staff do read them even if they don't always reply</p>

<p>I am a Time Warner cable customer. In VA. &nbsp;The first couple of weeks I had no issues in Warzone. &nbsp;During the last few days the game is unplayable. &nbsp;30 plus up 6 down speeds. &nbsp;I have made no changes to my settings. &nbsp;All other games work fine. &nbsp; The issue
 is with Halo 5. &nbsp;. Where do we get a refund? </p>

<p>I'm in Australia and games are slow in some playlists but so far the lag seems ok. We must have dedicated servers close by which is good. Just hope a few more players get the game for Christmas so we don't have dead playlists.</p>

<p>I ran into this same problem and contacted CodeMeter directly. Here is the solution and it worked on my Windows 7 Ultimate system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>And we got a solution.</strong> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>You should switch the state of your CmStick from local disk to removable disk.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You can change this with our tool “Code Meter Disc Configuration”.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;CodeMeter-&gt;Tools-&gt;Disc Configuration, then go to the rider “Option” and change the value “Disk Type”.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last step is to unplug the CodeMeter and replug it in and it should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Dirk Watteroth</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

    <title>Using Windows Media Center as a dvr on my TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron 12124  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows Media Center as a dvr on my  TV</h2>
                    <p>I really enjoy watching TV on my PC using Windows Media Center. </p>
<p>Being able to pause it or record programs to watch later is super cool. (It's a shame it's not going to be part of Windows 10, I will miss it if I upgrade.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if I could use it&nbsp; like a stand alone DVR and hook it up to my TV.</p>
<p>If I have the cable connected to the "antenna" connection, and a cable connected to the " TV out"&nbsp; on&nbsp; my computer&nbsp; and connect that to the TV would that do the trick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using standard coaxial cable . There is no cable box to contend with .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to connect the cable to my computer then to my TV and use Windows Media Center as the DVR part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Hauppauge Win TV HVR-1800 tuner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Ron</p>

<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling the game won't affect your saved data at all, so you shouldn't have to worry about that. The only instance I can think of that would cause hardcore glitching like that to the Bedrock/W10 version of Minecraft would be if you
 had the "Beta" version of the game installed that is available through the Xbox Insider Program. I've got that version and it does funky stuff all the time because it serves to test all the new game features as they're coded in. Your best bet would be to un-enroll
 your console from that game preview ring through the insider hub. Doing this will temporarily lock you out of any worlds saved on any of the new updates provided by that version until that update is publicly released.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not the case for you, then uninstalling and reinstalling the game or hard restarting your console could most likely fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            All mouse suddenly stops working</h2>
                    I've been facing a strange issue, my usb mouse will suddenly stop working, even if I change to a different mouse it won't work either. When it happens there's no warning or anything, the touchpad continues to work, but all mice stops working. The usb port
 works fine for other devices like pen drive, just the mouse won't work. A restart is necessary for the mouse to work again. Also I checked the device manager when it happens, it says the mouse is functioning normally. Has anyone faced this before? What could
 be causing it?

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you've experienced with your USB mouse could be a hardware or software-related issue, could be that some settings on your laptop were not properly configured, or there may be changes on your laptop that has caused the mouse to stop working. To
 help us figure out what may have caused this problem, help us verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a wired or wireless USB mouse?</li><li>How many mice have you tried so far?</li><li>Was the touchpad disabled or turned off while using the USB mouse?</li><li>Were there any changes or updates performed prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>While waiting for your feedback, we suggest running the hardware troubleshooter to help us identify and address hardware-related problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <em>Cortana search</em>, type in <em>Troubleshooting</em>.</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search results.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>, click it and hit <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.<br />

            I use wired mouse normally, the wireless one didn't work when the issue starts. I've tried 3 mice so far. Touchpad is always on. Sept windows update, nvidia driver update, troubleshoot was no help. I'll switch to the wireless mouse and test for a bit,
 see if it reoccur.

<p>That's one good way to isolate if the problem only occur when using a wireless mouse. Do let us know how it goes so we can further check on it. By the way, can you recall if the issue started after the NVIDIA driver update?

            <p>Hello baybee rose,</p>
<p>Although your post is quite vague, i did some research and was able to find an &nbsp;article that may be related to the issues you are experiencing. Are you having installation issues with an update package<strong>(.<em>net framework 2.0 : NDP20-KB917283-86.MSP)?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>This problem occurs because Windows Installer must load the cached installation database and all updates when Windows Installer performs any maintenance installations, such as uninstallations. If packages for those updates do not exist in the Windows
 Installer cache, Windows Installer tries to find the updates from earlier source directories</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>To further troubleshoot this issue, refer to the link below for tips.</strong></p>

            Hi there!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice, its greatly appreciated. I believe my XP is a dinosaur now! There are so many things that I couldn't open, I lost my files on Excel, Word, etc.
<br />
<br />
I downloaded your link clwireg-x86.exe and I opened it showed the MS .NET SP2 Correction Tool has been successfully completed! I tried to run it as "Administrator" and tried to type in my password and it locked me out?&nbsp; There must be really odd thing going
 on with my pc.<br />
<br />
All my MS Office Professional 2003 applications disappeared, I've been getting PRO11.msi error and I should reinstall the software, blah, blah. I am frustrated with it already.<br />
<br />
Also, when I run my Windows Update it would always show me that I need high priority update on MS .NET SP1 and Microsoft Silverlight, but the installation will always fail on both!<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway guys!<br />
<br />
Keep up your good work...<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows started putting some folders in two places at same time, won&#39;t display in some programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>in the last couple of weeks I have noticed that Windows (I'm using Windows 7) has started acting up with its folder allocation. First I noticed that a new folder I created for some music files was not being detected when I tried to open the folder in a music
 editing program (Adobe Audition). If I created a new folder in a different location and copied the files into that, suddenly Audition would recognise the folder. A few days alter I noticed that in addition to this, when I copied a disc onto my computer, having
 selected a new folder for the files to be copied to, Windows would create a second mirror copy of the folder and files and place it in another location not of my choosing (all of this is happening within my Music library folder). Some folders I had cut from
 my 'working on' folder, to paste in my archive folder of stuff that's done, and Windows made two copies of each of these - one where I had pasted it, and other weirdly within a completely separate folder in my archive. For some reason Windows has decided to
 put ghost copies of several such things within this particular unrelated folder. So, if I modify the files in one folder, they are automatically modified in the other; if I try to delete one copy of this folder, it deletes both; and if I try to cut and paste
 the mis-allocated folder and put it back where it should be (ie where there is already the original copy) Windows says it can not do this because the folder destination matches the original location. I can not figure out how to remove these extraneous doubled-up
 folders, which are creating a lot of confusion when trying to figure out where my files are and which ones to edit. Nor can I find any way or making Windows return to its proper filing system, which up until recently has had none of these problems.</p>

            <p>Music Library is not a folder, it's just a search definition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Libraries are really just XML files that define a search criteria.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The real gist you need to know is that libraries are not folders.&nbsp; They are really just a quick search of several places.&nbsp; Try this:&nbsp; right-click the Documents library and go to properties.&nbsp; This will tell you what locations that library is searching.&nbsp; Every
 time you open the Documents library, it does an instant scan of those places, and tells you everything it found.&nbsp; Those aren't extra copies of the files, it's just search results. If you delete something, you are deleting the one and only original, wherever
 it happened to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might ask "well what's the point of a library?"&nbsp; I'm glad you (might have) asked.&nbsp; The reason is because you might have a lot of places.&nbsp; Take me for example.&nbsp; I have some movies on my hard drive.&nbsp; I have a lot more moves on an extra drive (they won't
 all fit on the main drive).&nbsp; Plus my roommate has some movies on his drive.&nbsp; With a library, I have one Videos library that instantly searches all those drives and gives me one single combined view of all our movies.&nbsp; Now I can see all my movies in my library
 at once, regardless of which drive they are on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files aren't duplicated or moved, you're just seeing a listing of them, like a phone book or Google Search Results.</p>

    <title>Can I connect my surface to my Win 7 Home laptop via usb&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartellis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I connect my surface to my Win 7 Home laptop via usb&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot find a way to copy my music across from my laptop to my Surface in a way that maintains all the files in the correct folders. My music is currently managed using WMP and I have tried copying my music library across overthe network but this ended
 up with album folders and music files all over the place. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homegroup does not appear to work Win 7 either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a better way to manage my music as I am hoping that connecting to my laptop via USB will yield better results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>No, they both have USB A ports which mean they are both host devices and without software it is not possible to make host devices communicate with each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say Homegroup does not work but with one caveat it does. When both devices are on the same homegroup the PC will not be able to see the files on the Surface but they should work the other way round in that the Surface can access the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason I can think of as to why the copy might be corrupted is if you are using media server view to pick up the files. In that format files are grouped according to tag values such as Album Artist, Genre etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In desktop mode type WindowsKey+R to bring up the run box and enter 
\\<em>PCName\</em><em> </em>(your PCs network name). As soon as you type the last backslash you should get a list of shares off of the PC one of which should be My Music. Select that and you then get a folder view of the Music share. You can then pull in
 the files you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the PC files showing on the right click on the outline arrow in front of Music under Libraries on the left pane (don't click on Music itself) which will reveal the My Music folder on Surface. Drag folders in the right pane onto Libraries\Music\My Music
 in the left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fon't forget storage space on the Surface is limited.</p>

            <p>The Surface refuses to join my Win 7 laptop using the Homegroup. I have read that this is normal and I need Win 8 Pro on the laptop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried copying my music across using the network and a USB stick into Music under My Music but its still not worked properly. The majority of my albums are showing as Unknown Album or have missing tracks. On my laptop WMP has saved my albums under Music/Artist/Album
 and this seems to confuse the surface. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really need a decent syncing piece of software for my music. This does feel like a major oversight by MS as most people buying a tablet would not know where to start doing this sort of thing and would just expect it to sync with their library. This is
 rapidly becoming a big bug for me.</p>

            <p>No it is not normal. I can see my WHS and my Win7 PCs both at a library and at a file level quite successfully from the Surface the only limitation is the other way. I have done nothing special and the Surface uses the Live ID whereas the Win 7 PC has a
 local account and does not know the Live ID user so must be using homegroup permissions to allow access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For them to show as unknown album the tracks have to be missing the data from the ID3 tag information. Do you have WMP updating the tag info. WMP can store the info in its library database which is not then in the file info. Also do you have WMP set to reorganise
 files according to track info. This can break up albums into multiple folders where a secondary artist is involved.</p>

            <p>When I try and use Homegroup my Surface just trys to connect, then after about 1 min it comes back and claims the HG could not be found but it still lets me try and join it again. Really not sure what else I can do as I have tried making sure all sharing
 is available. I can map network drives ok but just cannot join the HG. I am using Win 7 Home, would that make a difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the music I let WMP download all track info and as far as I can tell on the dozen or so I have checked all track info is there under Explorer detail view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked but none of my albums appear to have sub folders for separate artists, the lowest level folders are at album then CD level.</p>

            <p>I don't know how many you have but I would remove HG from all PCs (and Surface), reboot them&nbsp;then recreate the group one at a time. The important thing is the 1st PC should not identify a HG still in existance on the network. Because it only has a one way
 connection you can't start with the Surface so I would begin with the Win7 PC unless you have a home server. I found one time that PCs wanted to join an existing homegroup when nothing was in that group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homegroup is available in all versions of 7 (+8, RT), it would be rather pointless if it wasn't. There is no "master" for a homegroup, even the 1st PC in the group is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there are no "rules" the fairly standard directory structure would be Music\Artist\Album and the split tends to happen at the artist. I would find a folder for artist X and one for artist X with Y and the same album in the next directory for both
 of them with some tracks in one and one or 2 in the other. I edit the ID3 tag so that the song features the extra artist and the primary artist only is in the artist field. That then concatenates the 2 directories.</p>

            First sorry for the troubles.
<br />Many many users are experiencing Windows update issues since the Spring update.
<br />Chance are your apps are not compatible with the feature update of Windows.
<br />You can either try uninstalling and reinstalling the apps that are not working OR you can do a rollback until either the software vendor or Microsoft come out with an update to make them compatible. 
<br />
<br />To rollback go to start - settings - update and security - recovery - go back to previous build.
<br />
<br />Select to go back to previous build.
<br />Once that is done then below is a link on how to stop the update for awhile.
<br />Use that after you rollback.

            <p>Hello, </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We know it's frustrating when things don't work as expected. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may please check in the BIOS boot order, if the hard disk is set as first boot option.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>BIOS Disclaimer: </strong><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to run Startup repair from Advance boot option. <br />
It may ask you to insert the Installation DVD/USB while doing startup repair. </div>
<div><br />
You have to create an installation media for that. </div>
<div>You may download an ISO from the below link:</div>
<div><br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once your media is ready follow the steps.</div>
<div><br />
•&nbsp;After you boot your computer using Windows 10 CD/ DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.<br />
•&nbsp;Select the correct time and Keyboard type. <br />
•&nbsp;Click on Repair your computer in the lower left corner.<br />
•&nbsp;Select Troubleshoot from Choose an option screen.<br />
•&nbsp;Click on Advanced options in Troubleshoot screen.<br />
•&nbsp;Click on Automatic Repair from Advanced Options screen.<br />
•&nbsp;Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.<br />
•&nbsp;Windows 10 will look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
If the automatic repair doesn’t work, then try to rebuild the Windows boot sector from the Windows RE command prompt.</div>
<div>To do so, follow the steps given below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>1. Boot the computer using Windows 10 installation media.<br />
2. In the “Windows Setup” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.<br />
3. Click on “Repair your computer” from the lower left corner.<br />
4. from the “Choose an option screen”, click on “Troubleshoot”.<br />
5. In the “Advanced Options” screen, select “Command Prompt”.<br />
6. Now type the following commands at the Windows RE command prompt and press Enter after each command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup<br />
c:</p>
<div>cd boot</div>
<div>attrib bcd -s -h -r</div>
<div>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</div>
<div>bootrec /RebuildBcd</div>
<div>7. Restart the computer and check if you are able to boot the computer successfully.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</span></p>

    <title>Gamertag Change Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im kinda frosty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag Change Problem</h2>
                    
<p>ok so i have this really weird problem and i don't know how or why it happened. so earlier today i decided i wanted to change my gamertag and was just fooling around typing in different gamertags and i finally found one i wanted and it said it was available.
 so, keeping the gamertag in mind i just typed in some others to see if i was sure i wanted this new one. i couldn't find any better ones so i typed in the one i thought was good and had just said was available again and it said the gamertag was taken. i honestly
 didn't think someone had taken it in the 5 minutes between when it said it was available and when it said it wasn't so i decided to message the gamertag. i typed it in and it said "this gamertag is not on xbox live" or something like that so i went back and
 tried to change it again but it said "gamertag is already taken". the gamertag was Fresh n Frostyy and after a little toying with it i figured that if i typed anything starting with "Frosty" it was always unavailable. for example i typed in Fresh werg556k
 and it said it was already and a bunch of other random things following the word Frosty. it seems to me that for whatever reason xbox has blocked me from using any gamertag starting with "Frosty" and i dont know why. if anyone could help or explain why this
 happened that would be great and any feedback at all or saying this has happened to you before would be appreciated, thanks</p>
