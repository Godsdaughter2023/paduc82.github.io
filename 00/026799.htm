            Go to <a href="http://m.opera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://m.opera.com</a> and download the latest 5.1 beta. I guess it is possible to update using that link.

            @krizanand-5.1 beta?<br />
Is the x3-02 a symbian phone?<br />
Because the beta is for symbian phones,while the final version for java phones has already been released.

<p>I can't delete it.Tried from the phone and from the memory,it is protected.</p>
<p>Im thinking,if the changes from 5.0.08 version are not significant to 5.1 i'll just let it as it is..</p>

As a last try you can go to <a href="http://mini.opera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://mini.opera.com</a> and try to download 5.1 version. @romperompe It just came out of oversight. Anyway the link is going to detect the device and will show the 5.1mini first.

            I got the same issue. You cant update opera because it's protected. Opera Mini was already installed before I bought x3-02.

<h2>            Word &#38; Power Point Conversion to PDF---hyperlinks do not work</h2>
                    I have Mac Office 2011. I cannot save Word files or Power Points as PDFs that preserve clickable hyperlinks. &nbsp;I've wasted hours searching online for an answer on Mac, MS, and Adobe forums, and find only overly complex solutions to more complex problems.
 &nbsp;This should be simple: neither Save as PDF nor Print to PDF yields a PDF with functioning links. What can I do?

<p>You need to put the BH-104 in pairing mode before the phone will see it. To out the headset in pairing mode, press and hold the power button on the headset for at around 5 seconds until the green light starts flashing quickly.</p>

<h2>            What I have to do to get new builds to install correctly</h2>
                    <p>1. Turn defender off</p>
<p>2. Turn firewall off</p>
<p>3. Run troubleshooter as administrator to repair windows update</p>
<p>4. do a clean boot</p>
<p>5.Then change updates from slow to fast</p>
<p>6. check for updates</p>
<p>7. sit back for a couple of hours while the newer build installs/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stay on slow ring until I see that there is a new build then go through the above procedure.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; hope the final version has all this stuff fixed.</p>

<p>Hi Sathish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience caused by the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, as you’re not encountering the issue when you open the Excel application in safe mode, so the problem occurs due to add-ins in Excel application. We suggest you inactivate the add-ins one by one to check which causes the problem.
 To do it, follow the below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Open the Excel application&gt; File&gt; Options&gt; Add-ins</p>
<p>b. In the Manage box, select the Add-ins type (Excel Add-ins, COM Add-ins etc.) which are in active.</p>
<p>c. Unselect the Add-in&gt; click on OK and restart your Excel application. Now check whether the Excel application is working normal or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Uncheck the Add-in one by one to find out which Add-in is causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, we also suggest keeping your Office applications up to date. You can refer to this
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to check the latest version of Office application related to your Office channel. If your applications are not update, please update them to latest version for better experience.</p>
<p>To update Office applications: Open any Office application&gt; File&gt; Account&gt; Update Options&gt; Update Now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you need any help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

            Keyboard shortcuts aren't always universal. While most applications will respect the most common keyboard shortcuts like Cut, Copy, Paste and Undo, that doesn't mean the application developer can't assign a different keyboard shortcut.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I don't have an extended keyboard to test what you're seeing. I don't find any other keyboard combination that will move to the beginning or end of a sentence, only to the beginning or end of a paragraph or the current line.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please be sure to let Microsoft know you'd like to see this feature in future versions by using the Help --&gt; Send Feedback mechanism in any Office application.</div>

    <title>MS Access Forms, subforms, comboboxes, queries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access Forms, subforms, comboboxes, queries</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am trying to make a form that will search my contacts table by name, and then populate all of the records fields, ie phone, email etc, into textboxes that can be edited if need be. I also have a subform that when a name is selected it will grab
 that contacts employerID and then with that I want to grab data from my BuisnessContact table because I don't keep address with each contact, just in the buisnesscontact table. I have another table that is for Contacts address, but that is only used if a contact
 has a different mailing address the the company he/she works for. I had the address portions (the buisness address, and then if possible a Other address in a tab control but I had to remove it bc it was causing to many problems. I have attached pictures below
 of my tables, forms and queries I am using with this form. I have a couple of questions pertaining to the form so I'm just going to number them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I go to click on the BuisnessAddressSubForm I get an error(displayed in pic) saying changes made to the table were not successful because they would create duplicate keys. Now I am assuming that what is happening is that Access is trying to append
 a record to Contacts Table with the data that is displayed on the form currently. This happens if I refresh as well. How can I stop this? and is it stoppable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) My BuisnessAddressSubform does not update like I want it too. After selecting the name at the top of the form, what should happen is the BuisnessID text box in the sub form should be updated with the correct BuisnessID once the Search combo box is changed
 (using the change event). The Buisness ID changes but none of the other fields do. I tried having the BuisnessAddress subform record source set to a select query that would select the appropiate fields where the BuisnessID (buisnessContactsTable) matches the
 employerID (contactstable). This did not work, I also tried to build an event to get the fields I need once the BuisnessID in the subform is changed, bc this is the only control in the subform&nbsp; that actually does change. I would also like this to be locked,
 meaning I don't want people to be able to edit the data</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) For a contacts other address (different from company address) I want the subform to work similarly to the BuisnessAddressForm, but instead of BuisnessID I would use employeeID. I want this to be editable data, unlike the other</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) After I got both of these subforms working, if I put them into a tab control will that in any way make the subform not work, I know tough to answer but in principal. Just asking bc of one I want to be able to edit one and the other would be just to show
 to the person searching</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) The button run Query is for an update query which just simply updates the contact table. When I click this several windows pop up, one for you are about to run an update query and then one for you are about change x number of records. I there a way to
 have a custom pop window, instead of the two default ones. I want it to say "Thanks for doing it correctly"</p>
<p>I am new to Access and am trying to build a database for my Manufacturing Company. I am sorry if I messed up the community
 rules, and sorry for Writing so sloppy on some of my attached pics. Please help me out!!</p>

<p>Without knowing your data structure it's hard to say, but based on the error I'd suspect that you don't have your Subform Control's Master and Child link set correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Master field should be the Primary Key value of the "Parent" record (the main form record). The Child field should be the field in your "Child" table (your subform's recordsource) where that value would be stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your Search issue: Again, without knowing much about your database it's hard to say. Can you show the code you're using to search with that box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not need to "run a query" to update anything in Access, especially for simple matters like this. If you use a bound form, Access will automatically save your data edits for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said - it's very important that you ensure your tables are correctly setup before you get too far along in your database work. Can you show us your table schema? You can do that by taking a screenshot of the Relationships window.</p>

            OK, First, to create a search combo where you can select a name and retrieve that record you can use the combobox wizard (third option). this will walk you through the process.
<br />
<br />Second, if the subform is linked to the Main form on EmployerID, then the subform will display the Employer information what whatever record is active. 
<br />
<br />Third, the error message about duplicate values is because you did not create the search correctly. it looks like you are not retrieving but copying a record and that's trying to create a duplicate. Without seeing the code you are using behind the search that's just an educated guess. I would scrap what you have done and use the combobox wizard.
<br />
<br />This also bears on the problem marked 2). 
<br />
<br />An embedded subform, need to be linked to a field in the mainform record. If it is, then the corresponding record will be shown. So i would check your links.
<br />
<br />Putting subforms on a tab page won't affect the way they work. 
<br />
<br />For question 5) we really need to see the code you are running. But you can use DoCmd.SetWarnings False to suppress the messages and then use a MsgBox to display your own message. Be sure to use a SetWarnings True to turn them back on

<p>I set up the link properly now, but It still doesn't update when I search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the code for the search combo box at the top of the form</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Namecbo_Change()<br />
Me!EmployeeIDtxt = Me!Namecbo.Column(1)<br />

Me!BuisnessAddressSubForm1.Form.BuisnessIDcbo = Me!Namecbo.Column(2)</p>

Me!Statetxt = BuisnessIDcbo.Column(4)<br />
Me!Zipcodetxt = BuisnessIDcbo.Column(5)<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>To clarify by a form being bound, you mean if the form has a record source? Bc I have the record source set to Contacts (the table), before I put the update query, I had the save record button, but it would append the record present in the form instead of
 updating the existing record.<br />

            I think that you might be in danger of digging yourself into a hole by overcomplicating what is in essence a relatively simple model.&nbsp; Let's go back to first principles.<br />
<br />
BusinessContacts is a sub-type of Contacts in that a business contact shares all attributes of a contact, but not those of other sub-types.&nbsp; A business contact might also be a personal contact of course.&nbsp; A type hierarchy is modelled by a one-to-one relationship
 type, so the Contacts table would have a primary key ContactID say, which can be an autonumber for convenience.&nbsp; Other non-key columns in the table would represent attributes common to all contacts.&nbsp; In the BusininessContacts table the primary key ContactID
 would not be an autonumber, but a straightforward long integer data type.&nbsp; It would also be a foreign key referencing the primary key of Contacts.<br />
<br />
Each table modelling a sub-type can have its own address columns.&nbsp; This might, at first glance appear to contradict the principle stated above that a sub-types attributes are not shared by other sub-types.&nbsp; This is not the case.&nbsp; The fact that the address attributes
 in each sub-type table have the same names does not mean that they are the same attributes.&nbsp; They are simply same-named attributes.&nbsp; A CityID column in each table would represent the city as an attribute of that sub-type, not of all other sub-types.&nbsp; A contact
 is very likely to have a business address in one city, and a personal address elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The user interface can be a Contacts form, with subforms for each sub-type, linked on ContactID in each case.&nbsp; Each subform can be on a separate page of a tab control with no problem.&nbsp; A common interface in similar situations is to have the primary data from
 the Contacts table in the detail section of the parent form, with secondary data from the same table on page 1 of a tab control.&nbsp; The other pages of the tab control will each have a subform based on one of the referencing tables, which might be subtypes or
 other tables referencing Contacts in a one-to-many relationship type.<br />
<br />
When it comes to attributes like email addresses and phone numbers, having multiple columns in a table for primary, secondary instances of each attribute is bad relational database design.&nbsp; It 'encodes data as column headings'.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the
<br />
The correct design would be to have related Emails and Phones tables in which each email address or phone number is represented by a value in a single column.&nbsp; So a contact with two email addresses would have two rows in the related table.&nbsp; In the related table
 it is also necessary to differentiate business, personal addresses etc, so an Emails table would be along these lines:<br />
<br />
Emails<br />
….ContactID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….ContactCategoryID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….EmailAddress<br />
<br />
This table is 'all key', i.e. its primary key is a composite one made up of all three columns.&nbsp; The Phones table would be similarly structured.&nbsp; You can if you wish add an IsPrimary column of Boolean (Yes/No) data type to indicate which is the primary address
 or phone, or you might want to number the addresses or phones per contact 1,2 etc to indicate their priority.&nbsp; ContactCategoryID would reference the primary key of a ContactCategories table in which there would be one row per category of contact.&nbsp; In relational
<br />
A phones table would probably also have, in addition to the ContactID foreign key,&nbsp; a PhoneTypeID column as a foreign key referencing a PhoneTypes table with rows for landline, mobile (cell-phone) types, and any others you might think of.<br />
<br />
For data entry there would be, within each sub-type subform further subforms based on queries which, for example would restrict the email addresses or phone numbers on the ContactCategoryID value relevant tom that subform.&nbsp; The DefaultValue property of a hidden
 ContactCategoryID txt box control in the subform would be the relevant value for that subform.<br />
<br />
With a logically structured model like this you should have little trouble putting together the form, its subforms and their subforms.&nbsp; In each case the LinkMasterFields and LinkChildFields properties would be ContactID.<br />
<br />
For searching via an unbound combo box in the form header you can navigate to the relevant contact with code in its AfterUpdate event procedure, which first finds the contact in the form's RecordsetClone, and then synchronizes the form's Bookmark with the recordset's
 bookmark.&nbsp; You'll find a simple example in FindRecord.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file, in addition to simply going to a contact record, there are illustrations of how to navigate or filter a form in other ways, including searching on the basis of a value in a subform.<br />
<br />
In the same OneDrive folder is a TypeHierarchy demo, which provides a simple illustration of a model for this, using a hypothetical academic institution as its example, along with one type of interface for such a model.<br />
<br />
As regards executing your queries, calling the Execute method of the current database object will avoid the prompts.&nbsp; This also accepts a dbFailOnError option, which will enable you to trap and handle any error which might occur in the execution of the query.&nbsp;
 To indicate successful execution of the query would merely be a matter of calling the MsgBox function if no error has been raised.<br />

            A relational database models the reality in terms of its entity types and the relationship types between them.&nbsp; Each table should model a real world entity type, with each non-key column in the table representing an attribute of the entity type which is
 functionally determined solely by the whole of the table's key.&nbsp; Where an entity is of two or more entity types simultaneously one is a (super) type of the other as a sub-type.&nbsp; In your case contacts is a super-type of business contacts.&nbsp; Other types of contact
 are other sub-types.<br />
<br />
Other relationship types in the database, such as that between contacts and jobs are modelled, as you have&nbsp; done, by a table which resolves the many-to-many relationship type into two or more one-to-many relationship types.&nbsp; Having separate JobNames and JobData
 table in a one-to-one relationship type serves no purpose, however.&nbsp; The two can be coalesced into a single table with no data loss.<br />
<br />
In your case non-business contacts should be a sub-type of contacts, and the one-to-many&nbsp; relationship type with addresses should be between the sub-type and the addresses table.<br />
<br />
All tables containing address data should be decomposed.&nbsp; At present they contain transitive dependencies in that Town determines State, so State is not functionally determined solely by the key, but transitively via Town.&nbsp; Each referencing table containing
 address data should have a TownID column (town names are not suitable keys as they can legitimately be duplicated) referencing a Towns table, which in turn references a States table. All the relationship types should be enforced to protect the integrity of
 the data.&nbsp; These are easily corrected faults, however.&nbsp; The principal issue is that of modelling contacts as a type hierarchy.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at DatabaseBasics.zip in the same OneDrive folder to which I gave you a link earlier.&nbsp; As it's name suggests, this provides an introduction to some of the principles and methodologies of relational database design, and includes
 explanations of how the various relationship types are used to model the reality with which the database is concerned.&nbsp; Other demos which you might find helpful are Normalization.zip and Relationships.zip.&nbsp; The former provides as simple as possible (but no
 more so) introduction to normalization, which is at the heart of relational database design.&nbsp; The latter shows how relationships are built across a database to achieve the final model, using a simple medical prescriptions database as its example.<br />
<br />
There is no reason why you should not be able to edit data following a search.&nbsp; It's merely a case of navigating to a record in the parent form.&nbsp; Provided that, and its subforms are based on updatable recordsets, you'll be able to edit data at will.<br />

<p>I agree with Ken that you are making a simple task over complicated. It appears you have a bound form, but your code is populating the controls of this bound form with data that already exists in your table. That's the cause of the error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code is unnecessary. If you use the Search combo as I recommended. Access will create everything for you and it will RETRIEVE the correct record which will result in the subforms correctly linking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So when Im consolidating to the table strategy you suggested, the phone numbers all grouped together, the email addresses, and the addresses all in their separate tables. I believe you want me to have both the business contacts, and the employees of the
 businesses in the same table, but the ID's are the same numbers(duplicates). They both start at 10,000 and each time a new one is added on to produce the new ID. Can I solve this by instead adding 1 in front of the employeeID and a 2 in front of the businessID?
 SO they would be 110,000... and 210,000... and now I don't have any duplicate IDs. Or a different ID system just one where there won't be duplicates between and employee and employer.</p>

<p>While I agree with Ken that a person is a person whether an employee or business contact, it would depend on how you treat employees within your app. If they are just treated as a contact then yes, you have one table with a field to indicate the type of
 contact. But if you are using the employee table for Human resources purposes,&nbsp; then I would have a separate table or, more likely,&nbsp; a separate app for HR and linking to the data in this app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the ID field is an Autonumber, you won't be able to change or maintain your numbering system. If its not, then yes you can do as you suggest.</p>

            A type hierarchy models a reality where two entities can be of more than one entity type.&nbsp; This is a fundamental concept of data modelling.&nbsp; There is much in the literature on the subject.&nbsp; Date devotes a whole chapter to it in his seminal work on relational
<br />
In your case the entity types are contacts, business contacts, and other contacts.&nbsp; The last two are sub-types of the first.&nbsp; Each entity should be identified by a distinct key, ContactID say, which is the same throughout the database, whether as the primary
 key of the tables modelling the type and the sub-types, or as a foreign key in a table modelling a different entity type.&nbsp; Usually the primary key of the root table, Contacts in your case, would be an autonumber, with the primary keys of its sub-type tables
 being of long integer number data type.&nbsp; As the values of these keys are arbitrary they would never be exposed to the user.<br />
<br />
If there is a cogent business requirement for business contacts and other contacts to be identified by their own identifiers, you can, in addition to the ContactID primary keys in the two sub-type tables, also have a separate candidate key column in each.&nbsp;
 The values of these would be distinct within each table, but can be duplicated across the tables, so there is no reason to depart from your current numbering system.&nbsp; It would of course mean that a contact who is both a business contact and an other contact
 type would have different numbers in each table, which might be confusing.<br />
<br />
I'm not quite sure what you mean by <em>'…have both the business contacts, and the employees of the businesses in the same table'</em>.&nbsp; If by
<em>business contact</em> you mean a corporate entity, then that is a different entity type from a person and has different attributes, so should be modelled by a Companies table or similar.&nbsp; The BusinessContacts table would, in addition to contacts who are
 business contacts in an individual capacity, include any contact personnel from a company, and would have a CompanyID foreign key column to identify the company for which they are a contact.<br />

            Note that the file format selected at File | Options | Save applies to untitled documents, that is, documents that have not yet been saved to disk. If you use Save As with an existing document, Word will suggest the format of that file.

            I should have said created from the Word application. These are docs created from an export from Filemaker; they are exported as tab-sep and then opened in Word (either through Windows or Unicode conversion).&nbsp;

            So you are saying that there is no way to set a default format when opening up docs already saved (as, for example, tab-sep)? It just seems screwy (and causes more work) that Word would not have its own format (doc or docx) as a default format. But if
 that's the reason, I guess I'll submit a suggestion.

            <p>With some file formats, such as PDF,&nbsp;Word will always suggest that you resave in *.docx format when you try to save.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, most formats that Word supports, including *.txt, does not work that way. Word assumes that you want to rename the document but keep the same format.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like there is something about the files that Filemaker is creating that makes Word think they are text documents. Is Filemaker saving as .doc or .docx format? I would suggest a call to Filemaker support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you could write an intercept to the SaveAs command (possibly SaveAs2?) that always defaults to .docx format. Such a command may have unforeseen consequences, though.</p>

            <p>The Filemaker files are straight tab-sep files, much as Excel would create; they aren't doc or docx--they are tab.&nbsp;<br />
I don't have any knowledge of intercept commands--will have to check it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the question we all are asking.&nbsp; And Microsoft is not forthcoming.&nbsp; I have been a MS user since the early '80s.&nbsp; Pre-internet I even had a Jornada 720, which I absolutely loved.&nbsp; Alas, MS has lost its way.&nbsp; Their purpose is unclear, their communication
 horrid.&nbsp; In the words of many others, I have not left Microsoft, Microsoft has left me.&nbsp; I'm to the point where I am so frustrated by the company's lack of communication that I am seriously considering quitting my job (very MS-centric), and going all Google.&nbsp;
 I currently have a MS Surface Pro 3 and 950XL phone.&nbsp; The phone's front camera stopped working last year (software, I'm sure) and lately I have been experiencing the random reboot, freezing, overall suckishness.&nbsp; So sad.&nbsp; It really is the best phone OS.&nbsp; Too
 bad MS hates it so much.&nbsp; I don't necessarily want a Pixel 2.&nbsp; But MS is driving me there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And their PC in your pocket idea is DOA.&nbsp; Yeah, I'm a totally geeky person and am still into having multiple desktop machines (some custom built), but that is no longer the majority.&nbsp; The average person's daily computing is handled through their cell phones.&nbsp;
 They simply won't care that the Surface Mobile device can deliver a full PC experience (albeit with a host of peripherals).&nbsp; That ship has sailed and MS is standing at the dock being wistful.&nbsp; The company is ruled by bureaucracy, not visionaries. They will
 come up release their WIN10 everywhere mobile device and no one will care.</p>

<p>Thanks for your opinion. :)<br />
I have Surface Pro 3 too ;) Love it!<br />
Windows 10 Mobile currently is full of bugs and they are doing poor job in fixing those. Have you got new update installed (Insider fast ring)?</p>
<p>As I said from what I see MS is leaving phone market so do I with Windows Phone but maybe there is a chance/hope that they will make a comeback this year? Or should I leave now? Don't know what to do.<br />
Thanks!</p>

            I think that this is the best time to get a new phone you can pick up a brand new never opened or used say a Nokia 930 for about 200 Australian dollars which is about 160 us online and Windows it self is not going awa in fact Windows 10
 is still in infancy so it will be getting support and updates for at least 2 and a half years and that's only talking about Nokia Lumina phones there are other companies producing phones with Windows so that they should be around for a long time yet

<p>Nokia Lumia phones do not exist, the last one was released in September 2014. None of the old Nokia Lumia devices are supported for the latest Creators Update of W10M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft stopped producing mobile phones one year ago and have not said a word about any new hardware coming - ever. There is still a diminishing number of OEMs making handsets, however there is nothing worth mentioning. The "latest" release of the Alcatel
 Idol 4 outside of the US is effectively a year-old design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile for consumers and Business support will be ending in August 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile MS continues to improve the user experience of their products on Android and iOS and Joe Belfiore is ecstatic about "Continue on PC" from your Android. The latest presentations of mobile software at Build were ran from iPhones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Draw your own conclusions.</p>

As I understand Microsoft is leaving mobile market and it's time to leave too. Sadly that MS can't make official statement saying that they left phone market but from everything (their enthusiasm in updating Windows 10, ending support in 2018) we make conclusion
 that MS is retreating.

<p>Nokia Lumia may not be bringing out now products but there are a lot of them still on the market (online) that have never been either use or even opened
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are the phones I was referring to they may not have been made in the last few months but are still very much a Lumia phone and very good value

<p>It's not just the WindowsPhone.&nbsp; Just look at what's happening with the Band 2.&nbsp; And you can lay the blame for this squarely in the lap of Satya Nadella, aided and abetted by&nbsp;"yesmen" acolytes like Panos Panay,&nbsp;Joe Belfiore, and others.&nbsp; Decisions to simply
 walk away from retail products without any notice, announcement, or other form of communication can only come from&nbsp;the highest levels of corporate management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could have some respect if they would just level with us and admit that they have left the retail consumer market to focus on cloud and enterprise software.&nbsp; But they don't, won't, and seem indifferent to the fact that they're leaving customers with decades
 of loyalty twisting in the wind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gag at the thought of having to live in one of the two Evil Empires but as someone else on this thread so eloquently stated, "it's not us who are leaving Microsoft, it's Microsoft that is leaving us."</p>

<p>Right now Microsoft seems to be focused more on devising new user experience crap that no one wants or needs rather than following through with anything in particular. Sort of like innovation for the sake of being innovative to show the shareholders we are
 doing something rather then developin a fully functional product. That combined with their costumer communication is going to cost a hefty deal of supporters.</p>
<p>
I got a Microsoft phone because I needed one cheap and it just happened to be a pretty good device for the price range but the OS has been a strain. I'll admit, it's more the issue of lack of apps (like I still haven't found a good text/code editor, wth!) as
 the system itself has it's merits but if it's own parents don't give half a dookie about it then there's no reason why I would. My next phone is going to be an android and no new fancy gadget is going to change my mind.</p>

    <title>Printing an entire workbook to pdf - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninette farrier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing an entire workbook to pdf</h2>
                    Hello, I have a workbook with 17 tabs that I am trying to print to pdf.&nbsp; The first tab comes out beautifully as 2 pages in landscape, and the next 5 tabs come out perfectly in portrait orientation, but then it locks up and stops responding.&nbsp; I've only
 been able to save the first 6 tabs (7 pages) out of the entire workbook.&nbsp; Is there a limit to how many tabs you can print to pdf?&nbsp; Not sure why it can't produce the entire workbook.&nbsp; The remaining 11 tabs should each be on one portrait style page.&nbsp; I've tried
 several times and it keeps locking up.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated!

<p>
</p><p><span>To troubleshoot the issue, please provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Provide the screenshot of Office 2016 Product Information. To get this screenshot, open Excel 2016 on your system, click

<p>Thanks for your reply, Neha.&nbsp; I tried some different things and finally was able to get the entire workbook by saving it in 3 sections and then combining the sections into one pdf.&nbsp; Not sure why it worked that way, but as long as I was able to get the end
 result, I'm good.</p>
<p>Thanks again!&nbsp; Ninette</p>

    <title>Random excel files wont save or can&#39;t move a tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shivishivi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random excel files wont save or can&#39;t move a tab</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will explain the error to the best of my knowledge and it's a very annoying one!</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>We have excel files that randomly cannot be saved and these seem to be corrupted somehow.</li><li>Saving them causes excel to close with the "saving temporary file" in the task bar being displayed before it closes</li><li>The file can then never be saved again and hence needs to be recreated, it can be opened and everything else seems to work.&nbsp;</li><li>I have performed numerous tests such as deleting every tab in the workbook, paste value links, break links, saving as xlsx, xlsb, xls, opening with excel 2010, removing conditional formatting and still it doesn't save once corrupted.</li><li>I noticed that moving a tab from another workbook into the broken workbook works, but I can't move or copy a tab out of the workbook - it closes excel.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that this is an issue with maybe a 64bit and a 32bit excel that opens the file or something about network locations that leads to a header corruption. I think it's this because I literally am unable to save these workbooks even when there is nothing
 present in the workbook (i.e a new blank tab, rest of the tabs are deleted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue keeps happening and it seems every week about 1-2 files are impacted. Help greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Sh</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may be caused by add-ins that you have installed on your application. We would suggest that you launch your Excel app in safe mode to test if you will encounter the same issue. Check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for the workarounds that you can try to launch the application in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to install the latest <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Thanks for the reply, it hasn't solved the issue unfortunately. I can provide the file if that will be useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following based on the article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: Start Excel in safe mode</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The file would not open in safe mode and crashed excel.
</span></li></ul>
<span>Method 2: Investigate possible issues with COM add-ins</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Removed all COM add-ins – same issue</span></li></ul>
<span>Method 3: Investigate Excel file details and contents</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>I</span></span><span> deleted all tabs and only had a blank tab in the file and it would not save</span></li></ul>
<span>Method 4: Check whether your file is being generated by a third party</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>N/A</span></li></ul>
<span>Method 5: Perform a selective startup to determine whether a program, process, or service conflicts with Excel</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Tried </span><span>various</span><span>&nbsp;combinations - same issue</span></span></li></ul>
<span>Method 6: Check whether your antivirus software is up to date or is conflicting with Excel</span>
<ul>
<li><span><span>U</span></span><span>nable to check this at the moment as I need admin to disable the antivirus</span></li></ul>
<span>Method 7: Verify or install the latest updates</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Both windows and excel is uptodate</span></li></ul>

<p>Unfortunately repair does not work. The issue is also there when the file is used on other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarise the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>1-2 random excel files every week get some form of corruption, the file can then never be saved again and&nbsp; needs to be recreated. The file can be opened and everything else seems to work but saving.</li><li>Moving a tab from another workbook into the broken workbook works, but I can't move or copy a tab out of the workbook - it closes excel</li><li>File size does not matter, issue has occurred with small files such as 2mb and large files such as 30mb</li><li>I am able to delete all table in the workbook and have a blank one and it still will not save.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide the file if that's easier.</p>

<p>You will normally experience the issue since some of the workbooks or the file itself has been corrupted. You can try to perform the Open and Repair option on your Excel file/workbook. Check this
 that you can follow to help resolve the issue. There are also some articles within the link that will give you more information about recovering the data from a corrupted workbook, saving a backup copy of a workbook and creating a recovery file at set intervals.</p>

            Hi Tajul,<br />

<br />
Whenever you download apps or an update, there are temporary files that occupy your phone's memory. Photos and videos that you take are also taking space. You can

<p><span>As the pst files are available in Security &amp; Compliance section, the files should be imported successfully.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, please check the pst in local, is there any pst file larger than 150MS and is there a PST with 300 or more levels of nested folders?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, may I know are the tenant with clean Office 365 online environment?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;Doug/Tony/ anyone else:&nbsp; My most recent post--to you, Doug--has not been posted; it's apparently with others that are temporarily lost. I let the 'bug' forum know and the response was&nbsp;a re-post of&nbsp;the previous one. And&nbsp;in trying to return via My Threads,
 it informed me that I had none. If I had not saved this page as a favorite, I would not be writing this.&nbsp;Ah, well..</p>
<p>As it turns out, it will not be necessary for me to irritate the experts with my ignorance (for which you would think they would be grateful, being that&nbsp;it is the very existence of&nbsp;the uninlightened that allows them to shine, shine, shine), because I mentioned
 my Font Color problem to my very bright daughter a few minutes ago, and she Googled this: "In Word, I can't change red font." The answer came instantly back that: "Probably due to an accidental Control-Shift-E, your Track Changes is on."</p>
<p>They were right, it was. Problem solved in less than a minute. My advice to all waiting for MS to save them? Google it!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem, which has just appeared recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried it from Windows and Ubuntu Linux - same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not using IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other apps work through the browser (email, calendar, onedrive etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneNote app seems to work ok both in Windows 10 and on my Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other changes other than usual Windows update.&nbsp; Only other thing of note is that the Store app tries to update Mail and Calendar and keeps failing.&nbsp; No idea if it's linked, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know how do you access OneNote, did you log in to Outlook first then access OneNote from this options?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/321a42ac-c88e-4d33-ab48-81f22b3d3ed2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/321a42ac-c88e-4d33-ab48-81f22b3d3ed2" /></a>&nbsp;
 If yes, please go directly to <strong><a href="https://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote
</a></strong>website instead and log in from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the result.</p>

<p>Yes, Ryan Fra, that is how I was doing it and it is still not working.&nbsp; There are lots of messages about TLA and sync'ing etc then the message</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong and we can't sign you in at the moment. Please try again later.</p>
<div>
<p>The Microsoft account login server has detected too many repeated authentication attempts. Please wait a moment and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the direct approach of www.onenote.com works fine, though it did want my username again, which is a pain if nothing else.&nbsp; But not being able to click a link on the Outlook page is a bit pants.</p>

<p>Sorry Mr Fra to correct you. The issue has been caused by unqualified Microsoft staff and belongs to
<strong>all </strong>OneNote users, who would like to get access via outlook.com.
</p>
<p>This problem can easily be reproduced with any browser, even Microsoft Edge shows exactly the same behaviour. After 8 tries without successful automatic login from the outlook.com page the error message mentioned by&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/32cdd48a-9bba-4bdf-a917-1aef2b19ec37" title="OEagleO">OEagleO</a>
 will be shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very strange that Microsoft is not able to fix this issue within hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Nick,</p>
<p>This issue is not related to "old" stored cookies on client browser. The problem is caused by a wrong authorisation process on your Microsoft server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try OneNote online access via login at outlook.com it will fail. If you try it via onenote.com there isn't any problem. I can easily reproduce this issue with</p>
<p>a) Microsoft Edge 41.16299.15.0</p>
<p>b) Mozilla Firefox 56.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if all cookies will be accepted or cookies of 3rd-parties being blocked. Of course before login all cookies are deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you duplicated this problem? If not, give it to a more qualified Microsoft support person. If yes, take a tool like Wireshark and compare the login handshake between outlook.com and onenote.com and you will see the difference.
</p>
<p>It's being nearly 4 weeks now. I don't understand why Microsoft can't fix this issue.</p>

<p>I'm not being funny Nick, but are you serious?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are people reporting this issue here who clearly are not noddy users.&nbsp; They are giving intelligent, researched fault-finding results.&nbsp; And you're coming back with "clear your cookies".&nbsp; I'm kinda speechless!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, lets be clear. You have here a Novell (remember them) CNE, M$ MCSE, plus circa 30 years experience in IT.&nbsp; Please do not tell me to clear my cookies.&nbsp; Or to reboot my router.&nbsp; It's like telling a 30+ years experienced car mechanic to check if there's
 fuel in the tank when he calls for 'expert' (I'm now using that term lightly) assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this from Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Palemoon. I've tried it from different computers.&nbsp; I've tried it on Windows and Linux.&nbsp; It is still the same:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong and we can't sign you in at the moment. Please try again later.</p>
<div>The Microsoft account login server has detected too many repeated authentication attempts. Please wait a moment and try again."</div>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a cookie issue, as even a teenager could tell you.&nbsp; This is about how the Outlook.com main site is passing credentials to the onenote site in order to provide a seamless (cough, cough, ahem) experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to wonder if anyone at your end has tried to replicate it.&nbsp; If you cannot manage that, let me know and I'll screen-share with you to show you it in real-time.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell the error is related to session affinity and stored state (the OneDrive load balancer shards on UserID). It doesn't replicate for many users and I can't get the error to replicate on my device. If you visit onenote.live.com do you get
 a TLS error? If you repeat that in incognito mode does it go away? We have a team looking into this, sorry for the inconvenience!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be fair, many a Linksys with flooded NAT translation table has been assisted by a gentle reboot ;)<br />

<p>Nick,</p>
<p>Assuming Kalicouk will provide feedback on your question too. Here is the answer from my site:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no difference in behaviour whether the login happens via www.outlook.com or as you mentioned via www.onenote.live.com. There is no TLS error shown in the browser. There is no difference if the browser uses incognito mode.</p>
<p>The result is always the same: after login the Outlook Mail page is shown. Then clicking on the icon to show the other Microsoft services and click on OneNote will cause the "authorisation error" after 8 unsuccessfully automatic attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click any other Microsoft service e. g. People, Calendar, Word, OneDrive, any of these can be accessed without problem. Just OneNote does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Successfully login to www.onenote.com and then opening another browser tap with www.outlook.com (of course) will allow access to OneNote via the Microsoft Services icon in Outlook Mail etc. because of the already available cookies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no difference whether I use Edge or Firefox. My system is Windows 10 64 bit 16299.19.
</p>
<p>I am accessing your servers from Europe. Maybe the problem is not related to all regions. Would be interesting from where Kalicouk will login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't reproduce the issue on your device, I assume you haven't tried it via the Microsoft intranet, or?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any further information or a demonstration via remote access just let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kurt S.</p>
