            <p>The 3200 mAh on the DC-19 is the charger's nominal battery capacity at 3.7 Volts.<br />
It will recharge a phone around 65% of this, so expect ~2000 mAh from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Capacity * 5 volt conversion&nbsp;* efficiency = 3200 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 2048</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most power banks are labelled this way and the percentage is about the same, so you need a 5000 mAh power bank for one full recharge of a 3200 mAh phone.</p>

<h2>            Messages delayed an hour&#63;</h2>
                    So, my friend lives 5 states away, and has a 2 hour time difference from me. Since we jumped forward an hour, my skype messages with him habe been messed up. Say it is 10:30 where i am and supposedly 8:30 where he is, my skype would normally keep the time
 stamps in my time. Now, if he sends me a message at my 10:30, it will have the time stamp 9:30. And if he leaves for 1 minute, it will say last seen an hour ago. How do i fix this?

    <title>E71 Linux Information, likes, and dislikes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smallmeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71 Linux Information, likes, and dislikes</h2>
                    The E71 is a fairly cool phone, but it took me a little while to get things working well with Linux after upgrading from my Motorola v3xx. To avoid other people having to figure things out, here's my info, and later in this a list of likes and dislikes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bluetooth<br />
---------<br />
<br />
The E71 works fine with bluetooth. I bonded the device to my computer with the instructions at
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/12/10/using-a-bluetooth-phone-with-linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/12/10/using-a-bluetooth-phone-with-linux</a><br />
<br />
After installing the software, I made my phone non-hidden, did:<br />
hcitool scan<br />
Scanning ...<br />
xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx Corey's Phone<br />
then got the address (the xx:xx... part). Then I did:<br />
obexftp -b xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -l<br />
and it asked on the phone for a passcode, then on the computer. Enter the same 4-digit number in both places. Now you are bonded. You can use obexftp to poke around in the phone.<br />
<br />
All fine and dandy, but I also use my phone as a tether to get to the Internet. That's when I ran into my first problem. You use:<br />
sdptool browse xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx<br />
to find the RFCOMM channel to use for dial up, but there's a bunch and I chose the wrong one. After hunting some more, I found out that channel 2 was aptly named "Dial-Up Networking". Set the right channel in /etc/bluetooth/rfcomm.conf:<br />
<br />
rfcomm0 {<br />
# Automatically bind the device at startup<br />
bind yes;<br />
<br />
# Bluetooth address of the device<br />
device xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;<br />
<br />
# RFCOMM channel for the connection<br />
channel 2;<br />
<br />
# Description of the connection<br />
comment "Nokia E71";<br />
}<br />
<br />
restart bluetooth with /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart, and voila, /dev/rfcomm0 appears and it's a PPP dialup. So my PPP scripts to dial into AT&amp;T worked perfectly. You can hunt on the internet for various scripts for this, or I can post one if someone needs
 it, though it would only work for AT&amp;T.<br />
<br />
<br />
USB<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now for USB. It's kind of ironic, but the high-speed data from AT&amp;T is actually faster than the bluetooth data rate. Kind of sucks. So I tether the phone with USB whenever I want to transfer a lot of data (like MP3 files) or when I want a faster network connection.
 Getting USB working hung me up for a while, though.<br />
<br />
Plug in the USB cable (which thankfully came with the phone) and you get a menu of things to do, as USB can really only do one thing at a time. The "Mass Storage" is what is used for file transfer to the microSD card. I guess that's an OK name, though it could
 have been a little more intuitive.<br />
<br />
I don't know what "Media Transfer" does.<br />
<br />
You would think that "Connect PC to web" would connect your PC to the web. But you would be wrong. To get a /dev/ttyACM0, a simulated serial port to connect to the web using PPP, you choose "PC Suite". The "Connect PC to web" option creates a simulated CDROM
 drive that has the PC software to connection your PC to the web through the phone. With the proper selection, I could dial in at will. Now I'm happier, though this cost my some unnecessary time.<br />
<br />
<br />
VPN<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now I've got a cool phone that does all kinds of stuff with email. So I think: "I'll set up a VPN so I can get to my home and work email." This was not easy. The best instructions I found were at
<a href="http://wiki.paepstin.info/nokia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wiki.paepstin.info/nokia</a>:vpn. But they are not quite accurate.<br />
<br />
First of all, if you are going to use RSA, the information the keys was wrong. You can completely ignore the information about the "fqdngw" key and certification. You only need to create on key and one certificate for both the phone and the VPN gateway. Put
 them into /etc/ipsec.d/private and /etc/ipsec.d/certs, respectively. You do need to put the server certificate in as it says. And the "RSA" entry in ipsec.secrets is wrong, it should be the key that you put into the private directory, not the name on the web
 page.<br />
<br />
I was able to get RSA to work with this, but it was annoying as the phone asks you occasionally for the key store password. So I'm using PSK (with a good password).<br />
<br />
Creating the keys is easier than it described in the web page due to some better software begin available from Nokia. Unfortunately, it only runs on windows. You can get it at
<a href="http://businesssoftware.nokia.com/mobile_vpn_downloads.php," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://businesssoftware.nokia.com/mobile_vpn_downloads.php,</a> it's named "Nokia Mobile VPN Client Policy Tool for Microsoft Windows". The settings in the tool can be directly accessed with the "Advanced view" options, you need to set the values up as described
 in the tool, but you need to set the mode to "X509 DN" if you use RSA.<br />
<br />
You can also do this all on Linux, perhaps, you can search around with Google and find that information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things that I like<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
The phone is very fast. Viewing web pages on my old Motorola v3xx seemed to be limited by the rendering speed of the web browser, not the bandwidth. Not so with this phone.<br />
<br />
The email works quite well, in general.<br />
<br />
Wireless LAN access works well.<br />
<br />
SIP worked perfectly the first time with Gizmo (I already had a Gizmo account, highly recommended). This will be really useful when I travel internationally.<br />
<br />
I use Scheduleworld to sync my schedule and contacts with Google calendar. The syncing was very fast and worked perfectly. It also syncs Notes, which was one of the most annoying things missing on my Motorola v3xx. (It didn't have notes at all, in fact.)<br />
<br />
The main screen is quite functional for me. I could set everything up like I wanted, and it has useful information.<br />
<br />
You can run multiple things at the same time! I really hated that about the Motorola v3xx.<br />
<br />
The battery meter seems to work correctly. The one on my Motorola v3xx was worthless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thinks I don't like<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
The IMAP mail works well for most everything, but you cannot move messages between folders. Since I use spamassasin, I have a special folder that spamassasin detects spam in, and another non-spam folder. But I can't read them move the mails to the various folders.
 I really don't like this.<br />
<br />
Voice dialing is completely useless for a number of reasons:<br />
<br />
1) It seems rather unstable, and often causes my phone to reset. Oddly enough, this has been getting better over time, perhaps due to the voice learning.<br />
<br />
2) Even if it didn't cause my phone to reset, it doesn't seem to work well. I know it learns, but my Motorola v3xx didn't have any learning and worked quite well.<br />
<br />
3) Even if the word recognition worked well, it's still not usable without being able to look at the phone and press buttons. The phone has no way to say "No, I don't want that one" through a voice command. You have to be looking at the phone in case it makes
 a mistake (which could be embarrassing), but that completely defeats the purpose of voice command. When my Motorola v3xx did voice command, it would ask you if it was correct and allow you to go through the selections it found, completely with voice commands.<br />
<br />
I'm really going to miss voice dialing. Probably the greatest loss switching from the v3xx.<br />
<br />
The phone should use standard microUSB connecter and should charge the phone through it. My Motorola v3xx did this, and I have a bunch of these cables lying around (from various cameras and such) and a bunch of chargers. I don't understand why any phone manufacturer
 would want to do anything else, except to make their customers lives more difficult and tie them to the manufacturers various chargers. This really sucks.<br />
<br />
I've had problems with Bluetooth disconnecting the headset. It's rather annoying, and I'm not the only one who's had the problem, as can be seen by searching through these forums. I just got a Jawbone, and it doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as the H700 I have
 previously, though.<br />
<br />
You have to use XAUTH for VPN logins, at least with openswan. This is somewhat annoying. It would be very nice if Nokia could fix this (apparently the E60 didn't have this problem so it's a new problem, as evidenced in the VPN web page I posted above). If you
 don't use XAUTH, it seems to connect (at least from openswan's point of view) but the phone never transitions on to do the thing it was going to do.<br />
<br />
WLAN really sucks power. It advertises 6.9 days, but I don't even get 12 hours. I don't get the values for GSM or WCDMA, either, but 12 hours is just not enough.<br />
<br />
The 2.5mm audio jack really sucks. Why can't it be a standard 3.5mm jack? I had to look for a while, and I think I found a 2.5mm to 3.5mm converter that will work at
<a href="http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/archives/2008/08/13/e71-recommended-accessory-javoedge-stereo-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/archives/2008/08/13/e71-recommended-accessory-javoedge-stereo-adapter</a><br />
<br />
I've noticed various glitchy problems. For instance, once I had to mailboxes connected on the same VPN at the same time, and then I disconnected one, then the other. The first one never disconnected and would not disconnect. I had to reset the phone to fix
 the problem. I've seen other little glitches like that, though none as bad as the resetting problem with the voice command and I've never been able to reproduce any of the other ones.<br />
<br />
The mapping program is not intuitive. I still haven't figured out how to use it very well. After I use it for a while I might figure it out. The ability to download maps to the phone would be nice for situations where you are not connected to the internet.
 I haven't done much with this. I really like the UI for Google maps, this is a big step down from there.<br />
<br />
VPN connections do not show up in the "Active data connections" section of the connectivity manager.<br />
<br />
The documentation is lacking a lot. Almost all the help on the phone is like the "Proxy port number" setting under "Access point settings". The help is "Enter the proxy port number". That kind of documentation is useless. I'd like to know what the thing does.
 And the browser has keyboard shortcuts, but I have no idea what they are. A scroll forward and back would be mighty handy keyboard shortcuts, and they might exist, if only someone wrote it down...<br />
<br />
<br />
Whew, that's a bunch, I guess, but mostly minor (and mostly correctable with a software update, hint hint). If the above things were fixed, it would make this a faultless phone, at least for me. But in addition to those, the following things would make the
 phone uber-cool:<br />
<br />
A big screen and a slider. The screen the only thing I like about the iphone (I really hate that it doesn't have a keyboard, plus you can't tether it and voice command really sucks on the iphone, too.)<br />
<br />
It could run Linux :). Sorry, I couldn't resist.

The "Media Transfer" USB connectivity mode works with Microsoft's Windows Media Player for music transfer. Probably only needed if you a Windows DRM protected music on Windows.

            EXCELLENT! Could you please please post your dialling files for AT&amp;T?? Even better if you could upload a zip of your entire /etc/ppp/peers folder that would be nicer even. I am in desperate need to get the $15 MediaNet tethering on my Fedora 10 laptop
 working over bluetooth, I used to do it before with T-mobile T-zones with my E61, but since then I switched to my E71 and moved my number to AT&amp;T and my attempts to adapt my scripts to AT&amp;T have not been successful yet :( however tethering under Windows XP
 with the Nokia PC suite works though...

            I am experiencing difficulty using the E71 VPN with a cisco asa running RSA_SIGNATURES. I create the policy no problem using the Nokia policy creation tool for windows and I can install the policy but when I try and associate the policy with an access
 point it won't stay associated. I select the policy when defining the access point but when I save the access point then navigate back to it there is no policy associated with it. This is a show stopper. Has anyone else experienced the same thing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.

<p>I discover Bluetooth in E71 is quite weird.&nbsp; I had previously 2 phones Linux-based (Motorola Z6 &amp; V8), and the Bluetooth configuration was fairly easy.&nbsp; But, in Symbian, the SDP profiles seems to be assigned dynamically.&nbsp; That means Dial-Up Networking RFCOMM
 channel isn't always the same.&nbsp; OTOH, I use Bluetooth for tethering just when I forgot the cable in my house, because, as said in this post, Bluetooth is slower than HSDPA speeds.</p>

    <title>How to Exclude One or More Contacts from Voice Command - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walterjames  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Exclude One or More Contacts from Voice Command</h2>
                    After using Voice Command for a few days, I must say that I am impressed.&nbsp; Better than 90% of the time, it correctly identifies the contact that I wish to call.&nbsp; From what I can see, it appears that VC scans my contacts and creates "voice keys", which
 it keeps it memory and uses to match against.&nbsp; Which brings me to this point.&nbsp; I have a rather large contact list.&nbsp; However, most of my contacts only have email addresses.&nbsp; Therefore, I really only want VC to "index" those contacts with phone numbers.&nbsp; Is
 there any way to configure VC to exclude certain contacts without removing them from my PPC?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<p>No this is not possible, But the other way around it could be to open the contact you frequently call and add a voice tag to their name. Which could be anything for anybody like "sweetheart" calls your sweethaert
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or define the number you call in the voice command you give</p>
<p>Call "name" home or mobile or work</p>

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; The issue isn't really voice matching.&nbsp; It's an issue of memory usage.&nbsp; VC appears to create a voice key in memory for every contact.&nbsp; Given the size of my contact list, that memory footprint is rather large.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a way to coerce VC into only generating keys for contacts that have phone numbers?<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Partial User Migration</h2>
                    <p>We are researching a migration to Office 365. &nbsp;We have a single domain that has users split into 2 groups with 2 different UPN suffixes but one registered domain name. &nbsp;Lets call it abc.com and the 2 UPNs we will call staff.abc.com and sales.abc.com. &nbsp;We
 currently have Exchange 2010 on premise with a MX record for abc.com (also own the abc.com domain name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we would like to do is migrate sales.abc.com to Office 365 and leave staff.abc.com on premise. &nbsp;We plan on using ADFS for SSO integration to Office 365 users.</p>
<p>

 Spell Check in Windows 10 is built in to the **** up windows 10 OS and even with it SET TO ON it doesn't work in IE 11</p>

<br />
Because you're entering the entire string as consecutive characters the entry is being recognized as an email address. To avoid the resulting Hyperlink you can do either of several things:<br />
<ul>
<li>Include a &lt;space&gt; after the digit 4 (or anywhere else in the entry), or</li><li>Precede the entry with an apostrophe (<span style="font-weight: bold">'</span>) to designate it as text, or</li><li>Use <span style="font-weight: bold">Command+Z</span> after pressing return to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Undo</span> the conversion, or</li><li>Right-Click the cell &amp; select <span style="font-weight: bold">Remove Hyperlink</span>, or [for an ongoing fix]</li><li>Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Excel&gt; Preferences&gt; AutoCorrect</span> &amp; clear the top check box labeled

            If you purchased a retail version of Office and it was properly installed on your computer using the email address and password for a Microsoft Account you can reinstall your Office from your Office Account at:
<a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;
 You will need to sign in with the same email address and password that you used when you first installed your Office. If you can access your Office Account you can reinstall your Office as many times as you desire.</span>

</p><p>How can we get refresh token that will be active not only 2 hours but permanently and without user&nbsp;interaction? I.e. we don't want our users to enter login and password every 2 hours, as one account is used for different users, and we cannot provide them
 with the access details to our main Bing account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Anastasia<br />
</p>

<h3> koryturn5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2007 corrupted database</h2>
                    
<p>I have just received the following error message:</p>
<p>Microsoft access has detected that this database is in an inconsistent state, and will attempt to recover the database. During this process, a backup copy of the database will be made and all recovered objects will be placed in a new database. Access will
 then open the new database. <br />
The names of the objects recovered will be logged in the "Recovery Errors" table.</p>
<p>when I click ok I the get:</p>
<p>The database 'C:\Documents\Users\bryanscott53\documents\test.mdb' can't be repaired or isn't a Microsoft Access database file.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the same for the back up copy too....</p>
<p>any suggestions on how to fix would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Kory,</p>
<p>I would suggest that you turn to <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=accessdev&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Access for Developers forum </a>for professioanl support as our forum focuses on Office 365 online services.</p>
<p>Moreover, you may try compact and repair the database if you haven't done that.<br />

<p>It reflects that your MS access 2007 gets corrupted, hence to repair the access files you have to use any MS access recovery tool.

            <p>Can I assume this is an insider upgrade to Win 10? I don't think any carrier sanctioned ones are out, though I may be wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an insider upgrade, is it the first one, or have you been participating in the program for a while. If the latter, I would strongly suggest doing a factory restore with the WDRT, and then doing the update. This is of course destructive to all
 your apps, settings, data, but some judicious backup, both cloud and manual to a PC, should get the majority back. You can often even do a restore from a pre-upgrade cloud backup with good results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was your first upgrade attempt, I would still recommend the factory restore and re-upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had multiple devices on insider builds and have had some that just didn't take to an upgrade well, from a been-used state. Upgrading directly from a fresh install has typically been effective.</p>

            I did a complete install from 8.5 to 10. This is an unlocked 1520. I had the same problem with 8.5. I have to shut off and ten on to connect to wifi. This was not an upgrade but a complete install, I think. It took 4 hours.&nbsp;

            At least once per day. Just the phone is having problems. Another phone using my wifi works just fine. Could it be that there are multiple wifi systems in the area. I click on the one I use and it can't connect. I think it's the phones driver if there
 is such an animal.

<p><span>For my understanding, if the logical of the criteria is parallel, it is better to use IFS, otherwise, you can use IF, here is an article explain the difference between IF and IFS:

<p>
</p><p>I would be surprised if the difference described in the article applies to the Excel IFS function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Excel IFS were implemented as a bona fide function, yes, all of its arguments would be evaluated.&nbsp; But the same would be true of Excel IF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, Excel IF arguments are evaluate left-to-right until a true condition is encountered, or until the last false condition is encountered.&nbsp; Excel IF is not a bona fide.&nbsp; It is just function-like syntax for a series of internal operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the same is true of Excel IFS.&nbsp; It is simply shorthand for nested-IFs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot test Excel IFS; it is not in my version of Excel.&nbsp; (Hmm, I might try Excel Online, when I have time.)&nbsp; But you can test it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create the following UDF in a normal VBA module (in VBA, click Insert &gt; Module):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function myudf(x)</p>
<p>myudf = True</p>
<p>MsgBox x</p>
<p>End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then enter the following in Excel:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFS(myudf(1), 1, myudf(2), 2, TRUE, 3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula should return 1, and you should see only one MsgBox, not two.</p>
<p>

<p>[Correction to a previous posting, deleted.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>An important difference is that IFS is available only to users of Excel in Office 365, the subscription service.&nbsp; It is not available even to users of Excel 2016 standalone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you intend for others to use the Excel file, it is best to avoid Excel IFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for your own use, you should use IFS whenever possible, assuming that I am correct about the same left-to-right evaluation of Excel IF and Excel IFS.&nbsp; It is simply shorthand for nested IFs.&nbsp; But it is much less error-prone to design and easier to
 read since there are no nested parentheses to balance correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, neither nested IFs nor IFS might be the best solution for your problem.&nbsp; If you describe what the formula should do and provide some concrete examples, someone might be able to point you in a better direction.&nbsp; Off-hand, I wonder if some combination
 of lookup functions might be better.</p>

<p>Hi Iris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to use IF or IFS, it would be better if you can provide the cost of each conditions, for example, how much for one specific color and how much for the Big size. So we can easily use IF
 or IFS to meet your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we welcome community members to share their insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 &#40;Office 365&#41; crashes and restarts in endless loop</h2>
                    <p>I've had Outlook 2013 (Office 365 installed on Windows 7) for a few months now and it mostly worked fine. Lately, I've noticed that it was taking unusually long time to launch after a full shutdown, but it still worked. Today it crashed and then restarted,
 then immediately crashed again and went into an endless loop of crashes and restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read some articles on similar issues and tried to repair it within Programs and Features, but got the message "Something went wrong".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also started Outlook in safe mode (had to create new profile) and disabled all of the add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I uninstall and re-install Outlook, will I need to set everything up from scratch again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What solution can you recommend?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your answer, Mohan. I have reinstalled Office 365, performed on-line repair, no errors along the way, and Outlook still crashes. I managed to get into the Options menu as soon as it launched and it seemed to stay up while I was in there. As
 soon as I clicked out, it crashed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It starts fine in safe mode, under a new profile. Can I just change backed up files for the new ones? Which files and what's the process?</p>

    <title>MS Access 2013 - Complied &#40;MDE&#41; DB can not be opened by others - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captainkirky  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2013 - Complied &#40;MDE&#41; DB can not be opened by others - Error msg&#58; created by newer version &#40;when it has not&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I created and maintain a large DB for my organization using a server with the data files and an application that is distributed to each user in compiled form (MDE).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past Access version 2010 and earlier, I was able to compile the DB and send it to
 the other users who could open and use it without incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since we went to Access 2013, This doesn't work anymore.&nbsp; The compiled version that the end users get will not open.&nbsp; They get an error message stating that the application was created with a&nbsp;newer version of Access.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; We are all on
 the same version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution was to not create the MDE myself, but have one of the other team members do it.&nbsp; I would then distribute it accordingly.&nbsp; As time went on, however, each of them were ending up in the same situation as me - in that if they compiled the DB, others
 can't open it.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; They can ALL use the MDB version without problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that MS Access somehow is keeping an inaccurate record somewhere that says there is a version mismatch.&nbsp; I don't know if that's true, but need to find out how to clear that.&nbsp; And would that be on the compiler's computer or the users' computers?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone knows how to fix this issue, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; It's a DB that&nbsp;receives&nbsp;frequent update to keep our team working efficiently.&nbsp; So I need to know how to permanently deal with this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp; - Kirk</p>

            Hi Kirk. You said all of you are using the same version. Which version would that be? When you compile a database, the same version or later should be used to open it. So, even if you had a database originally created using Version 2003 but compiled it
 using 2010, then 2010 or 2013&nbsp;users should open it. 2003 users might get the "newer version" error you mentioned. Just my 2 cents...

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; Here's my situation:</p>
<p>ALL users are on 2013 version.&nbsp; ( updates are pushed to our computers as the IT department feels fit).&nbsp; So I don't know if each user has exactly the same updated packages.&nbsp; We're scattered across the US so I can't see their systems and don't think they're
 able to determine their own versions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I compact/repair and back up the database daily.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried creating a new DB and importing everything.&nbsp; Never thought of that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really know what you mean by changing format to accdb to accde.&nbsp; I thought that's what mdb vs mde is.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>when I go to the General Tab in the DB, it has the default DB file format as Access 2007 - 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are these different from an accdb/accde?&nbsp; Aren't those the executables that allow for opening the db without Access?&nbsp; I thought that limited the functionality.&nbsp;
 I have over 100K lines of VB code in the db that need to run, so I need the full functionality available.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recall that this never used to be a problem in the past before we all went to 2013.&nbsp;

            <p>If everyone is "We're scattered across the US" then are they running the db on some remote server (Terminal Services, CITRIX, RDP, ...) rather than on their local PC?&nbsp; If so, which I would think is the case, I'm thinking the server's version has not been
 updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>mdb is the old Access database format used by 2003 and prior.&nbsp; When Access 2007 came out, MS introduced a new accdb format which allowed for some new functionalities (attachments, MVF, ...).&nbsp; Now, 2007 and + still support the old format for compatibility,
 but normally, if your are all running 2007 or more recent, you should upgrade the file format to the newer accdb format to ensure thing continue to run smoothly moving forward (this should however have nothing to do with your current problem).&nbsp; We never know,
 if/when MS might stop supporting the old format so by upgrading you ensure you never have any issue.&nbsp; This is only advised if you are sure no one will ever need to access it through an old version of Access, but in your case, it seems like a safe bet since
 everyone is running 2013.</p>

            <p>OK.&nbsp; Sounds like it might be a solution.&nbsp; Two points though.&nbsp; Only the DATA is shared on a server.&nbsp; The program resides on each persons computer (that's what I send out).&nbsp; So are you saying that both the two data files on the server and the program files
 need to be one the same version?&nbsp; Since some of the group (all running Access 2013) can compile the DB and it works for everyone, I'm pretty sure that's not the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I convert to the aacdb format?&nbsp; I see no way of doing that within the Access menus?&nbsp; I assume once I compile, it would create the aacde format?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp; I created a brand new DB shell as an .accdb and imported all the forms, queries, reports, modules, etc...</p>
<p>I then did the same with the two data databases and imported all those tables.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Linked them all together and created the .accde.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works for me as both the .accdb and as the .accde.&nbsp; However, those that I give the DB do, still can't open it.&nbsp; They get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This database is in an unrecognized format.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The database may have been created with a later version of Microsoft Access than the one you are using.&nbsp; Upgrade your version of Microsoft Access to the current one, then open this database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is incorrect.&nbsp; My version of Access is not greater than everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp; So still a problem.&nbsp; Here I was hoping this would be the magic bullet.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm wondering if anyone from Microsoft can tell me how the MS Access application determines the version being used?&nbsp; In other words, what critera is used to fire that version mismatch warning and prevent the program from opening?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to "see"
 what each program (Access application)&nbsp;is using and what the&nbsp;user-created databases are versioned at?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to synch them/overwrite/disable or update them when we know they are all using the same version?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still haven't gotten a satisfactory answer on what causes the warning.&nbsp; I say this because I KNOW that all the users are on the same version and the db files are all created with the same version.&nbsp; So the application either isn't recognizing that or there
 is something else going on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Access Developers:&nbsp; Can you help out here?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks. </p>

    <title>.accde VBA not running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timwood_967  say:</h3>
<h2>            .accde VBA not running</h2>
                    I was tearing my hair out trying to understand why&nbsp;a front end .accde file would not function.&nbsp; Since we use several databases, I add a splash screen when each opens to reinforce which one the user is opening. So when I say the file would not function,
 I mean that it would not open the menu form once the timer on the splash screen expired.
<p>
</p><p>Using the full version, it worked fine on the .accdb file.&nbsp; One user (using the runtime version) and I (running full version) could not get past the splash screen opening the .accde file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the last change - addition of a report to be used dynamically in report view - I found that the image of a filter that I had copied and pasted into the report as a visual clue to users was the culprit. Once that image was removed - no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In searching for answers, I was focusing on the runtime - until I learned that this also affected the full version.&nbsp; Just passing that along in hope of keeping others sane.</p>

            Hi. Is the app stored in a Trusted Location/Folder? If you're sure VBA is firing/running, then add error handlers, if you don't have any, or some MsgBox or Debug.Print lines to give you some cue which code is firing or not.<br />

&nbsp;"The action can't be completed because the file is open in System<br />

            <p>I've seen this problem myself - and haven't really been successful with dealing with it.&nbsp; I usually end up opening a "read only" copy and saving under a new name and work with that - can't even rename or delete the old one!&nbsp; I encountered a .pdf file created
 by Office 2010 like that just today.&nbsp; Most frustrating.</p>
<p>So I'm watching this thread to see who comes to our rescue.&nbsp; My setup on that machine:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional, Office 2010, file stored on a network shared drive under control of Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; And yes, I have full admin rights on the server although I suspect an ownership or access rights problem and NOT the reported "file is in
 use ..." error indicated.</p>
<p>I assume that the file is not on a network drive on your system?&nbsp; Sounds like a locally stored file in your case.</p>

            It is on a local drive. However, I had the file open on another computer also on the same network and when I closed down and restarted my computer with the problem, I was able to move it as I wanted into the new folder I had created for it.&nbsp; So I'm not
 sure if it was network related or an ownership or access rights problem like you suspect.&nbsp; My problem and the network sharing other computer are both Windows 7 Professional 64-bit OS and I'm just using Office 2007 Professional at this time.&nbsp; Although both
 computers are in the same Homegroup, I can never see my laptop (my problem computer) on my desktop, or on my HTPC/Home Network Server PC, which is also running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit OS, as a Homegroup computer; however the Network does see it on both my desktop
 and my HTPC/Home Network Server PC.&nbsp; Both my desktop and my HTPC/Home Network Server PC see each other as Homegroup computers and on the Network.<br />
<br />
I've tried everything I've seen on any MS Forum to get the Homegroup to do what it is supposed to with my laptop, but it still doesn't work.&nbsp; I have one other computer here on my home network that is also running the same Windows 7 Pro 64-bit OS, and it plays
 well with the other Homegroup computers as well. My laptop is recalcitrant...it's older, and running on an Intel Pentium dual-core CPU platform as opposed to the AMD quad-core platforms I currently use on my desktop systems.&nbsp; Don't know if it's an enmity between
 Intel and AMD systems or what. <br />

    <title>Adding Hotmail.com alias&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moriam a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Hotmail.com alias&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, my primary email is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** . I had an old email account that was linked to an alias of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** that I did not have access to for a while. Over time, I've heard from others how they often mix it up and always send things to the
 .COM rather than the .CA (even though I've always given them the .CA... It's understandable, I can't say I know many people with an @hotmail.ca) Anyway, I missed an important email the other day because of this mix up. Fortunately, I've since been able to
 access the email account that has the .COM as an alias and I was hoping to transfer it over to my primary email account. (Unfortunately, a lot of the emails I missed weren't in there because of an auto-sweep I had set ages ago...)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around the forum and it was previously suggested to others in a similar situation that they delete the alias from the old account, wait thirty days and then try to re-add it to the new account. I deleted the @hotmail.com alias from the old account
 today and am currently waiting a month to add it to my new account. However, I just took a look at the add-an-alias page and I noticed there were only two options: to add an @outlook.com alias OR to add an existing email address as an alias. To test, I tried
 to add a brand new @hotmail.com alias using the second option and it tells me that I can't because it's part of a reserved domain.... Now I'm freaking out, have I lost the chance to use the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** alias forever? D:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mac Word wipes autotext entries every time Word shuts down</h2>
                    <p>I've spent countless hours on the phone with Microsoft "Support" trying to resolve this. We've wiped the normal template a dozen times. It's still happening and it's driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Word 16.16.8 (2018).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>The Normal template should not be in the Startup folder, at least not in the Windows version.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It must be in the User Templates folder. Unless these folders are set to be the same folder in Word, Word will not use the normal template in the startup folder as the default template.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any template in the startup folder will be loaded as another global template. If it is
<em>moved </em>to the Startup Folder, a new normal.dotm template will be created by Word in the user templates folder.</p>

<p>Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've heard rumors of adding a template to the startup folder, but can't figure out how to do that. I went to the first article you linked. It recommends the path:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office365/User Content/Startup/Word</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>but I can only get as far as&nbsp;<span>Library/Application Support/Microsoft.&nbsp;</span>There is no "Office" folder after that. As suggested in that thread, I created the rest of the path, but when I tried to use Go to Folder to double-check
 that path, it just makes the error sound, even though it looks like the folders are there correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I switched over to trying to open and change the normal template from the instructions in your second link. Struck out there too. The path given is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><strong>/Users/</strong></span><strong><em>username</em></strong><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><strong>/Library/Group
 Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates&nbsp;</strong></span>but I can only get as far as /Users/[username].... there's no library folder under that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like my computer is really screwed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ashley</p>

            Your user library folder is hidden by default. Hold down the <strong>Option</strong> key, then click on the

<p>Ah. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that it helps - I opened the normal template, added the Autotext, set the keyboard shortcuts, saved the template, shut down Word, reopened... and was not able to add Autotext using the shortcuts. The shortcuts are still there - when I re-add the Autotext
 I want, it maps automatically to the shortcuts I'd set previously. It's the text itself that's disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... global template? How do I do that? Sorry if it's in the thread somewhere and I'm just not understanding how to do it.</p>

</p><p>Resource link: <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm#Global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Global Template</a> </p>
<p>That describes what a global template is.</p>
<p>Resource link: <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/startup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Startup Folder</a>
</p>
<p>That tells you where to put it. Mac screens will be different.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create a new document.</li><li>Save it as a template in the Word <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/startup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Startup Folder</a>.</li><li>With the template open for editing save your keyboard shortcuts, autotext, macros, etc. Make sure that you are saving them in the template rather than in the normal template.</li><li>Save and close the template. The customizations you just made should be available in any document.</li></ol>
<p>
In the Windows versions, once you have any AutoText stored in a template and it is loaded as a global template, you can store new AutoText in it directly from any document. I do not know that this is the case with a Mac. If not, you would need to either open
 the template for editing and create your AutoText there or use the Organizer to move it from the Normal template to your global template. (I believe the Mac has this process but do not know what is involved.)
</p><p>
</p><p>Future recorded macros will need to either be recorded directly in the global template when it is open for editing or you will have to record them in your normal template and then open the visual basic editor and copy and paste. To be able to do the latter,
 you will still need to have the global template open. <em>Recorded macros are always stored in the NewMacros module. (You can see this in the visual basic editor.) If you open a module in the visual basic editor you can see the macros themselves. You cannot
 have two modules with the same name in a template or document.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Future keyboard shortcuts you would need to open the global template for editing so you can store the shortcuts there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard shortcuts accessing macros or AutoText should be stored in the same template as the AutoText or macros that they trigger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have things working in your normal template, make sure it is saved. You can rename it and move it to the
<a href="http://addbalance.com/word/startup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Startup Folder</a>&nbsp; where it will be treated as a global template. You do not want it named "normal." Word would&nbsp; then create a new normal template.</p>
