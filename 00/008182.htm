    <title>Outlook refresh folder tree &#40;Sharepoint library integration&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chingurka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook refresh folder tree &#40;Sharepoint library integration&#41;</h2>
                    I have connected my Sharepoint document library with Outlook 2010. In it I want to store emails.&nbsp;
<div>I have written a macro that moves emails from Outlook to this document library. I also wrote code for creating a new folder in the library.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The moving of the email from outlook to a folder in the document library works fine as long as the folder is visible in the document library in the Outlook sidebar. The problem is that when I create a new folder in the library with the macro, this new
 folder is not instantly visible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, if I create a new folder in the folder named "12" using the macro, outlook won't display it automatically (it won't add an arrow next to "12" like there is next to "3"). And If I try to move an email to that newly created folder, Outlook will
 throw an error that it cannot find that folder.</div>
<div>I need to manually collapse the folders in the "Email Library" folder and then expand them again and expand "3" so I can see this new folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is how I create the folder:</div>
<div>MkDir "\\sharepoint\DavWWWRoot\Email Library\3\New Folder 1"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is how I am trying to access the newly created folder, but it is failing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").Folders("SharePoint Lists").Folders("Email Library").Folders("3").Folders("New Folder 1")</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to programaticaly refresh these folders so that the new folder is displayed?</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi Siva,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is related to the specific computer, here’s another possible cause, you may need to confirm with your admin that if they set the OneDrive sync restriction: they may set the restriction policy by OneDrive admin center

<h2>            Windows Phone 10, no GPS</h2>
                    <p>So I've got the problem that I don't recive a GPS signal on my Lumia 830. The maps app says no signal, both Hardware Tests an GPS Satellite are stuck in "Initializing" and My Phone states "GPS closed".
</p>
<p>When I got my phone everything worked, I can't quite remember when it stopped because I thought maybe it's just a bug and they'll patch it away.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have that problem and more importantly: Does anyone know how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS is: WinNT - 10.0.14393.0</p>

    <title>Word 2016 Macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microsoftuser_772  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Macro</h2>
                    <p>I created a Word Template, using Word 2016, with associated formatting, autotext, Macros etc.&nbsp; This template is stored on my server so that all users can create/open a document associated with the template and access the custom features I designed (or so
 I thought).&nbsp; Each user on my network is able to create/open a document associated with the template from a desktop shortcut.&nbsp; Unfortunately, only the Author of the template has access to the macros...&nbsp; every other user receives an error message stating the
 macros are not available due to Macro Security Settings.&nbsp; I've set the network to a Trusted Location on each user machine.&nbsp; Under Options, I have changed the path for Save/Save Documents/Default personal templates to point to the location on the server.&nbsp; I
 also changed Option settings for Advanced/General/File Locations/User Templates to point to the server path.&nbsp; I even tried opening Word as an Administrator and Enabling All macros on an individual user pc - which is not a feasible option long term - but even
 that does not bring up the pre-defined macros saved to the Word Template.&nbsp; Any ideas for fixing this issue would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>
<p>I am using Windows 10 and Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2016</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;ClarenceColtess,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We, at Skype no longer have an option to delete accounts. Microsoft aimed to bring convenience on your end and that means you do not need to contact us to process the cancellation. You may refer to the steps below on how to close your account:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Close your account</a>.</li><li>When you're prompted to sign in to your account, double-check that it's the account you want to delete. If not, select
<strong>Sign in with a different Microsoft account</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Check that the page shows the correct Microsoft account, and then click <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>Read the list, and select the checkboxes to acknowledge you’ve read each item.</li><li>In the <strong>Select a reason</strong> drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Mark account for closure</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note:</strong></span>&nbsp;Skype accounts must be associated with a Microsoft account before they can be closed. You will be prompted to add an email address to create a Microsoft account, make sure to use an email
 address that isn't already associated with a Microsoft account. Once that is complete, you can continue with the steps to close your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you proceed to delete your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will be closed as well. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials to all Microsoft products. Your account will be closed after
<strong>60 days</strong> but if you change your mind anytime during the <strong>60 day period</strong>, all you have to do is sign in to your account again to cancel the closure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, but if you have questions and clarifications, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.</p>
<p>
</p>

<h2>            Changing the default applications on the Nokia E7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know if there some apps out there that can replace the default ones used by the E7 (Photos, videos, webbrowser and music player)? So far I only found Opera Mobile that can replace the default web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone help out here please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can find a lot of alternatives on Nokia Store (<a href="http://store.nokia.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.nokia.com/)</a></p>
<p>Personally I use Zene player as a music player replacement, and of course the Opera browser.</p>

            Hi HilaryWainer 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 won&#39;t quit properly</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated Outlook on one of my Macs and am unable to close the application properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run Outlook for any more than a few minutes and perform a few actions (e.g. read/archive email), I am unable to close the app with out using "Force Quit".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Outlook version 16.8 (171210).&nbsp; No newer updates available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, I thought the issue was related to Spotlight indexing.&nbsp; Indexing is taking forever; and I noticed that Outlook search was not locating emails it should have found.&nbsp; However, I've turned Spotlight off for my entire disk and I am still having the
 same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read through numerous older discussions on this issue.&nbsp; Only solution seems to be to wait for MS to release an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Stephan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your first hunch was probably on the mark. Let Spotlight re-index everything. Then restart your Mac and test again.</p>

    <title>Works Spreadsheet has quotes in empty cells when converted and opened - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redlosen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Works Spreadsheet has quotes in empty cells when converted and opened in Excel 2013 cells are blank and formulas broken</h2>
                    I'm trying to help someone get their Microsoft Works Spreadsheet files into Excel 2013.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I directly open the Works spreadsheets in Excel 2013 everything seems to look okay, but formulas are broken if some of the values in the formula are currently empty.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So for example, when working on the Works spreadsheet opened in Excel:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=SUM(A1:A3) &nbsp;If A1 is currently empty I get a #VALUE error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found that if I just "delete" on the A1 cell the #VALUE error goes away and the formula is working again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked in Microsoft Works and the A1 cell has a quote in it. What's up with that?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So there's apparently these invisible quotes coming from Works to Excel and it's breaking all the formulas in Excel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I fix this? I can't go through each and every empty cell and delete...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi Brian,<br />
<br />
I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. To confirm if the issue is related to antivirus program, could you try closing the antivirus program and editing the files to see if there is any improvement?<br />
2. Regarding the error message, I suggest you set Mcafee and add the files and the OneDrive site to the trust list, then see the result. If further help is needed, please turn to the
<a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mcafee official website</a>.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<p>After several hours of working on this I figured out the solution and it is an issue with MS Office 10. &nbsp;You have to open each applicaiton (ie Excel, Power Point, Word etc) and select File/Options/Trust Center......once in trust center in some applications
 there is an advanced button and you have to look at all of the default selections as they will block downloads from the internet (which surprise blocks one drive) by unchecking this you can now download your file from office 365 one drive to your computer,
 also look at some other settings as there default will block older versions of excel etc so you have to look at those and play around a bit. &nbsp;Hope this helps to the next person who struggles with this I wish MS would have posted something on this!</p>

    <title>Very low battery power after Belle update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raweggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very low battery power after Belle update</h2>
                    
<p>Another Belle issue....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since updating to Belle on my N8 the battery power has significantly gone down. I use my phone the same way every day. I have turned off the clock screen saver too and still goes down quickly. Before it would last 4 or 5 days, with light use of the camera
 and internet, now it won't last past 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi raweggs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post and welcome to the discussion forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Battery consumption can depend on many factors from brightness levels, usage of device, how many widgets you have running etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I recommend you do is to have a look at the below link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/n8-00/faq#00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/n8-00/faq#00</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has many different hints and tips on how to extend your battery life!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also what can also do is just try switching the device off, leaving for a few minutes and then switching back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am no stranger to keeping the battery consumption to a minimum and have already adjusted the settings on the phone, I also charge it fully everytime from it being at the lowest point, ie; I do no charge it when it still has half it's life left.</p>
<p>I have also turned it off and on a few times recently and also has had no effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Belle update really isn't doing Nokia any favours what so ever. So many bugs and problems, it makes you wonder if they even fully tested it before releasing. I LOVED my N8 since I bought it in 2010, but now I am starting to hate it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definately not be buying another Nokia, as the Windows OS on new models will be just as bad if not worse.</p>

<p>i'm having the same problem, and the battery is also brand new, changed by Nokia after the previous one had totally stopped working. They got the phone, changed battery, updated to belle, given it back to me and now it doesn't stand longer than 1 day and
 a half.....of mostly Stand by usage!!!! This is not enough time in my opinion....if i should manage to use maps or browser for more than 5 minutes, what should i do, recharge it every half an hour? Crazy...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. email automatically set to 'soonest'</p>
<p>2. 3G automatically enabled.</p>

<p>Both consume more battery power.</p>

<p>So are Nokia going to sort this.... or ignore it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having to have my phone on power saver mode constantly to save me from having to charge so often, but when using the camera or sat-nav I have to turn it off so I can see the screen.</p>
<p>This only prelongs the battery life by around 1 day at best.</p>

<h3> dean sus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open a Report with a Parameter</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>I am encountering an issue using a button with a macro and combo box to open a report while showing only the results shown in the combo box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the macro, of the button, the Options are as follows:</p>
<p>Report Name: AllEquiptment (A report that lists a bunch of items owned by different employees.&nbsp; This Report's ROWSource is a query that has a parameter of Employee First name which, when open, requires you to insert the first name of the employee that you
 wish to view items of. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;View: Report</p>
<p>Filter Name:(Blank)</p>
<p>Where Condition: (Blank)</p>
<p>Windowed Mode: Normal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parameters:</p>
<p>Employee First Name = [Combo42] (A combo box that uses the Employee Query to list all of the first names of each employee.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am expecting that when you choose the name from the list, the macro would take that value and use it as the parameter, but when i go into form view and click the name I am looking up, and then the button, the Report opens but doesn't list any information
 relating to the employee information. (It does show what the report should show like heading, text boxes, but no employee information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another button that does the same thing, except the parameter is suppose to limit the information shown in a query, but it does the same thing: Not listing any information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing or doing wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help!</p>

            Hi Dean,
<br />
<br />First, I am not a fan of any queries with parameter prompts. You can read about my concerns at <a href="https://www.tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid=6763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid=6763</a>.  I don't believe you can fill a parameter from a macro.
<br />
<br />That said, I also work in code/VBA rather than macros. My code for the button click event would look like:
<br />
<br />DoCmd.Openreport "AllEquiptment",acViewPreview , , "[Your employee First Name Field]=""" &amp; Me.Combo24 &amp; """"
<br />
<br />Note the number of double quotes which are required for text fields.
<br />
<br />Please feel free to come back with additional questions.

            I typically don't have parameters in queries since they limit the functionality to either prompting or having a particular form open. 
<br />
<br />If you want to open the report when the combo box is updated, the code might look like this:
<br />
<br />Private Sub Combo42_AfterUpdate()
<br />    DoCmd.OpenReport "AllEquiptment", acViewPreview, , "[Your employee First Name Field]=""" &amp; Me.Combo24 &amp; """"
<br />End Sub
<br />
<br />This would be entered into the VBA window. The After Update event property would be:
<br />After Update: [Event Procedure]
<br />
<br />I typically prefer a command button so the combo box isn't tied directly with opening the report. 
<br />
<br />Also, consider finding and using a naming convention where it isn't acceptable to leave your combo box named "Combo24" ;-)

<p>Hello again, Duane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your help with this; I'm not really going far with this project with this problem. So The previous example was just that, an example which made this all more complicated for me than it has to be. Even after applying the VBA, the report
 still didn't update properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual project that i'm working on it a library, and the goal of the combo box and command button is to update the report to display the value in the combo box. Like you previously said, I updated the combo box so it would open the report After Update;
 it did open the report the way it should have, but like before it shows no results as if i'm not putting in a value it understands. Prior to this I removed the parameters for the source of the report so there isn't anything interfering with that process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the page that I'm working with is a form called "Library Navigation." On this navigation page is a combo box called "OwnerNameLookupComboBox" which should be initiated after command button "ViewOwnersItems" is pressed. Originally that button would then
 run a macro which would use the combo box as the parameter and open the report with that parameter. Like the problem I am having, it comes up blank. I am all for not using parameters; like you said they are more restrictive than helpful so if I don't need
 to use it I will, but somehow the AfterUpdate on the Combo box didn't work by itself. Do you think it may be a query issue? In the report itself there is the header which contains the owner information: Owner ID, Owner Name, Owner Address, etc. What I am narrowing
 it by is specifically the Owner Name which is chosen in the combo box (from the Owners Table) which then should narrow the results in the detail section to only that Owner's Items. The afterUpdate approach opens the report but shows up empty as if the report
 doesn't know what to open it with, or as if the value doesn't fit any results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help so far. I wish my teacher were more knowledgeable on the subject of what this entire class is meant to teach, but it is what it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>~Dean<br />

<p>
Using personal names as identifiers is not reliable.&nbsp; Personal names can legitimately be duplicated, so must never be used as keys.&nbsp; Nor is a combination of names and other columns as a composite key reliable.&nbsp; I was once present at a clinic when two patients
 arrived within minutes of each other, both female, both with the same first and last names and both with the same date of birth.&nbsp; People should always be identified by a
<em>'surrogate'</em> numeric primary key, e.g. PatientID, usually an autonumber for convenience, analogous to your OwnerID column.<br />
<br />
The failure of the report to return any data might well be due to the fact that the value of the combo box is, correctly, a hidden column containing the OwnerID values, rather than the visible text column.&nbsp; This is how such a combo box would normally be set
 up and is achieved by setting its ColumnWidths property to zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; If this is the case, the parameter in the report's query should be on the OwnerID column, not the OwnerName.<br />
<br />
Selecting a person solely by name is also unreliable to the legitimacy of the duplication of personal names. You'll find an example of how to overcome this in NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file's opening form the contact's address is shown in a second column in the combo box's drop down list, allowing two or more contacts of the same name to be differentiated.&nbsp; The address is concatenated by calling the following function
 in the RowSource property of the combo box:<br />
<br />
Public Function ConcatValues(strSeparator As String, ParamArray arrVals())<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Pass this function a character or characters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' to be used as the separator followed by the values to be combined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' For example: strFullName =<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' ConcatValues(" ", FirstName, MiddleName, LastName)"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim X As Integer, strLine As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For X = 0 To UBound(arrVals)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(arrVals(X)) And Trim(arrVals(X)) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strLine = strLine &amp; strSeparator &amp; arrVals(X)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading separator character(s)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConcatValues = Mid(strLine, Len(strSeparator) + 1)<br />
<br />
End Function<br />

<p>Thank you both for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did actually stumble over the solution of my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I needed to do was add criteria to the report's query without using parameters. That step was just throwing it all out of wack. Using the parameter from a combo box through the macro didn't give it the value it needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding this syntax to the criteria of the value to want to be narrowed, In this case the ID, I put in:</p>
<p>[Forms]![Switchboard]![cboFindCustomer]</p>
<p>[Form]![NameofForm]![Name of Combo box or where value is pulled from]</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for both of my problems, both for opening up the report and the query separately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the guidance!</p>

<h2>            Flagged emails not showing up in reminders - Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    I've recently switched from Outlook 2007 for pc to Outlook 2016 for Mac. On my old system I had several emails flagged for action at some future point in time. &nbsp;Since switching these emails are not appearing on my reminder list - the only thing that's
 appearing is items that have been saved as tasks, not emails. &nbsp;What do I need to do to get the reminders associated with emails?

<p>You can use Application.FindFormat and Range.Find to search for cells that are completely formatted as bold and/or italic, that's relatively easy, see code below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify: The whole cell must be formatted bold and/or italic.</p>
<p>But the code fails if only a part of the text inside a cell is bold / italic, like this s<strong>a</strong>m<em>p</em>le.</p>

<h2>            Active X List box fails to work when the worksheet opens</h2>
                    <p>Help required on a&nbsp;few programming issues :-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of list boxes that&nbsp;the operator uses to select a couple of items that will be used in a macro to analyse some data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macro works fine but the list boxes never work the first time.&nbsp; When I open the worksheet, I first have to switch to another tab first&nbsp;and then back again for the list boxes to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second question : are there any circumstances where the code in a macro would change by itself?&nbsp; Like for example when you insert a row in a spreadsheet, the formula changes accordingly.&nbsp; When I copied the code for this spreadsheet from another version of
 a similar spreadsheet, I noticed that one of the cell references had changed&nbsp; -&nbsp; only one cell reference changed and I am certain that I didn't change it accidentally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final question : I have used the code Set sum4=Range("d3:q285")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have noticed, by accident, that my macro will quite happily&nbsp;use sum4(1,27) in my analysis where clearly there are only 14 columns of data defined but I am going to column 27 of data.&nbsp; Should I not expect an "out of range error" or something similar.&nbsp;
 If not, what is the purpose of defining the data in the first place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

            <p>Can&nbsp;only guess without seeing the workbook and the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the first issue re having to change worksheets I would guess that maybe there is a worksheet activate event in the worksheet's module and that does not fire when the workbook opens; only when&nbsp;you change from another worksheet to the worksheet with the
 code in its' module. When you right click the worksheet name tab and View Code look for a sub like the following. It may or may not have the leading word Private.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the problem then&nbsp;do the following:</p>
<p>If it is a Private&nbsp;sub then remove&nbsp;Private so it&nbsp;is simply&nbsp; Sub Worksheet_Activate()</p>
<p>Double click&nbsp;ThisWorkbook module in the Project Explorer left column and insert the following code. Edit Sheet1 in the code to the Code name of the worksheet with the Worksheet_Activate event. The code name is the one you see in the Project Explorer (on
 the left of the VBA editor) that is not in parenthesis; the one in parenthesis is the name the user gives the sheet.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In the following line edit Sheet1 to the Code name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'of the worksheet with the Worksheet_Activate event.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Sheet1.Worksheet_Activate<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't see how just copying code would change a line in the code but then I suppose that stranger things sometimes occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless the workbook has sensitive data then I suggest uploading it to Skydrive. The following link is instructions with a link in the first step to take you to Skydrive. Login Id and password are the same as you use for this forum. You will need to zip any
 files&nbsp;containing VBA code before&nbsp;uploading them otherwise it will not accept them. When you right click the uploaded file and select sharing, don't fill in the form; select "Get a Link" in the left column and then create for anyone who has the link. Copy the
 highlighted link and paste into your reply here.</p>

<p>I have only sent part of the spreadsheet and the actual VBA is not the full code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want you to see what happens when you open the sheet&nbsp; -&nbsp; ie the list boxes don't work till you go off the sheet and back again.&nbsp; Very strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally have you a view on </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final question : I have used the code Set sum4=Range("d3:q285")</p>
<p>But I have noticed, by accident, that my macro will quite happily use sum4(1,27) in my analysis where clearly there are only 14 columns of data defined but I am going to column 27 of data. Should I not expect an "out of range error" or something similar.
 If not, what is the purpose of defining the data in the first place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My code works anyway&nbsp; -&nbsp; just wondering why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>In your workbook open event in the following line of code change Activate to Select. (Works for me)</p>
<p><br />
Sheets("Review 6").Activate</p>
<p><br />
And before you ask why, the answer is "I don't know".&nbsp;I&nbsp;can only speculate that there are slight differences.&nbsp;That is why it works when you change worksheets in the interactive mode; you select the worksheet.</p>
<p><br />
The answer to your other question is "That is the way it works". The cell reference does not need to be within the range assigned to the variable and the row and column is counted from the first cell in the range assigned to the variable.</p>
<p><br />
If you need to test if a cell is within the assigned range then use something like the following.</p>
<p><br />
If Not Intersect(sum4(1, 27), sum4) Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Does intersect"<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Does not intersect"<br />
End If&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
Another point worth remembering is that it is advisable to stipulate the worksheet name with the range when setting the ListFillRange and the LinkedCell properties like the following</p>
<p><br />
'Review 6'!B504:B521</p>
<p><br />
The single quotes are only required if the worksheet name has a space. The exclamation mark is always required. While the worksheet name probably does not matter if you are only working with one worksheet, there are occasions when it could be essential and
 therefore I prefer to include it all of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were assigning ranges to these properties from VBA code then&nbsp;the code&nbsp;would be like the following. The External parameter in the Address function includes the worksheet name in the address. (Actually the External parameter will also include the workbook
 name if it is applicable to the situation.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim objOLE As OLEObject<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set objOLE = Worksheets("Review 6").OLEObjects("Listbox1")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With objOLE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ListFillRange = Worksheets("Review 6").Range("B504:B521").Address(0, 0, External:=True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .LinkedCell = Worksheets("Review 6").Range("B502").Address(0, 0, External:=True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set objOLE = Worksheets("Review 6").OLEObjects("Listbox2")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With objOLE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ListFillRange = Worksheets("Review 6").Range("C504:C521").Address(0, 0, External:=True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .LinkedCell = Worksheets("Review 6").Range("C502").Address(0, 0, External:=True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />

            I don't believe that your sub ntg calculates any valid result.<br />
<br />
ListBox1 refers to cell B502, ListBox2 refers to cell C502, that cells changes if I select something in the list boxes, regardless what (or even no) code runs in Workbook_Open.<br />
<br />
Your code contain this lines:<br />
&nbsp;a = Range("b349"): crit1 = Range("b350")<br />
&nbsp;b = Range("c349"): crit2 = Range("c350")<br />
<br />
Neither a, b crit1 nor crit2 is declared in your sub. Cell B349 and B350 are both empty. C349 and C350 contains a string.
<span><span>And this causes</span>
<span>that</span> <span>the</span> <span>
line</span></span><br />
&nbsp; If bk(i, a) = crit1 And bk(i, b) = crit2 Then<br />
causes an error.<br />
<br />
I recommend that you use named ranges in your sheet and your VBA code to ensure that both work with the same cells.<br />
<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa221357%28v=office.11%29.aspx<br />
<br />
<span><span>I also recommend that you add the line<br />
&nbsp; Option Explicit<br />
at the top of every module, </span></span><span><span>to avoid</span>
<span>that you </span><span>use</span> <span>
undeclared</span><span> </span></span><span><span><span><span>variables</span></span>.<br />
<br />
If you declare variables in VB, any variable must have a type. The line<br />
&nbsp; Dim bk, subr, pupr, subn, grades As Range<br />
declares only "grades" as range, any other variable is variant. Use<br />
&nbsp; Dim bk As Range, subr As Range, pupr As Range, subn As Range, grades As Range<br />
instead.<br />

            <p>Sorry for the delay in getting back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing the Private code from 'Open' to 'Activate' appears to have corrected to problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for helping with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't suppose that you noticed when you looked at the sheet that sometimes the list boxes change size of their own 'free will'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't replicate it I'm afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They appear to change size sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes they grow in size, sometimes they shrink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas why?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code didn't do anything because it wasn't the code that was at fault&nbsp; -&nbsp; I removed the majority of it to make it easier for people to see if they could help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems was that the list boxes were not 'behaving' as they should.&nbsp; I've changed the Private coding from 'Open' to 'Activate' which appears to have solved the problem of the list boxes not working at all unless I select an alternate sheet first and
 then return to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is still the additional problem that&nbsp;the list boxes&nbsp;change size at various times, not often, and I can't pin down what circumstances cause them to change&nbsp; -&nbsp; any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the declaration of variables, I was advised much earlier when I started writing code, that unless you were writing long and complex code that this didn;t really matter.&nbsp; Most of what I do, is basic analysis of data.&nbsp; Have I been badly advised?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a problem that has been reported on many occasions. There appears to be some&nbsp;suspicion that it is related to using zoom but I can't confirm that. However, there is a workaround by re-setting the control dimensions with code in the Workbook Open event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First turn on design mode manually&nbsp;set the ListBoxes to your desired size and position. Make a list of&nbsp;the Left, Top, Height and Width properties of both your list boxes. You may need to edit the code below to reflect your&nbsp;dimensions. (Note the Left positions
 are passed to the sub routine because that is the only different dimension with the 2 ListBoxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Replace your Workbook_Open code with the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Review 6").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = 352<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("t354").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Edit last parameter following 2 lines to the left position of ListBoxes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call LstBoxDimensions("Review 6", "ListBox1", 497.25)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call LstBoxDimensions("Review 6", "ListBox2", 589.5)</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now copy the following code into a standard module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub LstBoxDimensions(strWsName As String, strCtlName As String, dblLeft As Double)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctlLst As OLEObject<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctlLst = Worksheets(strWsName).OLEObjects(strCtlName)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ctlLst<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Left = dblLeft&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This dimension passed&nbsp;when this sub is called<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Top = 4084.5&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Edit to match your top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Height = 201&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Edit to match your&nbsp;height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Width = 80.25&nbsp; 'Edit to match your&nbsp;width<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your other Question to Andreas. IMHO Yes! You have been badly advised. Using Option Explicit at the top of your modules and correctly dimensioning the variables allows you to select Debug -&gt; compile and it will pick up errors of misspelt variables and
 object names before running the code. However, the biggest advantage I have found is the use of the intellisense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dimensioning variables as I have done with Dim ctlLst As OLEObject allows you to type a dot on the next line after With ctlLst and you get a dropdown with the available options and for learners this is a great way to learn.</p>

                    I uninstalled Microsoft excel 2010 to briefly do something else and when I tried to reinstall it from my recovery disc it asked me for a Product Key. I have hunted for this both in my home and online to no avail. I have spent countless hours on line trying

Keeping up with the product key (serial number)&nbsp;for any product is your responsibility.&nbsp; If a product needs a product key (serial number) in order to be activated/utilized to its full potential, it is important you keep that in a safe place.</p>
<p>If the product was installed and activated (just Excel?&nbsp; really?) before - there is a SLIGHT chance something like
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-recover-office-2010-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ProduKey</a>&nbsp;(That's a link with a short tutorial too) might find it.</p>
<p>If you really want to order it, many places will have it...</p>

<p>Although I would recommend getting more than just Excel (that's the reason for my surprise at you naming a single product like that.&nbsp; The expense alone would keep people from buying an office product ala carte.) - so maybe a suite:</p>

<p>(A little more cost (4 to 5 USD) on the second one, but you can install it on up to three PCs and you get Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.)</p>

<p>I have EXACTLY the same problem.....get the message the Explorer has encountered a problem and shuts down the email.</p>
<p>Microsoft knows there is a problem but has been useless as to a solution.</p>
<p>If you find the cure, PLEASE let me know. I have gone back to my old laptop because of this aggrevating situation.</p>

            <p>Went to "E-mail help after upgrading to Windows 10".&nbsp; Found this solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Sign out of MSN Explorer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Launch MSN Explorer, but do not sign in.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Click the <strong>UPGRADE NOW </strong>option at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; If prompted to allow MSN Explorer to make changes to your computer, click<strong> Yes.</strong></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Once the MSN Installer has loaded, click the <strong>X</strong> in the upper right hand corner to close the installer.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Sign into MSN Explorer and the mail issues should be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a message that there was not an update--but this did fix my issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems to work OK now.</p>

            Going in to Help/Setting and unchecking the preview pane option helped with my issue&nbsp;somewhat, but is not a complete solution (you now have to open desired messages, but MSN Explorer crashes less frequently)...&nbsp; Also, using Outlook via MSN to access e-mail
 seems to work fine, as does going directly through Hotmail.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if you want to store messages on your computer you still have to go through MSN Explorer.&nbsp; Incidentally, I tried removing and re-installing MSN, but that had no effect.

            I tried to reach Tech Support and was unable. I am absolutely frustrated by opeing a text emial and having MSN Explorer shut down. I now have to use two email systems to read my incoming mail. MSN Explorer, which I am paying for, does not work on text
 email so I have to use a free email (Hotmail or Outlook) to read text email. This is absurd!!!

            I can use Outlook in Edge, but I like the MSN Premium "look" much better.&nbsp; In Edge, click on the 3 dots in the upper right hand corner, go to "OPEN IN INTERNET EXPLORER" and then proceed to MSN Premium when IE opens.&nbsp; Received an e-mail from MSN and they
 said they are aware of the problem and are working on it--whatever that means!&nbsp; Agree--we are paying for a service that is not supported.

<h2>            Outlook freezes when I export appointments to CSV file</h2>
                    I've had this happen on both Outlook 2003 and Outlook 2007.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to export my appointments to a CSV file (either DOS or Windows) using File-&gt;Import and Export, on two different machines (one XP, one Win7).&nbsp; I pick a target file, and begin the export, which then freezes. CPU goes to 100%. I have to kill outlook
 from the Task Manager.<br />
<br />
I have tried running scanpst on the pst file, but this does not affect the results.
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Overall goal is to get my Outlook calendar onto my iPhone in a separate calendar from my work calendar. I'm trying to load it into Google Calendar as an intermediate step, but if there's another way to do this I'm open to it.<br />

            Creating a new profile with the same calendar data did not help. <br />
<br />
I managed to work around the problem by creating a new calendar and copy/pasting my future events from my current calendar into the "export" calendar. I was able to export the new calendar to a csv file and upload it to Google Calendar and thence to iPhone.
<br />
I've got a lot of historical calendar data, and the export utility obviously doesn't like some of it.

    <title>Messaging and contact status issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hsverin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messaging and contact status issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having an issue with one of my overseas contacts for the past week. The contact has been constantly showing as offline for me for the past week
<span>("last active several days ago" will show up on occasion for this contact) </span>
<span>("last active several days ago" will show up on occasion for this contact) </span>
and I apparently show up as offline too on her side, even when I'm shown as online for all other people in my contact list and can chat/call normally with them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse I'm receiving messages just fine from that contact even when she is showing as offline, but she apparently can't see anything that I send back. All the messages I send back are showing up as successfully sent in the Skype app on Windows
 10 <span>(Windows Store version)</span>, Skype on the web, iOS and Skype for Mac on my end, yet somehow they don't appear to reach their destination.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my own sent messages sync fine on my side, as do received messages from all contacts including the one that is stubbornly showing up as offline. My friend is running Skype for Android and apparently sees herself as logged in and online as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had anything similar happen, did you manage to resolve it and if so how?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, to any Skype techs that may be reading this: this is pretty infuriating. IM, connection and Skype-to-Skype call reliability has really gone to the dogs lately. What's even more infuriating is that
 Skype Status is listing the messaging issues as resolved on Feb 13th. It's Feb 17th today and this issue has been going on for probably over a week now and shows no signs of resolving itself on its own.</p>
