<h2>            Problems with 3rd party XBox 360 wireless receiver &#40;Window 10 64bit&#41;</h2>
                    I got a receiver from eBay the other day and cannot for the life of me get my controllers to connect to it. I got the official driver off microsoft, 64 bit, and selected the latest "Xbox 360 wireless receiver for windows" in the list in device manager.
 I'm definitely doing the syncing right, but it simply refuses to connect. What else can I try?

Troubleshoot the Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows 10
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p><strong>The green light on the receiver does not illuminate</strong></p>
<p>When you plug the Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows into a USB 2.0 or 3.0 port, the green light on the receiver doesn't light up. This can occur because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Wireless Gaming Receiver is not plugged correctly into the USB port. </li><li>
The Wireless Gaming Receiver device driver is not working as expected, or Windows 10 is out of date.
</li><li>
The USB hub is overloaded. </li></ul>
<strong>Solutions</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Check the USB connection.</strong> Make sure that you've connected the Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows to a powered USB 2.0 or 3.0 port on the computer. The best way to verify the connection is to unplug the Wireless Gaming Receiver from the USB
 port and then plug it in again. If the light still doesn't illuminate, try connecting the receiver to a different USB 2.0 or 3.0 port on the computer.
</li><li>
<strong>Check for Windows 10 updates:</strong><strong> </strong>
<ol>
<li>
On the Start menu, select <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>Check for updates</strong>. If there are any updates available, Windows will automatically install them.
</li><li>
Once your device downloads and applies the update, try using the receiver again. </li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Notes </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
Refer to your game documentation for information about how to configure accessories for a specific game.
</li><li>
Drivers for Xbox controllers and accessories are included with Windows 10, so you won't have to download or install software other than Windows 10 updates.

            The green light in the receiver shows the proper function of the device. If that is available check the issue elsewhere.&nbsp;

<h2>            Fixed &#34; Cpu not supported&#34;&#34;CompareExchange128&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I started with my windows 7 x64 all upgraded and ready to go. tried to download and install windows 10 upgrade and it told me my cpu was not supported due to it being a AMD +3800 dual core.&nbsp; Now after several days of trying and trying I have found the workaround
 to get windows 10 installed, activated, and running. </p>
<p>I found out that the Product code that comes with your bought copy of windows 7 does not matter if it is 32 bit or 64 bit, it only needs to be the same&nbsp;edition, ( basic, home premium, pro ), so since windows 10 64 bit would not work due to an older cpu,
 I reinstalled my system as 32 bit, installed all updates, even the optional ones, activated it like normal, and like a charm it upgraded to the 32 bit version of windows 10 without any errors. since my computer only has 2GB of ram in it the 4GB limit does
 not effect me. So if you are having issues with an older AMD cpu telling you its not compatible or giving you that stupid CompareExchange128 error. try going 32 bit , it has a limit of 4GB of ram but at least your older computer will be running windows 10.
</p>
<p>Hope this post can save someone else hours of grief .</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Update 16.13.184</h2>
                    <p>I have problems with the Skype Business Update 16.13.184 for Mac OS (released December 2nd 2017). Every time I run Microsoft AutoUpdate, it says that the update hasn't been performed although I have run it several times. I do not get any error messages during
 or after the installation. Instead I get a confirmation that the installation has been successful. Thought that the issue would disappear when a new update to Skype for Business was released but the issue remains.</p>

<p><span>Hi Hans Olsson,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your situation, I suspect that there’re any other O365 applications running when you update the Skype For business. Please ensure that you have closed the other O365 apps and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it doesn’t work, maybe your MS AutoUpdate Tool is corrupted, you can try to download Microsoft AutoUpdate via this link:
<a href="https://officecdn-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/pr/1ac37578-5a24-40fb-892e-b89d85b6dfaa/OfficeMac/Microsoft_AutoUpdate_3.15.18011602_Updater.pkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And if the issue still persists after doing that, I recommend that you can
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-skype-for-business-28c4a036-7f22-406c-b7f4-87894cbaf902#OS_Type=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall the Skype for business on Mac</a>, and then you can re-install it via the following link:</span></p>

<h2>            Can I download Office onto my new hard drive after reinstall of Windows XP&#63; Office was on my computer when I bought it.</h2>
                    I have an IBM thinkpad R50 and recently had problems with my hard drive.&nbsp; I purchased a new hard drive and had a local computer repair shop try to clone my hard drive onto the new one.&nbsp; Unfortunately, since the old drive had some sector problems, they
 were unable to do a clone, so they had to reinstall the operating system on the new hard drive and copy just my data (no programs).&nbsp; Therefore, the new hard drive does not have the Microsoft office tools (Outlook, Word, Excel) that were on my computer when
 I purchased it.&nbsp; I have Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 3 and have my owne registration number.&nbsp; Is there a way for me to download Office onto my new hard drive?

<h2>            Skype&#47;DTMF Key Pad Tones</h2>
                    For years I have used Skype to get messages from my telephone answering machine. In the last few weeks a new version of Skype was auto-installed and now when I use the keypad to enter the answering machine DTMF code, nice sound tones are generated but
 they are not DTMF? Is there a solution for this?

            Hello Jeremy. I'm a fellow Community member here to help.<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear that you're having this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you are not alone. The new version of Skype is still in development and is lacking many features and much of the functionality of the previous versions.<br /><br />The particular issue that you are describing is one that many users have been describing since the update.<br /><br />While there is not an ETA as of yet, it is known among the community that Microsoft plans to start rapidly Releasing updates to Skype in the very near future in order to add back the functionality and features that users have come to know and expect.<br /><br />If you like you can keep track of that here at <a href="http://Skypefeedback.Com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Skypefeedback.Com</a> you can also submit your own feedback as well

<p>Thanks D5 for getting back to me. I tried reinstalling Skype and then I tried a DTMF generator and then the Skype keypad again. This time it worked, so I am not sure what the issue was. The keypad does not produce the same sound as the DTMF generator (two
 tones) so that's why I suspected it. Anyways I can access my telephone answering machine for now so that's good.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't make any unusual changes. I think the problem appeared after the Store app was upgraded to version 2015.21.12.0, on 4th November, according to the file dates:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/746476b1-1139-4935-8f44-8f187fbdf12f" /></p>
<p>I have another account on this PC (it's a tablet actually, and it was upgraded from Windows 8.1, it that matters), and the Store works fine on that account, so I suppose adding yet another account will not resolve the problem, which is specific with this
 one. Migrating all my apps and settings to a new account is not an option for me, I want to continue using this account, so I want to fix it :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problems are the same as above:</p>
<ul>
<li>clicking the Store app tile to launch it: nothing happens</li><li>trying to start it from a command prompt with "start ms-windows-store:" results in an "Invalid value for registry" error dialog, and after closing that, an "Access is denied" message in the console.</li><li>trying to run WSreset results in the same "invalid value for registry" error.</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0346811-00c8-46af-b8b2-970efe88e388" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further hints to fix this will be highly appreciated. :)</p>

<p>I just got the Xbox One and connected it to my DirecTv box, my family enjoys watching television, would that be problematic to the console being on for loner periods or is that what it was designed to withstand?</p>

<p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
The Xbox One was designed in mind with it being on for long periods of time, that's one reason why the power supply is outside of the console, and the console itself is quite large and has lots of vents.<br />
<br />
Aside from typical machine wear and tear, and given your console has ample space to ventilate, there's no harm being done having it on for long periods of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weird part is that time (899 seconds?) is huge, but I can't think of anything it's failed to do while I've been messing around with it.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did suffer some weird restart failures (it would tell me it failed to start and had to restart, and send the info to Microsoft) but I blamed them on a software install that went wrong, did a refresh and re-installed the software I wanted one at a time,
 restarting after every one, and have not seen that problem again for a few days now.&nbsp; But the above message is one of many, they seem to occur in groups with a few additional ESENT messages (info only) above and below them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found one similar sounding entry on MSDN and they seem to think it was a CPU core problem:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproperf/thread/6f27b7ec-f18c-4575-bbbe-09f55cf3ad64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproperf/thread/6f27b7ec-f18c-4575-bbbe-09f55cf3ad64</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Hopefully not 'send it back and pray' but if that's the only option, I guess better to know sooner than later when I have a lot of stuff on it.&nbsp; But I do want to have it for a trip (plan for the Surface is as a compact photo-triage Lightroom
 machine for dive trips) coming up in mid-April, so if I do need to return it turnaround is already getting worrisome.&nbsp; I did buy the MS Complete option though so I'm willing to hold out for a while if general advice is that I probably can....</p>

            <p>I'm just curious. Do you think this boilerplate answer helps? Do you think I'm unaware I can return / exchange it at point of sale or (since this one was bought online from Microsoft store directly) through Microsoft?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I asked the question because I'm looking for diagnosis and alternatives to just throwing my hands in the air, returning it, and stomping off? I came to a community forum instead of seeking out a service request direct access for a reason.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I did a little more digging myself and guessed that since the errors were all related to ESENT (Search, basically) and LiveComm.edb, maybe I just had a bad database. ****** does happen sometimes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cleared the search database, ran TRIM on the drive through the disk optimize interface, and then had search rebuild the database. So far - no recurrance of that error (although my Surface does show a few others such as the BTHUSB driver unloaded one about
 every startup). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course a bad database write might still be a sign of a flaky SSD, so I'll keep an eye on it. I did buy the 2yr warranty extension (MS Complete).

            Greetings Rtrski,<br />
<br />
I've read over the Event Viewer log that you posted above, and I can see the warning. I don't believe that your SSD is failing, since you have done the Refresh on your Surface and have not seen the error again, but that writing to the particular file took a
 longer time then expected.

I did not do a refresh (well, actually, I did, but not because of the above, the above happened after), rather as stated in my response to Hugo I ran the TRIM optimization on the drive and rebuilt the library (search) databases.<br />
<br />
Regardless, the error indication of "899 seconds" is a BIT more than just 'writing to the particular file took a longer time than expected'.&nbsp; 899 seconds = (drum roll, please) just a hair under 15 minutes, assuming I am capable of dividing by 60.&nbsp; That would
 not constitute a slow write but something magnificently wrong, either with the drive I/O, or with the file not being released by something else when the write operation was attempted.&nbsp; Especially since messages like that seem to come in mere minutes (less
 than 15) after logging in.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have indeed seen them again a time or two now since declaring my Surface 'cured', so that's egg back in my face.&nbsp; Yet the surface seems to run just fine, aside from the Mail tile being a bit slow to show me email updates on login when I know
 I have un-accessed emails (to the Surface) on starting up.&nbsp; I chalked the slow email updates as related to other warning messages in the Event log that an ipv6 DNS server is not responding (teredo.Microsoft.com or something of that nature?)<br />
<br />
Can anyone please let me know if this sort of thing is showing up in their logs as well? All these ESENT messages have one thing in common, they all have something to do with "livecomm.edb" which I strongly suspect is closely tied to the whole dynamic happy-dappy
 tiley updates, hence somehow search related.&nbsp; Anything else to look at, substantively?<br />
<br />
I'm not seeing signs of immediate crushing failure (aside from things easily blamed on web latency, no issues now at all outside of the log), so I can be a bit patient in troubleshooting.&nbsp; I won't trust any unlosable data to the Surface in the meantime, but
 I have a trip coming up in a month I'd like to use it on.&nbsp; Given other threads about the return turnaround time right now, I don't want to risk an exchange postal loop going open ended on me before that trip.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello rtrski, </p>

<p>Is it possible that the Surface was in the Windows 8 version of Sleep/Hibernate/Controlled Standby, accounting for the 899 seconds? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the question.&nbsp; I don't think so, in part because I have set my power settings so tapping the power button is a true shutdown when not plugged in, but it does still go into inactivity sleep at 10-15 min or so.&nbsp; I guess I can't rule it out entirely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wouldn't W8 be smart enough to know that it couldn't write a file while sleeping and therefore not send a warning including wording to the effect that hardware failure might be a cause?&nbsp; Is the sleep timer such an independent activity that it can 'surprise'
 the rest of the operating system that way? (Oh no you DON'T get to write that file...NAP TIME!)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen different time intervals as well like 335 and 706 seconds.&nbsp; There's usually a brief string of 508 errors followed by a similar 510 event.&nbsp; Last one I can find is a couple days ago.&nbsp; I won't post all the details but it varies from the 508 only
 a little in description:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm far from being an expert on the topic, but the way I understand it, the only time the Surface actually shuts down is when you select 'Restart' - and of course that shut down is momentary. If you select Shut down from the Power icon or set a function
 to initiate shut down it is actually in&nbsp;the Windows 8 version of Sleep/Hibernate/Controlled Standby.

            <p>I don't know.&nbsp; I do know based on other info how long that exchange/repair will take, however, so I've already elected to wait until after my next trip to decide, barring catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love how absolutely no one from MS actually tries to research and address the error itself, no explanation of what ESENT might be doing with LiveComm.edb on a regular basis, no pointers to MSDN error listings, nothing.&nbsp; I didn't want to 'assume' that this
 truly meant a hardware error...kind of interesting to me that those who should be more in the know don't seem to even imply it could be software.&nbsp; Not terribly reassuring, that lack of faith.&nbsp; Then again, I've searched myself blue and can't seem to find much
 that's up to date on ESENT either.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh well, I knew I was buying into a 'new' product unacknowledged beta test experience. ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Atthisaddress:&nbsp; Thanks for the info.&nbsp; I wasn't aware that the definition of 'shutdown' had evolved in W8.&nbsp; I'll see if I can't learn more about that.&nbsp; I still think even if it is entering a kind of 'suspend' mode the OS should be smart enough not to cause
 itself to throw an error because of a suspense - all periodic maintenance tasks should be put on hold for the duration vs. just doing a timestamp-based 'uh oh, something didn't work right!' check.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that's all it was, wouldn't at least one other user chime
 in about seeing similar events in their own log?</p>

<p>I'm curious, are you using the Mail app, or do you have an email client installed? I'm thinking the .edb may be a

</p><p><span>As this issue occurs due to insufficient permission to the user profile or probably some security settings might be blocking the user from making changes to the desired folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may temporarily disable the security software and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: If you have to temporarily disable the antivirus to install other software; you should enable the antivirus as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to virus attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, Adobe Reader 11.1 is distributed internally as two MSIs: "Adobe Reader 11”, plus a patch to bring 11.0 to 11.1.</p>

<p>The solution, in my case,&nbsp;is to Press 'Windows key + R' and type the following commands.</p>
<p><strong>AcroRead.msi</strong></p>
<p><strong>AdbeRdrUpd11001.msp</strong> (which fails), and then go to the control panel to uninstall Adobe Reader.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>For computer that cannot access the Desktop and receiving this particular page, Black screen or just a loading screen with small dot circle here are the troubleshooting steps that we need to perform:&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Start your Computer in Recovery Mode:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; Do a power interruption on your device by pressing the Power Button of your PC and let the computer restart do it 3-5 times until we reach the Windows Recovery environment, if this will not work try to Press Shift+ F8 while the computer is booting up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49b017cb-defc-4082-813f-0f70fd8a7f18?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49b017cb-defc-4082-813f-0f70fd8a7f18?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you enter the Windows Recovery it will show you this page:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/198af6ba-0807-4866-829d-db0691b4af24?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/198af6ba-0807-4866-829d-db0691b4af24?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; if the Automatic repair will not fix the BSOD Error, click <strong>Advanced Options</strong> then click
<strong>Troubleshoot&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4043147-d5f0-4562-b452-ea88df740ff6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4043147-d5f0-4562-b452-ea88df740ff6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Option 1:</strong> <strong>System Restore </strong>Once you click <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong> then <strong>click Advanced Options</strong>, we can do <strong>
System Restore</strong> if there are software changes on your device(Updates, downloads or configurations)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ffb70da-45e0-4956-a52c-a50753a01507?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ffb70da-45e0-4956-a52c-a50753a01507?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Start your PC on <strong>Safemode with Network or Minimal
</strong>For <strong>Safemode </strong>you just need to click <strong>Startup settings Instead
</strong>then click <strong>Restart</strong> and you will see these page:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17c2e211-1e4c-44f4-99f5-dbf96cce55c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17c2e211-1e4c-44f4-99f5-dbf96cce55c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>By these you can either Press F5 or F3 if there is a Display error&nbsp; (Typically for GPU or Display Driver error)&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Option 3: Reset keep my files or Remove everything</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Reset Keep my files will delete all applications on your device but it will keep all your files, while Reset remove everything will fully wipe the drive (fresh install) that will result to deletion of all files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For this step you just need to go to <strong>Windows Recovery </strong><strong>and click troubleshoot</strong> then select
<strong>Reset</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If the issue still persist the last option we have is to backup the files to a local technician or do a clean installation of Windows 10</strong></p>

<p>Hey&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5e2839d0-db9f-4e14-bab2-fe599f8b7830" title="JollyRager">JollyRager</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update with your reply! As you're using a wireless connection, it is normal to get some hiccups in the signal sometimes. If possible, you may wish to switch to a hardwired connection with an Ethernet cord. If not, then that is also okay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you continue to experience slow downloads or freezing up during the updates, I recommend taking a look at the troubleshooting steps available in our support article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/networking/troubleshoot-slow-game-or-app-downloads-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot
 slow game or app downloads on Xbox One</a> as it is also quite helpful for update issues as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, should the update stall out, you'll want to try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycling your console (removing the power cord)</a> simultaneously with your network hardware (just straight up unplug it) for 5 full minutes, then plug the network hardware back in. Let the lights come back on fully, then get your console connected to
 the power cord and turn it back on. This will strengthen your wifi signal (it can degrade over time) and should increase some speeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give the troubleshooting a try an let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>

            <p>Hello Jared,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below to remove old Network Connections on your Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Use your mouse to click the <strong>Start</strong> menu and select the <strong>
Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>2) Click the <strong>"Network</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Internet"</strong> button once the Control Panel loads and select the Network and Sharing Center.</p>
<p>3) Click the "<strong>Manage network connections</strong>" tab.</p>
<p>4) Look for the old network connections you wish to remove in the scroll box. Depending on how many connections you currently have in Windows&nbsp;7, it is possible you'll need to scroll a bit to find the one you wish to remove.</p>
<p>5) Click on the old connection you wish to remove.</p>
<p>6) Click the <strong>"Remove"</strong> button.</p>
<p>7) Confirm your selection by pressing <strong>"Yes"</strong> when asked whether you are sure you wish to remove the connection. You may also elect to press
<strong>"Cancel"</strong> or <strong>"No"</strong> to return you to the previous screen and prevent the connection's removal.</p>
<p>8) Note that you can also change network connections through the network wizard. Simply click
<strong>Start</strong>, then "<strong>Connect To</strong>" and "<strong>Show all connections</strong>."</p>
<p>9) Select the network connection you wish to change by right-clicking on it and selecting the option you wish. You can choose to
<strong>"Disable"</strong> the connection, which would have roughly the same effect as completely removing it, rendering it inactive.</p>
<p>10)Press the <strong>"Delete"</strong> key after clicking on a network connection in the Network Connection window. This will completely delete the connection in the same way that removing it from the Control Panel would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your replay.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not have a problem with my wireless networks.&nbsp; If you go to "<strong>Devices &amp; Printers."</strong>&nbsp; Then select the tab that says "<strong>Manage Default Printers</strong>."&nbsp; When the opens up it gives you a drop down box for
<strong>"Select Network."&nbsp; </strong>In this drop down box I have every wireless network I have connected to in the past year.&nbsp; How do I remove those old networks?&nbsp; They are not in my
<strong>"Manage Wireless Network"</strong> page.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this might clear things up a bit.&nbsp; Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The screenshot you have attached is the place where Microsoft windows saves all its latest WiFi network profiles. If your printer is showing up more then definitely your printer software has capability to save this info. Which printer software you use or

<p>I see that this was never answered here. If you (or anyone) is still having this issue, open the
<strong>Network and Sharing Center </strong>and click on the icon (usually a house) beside a network under
<em>View your active networks</em>. This will open the <em>Set Network Properties</em> window. At the bottom left, click on
<strong>Merge or delete network locations</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That opens a window which should have the same list of networks (not necessarily in the same order) you are seeing in the
<em>Manage Default Printers&gt;Select Network </em>pulldown, which you can select and delete (or merge) as needed. You will have to refresh (or close and open) the
<em>Manage Default Printers </em>window before seeing any changes reflected.</p>

    <title>PC Won&#39;t Start After Trying to do Reset &#40;Black Screen&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armand van tonder  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Won&#39;t Start After Trying to do Reset &#40;Black Screen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom gaming PC. When I bought it, it had Windows 7 Pro 64-bit on it. When Windows 10 came out, I took advantage of the free upgrade. So, I am currently running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A while ago my power supply failed (or something of the sort). I took my PC to a computer shop. They guy there replaced a burnt fan and inserted a new power supply. After the repairs were done, I brought the PC home and everything was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two things were different, though. Usually, when one starts one's PC, the motherboard screen shows up, then the Windows loading screen shows up, and then the lock screen appears. You then log in and use your PC. After my PC was in for the repairs, it no
 longer did this. Instead, I'd switch on the PC, the screen would stay black for about 15 seconds, and then the lock screen would appear. Neither the motherboard screen nor the Windows loading screen would appear. (Is this quick-boot?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing I noticed was that my PC's internal hard drive now showed up under the "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media" icon. It didn't show there before the repairs were done on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the new power supply and fan were placed into my PC, I remember the guy went into my BIOS settings (I believe that's what it's called) at the motherboard screen. I assumed he had to do something there as part of the process of inserting the new power
 supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I decided just to let it be. It wasn't really bothering me that much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem came today. I decided this week that I'd like to reset my PC (basically, backup my files, then reset/reinstall Windows) because I wanted my PC to feel fresh again. So, I backed up my files, went to the "Update and Security" settings, went to
 "Recovery," and chose "Get Started" under "Reset This PC." The process started on my screen, and everything seemed fine until my PC restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC restarted and I got a black screen. My monitor entered "energy saving" mode, and it's been like that for more than two hours. I assumed it was doing the same thing it does when it starts normally (the whole skipping the motherboard and Windows loading
 screen thing), so I've been waiting anxiously for something to happen. It just stays black. I decided, after the two hours, to take a risk and hit the restart button. Nothing. I pressed the power button to try to switch it off. Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now my PC is basically on, my monitor is in energy saving mode, and the screen stays black. I don't want to unplug my PC for fear of losing something, since I assume the Windows reset didn't complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? I shall await a reply. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Kerwin Lee</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the <strong>Troubleshoot black screen problems</strong> link. I do not believe it presented a solution, though it
<em>was </em>quite informative with regards to another question I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Regarding my problem:</strong><br />
I solved the problem by disconnecting my monitor from my graphics card and connecting it to my motherboard's on-board graphics. Once I did that, my display turned on and I could continue reinstalling Windows 10. It seems that the reason I have a temporary black
 screen when my PC starts up is because my graphics card is not the main display -- the motherboard is. Once my PC has fully started up, the display switches to the graphics card and my monitor turns on (since it's connected to the graphics card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, <strong>my problem has been solved</strong>. If I ever need to access my BIOS settings, or something similar, which involves using the PC before it's fully "started up," I just need to connect my monitor to my motherboard instead of my graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As a side question: does anyone know I can make my graphics card the default display, therefore causing the monitor to turn on, ergo, allowing me to see the motherboard screen and Windows loading screen?</em></p>

    <title>Hard drive inaccessible, parameter incorrect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> owenrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard drive inaccessible, parameter incorrect</h2>
                    Last night for an unknown reason, my 1 TB Seagate external hard drive wasnt allowing me to use things inside of it or open it. It would tell me the parameters were incorrect. When it was plugged in, I was unable to use the taskbar with the start menu unresponsive
 and my cursor turning into a loading cursor when it was on the taskbar. I eventually found out to open cmd as admin and run chkdsk F: /f /r. I tried that last night and it seems to be working but I left it going over night. It has been about twelve hours and
 it is on stage 4. It was on stage four when I went to bed. It says stage is only 14% done and total is 39% done, with about 19 hours remaining on the ETA timer. The last 2 entries in cmd also now say that there is not enough space to replace bad clusters.
 Do I really have to wait for this to complete or is there another method? Any help is appreciated.

<h2>            Any different between logical and primary partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Referring to following video,&nbsp;after free space for new partition, I create partition, which show logical drive (blue color), but the other partitions are primary partitions (deep blue color), I would like to know whether it is possible to create a main drive
 partition instead of logical drive, and what difference is between logical and primary partitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an option to delete logical partition (D: drive), after deleting it, can it create a new primary partition? through this process, will it cause any problem on primary partition (C: drive)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any advantage to have an logical partition (D: drive)? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, if I need more space in C: drive, will it be easier to extend primary partition (C: drive) with logical partition (D: drive)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I convert logical partition (D: drive) into primary partition, will it be easier to extend primary partition (C: drive) with&nbsp;primary partition (D: drive)?

            I must not have explained something very well before. An extended partition is not part of any other partition, ti is a partition that can hold other partitions. the extended partition on your drive was created using what is called "unallocated space"
 your D:\ partition was then created as a logical drive within the extended partition. To remove the extended partition, and have your D:\ become a primary partition you need to back up the contents of your D:\ or copy it someplace safe, then delete the d:\
 logical drive, followed by deleting the extended partition, then create your primary partition, you may need to rename the new partition to D:\, after that you can restore your data to your new d:\ primary partition. But again, why do you want 4 primary partitions
 instead lf what you have now? Do you know that as it is now if for some reason you need another partition on that SSD you would only need to make room for the new partition in the extended partition, and create the new partition? I personally would not get
 rid of an extended partition once it was created, logical drives work as well as primary partitions as far as I can tell, and having an extended partition gives me more flexibility in my use of my HDD.<br />

                    I am trying to backup a Windows 7 system (version 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601) on a hard drive with 186gb used.&nbsp; I am trying to write to a 1tb outboard drive connected via eSATA.&nbsp; The outboard drive is formatted NTFS with one partition and is empty.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually this error come when 100 MB hidden System Reserved partition created by Windows 7 does not have enough space to store a shadow copy. Please check the freespace on this volume. Follow the following steps:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Start -&gt; Computer -&gt; Right click -&gt; Manage<br />
2. Select Storage -&gt; Disk management.<br />
3. Verify that you have a System Reserved partition of 100 MB size.<br />
4. If yes, right click on this volume and select Properties.<br />
5. View used and free space.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows backup requires around 40 MB of free space on this partition to backup successfully. So if the free space is less than 40 GB, backup does not get enough free space. As a workaround try the following
 solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the default System reserved partition cannot be extended, creating a new system volume is the workaround. Here are the steps to move the system volume to any other volume:</p>
<p><br />
1. Choose where you want to have your system volume. Few things you need to keep in mind:<br />
&nbsp; a. System volume can only be created on a primary partition of MBR disk.<br />
&nbsp; b. If system volume &amp; boot volume are together, then BitLocker feature cannot be used to encrypt volumes on your machine.</p>
<p>2. Suggest creating a new volume (say F:) on the same disk that contains the boot partition of size of about 490 MB (be careful to keep it less than 500 MB).</p>
<p>3. Assuming Windows 7 is installed on C: on your machine. From an elevated command-prompt run: bcdboot.exe /s C:\Windows /s F:.</p>
<p>4. From elevated command-prompt run: DISKPART</p>
<p>5. From the disk part command-prompt:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
DISKPART&gt; select volume F<br />
DISKPART&gt; active</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can reboot your machine and F: will become the system volume. You can undo this by repeating the same steps using the original system volume (you have to assign drive-letter to it) to revert to your
 previous configuration.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, if this does not work please let&nbsp;me know.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though above solution should solve your problem, you can follow the steps mentioned below to exclude System image from your backup.</p>
<p><br />
1. Go to Change Settings option on Backup and Restore control panel. <br />
2. Select Let me choose option.<br />
3. Check/uncheck the checkbox "Create a system image" located at the bottom of this page to include/exclude the system image.<br />
<br />

            I followed your suggestions and found I do have a 100MB system reserved partition.&nbsp; It has 61.8MB free, so this does not seem to be the issue<br />
<br />
Additionally, I have tried to exclude "create a system image" from the backup and still get the same results.<br />

            <p>I would suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is frought with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Two I'm familiar with and like
 are Norton Ghost (which I've been using for 7 years without the 1st problem), and Memeo which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from http://memeo.com . You can get Ghost for next to nothing (like I did) if you watch
 the sales. </p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>
<p>http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were 315), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
