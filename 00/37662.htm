    <title>Winamp context menu options won&#39;t appear in Windows Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Winamp context menu options won&#39;t appear in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    I've always used the context menu options a lot in the past, but now that I've upgraded to Windows 7 it doesn't seem to work at all. I've gone into the Winamp options and enabled the context menu options&nbsp;and even rebooted the computer. Still nothing.<br />
What I mean by context menu is the menu that appears&nbsp;when you right click on a folder or file. I have reason to believe that&nbsp;Windows Explorer is&nbsp;simply not cooperating with Winamp, since I also selected the option to automatically associate all audio files
 with Winamp, but Windows Explorer&nbsp;did not reflect that,&nbsp;so I had to go and associate the ".mp3" file type manually. Is there any way to fix this?

            I don't think&nbsp; "Bluewire General Property Sheet" is the problem as this appears in a default installation of Windows 7 and appears to actually be part of Windows.<br />
<br />
The problem&nbsp; that you have may be related to the Winamp installation.<br />
<br />
Are you using the latest version of Winamp (v 5.57)?<br />
<br />
Also, if you right-click winamp.exe in the Winamp program folder and select "Run as administrator" does the&nbsp; enabling Winamp context menu options remain "checked"

<h2>            how to make it so that when I use the analog stick on a xbox 360 controller that has been hooked up to my pc, it DOES NOT move my mouse cursor.</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using a Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows to hook up my controller. And my PC runs on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am gaming and I move the Right Analog stick on my xbox 360 controller it moves my cursor regardless of how I set it up within the game; this gets in the way of me actually playing my games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>not to mention the fact that the mouse cursor has a tendency to wander the screen when the controller is hooked up.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            latest update to windows 10 has wiped out my office package and many files</h2>
                    i have a toshiba satalite l350-170 laptop and it has just finished updating windows 10 i have been running the original build of 10 after changing my hard drive and rebuilding my system to get windows 10 when the initial upgrade period started my laptop
 would not complete the upgrade process and now with the latest major update, it would seem that everything has went pear shaped again. my office 2010 has vanished along with a lot of my precious files as an author the latest saves of manuscripts are saved
 onto a pen drive as well as the computer which is just as well as there was no warning that this update could impact on other programs within the system. my anti virus software is now corrupted and is unresponsive the windows button dosent work and before
 you ask me to try rebooting to safe mode and checking through things i cannot as it would appear to be stuck in a loop where it will not accept my pin number nor any of my other microsoft passwords. therefore without rebuilding the sys

            have a Toshiba laptop that is to say the least not exactly in its prime but still does the job, it has the ability to run windows 10 but when the first upgrade to windows 10 began the system would get to about 46% and hang up and then revert back to windows
 7 after much fluffing about using all information in the forums i replaced the hard drive with a new 1 terabyte western digital and did a clean install of windows 10 which worked great finally i was up and running could only assume that there was a problem
 with drivers or something strange going on reloaded all relevant software and for the last 2 years all has been fine until the latest large update forced itself onto the computer. all looked fine until it had finished and did the last restart. everything came
 up but i was unable to access the start menu and it then asked me for my windows activation key which as it was a windows 10 overlay on windows 7 so i do not have anything but the windows 7 key that does not work. i skipped this stage and again was stuck with
 no access to the windows menu. Cortana didn't work either. and my anti-virus software is corrupt and even when i try to do a clean removal from their website it tells me that it is unable to complete due to corrupt data on the system. my Microsoft office package
 that is part of the Microsoft home usage program as i said a perk from the business my company does with Microsoft on a yearly basis this is the oldest version 2010 that i was using i just liked the feel of it. has just vanished completely along with lots
 of other documents. as i said this was a completely functional system until the last update. i know my software and hardware are not top end but they done the business for me.&nbsp; i have done nothing wrong and should not have to bear the brunt of a now non functioning
 system. i have had to remove the hard drive from the laptop and replace it with the original hard drive that has all the relevant software and the laptop functioned perfectly again so there is no doubt in my mind that the problem lies in the new software bundle.&nbsp;
 i have numerous desktop computers and numerous laptops belonging to my wife and the kids and they are now petrified that the same thing will happen to them. my system is functioning with windows 7 just now but after the grief i went through the last time,
 and having very little time to rebuild the hard drive. i am not a stupid person and build and test (sorry but cant tell anybody without dying a horrible death or spending a long time in a very small room with bars) so any help would be gratefully received.
 i have also tried the Microsoft home button repair tool which it worked once after reboot but then refused to work again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype for Business Mac Client - Duplicate Contacts w&#47; Mismatched Presence Status</h2>
                    <p>macOS Sierra 10.12.1 running Skype for Business client 16.1.456.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having an issue where if I search contacts, the same person shows up multiple times. &nbsp;In some instances, the contact is shown by their resolved name (i.e. 'John Smith'). &nbsp;Others, it is shown as their email address. &nbsp;Often times the presence status does not
 match. &nbsp;One will show "in a call" and the other will show "available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried signing out of Skype for Business and that made it worse. &nbsp;Four contacts for each person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried completely removing Skype for Business following this procedure:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3202833</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a fresh install, but the issue persists.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this thread, I have totally fixed the problem. Just like some others reported here, issue occur on those who have Lync installed before. I found out that there's a Lync cache folder which was left over during the previous uninstall. No more duplicate
 contact after below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Perform clean uninstall of Lync related files. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2691870, take note on the last info about the cache,&nbsp;<span>Users/Home
 Folder/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.Lync)</span></p>
<p>- Perform clean uninstall of Skype For Business Mac. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3202833)</p>
<p>- Download and install&nbsp;Skype For Business Mac latest version.</p>

    <title>Scrolling One Line at a Time With Comfort Mouse Wheel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coast guard jack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrolling One Line at a Time With Comfort Mouse Wheel</h2>
                    I have a small, worrisome problem using my Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 with Excel on my desktop computer.&nbsp; Most of my 'real' work is done in Excel and the problem is getting more worrisome each day.&nbsp; When I scroll with the wheel, Excel scrolls down three
 lines.&nbsp; I would like it to scroll just one as it does on my laptop with a Logitech mouse.&nbsp; Mouse Properties does not show an item to select the number of lines for scrolling.&nbsp; I am using the latest Intellipoint software from Microsoft.&nbsp; I have tried changing
 ScrollWheelLines in the registry to one but that doesn't do it.<br />
<br />
I have researched this on the web in many places and am about at the conclusion it can't be done.&nbsp; Can someone tell me how I can make Excel scroll just one line using the Comfort Mouse if it can be done.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

<p>This is something that will be a hardware setting. Maybe something in windows but Excel has no influence in the scrolling behavior. I am moving your thread to the Windows forums in hopes someone there can help you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Game DVR Does not Work</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have been using Game DVR since Windows 10 came out (not preview though), and it has always worked fine, excluding fullscreen games of course. But recently while playing The binding of Isaac: Afterbirth, i decided to use my controller, and when trying
 to record, it didn't work, saying "There is nothing to record. Play some more and try again."</span><br />
<span>Now, regardless of whether i open the game bar with my controller or not, or use the Win+Alt+R shortcut, the message always appears on all games when i try to record, and i have no idea why.</span><br />

                    I am a snowbird (six months in Canada six moths in USA), i fly between my two homes and want to transport just a hard disk drive from one location to another. i have two computers, one with an OEM windows 7 home&nbsp;premium&nbsp;and one with no operating system&nbsp;&nbsp;(one
 in each country). If i buy a Windows 7 full &nbsp;or upgrade am i able to accomplish my goal of&nbsp;installing W7 on one hdd and using on either computer, not at the same time.&nbsp;

<p>What are the make and models of the two computers?&nbsp; You cannot transfer the hard drive that has the OEM operating system on it.&nbsp; OEM software is not transferrable and is likely bios locked to the computer it was preinstalled on.&nbsp; When you try to start the
 second computer with the hard drive it may not work because of the wrong hardware, specifically the BIOS on the mobo.&nbsp; Things would be better if your OS was retail.&nbsp; Then you could reactivate when prompted, install some drivers, and go.&nbsp; Or the two sets of
 hardware could be so radically different that reinstallation was required.&nbsp; That would defeat your purpose.</p>
<p>What I would do is put an operating system and programs on the second computer and use SkyDrive to move your data back and forth.&nbsp; Then you don't have to carry anything.</p>

<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />That's a bug and the Skype team is working on it. Unfortunately, there is not an estimated time for this to be fixed.

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more assistance.

<p>Original title: Upgrade recovery partition or backup from C drive</p>
<p>Just finished fixing a friends computer. Her brother in law had reformatted her HD with Win98 and then upgraded the C drive to WinXP.</p>
<p>She was having all kinds of issues which I managed to fix. However, her recovery partition still has Win98 on it.</p>
<p>I was going to make her recovery disks but if I understand correctly, they'll be made from the recovery partition so they'll have the wrong OS. Is there any way to upgrade/update the recovery partition to WinXP?</p>
<p>If not, how can I make her recovery disks from the C: drive instead of the D: (recovery) drive?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Lorraine,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which edition of Windows XP is installed? (Windows XP Home edition or Windows XP Professional)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You won't be able to use the Windows 98 Recovery partition to create Windows XP Recovery disc.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Windows XP Home edition, then you may try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Place a formatted floppy disk in your floppy disk drive. Click on the "Download a Windows XP recovery disk
 from Microsoft" link below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=E8FE6868-6E4F-471C-B455-BD5AFEE126D8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=E8FE6868-6E4F-471C-B455-BD5AFEE126D8</a></span></p>
<p><span>b. Click "Download." Then click "Save." Find your floppy drive on the menu and click "OK."</span></p>
<p><span>b. Remove the floppy disk when the Windows XP recovery disk download is complete, and place it in the computer
 on which you need to use it.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Shut down your computer; then turn your computer back on. Your computer will automatically start up running
 on the Windows XP recovery disk, which will allow you to install Windows XP once again</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>

    <title>Restoring Windows 10 from backup ISO - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardjansenlive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring Windows 10 from backup ISO</h2>
                    My internal SSD became corrupted so I purchased a new one that is slightly larger, downloaded Win10 and installed it.&nbsp; I am trying to recover my previous setup from an ISO that I created from the old SSD before it failed, but when the Troubleshooter/Recover
 fro System Image process begins to load the ISO, I get a disk error on the new drive and the process fails.&nbsp; I tried shrinking the volume to the same size as the old one, but this does not work either.&nbsp; I need to restore all of the old programs, many of which
 have no media to load.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<p>
</p><p>As long as the new drive is larger, that SHOULD not be a problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that the issue may be due to the way the new SSD is configured...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have been using UEFI Bios and that is what the Image is of, then your new SSD must be a GPT drive... If you were not using UEFI Bios, then the new SSD must be a MBR drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This selection is made when a completely blank drive is first accessed... If it has been formatted, everything needs to be deleted and reinitialized...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible problem is that the new drive may require a different settings in your machine's Bios... Most of the newer SSDs require your SATA connections to be AHCI...</p>
<p>Not IDE..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have managed to install Win 10, and it is working, this is unlikely the problem...</p>

            Followup 2 - I was able to re-format the new drive as well, then "repair" it using the recovery ISO.&nbsp; So, now I have a new SSD with all of my old content, in addition to the old one, which also works.&nbsp; However, the recovery set up a partition on the new
 one which is the same size as the old SSD (222GB).&nbsp; The new drive is 256GB, so I tried extending the ISO-created partition, but no luck.&nbsp; Bottom line: my new drive has a 222GB partition with operating system and data, and I had to format the additional space
 as a new partition of 33GB.&nbsp; If anyone know a way to combine the two partitions, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why you can't Expand the OS partition to the full size...</p>
<p>About the only reason this would happen is if there is a hidden partition in there somewhere preventing this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could post a picture\capture of your Disk management, that would be helpful...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What be more helpful to both of us would be to boot the machine with a 3rd party Disk management tool... There is a free program called Partition Wizard 9 that can be downloaded as a ISO... This ISO can then be burned to a CD to make a bootable disk...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, it can also be put on a Flash Drive, but that is a bit more tricky...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3rd party tools will usually show stuff that is not visible in Windows... They can usually do things windows won't as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free version is getting a bit hard to find, but this link will get you a download...</p>

 I bought a Midi Keyboard to enable me to create music it is a keyboard that will need to send midi data to and from my computer. I have installed it,&nbsp;albeit on ignoring a notice which said that windows or my computer did not want to install it because it was
 unsigned&nbsp;by the publisher, something along these lines, after I had downloaded it and was about to install it, something like this anyway,&nbsp; now&nbsp;two weeks on I don't seem to be experiencing any PC performance issues, the only issue&nbsp;am having&nbsp;is getting my midi
 keyboard to work. So what problems should I look out for in that I&nbsp;ignored the warning notice notification on that day, two weeks ago now or is it a hard subject to give a s

            1. I would suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:
<br />
<br />    Press “Windows key + W”.
<br />    Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.
<br />    Select “Hardware and Sound” from the Troubleshooter Window.
<br />    Select “Hardware and Devices” under Devices option.
<br />    Follow the On Screen instructions.
<br />
<br />2. Also see if there is any driver provided by the manufacturer. If yes, install it.

<p>Thanks for&nbsp;the reply you helped me realise this troubleshooting area I had forgotten about in my PC that would help me if something did go wrong nothing has gone wrong but thanks anyway the only thing giving me a headache is that my computer is supposed
 to be a 1TB&nbsp;HD computer I've used around 550GB and continue too download even though I&nbsp; am slowing down on this now because&nbsp;with so much stored items I would not know if files were being written&nbsp;over&nbsp;and what I have realised is that I've been saving&nbsp;multimedia
 files&nbsp;music files&nbsp;etc&nbsp;for my project in my project and the memory space does not seem to be going down its&nbsp;stuck around this&nbsp;350 GB free space mark I have assigned around 139GB to&nbsp;the&nbsp;SYSTEM RESTORE backup area,&nbsp;but the storage space does not go down anymore
 and stay at a fixed value it goes down one moment and then goes back up so I'm wondering&nbsp;if when I'd been&nbsp;storing&nbsp;those multi media&nbsp;files from the internet music, etc if files I have stored/saved/downloaded onto my computer, already,&nbsp;are being written over
 which would be something that I wouldn't want to be happening. So the only files that I am storing now is the files created by my musical instrument, music maker kit. Can anyone help me ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS-&nbsp;So to all you tech wizards out there if any of you read this and can help me out do not hesitate in replying to my dilemma .&nbsp; Thanking you in advance if you do know share the knowledge. Please</p>

    <title>How can I verify which console is licensed to what Game. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leavingsmile199  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I verify which console is licensed to what Game.</h2>
                    I have 2 console. I recently bought and replaced the second console due to defective disk drive. I transferred the data from the defective to the replacement. During the process I confused myself in the license transfer section. I purchased a second Minecraft
 game using my child's profile, as I already had one with my profile. Mine is on the original console and I needed the other back on the new console. I may have used my profile in the transfer license screen on console 2, instead of my child's. At this point
 I stopped everything. I did NOT redownload the game with my profile, nor did i attempt to use my child's license transfer. I don't want to mess up console 1 nor do I want to used her transfer on the new console 2, just in case I need it for console1. I don't
 want to wait 4 months to correct it, if I guessed wrong. Please help...is there a way to figure this out...what profile's license to minecraft is on console 2? Thank you.

<p>You can sort this by logging in to your child account on the console you want the license on and then transfer licenses.</p>
<p>Then log in to your other console with your main account and transfer licenses.</p>
<p>On your console</p>
<p>Go to Settings and select Account.</p>
<p>Go to Your Billing Options and select License Transfer.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions to transfer the content licenses.</p>

<p>Bazajatee is correct that you can do a license transfer directly from the new console for your child's account - but that was not your only concern. If you transfered your licenses to console 2 but wanted them to stay on 1, don't worry. Your licenses are
 also tied to your account; you can play the games on any console without an issue. Other profiles will not be able to use your content unless your profile is signed in at the time they wish to access it. I do not know if you can check to see what licenses
 are associated with a specific console.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>in case you don't know it, the profile that bought the game/dlc/content will always have the license for that content.</p>
<p>A profile with the license can redownload the content on any console and use it whenever the console is connected to xbox live.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>But to answer the questions, there is no way (that I know off) to check the licenses on a console, other then trying to use the content with the profile that bought it when the console isn't connected to xbox live. If the content shows up as trial then the license isn't on the console, if the content shows as the full game the license is on the console and on the profile.</p>
<p>Only the profile that bought the content, can use the full content on the console where the license is.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your replies...each reply has addressed my concerns. &nbsp;I will also take the chance of doing the transfer again on the second console, if I did it right the first-time no harm done. &nbsp;If not, my second child will just have to sign on with
 me on the orig. console for the four months. &nbsp;Thank you again for taking the time to help.</p>

            <p>(new method also microsoft dont know)<br />
<br />
<br />
guys i have a solution of error 0xc000007b.<br />
just just you have to</p>
<p>1: &nbsp; Download "msvcr100.dll" in 32bit.</p>
<p>http://download.dll-files.com/0e37fbfa79d349d672456923ec5fbbe3/msvcr100.zip?0XEjQGdGiV</p>
<p>2: &nbsp;paste to &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C:\Windows\System32 (Windows XP, Vista, 7, win 8)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you use a 64-bit version of Windows, you should also place the .dll in&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C:\Windows\SysWOW64\</p>
<p>3: Done<br />
<br />
If you have 64Bit windows then no problem just u have to download&nbsp;"msvcr100.dll" in 32bit only not 64bit then paste to above two mentioned directories.</p>
<p><br />
Thankx</p>

<p>(sorry for my BAD ENGLISH)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is recommended to install all the latest updates which are available during the update of Windows updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool helps remove malicious software from your computers that are running Windows 10. Microsoft releases a new version of the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool every month. After you download the tool,
 the tool runs one time to check your computer for infection by specific prevalent malicious software (including Blaster, Sasser, and Mydoom) and helps remove any infection it finds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, initially I suggest you to run the Windows update troubleshooter on your Computer and then try to update the Windows updates and check if it helps in updating the malicious software tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps: </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click on search bar next to <strong><span>Start Menu</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Type “<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>” without the quotes and click on
<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Click on <strong><span>View All </span></strong>on the left panel of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Click on&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Click on <strong><span>Next </span></strong>and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter. Restart the PC and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as per the description it seems like you are facing an issue with your printer. I suggest you to try the below troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type troubleshooting in the search bar.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select <strong>View all</strong> on the top left corner.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click<strong> </strong>on<strong> Printer</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Check if issue persists.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Kindly let us know if you need any further assistance with Windows. We are glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>thanks I ran the troubleshooter on updates, which stated problems were fixed. Restarted computer that says all up to date.&nbsp; However, when I review update history there are still 2 attempts shown for the updates that failed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the printer, I have already removed all traces I could find and need to try a re-install when I have the strength.&nbsp; I have had several problems with the printer, which was working until the November update.&nbsp; You may have seen the thread regarding
 broken parallel ports....the instructions on that don't work for me.&nbsp; Microsoft told me awhile back that there were no updated drivers for my printer and printer manufacturer only has 8.1 drivers that were working at one time.&nbsp; I have spent far too much time
 on this and am out of pocket.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And we are sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say, "there are still 2 attempts shown for the updates that failed" which are those updates?</li></ul>
<p>Regarding with the printer issue, I suggest you to check by&nbsp;installing the latest printer drivers from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work you may install the drivers in a compatibility mode and check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on&nbsp;<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>‘compatibility’</strong>&nbsp;tab and check the box&nbsp;<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong>&nbsp;and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. </span><span>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>
