<h2>            Locking the size of a chart &#47; chart template&#63;</h2>
                    After making chart templates I wish to also lock the size of the diagram to a specific size, so that whenever I make a chart it is made in a custom size. Also when copying between Excel and Word or PowerPoint I want the chart to be pasted into place in
 this specific size.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this possible?</div>

            Is it possible to set a standard size in the template, so that every time a new template is made, the chart is set into place in a specific size? Now it seems the size depends on the screen resolution?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I don´t want to lock it after it is ready made, but actually set a standard size in the moment it is inserted for the first time....</div>

<h2>            Change the ownership of a OneNote Class Notebook in Office 365</h2>
                    I need to change the ownership of a Class Notebook. The original teacher who created it is not longer at the school and the teacher who now has the job, would like her name to be on the Notebook and not the other's. Is there a way to do this? The new teacher
 has been added as a teacher to the notebook which gives her all the admin rights she needs. It would just be nice if it could have her name on it.

            <p><span>Hi Jill,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to this <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/05/24/teacher-only-spaces-collaboration-space-lockdown-subgroup-creation-and-more-with-the-new-class-notebook-api-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blog</a>, the ownership of OneNote class notebook can be transferred from one teacher to another by using the PowerShell script. To run the script and perform the steps, one should be an Office 365 admin.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4968e689-b7ba-42c5-9657-2e74b247d7b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4968e689-b7ba-42c5-9657-2e74b247d7b9" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To use the script, you should associate your Office 365 subscription with an Azure subscription. You can follow the steps mentioned in this
<a href="https://github.com/OneNoteDev/ClassNotebookTransferAPISample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a>, if you have the azure subscription.</span></p>

<p><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span>If you need any help with the script, we’ll suggest you contact our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointgeneral%2Cappsforsharepoint%2Csharepointdevelopment%2Csharepointcustomization%2Csharepointsearch%2Csharepointadmin&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN forum</a> for further help, as the engineers there can help you if you run in to any issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case, if you do not have the azure subscription or you do not wish to run the script, then as a workaround, you can create a new notebook in new teachers’ OneDrive and copy section by section in to the
 new notebook. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the same <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/05/24/teacher-only-spaces-collaboration-space-lockdown-subgroup-creation-and-more-with-the-new-class-notebook-api-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blog</a>, this functionality (transferring the ownership of notebooks) will be available from Office 365 SharePoint admin in the near future, until then we can use the workarounds.</span></p>

<h2>            Attaching Files from OneDrive in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems attaching files from OneDrive while replying to a message in Outlook iOS. I have the OneDrive app installed and the files also show up on the "Files" tab in my Outlook iOS app. From both the OneDrive app or the Outlook "Files" tab, I
 am able to email a file as an attachment. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I am replying to a message, I couldn't attach a file from OneDrive. Here's what I did: 1) reply to a message, 2) press the paper clip icon, and 3) press "Attach Files" but the files aren't there. See the first screenshot below. And when I click
 on Add OneDrive, my company account doesn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can access all my OneDrive files from the OneDrive app and under the "Files" tab in my Outlook iOS app. See second screenshot below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Please help to see how I can access OneDrive files when I am replying in Outlook iOS.
</strong></em>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Glenn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The probable factor why you're unable to upload or attach a file into your Outlook email might be because of OneDrive's sync issue. We suggest that you follow the steps below:
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uninstall the <strong>OneDrive app </strong>by pressing and holding the OneDrive app icon. Tap the 'X' in the corner&nbsp;and then accept the confirmation message to delete it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Perform a “soft reset” by pressing and holding both the <strong>Sleep/Wake </strong>
and <strong>Home </strong>buttons simultaneously for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo. You can let go of both buttons after the Apple logo appears.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reinstall the OneDrive app from the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=232802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
App Store</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure that OneDrive is kept up-to-date by enabling it in your device's <strong>
Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>General </strong>&gt; <strong>Background App Refresh</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Keep us updated if anything comes up so we can further assist you. </p>

<h2>            Certain appointments on AT&#38;T Tilt are one day earlier than they are in Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>Windows XP</p>
<p>ActiveSync 4.5</p>
<p>Outlook 2003</p>
<p>Windows Mobile 6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a few appointments that recur every 12 days, these appointments are shifted one day earlier on the mobile device, but they are accurate in Outlook.&nbsp; Some of the holidays are also shifted a day.&nbsp; Most of the other appointments are correct.&nbsp;
 On the mobile device, the Outlook generated birthdays and anniversaries show up on the correct date in the calendar, but in the contact information the dates listed are a day early.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just upgraded from an old iPAQ I've had for years, and everything in it is synced&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially I connected via bluetooth... dates were&nbsp;off</p>
<p>I deleted the partnership and created a new one... no change</p>
<p>I connected via usb... nope</p>
<p>I deleted the partnership and uninstalled and reinstalled ActiveSync and created a new partnership... wishful thinking</p>
<p>I've tried to edit the problem appointments in WM6... no luck... the appointment just gets messed up even more</p>
<p>I've deleted and recreated the appointments in Outlook...&nbsp; doesn't change a thing</p>
<p>I can't remember what else I've done, but whatever it was, it didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fell asleep last night on hold with customer service.&nbsp; I got to a person this morning, but my call was upgraded, or something, so they're not going to call me back for a while, and when they do, I'll probably be told that they will research
 the problem and get back to me.&nbsp; So I turn to you guys for help.&nbsp; Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            BUG in Excel re formula precedents</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I thought I’d share this to get your thoughts.&nbsp; I have only 2010 – does anyone&nbsp;get the same with 2007, 2013, 2016, etc.?</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>1. Create a new workbook with at least two tabs.</p>
<p>2. On one tab make a table (ListObject) with headers and data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In cells A1:A2 enter a label (for the header) and a number (for the data point)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Select A1:A2, hit Ctrl-T to make a table, and click OK.</p>
<p>3. On another tab (cell A1) begin entering a formula by typing an equal sign (=).</p>
<p>4. In formula-entry mode switch to the tab with the small table, click cell A2, and hit Enter to finish the formula.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It will look like "=Table1[HeaderLabel]".</p>
<p>5. With the formula still selected click the Trace Precedents button on the Formulas ribbon.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BUG: it says there are none!</p>
<p>6. Go back to the small table, right-click it, and choose Table / Convert to Range.</p>
<p>7. Go back to the formula cell, and click Trace Precedents.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This time it works: you get a tracer arrow to the other tab.</p>
<p>8. Hit Ctrl-Z to undo converting the table to a range.</p>
<p>9. Go to the formula cell, where you'll still see the tracer arrow, and double-click the arrow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; BUG: the dialog box of links is empty!</p>
<p>This doesn't happen if the table and the formula are on the same tab.</p>

            <p>Latest from Microsoft:&nbsp; they've known about it since Office 2007, but without "significant business impact" they won't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, at S&amp;P we use Excel to develop financial and stochastic models&nbsp;that analysts use to decide ratings&nbsp;we publish -- that's our line of work.&nbsp; These models have to undergo exhaustive and serious auditing,&nbsp;version control, build/QA/deploy,&nbsp;&nbsp;checks, tests,
 balances, etc., etc., and formula auditing is an integral part of that.&nbsp; So if that's not "significant business impact", I don't know what is!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, guys, it's a bug.&nbsp; Man up and fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how do I know that my office activation has been completed successfully&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a new Acer laptop with which I got MS office 2010 free for 30 days tral version. I have also purchased&nbsp;a lincensed version of MS Office home and student 2010. I have installed it and activated -online ,&nbsp;as per the set up wizard. But I want
 to assure whether the activation has been successful or not. I can see my office application working in compatible&nbsp;editable mode but am bot sure whether it is a free 30 days trial version or it is after activation of&nbsp;the MS office home edition&nbsp;suit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please confirm my activation so as to receive a good service of the MS office suit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having a nightmare to sync One Drive for Business to my computer - I follow the steps after pressing the 'sync now' button, it accepts my email address and password, but then another dialogue box pops up titled "Connecting to netorg50836-my.sharepoint.com"
 where I am asked to 'Enter your credentials'. I enter my username (email address) and password - to be told it couldn't verify my credentials. What am I missing?</p>

<p>hi gary,</p>
<p>have your tried syncing the test account's onedrive for business library? this would help us identify whether it's a client issue or credential/account issue.</p>
<p>also, regarding "we can't connect to the specified sharepoint site", you can try the following steps to see the result.<br />
</p>
<p>1. if you have some libraries synced, right click onedrive icon in taskbar and stop syncing all the libraries,
<strong>exit</strong> onedrive for business sync client.</p>
<p>2. delete the previous credentials via control panel &gt; credential manager &gt; windows credentials and remove all office related credentials one by one.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4658eb59-4427-45b9-b3e7-3d97d93ed9d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4658eb59-4427-45b9-b3e7-3d97d93ed9d6" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>3. restart your computer.</p>
<p>4. run an online repair on your office applications. open control panel &gt; programs and features, select office application and click change &gt; online repair &gt; repair.</p>
<p>actually, from the library url you filled in, we can see that you are syncing your onedrive for business library rather than sharepoint library. so we strongly suggest you use

<h2>            Memory problems</h2>
                    
<p>I get the message that my site is full, so, as asked I emptied the recycle bins. Then I went to Storage Metrics and it was indeed confirmed that my memory ran out. There was however a button with Request more quota'. I clicked it and got a message that it
 was succesful (no further information).</p>
<p>Since then however nothing has happened, no messages from MS, no changes in mem-size. I have an Office 365 account Small Business (6 licenses). What can I expect to happen and how long does this take.</p>

                    <p class="contentHeader1">Soapbox:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As Adobe ruins Adobe FrameMaker, some of us technical writers may suffer WinWord again. Or MadCap Flare. Or LibreOffice.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>MS Word 2003 was quite spiffy and reliable with long manual composition on Win XP with
</em><em>numerous</em><em>&nbsp;images and illustrations </em><em>in the file </em><em>using the MS Word 2003 drawing layer.&nbsp;I once said, "MS Word may replace FrameMaker. At least we have Unicode in&nbsp;Word as of Word 97.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;I have few good things to say of MS Word 2013 (v15).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There's my soapbox. Now I need help. Lest I get out the sector editor out ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Word 2013 ( Version 15.0.4659.1001), Win 8.1, 20,607 KB .docx file. An Asus Laptop with Intel onboard graphics, 8 Gigabytes RAM, Intel I-5 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>I'm composing a rather long hardware install guide for a client.&nbsp;The file contains many photo and&nbsp;&nbsp;of images, innumerable complex illustrations using the MS Word drawing layer. About 70 pages with TOC, List of Figures (LOF), and List of Tables (LOT) as the
 only generated lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS Word 2013 crashes innumerable times, so, with research, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled both COM Add-Ins (OneNote Notes, Send to Bluetooth)</li><li>Word Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Uncheck "Use subpixel positioning to smooth fonts onscreen.</li></ul>
<p>I realize today I should have already&nbsp;checked (populate the box with a check), to disable, (Word Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Disable hardware graphic acceleration) a bug between Word and some video drivers or hardware; Intel video tops the list, research suggests,
 and that's what's in this Asus laptop thing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp;I open the file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title page header displays only. </li><li>Navigation Pane displays headings</li><li>Search can find word in the document.</li></ul>
<p>The content remains in the binary Word 2013 .docx file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The styles endemic to the file open in the Home Tab, Style pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also performed the MS Word 2013 "Open and Repair" feature with no suceess and no messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On&nbsp;a Win 7 workstation I perform the MS Word 2010 "Open and Repair" feature with innumerable messages, yet the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 4000 minutes effort in this document. I would like to finish in over the next several months and deliver it to the client to their satisfaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Soapbox (slight return):</p>
<p><em>MS Word 15 (2013) is a complete reversal of advances made to MS Word up to MS Word 2003. Win 8.1 has the usability and human factors design&nbsp;of a fast food restaurant overhead menu. MS Word 2013 is reliable like MS Word '95 on Win '95 or Word 97 on Windows
 98. Requiring users log into a remote account as outlook.com is an egregious violation of good IT security. No ISO 2700x-compliant, or compliant seeking,&nbsp;organization, would ever accept Win 8.1.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try your suggestion as described on http://support.microsoft.com/kb/893672.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the article Properties section:</p>
<p><br />
<em>APPLIES TO</em><br />
<em>•Microsoft Office Word 2007</em><br />
<em>•Microsoft Word 2002</em><br />
<em>•Microsoft Word 2010</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, aside from my soapbox commentary, the MS Word 2013 .docx file, I authored this file on in MS Weird (Word) 2013 (Version 15.0.4659.1001) on Windows 8.1. All updates automatic and current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other individual has accessed the file in any other Word or Win version on any other Windows instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 10 NOV 2014, after posting this article, I contacted MS Support, paid the 99$, and after some hours of the very kind and thoughtful Support Engineer working through the issues, this matter has been appreciated to&nbsp;Tier&nbsp;2 support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did perform the WinWord 2013&nbsp;file open and repair feature with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I duplicated the file to a USB drive, then used sneaker net (1980s!) to access the file on a Win 7 instance with WinWord 2010 using the open and repair feature, there was a report of issues dealing with listed graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can tell, one or more of the indices in the .XML schema inside the (.zip) .docx file is broken do to WinWord 15 possessing memory management issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post back with progress and results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for now, I'll recreate the lost content, separate sections into individual files, and go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet I'll try the method you advocate in Article ID: 893672.</p>

            <p>Hi Deepak Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the macro modification per instructions in Article ID: 893672.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to changing the .docx to .zip, then opening the .zip&nbsp;file to look at the .xml file schema therein to find an error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it troubling, that with the change to the .docx file format, all stored as a compressed .zip, yet named .docx, that MS Word does not validate the data structures in the file on at least
<em>file&nbsp;save</em> or <em>file save as new</em>, and in MS Word 15 (2013), as well as
<em>file open</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess .docx xml and other data structure validation occurs only when using the File Open and Repair feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The general concept for your problem is "document corruption".&nbsp; It was a major problem in the older "DOC" / 2003 format and was supposed to be fixed by the change to the DOCX XML format.&nbsp; Unfortunately it created new types of corruption.&nbsp; Fortunately, or
 not, for you you are not suffering from the most common form of corruption which diagnosed by a XML "End Tag" error.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are some real XML experts on this forum. Look for the "XML End Tag" discussions.&nbsp; Even though your problem is off topic, they will probably be willing to look at your file and possibly help you.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The first thing I can suggest to try (after you have already done the troubleshooting link) is to try the competition, OpenOffice or LibreOffice.&nbsp; They include a better XML validation and correction process at file open. It has been known to fix problems
 that Word can't handle. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't have a specific fix for your problem. <br />

<p style="margin-left: 0">The error message “<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/21971fa0-df44-4ba6-ac42-7d4b5cd4174f"><strong>Unspecified Error, word/document.xml, Line:2, Column: 0</strong></a><span><strong>”
</strong></span>is pretty useless. You can edit XML to add lines breaks at each XML tag. Then when you open the file it will provide you with hopefully a more usefull line number to start from (as long as it is not the end of the document).<br />
</p>
<p>Opening the word\document.xml file with Notepad++ and then opening the Replace function window, you can put each XML tag on its own line and get a line number for your error, instead of “line 2, column 0”. Apparently putting the tags each on their own line
 and then rezipping the document.xml file with its fellow XML subfiles, does no harm, but obviously helps a great deal pinpointing the problem.
<br />
</p>
<p><span>However one should note, there is a trick to putting each tag on its own line in NotePad++...you have to be sure to move the radio button in the Search Mode section of the Replace Window from “Normal” to “Extended” and use “\n” to indicate a new line
 to the program. See step number 5.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>So here are the steps for recovering manually from Unspecified Error Line 2, Column 0.&nbsp;Credit for this algorithm should go to ???</span><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>NotePad++</span></a><span>. Many expert users agree NotePad++ is the best software for this kind of thing. I have turned on word-wrap from the View menu, so that why the text fills the screen
 instead of the normal case where line 2 runs off the page to the right almost ad infinitum I’m sure it seems...<span>

<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><strong>Note</strong>: Here are 4 patterns of bad XML which will lead to “Unspecified error - Location: &nbsp;Part: /word/document.xml, Line: 2, Column: 0”.
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Something wrong inside <span>&lt;<strong>m:oMath</strong>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>&lt;/<strong>m:oMath</strong>&gt;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>tags<br />
Removing the tags and everything in between, sometimes cures the problem. This problem apparently is caused by editing equations after they are initially created and saved. The work around is if you have to fix an error in an existing equation it is safer to
 simply recreate the whole equation</li><li>Something wrong inside of<span>&nbsp; </span>&lt;<strong><span>w:tbl</span></strong>&gt; and
<span>&lt;<strong>/w:tbl</strong>&gt;</span> tags. <br />
Removing the tags and everything in between, sometimes cures the problem.</li><li>Something wrong inside of &lt;<strong><span>w:fldChar w:fldCharType=”begin”/</span></strong>&gt; and
<strong><span>&lt;w:fldChar w:fldCharType=”end”/&gt;</span> </strong>tags. These tags define the Table of Contents.
<br />
Removing the tags and the content in between allows these files to sometime open. That is a bit drastic but it is what chrima &nbsp;reccommends here:&nbsp;<a href="http://help.wugnet.com/office/open-docx-file-content-error-ftopict1081932.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.wugnet.com/office/open-docx-file-content-error-ftopict1081932.html</a>.
 It could come down to some tags that shouldn’t exist in the TOC. You might experiment to remove some odd looking tags within the TOC to see if you can save it although recreating it may be better. This blog post suggest an easy way to get rid of the TOC is
 to open the corrupt Word file in Office Docs/Office365/Office Online, which have apparently lower standards as to what is corrupt in this regard, and apparently you then easily remove the TOC there and save it and then download it again for TOC recreation
 on your Desktop version of Word:&nbsp;<a href="http://problemswiththecontent.blogspot.com/2011/03/file-cannot-be-opened-because-there-are.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://problemswiththecontent.blogspot.com/2011/03/file-cannot-be-opened-because-there-are.html</a>.</li><li>Sometimes the <strong><span>&lt;m:num&gt;&lt;/m:num&gt;</span></strong>&nbsp;pair contains absolutely no content and can be removed without any damage to the DOCX at all.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Now that XML code sequence passes syntax muster but Word still chokes on it. This can be proven by extracting the
<em>word\document.xml</em>&nbsp;and opening it in Excel (or some other XML editor).<br />
</p>
<p>I first tried to delete the lower&nbsp;<em>&lt;m:ctrlPr&gt;&lt;/m:ctrlPr&gt;</em> section as it seemed empty of any actual contribution to the content of the DOCX but that still did not allow Word to open the document. Failing that, I noted other surrounding text so I could
 locate the problem area within the document at a later time (e.g. within <em>Word</em>) and snipped out the entire&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>&lt;m:num&gt;&lt;/m:num&gt;</em>&nbsp;block. This allowed Word to open the DOCX.<br />
</p>
<p>I searched for the surrounding content I had noted previously and recorded the page number. I zoomed to
<em>10%</em>&nbsp;and took a screenshot of the first four pages and wrote my reply.<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>Here is another cause for this error:<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>here’s what caused my problem: Where you found the error, I had a checkbox (legacy form field) inside of a plain text content control field.&nbsp; It didn’t cause any problems when left alone, but when I altered only that field (i.e., checked the box), saved
 the doc, and reopened it, presto, there was the error.&nbsp; I guess Word doesn’t like form fields inside of form fields...which is maybe an obvious thing...&nbsp; I’d done it based on a suggestion I found online, because putting the checkbox inside the plain text content
 control field allowed the user to actually tab to the checkbox -- Word won’t tab to it otherwise (apparently due to the mix of legacy fields and 2007 fields).&nbsp; Oh well, I guess I can live without that :-)&nbsp; I took the checkbox out of the plain text field and
 now the form works fine.<br />

<p>Thanks to your advice I managed to restore my document and it saved me a ton of headache. So I thought I should write some words about the method I used to fix xml errors in document.xml.<br />
</p>
<p>I opened the docx in 7-zip and unzipped document.xml. The problem was that document.xml had ~90k tags so this was far too much to read through manually to find the error.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>What I also saw is that Word store document.xml without Windows line endings, so the whole document was on one line(I saw this when I opened it in Notepad and Visual Studio).<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I then opened document.xml with Microsoft Xml Notepad and saved it again. Xml Notepad is configured to normalize the line endings when saving the xml file. I zipped document.xml back into the docx-file and opened it in Word. This time, instead of getting
 Line:2,column:0, I got something like Line:75377,column:0.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I then jumped to the erroneous line, deleted it and some other suspicious tags around it and zipped document.xml back into the docx. Opened the document in word again, got an error on a different line and repeated the procedure. After three attempts I had
 managed to clean my document of errors and it opened correctly in Word.&nbsp;<br />

This page has the most readable description of Word file structures, DOC and DOCX, I have seen so far<br />
</p>
<p><span>The logical structure of a Word 97‑2003 format document is one of a series of elements arranged in a hierarchy, much like a mini file system. As an example, here is the structure of a simple Word 97‑2003 (.doc) format document:
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>MyDocument.doc </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>1Table </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>*CompObj </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>Word Document</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>*SummaryInformation </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>*DocumentSummaryInformation </span>
<br />
</p>
<p>The physical structure of the complete file bears little relation to the logical structure; it is, again, of a proprietary design, a compound, or structured storage, file. Briefly, and loosely, the separate logical elements of the file are broken
 up into blocks; these blocks are treated as individual units, which units are then organised without regard for their logical arrangement, and catalogued, catalogue and organisation detail being held alongside the blocks themselves, to enable recombination
 into logical components when necessary.<br />

<p><strong><em><span>Views of a Word 97-2003 format Document</span></em></strong><br />
</p>
<p><span>The logical structure of a Word 2007 format document is one of a series of elements arranged in a hierarchy, much like a mini file system. As an example, here is the structure of a simple Word 2007 (.docx) format:
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>MyDocument.docx </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>_rels </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>rels </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>docProps </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>app.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>core.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>word </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>_rels </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>document.xml.rels </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>theme </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>theme1.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>document.xml</span></strong><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>settings.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>fontTable.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>webSettings.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>styles.xml </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>[Content_Types].xml </span><br />
</p>
<p><span>As briefly as before, the [Content_Types] file and the _rels folders, along with the subordinate files therein, contain information about the logical structure, and the two files in the docProps folder contain much the same as the two Information
 files in the old format. The document.xml element within the word folder holds the bulk of the document content and the other files within that same folder hold formatting details.
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>So, you might say, the internal structure of a document has changed a little, so what? There are, however, other changes that make a bigger difference. The first is that, although both logical formats are conceptually similar, they are wrapped
 up in completely different ways to make a single file. Instead of the proprietary physical structure used for Word 97‑2003 format documents, a fairly standard, and open, Zip Archive format is used for Word 2007 format documents. The second change is that instead
 of using obscure binary codes, everything in Word 2007 format documents, well almost everything, is held in XML format.
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>All data held as XML? In a standard Zip Package? It should be much easier to work with, then? Judge for yourself; here are some views of parts of a Word 2007 format document taken from a hex editor:
</span><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Views of a Word 2007 format Document</span></em></strong><br />
</p>
<p>I found that the 13th &lt;mc:AlternateContent&gt;&lt;mc:Choice Requires=”wps”&gt; actually ended with
<br />
</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
&lt;/mc:Choice&gt;&lt;/w:r&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>... instead of this,<br />
</p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
&lt;/mc:Choice&gt;<strong>&lt;/mc:AlternateContent&gt;</strong>&lt;/w:r&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>... so I fixed it.<br />
</p>
<p>What you have found was, indeed, the error; this is a new type of corruption that is starting to appear - Microsoft have told me nothing has changed but something, somewhere, certainly appears to have done - and well done for fixing it - especially
 in Notepad; the more people who can do this the better.<br />
</p>
<p>The correct construct looks like this (apologies in advance for the formatting - I don’t see any tools in this forum):<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&lt;mc:AlternateContent&gt;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mc:Choice requires = “wps”&gt;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word 2010 xml<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/mc:Choice&gt;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mc:Fallback&gt;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word 2007 xml<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/mc:Fallback&gt;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&lt;/mc:AlternateContent&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>When Word 2010 reads the xml it reads the “wps” Choice section - the Word 2010 graphics format code - and ignores the rest. Earlier versions of Word will read whatever is in the Fallback section (which should be a Word 2007 format graphic) and ignore
 the Choice.<br />
</p>
<p>Requires=”wps” does not actually _mean_ Word 2010, but in this case it implies it. The contents of the two lots of xml are, typically, a &lt;drawing&gt; structure for 2010, and a &lt;pict&gt; structure for 2007.<br />
</p>
<p>When there is no fallback, the document will open in earlier versions, but there will simply be nothing in place of the image.&nbsp;I can not&nbsp;reconstruct the required pict structure -&nbsp;although it would be fun to try -&nbsp;and I don’t think Yves can either,
 so we add a basic Fallback construct containing a&nbsp;text placeholder, so that anyone opening the document in Word 2007 is notified that something is missing.<br />
</p>
<p>Ideally the document owner will fix the problem once they can open the document but, unless they are running multiple versions of Word - which isn’t common for normal users - it will be very hard for them to know whether they have done so.<br />
</p>
<p>Enjoy, Tony<br />

<strong><span>Sysadmin blog</span></strong><span> What do you do when a critical Word document won’t open? Even in today’s world of versioned documents, it is entirely possible for
 corruption to squeak in and go unnoticed, wrecking your entire version history.</span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>But all is not lost. My wife had this happen to her; here’s how we solved it.</span><br />
</p>
<div>
Real world example
<p><span>In my case, Word wouldn’t open an important file, dying instead with the error “the name in the end tag of the element must match the element type in the start tag”. Translated from Microsoftese: “The word processor that created this document
 made an XML boo-boo, and Word is going to refuse to read this document now.”</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>The most common kind of XML boo-boos that word processors will make are either saving tags out of order (the most famous example being Microsoft Word’s
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2528942/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 221, 1)">oMath tags error</span></a><span>) or opening a tag but not closing it. Today’s issue was the latter. The wife was using an
 old version of LibreOffice Writer (v4.1) and had made several changes to hyperlinks in one area of the document. Writer got confused somehow, opened a hyperlink tag, but didn’t actually put in any information as to where it was hyperlinking to, and didn’t
 close the tag.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>What should be noted here is that Writer and Word behave very differently with this broken file. Writer will open the file, but simply stop processing the document around where the XML stops making sense. Word will vomit that error and die.
 Both are useful.</span><br />

            <p>Rohn007,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly for the comprehensive reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LibreOffice 4.3.2.2, the current newest version as of date,&nbsp;opens the file, yet displays only two pages of content with some carriage returns. I have yet to try Apache OpenOffice.org, yet I expect the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all to familiar with how horribly Microsoft Office and other Microsoft applications do not validate data on file open and file save.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best validation action comes in the form of saving the file as a new file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at essence, in spite of the dog-awful, yet hideous interface of Windows 8.1, the insecurity of an outlook.com account paralleling the root admin account on the Win 8.1&nbsp;localhost, and how the formaly much ballyhooed 'xml' file formats since Office 2007,
 what we have here is ...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Microsoft Office '95, '97, and 2000 ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>... dressed up as Microsoft Office 2013. Complete with corrupting your files. Specifically Excel and MS Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By Office 2003, I was able to anticipate such issues by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using complete saves (Not incremental or the binary file formats go to the %%%###!!!!)</li><li>Save the file as a new file name</li></ul>
<p>So, the same as nothing has changed, and Microsoft dumps poor quality compiled code layered into the marketing sensibilities of an overhead North American fast food restaurant menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can rock with Office 2003 with good file curation. I'd go no newer than the now no longer sold, if sort of goofy Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good human factors engineering and good usability are also gone. We now have the ribbon in each Win 8.1 desktop window. Appears as if there was conflict from disparate design philosophies since Office 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As dog-awful as what Adobe has done to ruin FrameMaker. I've used Frame since the version 3 I still have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perfect was the Win NT 40 SP6.0a desktop metaphor. Applied to Win XP without window title bar color gradients. Save the screen captures at 8-bit PNG files. Small, yet lossless. Perfect for single sourcing. I could do the same work using the interface perfected
 in Office 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the interface is consumer marketing garbage in the operating system and the premier, or ubiquitous, I should say, MS Office&nbsp;productivity suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, thanks for the garbage. I conscientious technical writer do one's best to champion the client's content, and you, the Microsoft Office and Word development team, produce corruption and mediocrity, at best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a productivity environment to produce for my employer and clients. Not the American McDonald's fast food of interfaces and environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot express how upsetting this has been without violating the forum rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win XP was way more advanced than the, at the same time, Mac OS 10.4.x (I guess). I'll look at Apple, again, yet computing should not be entirely some social expression and identification tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though it falls on uncaring sensesbilities in old Redmond at the Microsoft Mothership (Connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, at least in old Redmond (North Redmond)&nbsp;you have the Black Raven Brewing Company. Best in WA-state I'd had in addition to Kulshan Brewing in beautiful, beautiful Bellingham, WA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could REALLY enjoy a few pints of the Royal Tennenbaum Christmas Ale in Bellingham, at Kulshan, after this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or a few pints of the Buttermilk. (With a little pepper on top.) And some fresh sourdough bread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great gravy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to work.</p>
<p>

            <p>Uncle Rohn007,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. I'm only stating opinion with the Volvo 240 analogy for what systems and software should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Darigold buttermilk in WA-state, and Kulshan and Black Raven Breweries in North Redmond, well, that my opinion stated as fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of big data, analytics, and all the goofy, if funky stuff, I'd imagines all of these forums are mined for understanding as to the current state of perceptions for product users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth-seeking dialectic become understanding of grammars and such, that then, becomes of the rhetoric of the ad-campaign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 and MS Office are the products of the prior executive group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We now have Mr. Nadella and staff at the helm. I hope for better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let idle processor cycle and bandwidth be. I PRODUCE content. NOT consume it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as much as I don't like Adobe, I REALLY want to say someday, again, as with judicious Office 2003 Professional on Win XP, use, that I can use Microsoft Office, Windows, and other tools like Publisher, to do what I could do in any Adobe Product. (I really
 don't like Adobe as they ruined Frame. The media runtimes are quite good for media development and resource gobbling playback. Same for Silverlight.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel Microsoft is a better agent than many of the large technology corporations. While I don't like the fad known as the Cloud, (what Larry Ellison and his slew of island may call network computing in the day), Microsoft has the extant examples, has collected
 a quality armoire and cadre of cloud services that shall comprise Azure. (Google is evil and Amazon&nbsp;ain't no good agent no more as what they did with Hachette Publishers. All folks I know on the current slew of Apple computing products, no not the iPhone this
 and iThat- that,&nbsp;describe it as Nirvana. (These are developers for Linux-hosted system.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It made me hideously sore to lose that content for my client and their customer using MS Word. It still hurts to this day, yet I'm ahead of the loss, now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, back to the 5U4 GB full-wave rectifier vacuum tube.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best to owld Redmond, WA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WA-state. The mightiest state! Glad to be here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers.</p>

            Dear friend you should be patient while you use these apps because these apps need to be configured first and if this doesn't work you should long click the app and then the options will arrive and goto application access and then communications and data
 access.<br />
May this solve your problem.

<p>I have the same problem. Connection failed.This problem with connection is only with applications that I installed myself. These applications has a symbol of Key over the icon. What does it mean? And another problem: I can not run the Ovi Store.It is loading

            So, it means that your phone's software is corrupted if you can't use the third party apps or the ovi store.The key on the icon means that the app is protected and is a third party app.Or other way is to contact your service provider for gprs settings
 and you can't do mannual settings in C2-02/03/05/06 phones that's y u can't watch online videos.Rush your nearest Nokia Care Centre and update your phone's software and try to use ovi store for apps instead of third party apps and use your phone's default
 browser instead of opera,bolt,uc,netfront etc.<br />
Thank You.

            <p>Which process is the consumer of this high CPU usage? Take a&nbsp;first look using Task Manager.</p>
<p>But as you had the problem with a previous build, I suspect you are dealing with a faulty driver or a faulty HW component. Maybe you should inspect your HW &amp; drivers and look for updates if any.</p>

<h2>            Account sign-in issue with verify email</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to access my Skype account since the end of last week. My username and my password are correct (Skype says I am signed in) but it keeps on asking me to verify that I own the account by emailing an email that does not exist. Therefore I cannot
 verify the account. It also won't let me add another email or change it, and I am stuck here without any other option.</p>

<h3> microsoftsignin1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 2011 Excel Compatibility with Mac OS X 10.10.5 &#43; AWFUL customer service</h2>
                    <br />
<p>RE: Inserting Pictures into Cells</p>
<p>On Mac 10.9.5, when inserting pictures from file, I had to find the picture on my computer the first time. The rest of the times, I was taken back to the last folder. Now, excel keeps taking me back to my computer's document folder. No big deal except when
 I have to insert 60 pictures ( meaning I have to find the same folder where the pictures are in 60 times.)</p>
<p>Re Customer service:</p>
<p>Signed up for call back. Was told I would be called in 155 minutes. Was called back. Heard Windows 10 ads for 10 minutes. How about ONLY calling someone back when an actual person is available? Being forced to listen Windows 10 ads for 10 minutes&nbsp; does not
 make me feel positively about the product. Representative called me on the phone. I explained the situation. He said this was a " very complicated " issue. When I mentioned that what I wanted worked on Mac OS 10.9.5, my call got disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 1: He didn't want to/ lacked enough knowledge to help so he hung up.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: Phone was disconnected accidentally. Since Microsoft called me, why hasn't someone called me back? If person could not access my phone #... why not? This is Microsoft after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consistently bad customer service. This company is so large that it's going to fall under it's own weight.</p>

            <p>I'm afraid there's nothing anyone here can do re your experience with Microsoft's customer Service other than suggest that you call or write to register your complaint. If you call, ask to speak to a Supervisor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the software problem: My understanding is that this is due to O2011 being predominantly Carbon-based code. In view of the age of this version I doubt that there will be any change even if it can be corrected. O2016 is completely rebuilt using Cocoa-based
 code so it works as you expect... although [IMO] that hardly justifies going to the new release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you go into the <strong>Choose a Picture</strong> dialog open the Locations list at the top &amp; select the folder you want from the
<strong>Recent Places</strong> listing. You'll return directly to it.</li><li>If you use the same folder frequently, add it to the Finder window Sidebar. It will be selectable from any Open/Save type of dialog including Choose a Picture. Remove the folder from the Sidebar when no longer needed.</li><li>If you still have it, take advantage of iPhoto which integrates with the O2011 Media Browser... you never have to use Insert&gt; Photo for any pictures in an iPhoto Library. [In Yosemite, Apple has replaced iPhoto with the new Photos.app which isn't supported
 in O2011.]</li></ul>

            <p>So I am guessing that you are coping those files to a SD card AND that card was used in a previous device. If that is true then there are probably some hidden files written to the card that are causing this issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If that is the case, remove the card, format the SD card then try adding the video files back.</p>

<h2>            Missing tiles E3</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I've been assigned an E3 license. So Office online is included. However when I log into portal.office.com I only see tiles for mail, calendar, persons and tasks. Clicking on 'display all apps' changed nothing. I checked the assigned license via the
 site admin, and it is E3. What is going wrong?</p>

            I though I wouldn't use it either but alter awhile in 8.1 I decided to give it a try, found it was a good place to store things like my drivers and software from computer manufacturer, turned out it was faster to retrieve them from one drive than to download
 them from Dell......I just turned off all the automatically uploaded stuff that way it only stores what I manually upload to it.&nbsp;

<p>I am running the only version of Win10 that was available for download after Microsoft had been bugging me for weeks with pop-ups: "upgrade NOW". There are various gpedit.msc files in c:\windows and c:\windows.old, but I apparently have no authority do access
 these. Note that this is not a work or networked computer. but my brand new personal PC at home. A MAC looks more and more appealing.</p>

            <p>I am in the same boat! &nbsp;I started trying to slowly move picture files from OneDrive to other folders (like I had to sneak them out) so I could try and stop OneDrive from making many, many copies of the same photos. &nbsp;Especially now that Microsoft has decided
 to charge for storage. &nbsp;I also do not have and cannot access gpedit.msc. &nbsp;I actually have removed all files until now, when I click on the OneDrive file, it says it is empty. And it no longer shows up on my toolbar as a hidden icon. &nbsp;Problem is, now NONE of
 my photo links that were in that list of hidden icons are there anymore, except iCloud. &nbsp;Plus, I can't seem to find a way to get my computer from downloading my photos to either OneDrive, or sometimes Documents under This PC.</p>
<p>None of the suggestions in this support group, or any other similar questions/suggestions have helped. &nbsp;That is what has forced me to look to the net for help. But as other people have mentioned, I don't want to find out that if I completely destroy OneDrive
 from my PC, it will still take all of the photos it took me so long to remove.</p>
<p>This is total frustration to the nth degree!!!!</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6680 Displaying number instead of contact name</h2>
                    Hi, I have a nokia 6680 which I upgraded to the latest firmware version. For some reason, there are some numbers that the phone won't display the contact name and will display the number only, even though the contact is saved in the phone memory.<br />
It happens only when I recieve SMSs from certain people. When they call, I see their name fine, but when they send SMSs, I only see their number displayed.<br />
Any Idea how to fix this?

            check that you dont have that number duplicated in your contacts list. Try deleting the contact and re-entering it. Remember if you solve the problem the messages that are already in the inbox wont change to show the name.

    <title>Misidentified circular reference in Windows Excel 2013, Office for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmoag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Misidentified circular reference in Windows Excel 2013, Office for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have a not that complex spreadsheet that has sheets for every month of the year structured to look like a basic double entry ledger.</p>
<p>There is a formula that compares values from the current year to the year before for the same month. It is a simple formula that I have used without incident in multiple prior versions of Excel.</p>
<p>On some of the worksheets Excel 2013 identifies the formula as a circular reference but not on other worksheets. The same formula is used in a column to derive comparisons of several different values and it seems random that Excel will single some iterations
 of the formula as circular and not others and is not consistent from worksheet to worksheet.</p>
<p>There is no circular reference (A specific example: Excel says BA43 contains a circular reference but BA43 is not referenced in the formula), the workbooks from one year to the next are correctly linked. The formula returns a correct value when compared
 to a manually performed calculation.</p>
<p>When I open the same workbook in Office/Excel for Mac it identifies different iterations of the formula as having circular references than the Windows version. Again there are no circular references,Nada, zilch, zip, and the formula calculates a correct
 value.</p>
<p>I just want to know how to turn them off to avoid having to click through two useless/wrong warning boxes every time I open this workbook, which is nearly every day and is the only important spreadsheet for which I use Excel or which contains formulas of
 any complexity.</p>

<p>I seem to recall Excel 2013 has a bug regarding circular references.</p>

            Thanks for your offer but there is too much proprietary information on the spreadsheet and I don't have a template with just formulas. As noted the messages about circular references are annoying but fortunately I do not see any inaccurate results in the
 spreadsheet when I manually check on the cells identified by Excel as having circular references.<br />

            You could replace sensitive text with nonsense text, but that might even break any existing circular reference (the data affects the calculation chain). No problem, it was just an offer.

            <p>Protected view should also respect the "All Markup" view; I don't know why it doesn't on your system. You can try a modified macro such as the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub AutoOpen()<br />
&nbsp;On Error GoTo errhandler<br />
&nbsp;With Application.ProtectedViewWindows(1).Document.ActiveWindow.View.RevisionsFilter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Markup = wdRevisionsMarkupAll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .View = wdRevisionsViewFinal<br />
&nbsp;End With<br />
&nbsp;Exit Sub<br />
errhandler:<br />
&nbsp; With ActiveWindow.View.RevisionsFilter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .Markup = wdRevisionsMarkupAll<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .View = wdRevisionsViewFinal<br />
&nbsp;End With<br />
&nbsp;End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, add&nbsp;the macro&nbsp;to your Normal template as discussed above.</p>
