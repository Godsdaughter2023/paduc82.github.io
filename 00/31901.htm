<h2>            HP pavilion No Sound Problem</h2>
                    Hello I'm here because there is no sound coming from my laptop. I just got this laptop a few weeks ago and everything was great but suddenly one day there was no more sound. I've looked into it to see if anything was muted or if it was disabled, no. Everything
 is how it should be. Even the speakers work. There are no updates that need to be done also. I've reset the computer and tried to roll back driver but it is not allowing me. Does anybody know what I&nbsp; should I do?

            Hi there, thanks for your question. A number of users have reported audio errors after the latest Windows Update, so Microsoft have published an article to guide you through fixing the issue:
<br />

<br />
<br />If you're still having trouble with audio after following those steps, try reverting to a previous version of Windows until the new update is available with fixes for audio:

            Hi Victoria.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>1. Yes, the current battery is OK and when cuts out it is still over 90%</p>
<p>2. Not sure, but would have been whatever it was brought with, </p>
<p>3. Free version of Avast and Malwarebyte&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Probably, can't remember which, but no longer on computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. No&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.674)</p>

            1. When did you purchase the current battery? [The problem may be the internal power supply/hardware, not the battery. Not unusual for an aging-in-place Samsung laptop. If so, you'd have to take the laptop to a reputable repair shop for testing - which would cost you at least $150.00 USD.]
<br />
<br />2. When you're running on external power for long periods of time, do you leave the battery in its bay or do you remove it?
<br />
<br />3. Assuming Avast Free is still installed =&gt; In File Explorer [WinKey+E], navigate to &amp; right-click on: 
<br />
<br />. • C:\Program Files\Avast Software &lt;=this folder 
<br />
<br />Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?
<br />
<br />4. When &amp; why was MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware (MBAM) installed? Is (was) it MBAM Premium v3.x (free-trial), MBAM Premium v2.x, or MBAM Free? Has MBAM ever detected &amp; quarantined anything since it's been installed?
<br />
<br />5. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., CCleaner's Registry Cleaner component; Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Advanced System Optimizer; Comodo System Cleaner; Glary Utilities; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG Quick Clean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; Norton PC Tuneup; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; FixMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Wise Care 365; Wise Cleaner; Bitdefender OneClick Optimizer; etc.)?

<p>1. Not sure if before or after windows 10 was added, but think after&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Not sure what you mean, but when plugged in the battery is connected, have never run laptop without the battery&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Not near computer presently, but I am running the latest version of Avast&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Not premium, and yes it has detected and quarantined, and installed to addes such issues that were slowing laptop down&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Yes,&nbsp; CCleaner and Avast systems boot&nbsp;</p>

            1. So the current battery's approx. three (3) years old, is that correct? 
<br />
<br />2. When the computer is plugged in to an external power source (i.e., a wall outlet or power strip) for extended periods, you leave the battery in it's bay, is that correct? 
<br />
<br />3. REPOSTING =&gt; In File Explorer [WinKey+E], navigate to &amp; right-click on: 
<br />
<br />. • C:\Program Files\Avast Software &lt;=this folder 
<br />
<br />Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab? [I don't care what version's installed, I need to know when it was installed.]
<br />
<br />4. Do you know what "Avast system boot" [AKA Avast Boot-time scan] is and does?
<br />
<br />5. Do you have backups of ALL the changes CCleaner's Registry Cleaner component has EVER made to the computer?
<br />
<br />=&gt; Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here.

            Your best bet at this point (IMHO) would be to replace the battery again. I'm seeing several retailers offering them for $20.00 USD or less - but chances are the lower-priced ones are reconditioned/remanufactured, not brand-new (not unusual for such an older laptop).
<br />
<br />If the behavior persists after replacing the battery, chances are the internal power supply is faulty or about to die.
<br />
<br />TIP: For longer battery life, remove the battery from the laptop (i.e., the battery bay) when running in external (AC or DC) power for extended periods. Store the battery in a cool, dark, dust-free environment (e.g., in a "Zip-lok" bag (all the air squeezed out) in a fridge or freezer).
<br />
<br />Good luck!

<p>
</p><p>I've been locked out of my account and the email address used to reset was old, so I've entered a new one but I can't get microsoft to verify it, even if I answer all the questions. Being logged into my microsoft account doesn't seem to help at all either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3 Possible solutions:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Norton Security Suite (skip if you do not have it installed)</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms in my case were a flashing screen post update to Threshold, caused by explorer restarting over and over. The start menu and shortcut keys would not work, and the network icon would not appear in the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The reason for the restarts on this machine&nbsp;were issues with the bushell.dll shell extension that's a part of the Norton Security Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your mileage will vary, the steps below will only help if your issue has the same cause as in my case and require some experience with using low level technical tools. If you are not familiar with the windows command line, you should not attempt
 this type of repair but ask someone who is for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>That said, I was able to stop the restarts by following these steps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Press Ctrl-Alt-Del</p>
<p>(2) Choose Task manager</p>
<p>(3) From File | Run, run cmd.exe as an administrative user (check checkbox underneath edit)</p>
<p>(4) Note that text input is impacted by the explorer restarts. You will have to type carefully and likely will need to repeat multiple letters</p>
<p>(5) In the command shell, type taskkill /f /im explorer.exe (same cautions about typing apply)</p>
<p>(6) This should stop the flashing and make the rest of the steps easier to manage</p>
<p>(7) Type cd "\Program Files"</p>
<p>(8) Type dir /s bushell.dll</p>
<p>(9) In my case, the dll was found in "c:\program files\Norton Security Suite\Engine64\22.5.2.15</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If bushell.dll is not found, repeat steps 7 to 9 but use "\Program Files (x86)"</p>
<p>(10) Type cd "c:\program files\Norton Security Suite\Engine64\22.5.2.15" (replace with the name of the directory you found the extension in)</p>
<p>(11) Type ren bushell.dll bushell-crash.dll</p>
<p>(12) Restart the system (you can do that from the command line by typing shutdown /r /f /t 0)</p>

<h3> krayola47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 download on separate storage device</h2>
                    I currently have windows 7 downloaded onto my 1 tb hard-drive, but I recently bought a SSD that is plugged into my computer but not doing anything because I am waiting for the release of windows 10 to have it downloaded on the SSD for faster boot up time.
 Will I be able to download it onto the SSD even though my current version of windows is downloaded to a different hard drive? Also, if it is possible, will the windows 7 download on my current hard drive be eliminated or will it still be on the hard drive?&nbsp;

<p>Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>1. Which edition of windows 7 are you using?<br />
2. Do you get any error codes?<br />
3. Where is the file located? <br />
4. Where did you get the file from?<br />
5. What happens when you try to open?</p>
<p>(A). You may try installing the language pack and then check if you can open the files containing chinese characters.<br />
Here are the steps.<br />
1). Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Update, and then, in the list of results, click Windows Update.
<br />
2). In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.<br />
3). If any updates are found, click Select optional updates.<br />
4). Select the MUI that you want, and then click OK.<br />
5). Click Install updates.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>

    <title>How do I use Windows Installer with Click Once&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mardude  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I use Windows Installer with Click Once&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to use Click Once with the Windows Installer but I can't even find Windows Installer on my system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give me (or point me to a link) on using Windows Installer. &nbsp;It would be great if I can get instructions on using Windows Installer with Click Once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running Windows 7 and I need to install an application with some shared dlls. &nbsp;The application is the only thing using the dlls right now, but future applications will need them also. &nbsp;I currently have the app installed with click once but dll ****
 will return if I use click once to install the second one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately can someone provide me the details on making my own installation program? &nbsp;In case no &nbsp;one knows how to follow Micorsoft's suggestion on combining Windows Installer with Click Once and I can't figure it out it would be better for me to write
 my own installer than have to remember to publish a dozen apps just because of one line of code to one dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Cleanup steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Note: These steps are only necessary if you performed steps A B and C (the trick) before preceding to the Recover / Rollback option&nbsp;as you may still see the remnants of the Windows 10 GUI boot menu, simply click on the Windows 10 option to load your
 earlier / original version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once XP, Vista, Windows 7 or 8.0 / 8.1 has loaded there are two final steps to perform:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Rename the Windows.XXX folder back to Windows.old. Run Disc Cleanup to remove the no longer needed Windows.old folder as this folder can consume more than 21GB of disk space.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d2b59c1-7ace-4409-b646-732124e70016" /></p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b344c170-5efa-4eb1-89fc-75b26efe5f86" /></p>
<p><span>After Disk Cleanup finishes calculating how much disk space you will be able to free up, scroll down the list of ‘Files to delete’ and place a check mark in the ‘Previous Windows installation(s)’ category. You may want to remove some of the check marks
 from other categories if you wish to keep certain files. Now click the ‘OK’ button and when prompted click ‘Delete Files’. The cleanup may take a few minutes to complete.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7db43734-5f2d-4b9c-88d3-9341630caeea" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) Remove the incorrectly labeled GUI boot menu only if you do not have a Dual Boot configuration.</span></p>
<p><span>If you find that you still see the GUI boot menu displayed when you turn on your PC with Windows 10 still in the menu options, don’t let this mislead you as when you click on ‘Windows 10’, whichever version of Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7 or 8.0 /
 8.1) you rolled back to will load.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a) Run msconfig and in the ‘Boot’ tab delete the 2</span><span><sup>nd</sup></span><span> entry (Labeled: Windows Rollback).</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) Place a check mark in the ‘No GUI boot’ box.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdd9f04f-2a9c-4b34-8714-5d0500b35a34" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c) Click the ‘Apply’ button.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The next time you turn on your PC you will load Windows without the GUI menu.</span></p>
<p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently installed the latest update for Windows 10 (after snoozing it for a few days at least) and have completely lost all of my sticky notes as a result. Is there any way to retrieve the data?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Disk Scan and Repair stuck and unable to stop</h2>
                    <p>AVG tuneup told me my disk needed to be scanned,</p>
<p>So I ran the disk scan and repair, it is either stuck or running extremely slowly because it is stuck at 10% and has been for over an hour.</p>
<p>I would like to stop the scan but I don't know how and if I shutdown my PC then turn it back on it goes to the blue screen with restart and advanced options.</p>
<p>I've tried every option in advanced and restarting goes back to the scan BUT it says for a brief moment "Press any key within 1 second to skip"</p>
<p>So I have tried this about 10 times and no matter what button or how quickly I press it, it refuses to skip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there another way to skip the scan or must it just run fully now?</p>

<h2>            Trackpad left&#43;right click opens start menu in any application Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron laptop with a Synaptics touchpad. </p>
<p>In Windows 8 I could click the left and right keys at the same time to open a link in a new tab. This is the same effect as clicking the scroll wheel with a mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to 10, it still works for opening links but it opens the start menu search in any application. I have installed all updates and checked the touchpad software to make sure there are no shortcuts set up for this. I don't have this issue when
 clicking the scroll wheel using a mouse.</p>

    <title>Netbook, 64-bit or 32-bit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> polyprobatos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netbook, 64-bit or 32-bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In about a week and a half, I'm going on an extended vacation, and need a (physically) lightweight piece of hardware that can do two basic things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>browse the internet comfortably on wifi</li><li>connect to Skype/Viber/some other VoiP program reliably</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I figured I'd dust of my old netbooks, and see if I can get one of them to do just that. They're
<strong>Asus X101H EEE</strong> PC's, sporting an <strong>Intel Atom N570 1.66 Ghz</strong> CPU (which is
<strong>64-bit</strong> capable), and <strong>1 Gb of RAM</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I know these are 64-bit capable, and I have managed to succesfully install Windows 10 on one of them. The other one will probably be running on Linux, and be the one I take with me. The 64-bit Windows
 10 running one is still a bit sluggish anno 2016, though notably faster than when it was running the bloatware infested factory installation Windows 7 Starter. As such, I can’t help but wonder whether running the 32-bit version of Windows 10 would actually
 make it faster, because it’s “RAM-capped”. Hence I was wondering whether anyone on this forum might have some advice to share on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance,</p>

</p><p>Thanks, BulldogXX!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That reply is a lot more helpfull than the one I got from MS support, by "a certain Ivan", who hilariously maintained that he wasn't a bot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still face the same dilemma with my Linux laptop though: 64-bit or 32-bit? While it's not normally the case, would perhaps this time "go for Linux, what goes for Windows"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that I can obtain a similar straightforward answer on the Ubuntu forums.</p>

            <p>The only real test would be trying 32 bit Windows 10 and seeing if it ends up being faster in practice [a test that would take quite a bit of your limited time].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the impression that you are aware that <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-specifications?OCID=win10_null_vanity_win10specs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
2GB RAM are required for the 64 bit version</a> whereas a minimum of 1GB is required for the 32 bit version.&nbsp; So your choice is between
</p>
<ul>
<li>getting the benefit of 64 bit processing but&nbsp;limited by the invalid RAM size, or
</li><li>foregoing the 64 bit processing benefit in order to fulfil the minimum RAM requirement.</li></ul>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To add to BulldogXX's good information :<br />
<br />
Windows 10 - Specifications and Requirements<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/windows-10-specifications</a>
<br />
<br />
And remember for a quality experience the systems really need to exceed the minimums.<br />
So you need more memory (than 1GB)&nbsp;even for 32 bit. &nbsp;However if it will run 32 bit then that system should be a little smoother than running 64 bit (if on 1 GB).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>It honestly depends on what you are doing with the device. Years ago, there was a study done by Microsoft that 32 bit versions of Windows get a 9% performance boost running on a 64 bit capable system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you need to take into account is that Skype, which you mentioned is one of the activities you will need the device for; doesn't work so great on Linux operating systems at the moment. It significantly lags behind the Windows version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the latest version of Skype for Linux just gained experimental video call support. and the video calls only work between Skype-for-Linux Alpha clients at this stage. So, that's something to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is another thing you want to take into account is the fact that Linux is of no greater benefit, running 32 or 64 bit under 1 GB of RAM. The latest Ubuntu Linux 16.10 requirements call for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recommended system requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 GHz dual core processor or better</li><li><strong>2 GB system memory</strong></li><li>25 GB of free hard drive space</li><li>Either a DVD drive or a USB port for the installer media</li><li>Internet access is helpful</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to my initial argument, you could get away with Windows 10 32 bit on 1 GB RAM, but it depends on what you plan to do. If you are going only keep a couple tabs open, listen music and light web browsing, occasional word processing, it will work.
 If you are going to participate in a video call, you don't want to have a lot of activities going on since that's going to require a lot of resources. Or you could just stick with Windows 7, which is certainly much lighter and still supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, Linux or Windows 10, its probably best to max the RAM to have a great experience running either platform. Being biased about it is not the way to go.

</p><p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually planned on going with <strong>L</strong>ubuntu, which uses the LXDE desktop and is much lighter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Windows 7: the thing is that if I reset to factory settings, there's a lot of bloatware. Whereas, if I somehow managed to perform a clean install of Windows 7 Starter, I'll probably have driver issues. Both Windows 10 and recent Linux distros seem
 to perform a lot better when it comes to recognising hardware. In summary, and performance advantage gained by sticking with Windows 7 is negated by the amount of additional junk required.</p>

<p>All you need to do is:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Reset to factory with the original image. Forget bloatware. This is only to have access to original drivers and go to step 2.</li><li>Use some tool to backup the original drivers, like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/drvback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DriverBackup!</a>. Save your drivers in some pendrive or any other storage.</li><li>Download the original Windows 7 Starter image or any other Windows 7 32 bits (if you have the license).</li><li>Make a clean installation of Windows 7 Starter using the license that should be in some sticker in the netbook. I have HP mini and, to see the license sticker, you must remove the bottom plastic cover.</li><li>Use&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/drvback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DriverBackup!</a>&nbsp;to restore the original Windows 7 32 bits drivers you backed up previously.</li><li>You are done.</li></ol>
<p>That way, you can have a clean Windows 7 32 bits (Starter or any other version) and the original Windows 7 32 bits drivers provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored my HP Mini with the original image. My HP Mini has intel Atom N455 and 2GB of RAM. I works horrible with Windows 10 64 bits. Forget using W10 64 bits on it. W10 32 bits didn't try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other problem I had is that Intel has no W10 graphic driver for GMA3150. Windows 10 uses WDDM. There's no way to use Inter Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I decided to return to Windows 7 Starter, wich only comes in 32 bits version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, original image has lot of bloatware. Norton antinvirus, HP games, and other crap. However, you just have to unistall it. In a few minutes, you can have your Windows 7 nice and clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install Microsoft Security Essentianls, run the Disk Clean tool and you are ready. My HP Mini performs really well that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most time consuming work was to update Windows 7 because my HP Mini came with Windows 7 "Without" SP1. So, it took almost two days to be fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend to use the Disk Cleanning tool after the full update and with Admin privileges because updates (a really massive update) leaves lot of files that Windows can clean in a secure way. In my case, Windows cleaned almost 10 (yes, ten) GB of files,
 foldes, etc. And it runs perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, I managed to install League of Legends in my netbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tryed Lubuntu 10.16 64 bits. I've installed Steam For Linux and played Counter Strike Condition Zero with no problems. It take some time to launch the game, but once it starts, it runs OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this info and experience could be useful for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong>Update:</strong> Today I was talking with the "systems guy" at my work.<br />
<br />
He told me that it's very possible that the manufacturer of the netbook (in my case, HP) could tweak Windows in some way/s to work better.<br />
<br />
And explained to me that he knows that the company Monsanto use to have its own Windows updates. Fully customized by Microsoft. They had an agree (can't imagine how many $$$).<br />
<br />
So, it is not crazy to speculate that HP (or your netbook's manufacturer) could use tweaked versions of Windows, customized for their products.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, that could be the reason my Win7 Starter by HP works better than any other Win7 / Win10 installation I've made.<br />
<br />
Best regards.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Bug Report&#93; A huge Bug in All versions of MS calculator</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm a Civil Engineer and use MS Calculator as a hand tool since win XP,when I don't use my Casio Classpad.</p>
<p>During my simple calculations,I've found Microsoft programs (Such as MS Exel) has some problems in tringle functions (such as Tangent), and accept this problems because these are not orginally mathematics programs such as Mathlab; But in a simple and global
 program such as MS Calculator -A formal program in all versions of windows- this erros are not acceptable in any reason.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let's try to know this bug :</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.Open MS Calculator in Any version of windows (XP,Vista,Se7en)</p>
<p>2.Calculate 64^(0.5) or Radical 64</p>
<p>3.The answer will be 8</p>
<p>4.Mines8 from answer</p>
<p>5.in logic,the answer will be 0 (Zero)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But what MS Calculator answers,is different!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Total process : (64^(0.5))-8=0</p>
<p>But it shows:&nbsp;&nbsp; (64^(0.5))-8=1.1e-9 !!!! &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can do this process by any nuber such as 4,9,16,...,64,...81,....etc!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            Why Why Why does MS continue to torture its customers. On Windows 8.0 I had to downgrade from pro, install a media centre pack using a special key they were distributing and then upgrade to pro (All VL and MSDN sourced). The following upgrade to 8.1 has
 ripped out WMC again (no suggestion this upgrade would remove my perfectly functioning W8 WMC). You cannot even buy it and add it as the add features button has gone. No download available.
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft have shown how easily the desktop is going to be surrendered on the technology front over the last few years by deciding the ubiquitous Start button that has been there for 20 years could disappear and everyone was now on touch screens. It would
 appear that the same customer contempt is at play for the MSDN community.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Be fascinated to hear any decent explanations for the above - but given your VL subscribers have had WMC on both W7 and W8 - this reply does not cut it.</div>

<p>I agree!</p>

            <p>This is dumb. We have 5 media center PCs connected to cable cards in our conference rooms. So after spending 10s of thousands of dollars for an EA agreement. I now have to go out and buy a normal consumer version.</p>

            While I will never spend a ridiculous amount of money to downgrade to an apple, it is a bit ridiculous that after buying windows 8 pro, I was sent an offer to get wmc for $10 or something. &nbsp;Nowhere did it say that I could not install it. &nbsp;Good thing I

</p><p>I wasted a LOT of time to find this little tidbit out.&nbsp; WHY IS THIS LITTLE FACT not published on more of Microsoft's website that tout Windows 8.1 Pro?&nbsp; Microsoft is just screwing their customers yet again.&nbsp; There's a long list of reasons to why a business

            <p>Really don't think apple is the way to go on anything-especially for large network administration. That being said, MS makes some boneheaded moves, some of them walked back in Windows 8.1. They do try to move the UI forward, but confuse functionality with
 interface sometimes. I especially don't like some of the streaming audio/video problems on windows phone 8.1 since adobe gave up on flash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per Media Center, bad idea to move people away. Understand a lot of people didn't really access the feature and it was tied to other products, but offering it to consumers and not in the volume licensing is just stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about the network people that can do administration through the license and support remote access.&nbsp; Media center should be included, at least as a service pack that can be applied if not available through add features.</p>

            <p>No, because even as a developer myself&nbsp;I still use those features to develop add-ons. Our company had to purchase a completely different version for one single laptop - I mean REALLY?&nbsp;This is lazy and in poor taste for what MSFT is doing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's wrong w/ just having 1 OS, which gives you the ability to add on OS components? 8 Versions of windows -&nbsp;come on MSFT! This is why your stock drops lower in the hole a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;OH Wait, I know why - because you can't "charge" people for it - give me a

<h2>            Surface Music Kit and Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am one of the few with the music cover. It was a fun and nifty device for my surface pro 1. That is until my Surface Pro 1 had its life cut short in a tragic fall. As a loyal customer to Microsoft, I went out and bought the new and improved Surface Pro
 3. Unfortunately my nifty little cover and the music kit dont seem to play nice with the new Surface. I know there is no official support and the chances of getting an update from microsoft are dismal at best. But im hoping someone can help me out on getting
 this thing running? Might there be a fix in the registry or a way to tweak the music kit app to get this working?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Same here... Although I just got mine....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been playing with the app a little and trying to debug it. &nbsp;The blade is detected and functioning properly on the SP3. &nbsp;The software does not detect the hardware identifier on the Surface to either know its a Surface or its complaining because its
 not a pro 1 or pro 2. &nbsp;I have sent tried to email the team that created the software to see if there is anyway around this and I am looking for how it even identifies the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any luck! I will do the same.</p>

            <p>I don't have any joy to add, but just as a contribution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new Surface Pro 3 a couple of weeks ago. Pretty awesome, so far. I'm primarily a .Net/SQL Server developer, and it will definitely replace my clunky old desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this subject, I do music and recording as a sideline, and when I saw the "Surface Music Kit", I thought "great". I'm familiar with Sonar, ProTools etc. but they are so much more than I need for the simple stuff I do. The Music Kit and the simple DAW keyboard
 seemed ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm sure many have done, I couldn't find much about it online. Finally I tried a live person at the MS support center and they pretty much confirmed the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Music Kit was a "project" for the earlier Surface Pros that doesn't seem to have gotten beyond a very limited release. Most of what got out there seemed to be via contests as opposed to a fully supported release that was for sale. The support
 person said, and it seems to be true, that the only way to get it now is via eBay etc. from someone who already has it. It's no longer available from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, and this goes to the thread here, it doesn't appear that it will work on the Surface Pro 3, which of course is my interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as of now I'm certainly not going to invest in the kit even if I can find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will monitor this thread with interest to see if anyone has any luck getting it working on the Pro 3...</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>When you say that the music kit blade is detected and functioning properly, does if mean that I can use it with the app and make the tactile controls work? I'm sorry I'm about to buy one off eBay but I don't understand if you mean it'll work or not. Could
 you kindly explain its limitations? Thank you!</p>

            <p>I also have the surface music kit which i used on my surface pro 2. I now have the surface pro 3 and it sucks that it does not work with it. I was one of the lucky contest winners, I am a music producer beat maker and I was lucky and won it in that contest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a awesome tool. I loved it. worked well. The surface pro 3 can recognize the music kit. the software however is what tells you it can only be used on the older surface's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is no support for it either, however it would be great if it would work with a DAW (digital audio workstation) like FL studio, Studio One Pro 3 etc. If we could find a work around to get it to work with one of those then I would be back in business.</p>

    <title>How do I completely uninstall printer software and drivers if Control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrs. geok  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I completely uninstall printer software and drivers if Control Panel Uninstall a Program utility results in error message&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Brother MFC-9440CN multi-function printer/fax/scanner. When I bought my new 64-bit Windows PC, Brother didn't have any Windows 7 drivers, so I used the original (Windows XP) software to get the device up and running. It did work perfectly - I
 could print but not scan. Plus I wasn't able to set it up as a shared printer so other family members on our home network could print to this device.<br />
<br />
Now that Brother has 64-bit Windows 7 compatible software and drivers available, I'm having trouble installing it. When I try to install it, I get the message that "MFL-Pro Suite is already installed. Do you want to uninstall and then proceed with installation?"
 I click yes and then within the Brother MFL-Pro Suite InstallShield Wizard I get the message "An error occured during the installation. Please restart your PC, ensure all active applications are closed - then reinstall "MFL-Pro Suite."<br />
<br />
I have already tried the Control Panel Uninstall a Program utility and end up with exactly the same error message.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded an uninstall utility from Brother and end up with exactly the same error message.<br />
<br />
I tried looking under regedit, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SOFTWARE &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt; Uninstall for any stray registry entries relating to Brother. There aren't any!<br />
<br />
I need to find a way to completely remove the now non-functioning MFL-Pro Suite software and Brother drivers so that I can install the new Windows 7 compatible version. Can anyone help with this?

            I put the original XP version of the software in the CD drive (after I edited the registry to that Windows 7 could "see" the CD drive) and it installed OK. Then, miracle of miracles, the Brother unistall utility worked and I was able to install the Windws
 7 version of the software and drivers!!!&nbsp;Something must have been messed up with the very original installation...<br />
<br />
So, printing and scanning is now working properly my PC.<br />
<br />
Next challenge...setting the printer up as a shared printer so others (non-Windows 7 Windows PCs) on our home network can print!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support.

                    <p>I've recently been experiencing BSODs every thirty minutes or so - sometimes I'm doing nothing on the PC, others I'm playing a videogame or browsing the internet.</p>

</p><p><span>W</span>hich seems to be related to some sort of "malicious attack"? I have no idea what's going on. I reformated my hard drive, resintsalled Windows 10 from scratch and the problem persists, but the
 error keeps changing - i had errors like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KMODE EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED</p>
<p>SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION WIN32KFULL.SYS</p>
<p>SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION TCPIP.SYS</p>
<p>REGISTRY FILTER DRIVER EXCEPTION</p>
<p>
</p><p>and a few others I didn't write down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed no new hardware or drivers - my memory-dmp file is too big to post, but I can make it available on OneDrive, if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ahead for all and any help you might give me!</p>

<h3> fotisk  say:</h3>
<h2>            a BSOD&#40;&#63;&#41; with no text, an icon, a beeping noise and mouse support - anybody having heard of such a thing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently our secretary informed me that in the past 2-3 months she had a strange occurrence twice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 10 computer was locked and making a beeping sound (she couldn't describe the pattern, but must had been very noisy since she mistook it with an alarm going off)</p>
<p>On the screen there was a blue (not 100% sure about the color) screen, with a big computer icon in the center, no description or text whatsoever, no windows taskbar or anything. Underneath this central icon, a smaller one with a speaker icon that you could
 click on (from what she explained the mouse was working) muting the beeping sound.
</p>
<p>The only escape route was the power button of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the event log, but there was nothing critical or error that I couldn't account for. It has Kaspersky internet security installed and it's up to date; The computer is new (a 4-5 months old Dell optiplex).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not familiar with windows 10, so at first thought that this was a BSOD, but when I googled it, I couldn't find any similar incident. The beeping noise might had been some hardware issue, or some power surge, and maybe the screen was not a windows10 screen,
 but coming from the MoBo itself, but... a mouse pointer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody having any idea what that might?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Beeps on start up usually identify a hardware issue.&nbsp; The pattern of the beeps can tell you what hardware that is.&nbsp; You can investigate the particular pattern on dell to find out what it is.&nbsp; Since it is only 4-5 months old it is still under warranty.

            Thanks for the reply @ZigZag - as a sidenote this was not on startup; Both times the machine was already on (in windows) when this happened. Plus the mouse pointer would work and there was an on-screen button to mute the audio!

            <p>hi @Paola Gar,&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your interest! I've posted a similar question to the Dell community site asking whether it was MoBo related, but as of now there hasn't been any positive reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurred only twice back then and in addition I wasn't present when it happened (it was merely described to me by a user). I've decided to wait for the next incident so that I can also have a first hand experience of the issue before escalating
 it to the DELL tech support (if it's a hardware issue)! </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case I'll make sure to come back and post on both fora regarding my findings (as soon as I have any)</p>
<p><br />

<p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example,
 some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">How does the Snipping tool work on Windows 8? I am using a second screen with my laptop (laptop has a touchscreen--Sony Vaio). When I click on the Snipping tool, whatever I am viewing gets minimized. Am I supposed to only be able
 to snip the desktop? And why can't you have a keyboard shortcut to it, like you did with Windows XP? The keyboard shortcut only calls the Snipping tool if it's already open (but then it minimized the thing I wanted to snip...)</span>

<div><span style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">I got the following feedback from the MS Facebook team:&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(78, 86, 101, 1)"><span>You can create your own Windows shortcut for the snipping tool. Here's how:&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Start Windows 8. Press the keys [Windows] + [Q] to display all Apps.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(78, 86, 101, 1)"><span><br />
<br />
<span>2. Right-click the Snipping Tool icon.</span><br />
<br />
<span>3. Click Open File Location in the lower section.</span><br />
<br />
<span>4. Right click on snipping tool.</span><br />
<br />
<span>5. Select the option properties and click on shortcut.</span><br />
<br />
<span>6. Change the shortcut key accordingly, (press the key Ctrl)&nbsp;</span><br />

<div><span style="color: rgba(78, 86, 101, 1)"><span>When I right-click on the app I see no menu option to change its properties. Since this is my work computer, I am not the administrator of the machine, so that might limit the options I see on

<div><span style="color: rgba(78, 86, 101, 1)"><span><span>The tool itself is not working properly.&nbsp;</span><span>If I click on a new snip on the laptop screen, the screen fades and it works fine with some programs but not all. For example, it does
 not work with Chrome. If what I want to snip is from Chrome and it's on my secondary screen, it does not work because the secondary screen does not fade to indicate that it is "snipable." So, if I want to snip something from Chrome, I have to put the Snipping
 tool on my secondary screen, then Chrome on my laptop screen. Click the snipping tool, and both screens fade to indicate that they are "snipable." To me, that does not seem like a very elegant solution, unless you are forcing people to use Internet Explorer.</span><br />
<br />
<span>By the way, I think the Snipping tool is one of the best hidden secrets of Windows. It's too bad that so few people know about it...</span></span></span></div>

<p>Let's use a better example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 8 run the Store app</p>
<p>The store app runs in full-screen mode - ONLY</p>
<p>Now, how do you use the snipping tool</p>
<p>If you have set a shortcut key to the snipping tool, fine, however, it does not pop up within the Win 8 app</p>
<p>If you call the snipping tool (via shortcut key) while the Win 8 app is on screen, then you do get the snipping tool.&nbsp; BUT you also no longer can see any part of the Win 8 app (Store App, in this case)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be very clear that the Snipping tool is only a desktop tool and will never work with any Win 8 apps.</p>
<p>
