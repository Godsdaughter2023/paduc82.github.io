<h2>            How to enable USB Gamepad &#40;Frontech JIL-1731 USB Vibration gamepad&#41; vibration in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a <strong>Frontech JIL-1731</strong> <strong>USB Vibration gamepad</strong> and it is working fine with windows 8 with the exception of the vibration feature.</p>
<p>The drivers I have are probably old and incompatible and I'm <strong>not able to find any other source for latest drivers</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The manufacturer site seems to have some malicious content</strong></em> due to which my antivirus is not allowing a visit to that site and I don't want to risk it so I'd be grateful if windows could provide me the latest drivers somehow or some
 workaround to enable the vibration feedback feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the drivers and visiting control panel, I'm not getting all the tabs in the properties pop up box that appears after clicking " Set up a gamepad" option and clicking properties. It doesn't show any options to enable vibration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I'd be grateful if anybody could provide a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou</p>

            Hi Wael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you everything possible for keyboard problems.  If you need help with any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If this began within the recent past,  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Why does it say I left a chat after I was added back again&#63;</h2>
                    I was joking around with friends and left the chat for about 2 minutes, however when I was added back in, I couldn't say anything. I can see everything that's going on and such, but at the bottom it says "you have left this group." I can message others
 perfectly fine as well as other group chats. This is also only on my computer. On my phone everything is normal. What can I do to make this glitch stop? (And yes, I restarted my computer)

<h2>            Unable to print from Internet.</h2>
                    <p>My PC runs Windows 10, as does my wife's laptop. Both are wirelessly connected to a Brother HL2135W printer, recognised by both computers as their default printer.
</p>
<p>I am able to print Word files created on my PC with no difficulty, but I cannot print files from e-mails or any printed content from web sites. Such material is printed from the laptop with no trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago I asked this community how to clear my DNS cache. When I followed the instructions given,&nbsp;which involved removing and restoring the DNS&nbsp;within the MS-DOS environment, I was able to remove but NOT restore. Certain of the files, which were associated
 with specific connections to external hardware, remain UNRECOGNISED. I can only assume that herein lies my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to repeat the DNS removal/restoration sequence in some way as to restore it completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was disappointed to receive apparently expert advice within this community only to find that is has damaged my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>

<h2>            BitLocker and Windows Hello&#39;s and PIN problem after KB4468550 update</h2>
                    <div>(In English)</div>
<div>
<p>Today I boot up the computer and was welcomed by a BitLocker restore screen, asking me the 40-digit keys to recover the PC. I guess that there was some major update/change to the computer (since this was not the first time BitLocker suddenly ask me for the
 key), so I entered the key and bypass that blue screen. Then I went into the Windows login screen (Windows Hello), but I couldn't use both Windows Hello or the PIN code (error code 0x8001739f), so I have to use my lengthy Microsoft account password again.
 Then I got into the computer, worked with it a little bit then turned it off.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The thing is, after that, Windows keeps asking me for the Bit Locker key, and the problem with Windows Hello and PIN code persists. And the Action center keep telling me to restart the computer to complete the update from yesterday (2019/1/12 KB4468550
 I guess), even though I already restarted the computer for a few times (and have to enter the long PIN code, every, time). Anyone has an insight onto this problem?</div>

            Thank you for your reply. I have another question, In my system 32 folder is a wininet.dll (2) file and also wininet.dll (3) file and 4 . My question is why are there so many different wininet.dll file with these different numbers and which one should
 I copy ?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I am not sure why you see stuff like that, but on a "normal" system in good health, there should only be one wininet.dll file in the system32 folder.<br />
<br />
I <i>think </i>that if you see something like that wininet.dll(2), wininet.dll(3), etc. that means that you may have&nbsp; been having problems updating your Internet Explorer and if you keep trying and trying or uninstalling and reinstalling IE, it may make a copy
 of the file then. &nbsp; If these updates go smoothly, the installation or update should clean up after itself when it is done.&nbsp; Any of that sound familiar?&nbsp; Maybe somebody else can tell us why that is.&nbsp; But
<i>something </i>happened prior to those files being created.<br />
<br />
Since the wininet.dll file is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after, there should also be a backup copy here (assuming XP is installed on your C drive in the Windows folder):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
To see Windows File Protection work, navigate to c:\windows\system32 and rename the wininet.dll file to something you can remember like wininet.xxx:<br />
<br />
<b>rename &nbsp; wininet.dll &nbsp; wininet.xxx</b><br />
<br />
Then the important wininet.dll file would be "missing" and Windows File protection should automajically quickly and silently replace the "missing" file using the backup copy in the dllcache folder and put an event like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file <b>c:\windows\system32\wininet.dll.</b> This file
<b>was restored</b> to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 8.0.6001.23532.<br />
<br />
That is Windows File Protection in action.&nbsp; Try it!<br />
<br />
If you installed Service Pack 3 from a download, there may also be a copy here (along with lots of other files):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
Then if you ever install a MS Update where later and the update (especially IE updates) include a new version of wininet.dll, you will find old copies of the file (which may be the same) in the MS Update folders that get created when you installed the update.&nbsp;
 This is because when you install an update, the installation makes a copy of the original file(s) when the update is installed.&nbsp; That is so you can uninstall the update later if you need to - uninstalling the MS update will put the original file back.<br />
<br />
So you may find lots of wininet.dll files on your system if you have been applying updates to your Internet Explorer (think in the
<i>inet </i>in win<i>inet </i>to mean Internet and that makes sense).<br />
<br />
If you search your system for wininet.dll, you may find dozens of wininet.dll files in various places on your system.&nbsp; The same is true for lots of XP files - you could have lots of them scattered around on your system.&nbsp; The only ones that really come into
 play when XP is running are the one in system32 and the backup copy in the dllcache folder.&nbsp;
<br />

<p>I can use the Ease of Access button or I can just hit the numlock key to turn it back on. But why does the numlock key turn off?

            <p>Hello MyraThompson, <br />
<br />
I am a little confused by your information. <br />
What operating system are you running on your computer? Is it Windows 7 or it is on a Windows 2003 or 2008 server?<br />
<br />
You might want to look at the information in the following article about EFS and the error code: 0x80074005.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update on your status. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

    <title>Windows 10 Task Manager Priority. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markhendall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Task Manager Priority.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged onto my Laptop at usual, I went to play a game, 'squad' and as usual, I went to task manager and tried to change the priority to high. I was shocked, access denied. It only happened yesterday and today I still cannot do it. It suddenly stopped working.
 I have tried running as an Admin, etc. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theories are the anti cheat in the game is blocking it or Mcafee. Any help?</p>

            Hi Mark.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Usually when MacAfee is mentioned we've found the culprit.  That's why no expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Norton or MacAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled. 
<br />
<br />I would use built-in Defender which always offers best Windows performance with least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Also Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>&nbsp;Hi</p>
<p>I am currently testing Skype for Business PSTN solution with MS as the provider. However I am a bit stuck. I set up a meeting via Outlook, and required&nbsp;the my attendees to stay in the lobby. I asked my tester to dial in. But how do I move the dial in&nbsp;attendee
 from the lobby into the meeting?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Mia,</p>
<p>To do tests and research, I would like to build an environment which is identical to yours. Please share the following details with me:<br />
1.&nbsp;Are you using a pure Cloud Skype for Business Online in Office 365 or has any integration with on-premises servers?<br />
2.&nbsp;The test user’s dial-in conference settings in the Skype for Business Online admin center.<br />
3.&nbsp;What client is the user using to attend the meeting, Skype for Business Web App or a desktop version?<br />
4. What's your Office 365 plan?</p>
<p>And based on my knowledge, you should be able to see the attendees in the Participants tab and right click to manage them. Please check whether you can move them from the lobby into the meeting.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>

            <p>Photo Gallery will do bulk conversion with this approach:</p>
<p>1) Select photos to be converted (usually the entire newly made folder).</p>
<p>2) Click the Edit tab</p>
<p>3) Click Resize (yes,Resize)</p>
<p>4) In Resize dialog select Custom and set the Maximum dimensions well above what your camera delivers (8000 should work)</p>
<p>5) Complete the resize operation - You can specify where the JPGs are to go.</p>
<p>This will make JPG copies of your photos and leave them in full size (resize does not increase size, just leaves them at their max dimension).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use this procedure routinely as it is much faster then other ways of converting to JPGs.</p>

                    <p>Setting up new&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;computer, we got very confused with the logon user accounts.&nbsp;We have an Administrator account and a standard account, which I plan to use for most of my computing. The Administrator account uses my husband's Microsoft account while
 my logon uses my Microsoft account. I ended up with my first and last names on the logon screen. I'd like to do two things: change my logon name to my first name only and change the password on the Administrator account.</p>

    <title>Eventid 134 time service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerbens_1980  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eventid 134 time service</h2>
                    <p>I've tried everything i can think off but every morning (since the summer to winter time transition) i usually get about 3x in a row the eventID 134 in my eventviewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning it cant sync with uh i think its NTP servers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres what i've tried so far :</p>
<p>
</p><p>-W32TM /resync, 9 out of 10 times doesnt work (no time data available) and it will switch to CMOS as the source</p>
<p>In the evenings or later on the day funny enough it will but every morning, same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-ipconfig /dnsflush (probably spelled that wrong here but you know what i mean)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-settings for time and date : autoupdate off / on, usually ends up endlessly trying to sync, in the eventviewer i'll see a message about it discarding the source and that it will look for a DNS similar to it or somesuch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-using the old configuration screen - internettimeservers - manually selecting one and "update", that tends to work.. but only once.</p>
<p>If i try again using the same server and press update, it will timeout again, select one of the other servers and it might sync, but same problem.</p>
<p>Seems rather random for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i type, the following morning, W32TM /query /status, it usually did update the evening before (like before i shut the system down)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example as im typing this :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;W32TM /query /status<br />
Leap Indicator: 0(no warning)<br />
Stratum: 2 (secondary reference - syncd by (S)NTP)<br />
Precision: -23 (119.209ns per tick)<br />
Root Delay: 0.1240422s<br />
Root Dispersion: 8.5910716s<br />
ReferenceId: 0x81060F1C (source IP:&nbsp; 129.6.15.28)<br />
Last Successful Sync Time: 6-11-2017 15:41:38<br />
Source: time-a.nist.gov,0x9<br />
Poll Interval: 12 (4096s)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seems okay, its midday and it did update somewhere since this morning and the timestamp you're seeing.</p>
<p>In the mornings you'll see leap indicator on 3 which means not synced i think. (regardless of server, i choose a random one this morning)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However I got no clue anymore, why its doing this in the mornings when i start it up or how i can more permanently fix this event.</p>
<p>Never had this issue before, or it was longer ago and it was more easily fixed by using the w32tm /resync command, but for some reason the problem comes back every morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, as its driving me nuts.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>I've already changed the server yesterday.</p>
<p>It updates or syncs., just fine throughout the day and if i did a /query /status, you'd see it did sync last night without issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next morning with startup, 3x timeouts again the only difference being its that server (as specified in my opening post) mentioned in the eventID instead of the time.windows.com server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got no clue why every official server seems to time out when the computer starts up.</p>
<p>Now i were to somehow sync right now, and shut the system off, and start it up again.. it will not mention time service errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested that yesterday aswell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also why is there an apparant need to sync every single hour or day even!.. isnt that supposed to be only like once a week? (cause i kept an eye on it when it was syncing / updating during the day, it was like every hour that i saw a new timestamp about
 it succesfully syncing and whatnot)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try adding a custom server like pool.ntp.org and see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit : i've glanced over the other thread you mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice in my regeditor it mentions under specialpollinterval 32786</p>
<p>Specialpolltimeremaining however is listed as time.windows.com, 7d743dd</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the feeling something aint quite right with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Small edit : i noticed if i look at the date/time settings - internettimeservers it will say it synced at 8:00, but if i use query status in prompt it mentions it was succesfull last night at 20:13, and leap indicator will be on 3 now. (instead of 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now changed it to nl.pool.ntp.org and that synced immediatly without issues.</p>
<p>But in my previous edit i think the interval is wrong? Shouldnt it be no less then something like 86400 or somesuch? (as the other thread mentioned)</p>
<p>I calculated it, not too hard ofcourse lol, but it wants to sync every 9 hours..? that seems a bit much..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait for a reply to be sure, sorry for the lengthy post, i just want to be thorough.</p>

<p>Okay i sorta jumped the gun here and did a stop/start of the time service incl. a unregister and register command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each command was succesful, however i notice the specialpollinterval remains at 32786 and specialpolltimeremaining is now blank. (im going to guess thats probably normal after a un- and register thing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after it couldnt sync to the nl.pool.ntp.org server i had set.</p>
<p>However it did to the time.windows.com server.. and right after that it could again to the pool server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is confusing as all hell lol, i dont know why it will sync at one moment but not the other, and will usually sync if i try a new server and back again.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a thought, whether this would apply to your situation and/or device I do not know, however, this reminded me that, in times past, a faulty, discharged (or mostly discharged) CMOS battery on the motherboard can (has been known to) cause this very type
 of problem.</p>
<p>

<p>I dont think thats it, i mean when there are too many timeouts it will automaticly switch to CMOS.</p>
<p>I'd think that wouldnt be possible if it were faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i look carefully in the system information logs, after the initial timeouts it will report it succesfully receives time from whatever server i've set.</p>
<p>So its just during the startup i get those 3 timeout messages, and never during the rest of the day as its syncing normally. (though too often i think)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus i see alot of information logs (not listed as errors or somesuch) eventID 154, VMICtimeprovider "t<span>he time provider 'VMICTimeProvider' has indicated that the current hardware and operating environment is not supported and has stopped.
 This behavior is expected for VMICTimeProvider on non-HyperV-guest environments. This may be the expected behavior for the current provider in the current operating environment as well."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I could be wrong but as its not listed as an error, i think its mosly intended for servers, im just on a regular windows 10 home edition.</span></p>
<p><span>Also it syncing time at the moment, so i dont entirely see why i see alot of those messages, however i do remember seeing them well before this problem with syncing time ever occured.</span></p>
<p><span>(again i only started having this issue since summer-winter time and never before in all these years i've been running windows 10, last time i had this issue was windows 7 i think)</span></p>

<p>Ok,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point was that when the PC is shutdown the keep alive memory function that the CMOS battery provides will be lost and the time sync from the last session is then lost as well causing an immediate resync upon startup or a time that is slightly off of
 the correct time until a resync is accomplished. Also, the various time servers available are somewhat notorious for being unreliable from time to time (no pun intended). The other symptom, although less noticeable if applicable at all, would be that any BIOS
 settings that had been made to other than default would be reverted to the default BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is newish there is a chance that it does not incorporate a CMOS battery type keep alive memory function, perhaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, it was a thought as to a possibility based on past experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>

<p>Ok,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point was that when the PC is shutdown the keep alive memory function that the CMOS battery provides will be lost and the time sync from the last session is then lost as well causing an immediate resync upon startup or a time that is slightly off of
 the correct time until a resync is accomplished. Also, the various time servers available are somewhat notorious for being unreliable from time to time (no pun intended). The other symptom, although less noticeable if applicable at all, would be that any BIOS
 settings that had been made to other than default would be reverted to the default BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is newish there is a chance that it does not incorporate a CMOS battery type keep alive memory function, perhaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, it was a thought as to a possibility based on past experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>

</p><p>Its not all that new of a computer, coming this febr. it will be about 3 years old. (no bios settings have been altered recently)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But im thinking as it wants to sync every 9 hours, i obviously im not going to make it in time when i shut it down in the evenings, go to bed etc., and usually it at best, it gets turned back on about 10-12 hours later.</p>
<p>As the system wanted to update it much sooner, it wasnt able to as system was shut off ofcourse, it wants to immediately resync again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get what im saying as english isnt my first language. xD but i feel its similar to what you were describing but different reasoning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what im trying to say is, it wants to update to fast or too soon, a deadline i never make so i get issues in the morning. (im on wifi which isnt immediately ready the very instant i turn it on ofcourse)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also time never actually changes, its not all of a sudden running behind or incorrectly in any way.</p>
<p>(infact according to time.is its running perfectly on time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All i can think of right now is the interval is too quick, but thats guesswork as i dont know what the standard settings were before all this started. (no way to compare)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit : after a reboot it now says it will sync on fixed time uh.. settings or intervals. (when i check it under date/time - internettimeservers and settings)</p>
<p>Thats new at least, but the specialpollinterval is still set on 32786, it just doesnt seem right for some reason.</p>

<p>If you have no other symptoms other than what you are seeing by manually looking in the event viewer I would say that you actually don't have a real problem at all and what you are seeing there are just normal for the beast. It is very common to see random
 errors or warnings in the event viewer on all devices. Are you getting any pop-up error notifications on the desktop as well? If not then don't stress-out on what you are seeing when looking in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the below snapshot is of the event viewer summery of a 3 day old upgrade type installation of Windows 10 v.1709 (the Fall Creators Update) (upgraded to from v.1703) that performs and functions very quite well (it's also quite fast, perhaps even
 faster than v.1703).</p>

<p>Thats pretty much my eventviewer aswell and no there no popups.</p>
<p>But i tend to keep an eye on the eventviewer from time to time and unusual issues i just notice and want to learn how to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the register commands and whatnot helped in this case, but ill guess i see it in the morning lol.</p>
<p>Least the "updating every single hour" thing seems to have stopped and the text is replaced with what i mentioned, i think thats good news at least.</p>

<p>Well, OK then, very good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, becoming familiar with the Event Viewer can become very informative and by extension instructive toward the better understanding of the workings of the OS and device at hand (forever a work in progress).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trick is for one to not allow oneself to become alarmed unnecessarily, or even worse, negatively obsessed, by the normal random error and warning events reporting that will be accumulated during the course of any given normal session, that are, in essence,
 inconsequential to the overall function of the devise and/or the performance of the OS as a whole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, the Event Viewer is a good starting point for those that wish to further investigate the idiosyncrasies thereof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards and Good Luck going forward!</p>

            Hello Alexander<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to

<br />
<br />5. Click on Nextand follow the instructions.
<br />
<br />If the issues still persist, refer to the below methods.
<br />
<br />Method 2: I would suggest you to try to check for the status of the drive in the device manager.
<br />1. Press Windows Key + R Key.
<br />2. Then type “devmgmt.msc” without the quotes and hit on Enter Key.
<br />3. Expand Disk Drive. If you are able to find the driver for the external drive.
