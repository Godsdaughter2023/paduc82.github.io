    <title>Can no longer change brightness in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theelementalofdestruction  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can no longer change brightness in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After an update about a month or two ago I can no longer change my brightness on my laptop in Windows 10. While in the bios or another operating system, the brightness control works perfectly,&nbsp; but not in Windows 10. When booting my laptop, the brightness
 will be locked in windows 10, at a seemingly random brightness level. I haven't been able to figure out what determines the level it gets locked at, but it seems to have something to do with changing it while the computer is still booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, a couple weeks ago, the bar in display settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8ebf04f-e032-46a0-a57a-e1c12eeb489a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8ebf04f-e032-46a0-a57a-e1c12eeb489a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>has completely disappeared:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f965272f-038d-40b4-b694-1820e3ab1f3a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f965272f-038d-40b4-b694-1820e3ab1f3a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to update my drivers and waited a couple months to see if a new windows update would correct the issue, but the issue has only gotten worse. It seems like windows no longer properly sees this computer as a laptop, even though everything was working
 fine with this laptop. Just a note, I has not myself made any major chages like installing a new program, device, etc. for at least a couple of weeks before that happened. Also, the fact that Windows 10 just does updates whenever it feels like it is a major
 pain in the rear. Especially when it restarts itself without asking. Anyways, does anyone know why this is happening and a way to fix it? This computer came with windows 10 natively.</p>

            Looks like the display driver is misbehaving. First of all check,
<br />related services to graphics like AMD/ Intel and Desktop Window Session manager services are automatic and running.

 you need.&nbsp;

            For Dell, you can easily find drivers via Service Tag unlike other OEMs like HP where there are large variants of a particular model.
<br />Please follow the steps below to clean reinstall video drivers:
<br />1. Boot to Safe mode using any option posted below:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are using XP home edition, the in-built administrator account probably does not have a password set. You can boot to safe mode where this account will be selectable at logon. Use it to logon and change the password of your normal logon.</p>
<p>To boot in safe mode, keep hitting F8 twice a second after turning on the PC until you get the boot menu where safe mode is selectable by the up/down arrow keys, then hit enter.</p>
<p>If you are using XP professional, try logging on using the built-in administrator account. You do not need to do this in safe mode (though you could if you want). If your normal logon screen is a user icon display hit ctrl-alt-del twice to get to a text
 input logon. Enter Administrator as the user name and try a blank password.</p>

<p>I had to post this cause it has to be known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bought my first copy and tried to install it, it gets 22% of the way and says it can't read the disc and says to clean it.&nbsp; Tried it about 10 times and took it back and exchanged for another copy.&nbsp; Brought it home and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>Went ahead and just played it off the disc and these are the problems I'm having..</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Put in DLC codes, got my avatar Lion hat but not the DLC wardrobe</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Obvious game freezes everywhere</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Stuck doing the escort quest and it's not possible to heal the two being escorted (Thus not getting the achievement)&nbsp; /&nbsp; They die with full health randomly&nbsp; /&nbsp; Finally got to the troll and beat it, and while it's dying falling back into the earth, the
 mission failed screen pops up saying they've died.. but with full health or three quarter health.</p>
<p>I love this game but want to play more FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! ~Chris Farley&nbsp; voice~</p>

<p>I tried the clear cache 3 times, let opening screen sit 5 min before starting game. Also tried many other things suggested by XBox phone support. Nothing helps.</p>
<p>I have had the following problems. </p>
<p>1. A button often won't respond, especially in conversations and tutorials.</p>
<p>2. B button sometimes won't respond.</p>
<p>3. Game freezes and have to shut down console to restart.</p>
<p>4. Items on D pad won't access when needed in battle.</p>
<p>5. Can't access journal during battle to get food or potion when needed. Health goes down and I die while clicking repeatedly on a potion if it is showing on D pad.</p>
<p>6. Escort quest is majorly bugged. Traders die with full health. Then game puts me back to last checkpoint.</p>
<p>7. Save system dies not work as promised. It will only save from last checkpoint ir last auto save. We were promised we could save whenever we want.</p>
<p>These issues are what I've found after a few hours of trying to play. Thus game us so bugged it is impossible to play....A waste of money!</p>

<p>I rented this over the weekend and yes it does indeed have many problems. &nbsp;It froze on me at least 5 times in the few hours that I played the game. Also a bit frustrating in combat when it auto-locks onto friendlies instead of enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to return
 the rental.</p>

<p>I got this, was enjoying it and had no problems at all. Then I turn it on one day and it needs an update, download the update and since then every 20 mins or so it freezes. Haven't played it since.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ramzi.H – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
As Jeeped already said in his first post, it is often the End User which<br />
opens the door to the hacker/cracker. I made an illustration below <br />
to make this clear to you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwykdgq.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1p9wWdZMSGZUVB8QCyQ4nwN-9yRsiT7EUsK2_ahBYhzK2t2mzrmoxUKQUCGyOgpvL4R3p3pBemFA8WU9zI_Wy02o4H6m_QgJ9u%2fInfectedHackedControlled2011_010101.png%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
<br />
First off, it’s very hard for a hacker to hack your PC without having some<br />
information. If you have a Wireless Network at home, and the wireless<br />
is open to the public, then any hacker is able to hack your system, and<br />
take control over it. If your wireless is encrypted with WEP then you are<br />
safe to some point, however, a hacker/cracker with experience can crack<br />
your password, and then gain access to your wireless network without <br />
asking you for permission. <br />
<br />
<strong>*Please note:</strong> Even the inexperienced hacker with basic hack knowledge<br />
can crack your wireless network. <br />
<br />
The inexperienced hackers mostly use hacking tools and password<br />
crack tools built by the most experienced hackers, with programming<br />
knowledge and software development knowledge, hackers that make<br />
virus code, knows also how to find vulnerability in systems, and using<br />
that information, they study the behavior of this vulnerability and then<br />
they write some code which interacts with this vulnerability and takes<br />
advantage of it. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
Hackers are often divided into categories, because there are good<br />
hackers that sometimes help companies improve their security in<br />
their PCs and corporate networks, and then there are those known<br />
to be “bad guys” which often hack and spy or hack and destroy or<br />
hack and steal money from regular people’s bank accounts etc. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>No Client Operating System (OS) is perfect, UNIX® had a vulnerability<br />
which allowed people with programming and hacking/cracking knowledge<br />
to take advantage of this, and hack NASA computers. <br />
<br />
<strong>How to protect yourself then?</strong><br />
<br />
</span><em><span>I would like to give you some suggestions and teach for<br />
good PC protection.</span></em><span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Tools:</span></span></strong><br />
DBan – Use this tool to wipe out the disk completely. It will Zero the <br />
magnets on the physical disk. <br />
<br />
<strong>DBan:</strong> </span><span><a href="http://www.dban.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.dban.org/</span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
For good AV, I suggest and recommend Kaspersky® Internet Security 2010. <br />
For a more light-weight and for a simpler AV I recommend Microsoft®<br />
Security Essentials (MSE). <br />
<br />
<strong>Kaspersky:</strong> </span><span><a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/kaspersky_internet_security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.kaspersky.com/kaspersky_internet_security</span></span></a></span><span><br />

<br />
Keep the Firewalls turned on. <br />
Keep Windows® up-to-date. <br />
Keep third-party software up-to-date, a good online service <br />
to keep them updated is Secunia®. <br />
<br />
<strong>Secunia:</strong> </span><span><a href="http://secunia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://secunia.com/</span></span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
User restricted users on the PC. Please add a password to your account <br />
and (encrypt) you data. <br />
<br />
I also recommend that you constantly (or very often) backup your PC <br />
using Acronis® True Image Home 2010. <br />
<br />
<strong>Acronis:</strong> </span><span><a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/</span></span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Something else:</span></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></strong>Keep up the knowledge. <br />
</span><span>Be careful on Internet.<br />
</span><span><br />
<strong>If you have Wireless Network, encrypt using WPA2, <br />
and config the DMZ on the router for the hardware<br />
firewall, and use MAC-address filter: See this forum post discussion:<br />

<p>Hi Jeremy</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Sorry but forum policies do not allow information for recovering passwords. This is required due to the anonymous nature of these forums.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Your best solution is to take the computer to a local computer repair shop and have them recover the password for you. This usually takes a few minutes and the charge is minimal.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Ok firstly I ran the driver verifier on Friday this cause an endless boot loop not allowing me to access windows, it was constantly blue screening with the error: DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ended up with me having to re-install windows yesterday, after all of this I do not trust this application. Plus I do not feel like having to re-install all of my applications and windows again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the memtest and get back to you with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And at this time I think that on startup the BIOS posted that the overclock failed. I will flush the BIOS and/or get rid of the settings and restore them to default.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge - the page cannot be displayed</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continually get the error message for Microsoft Edge, "The Page Cannot Be Displayed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on the same desktop, I never, ever, ever get that error message with FireFox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I need to do another nebulous "check with your ISP", throwing darts around for hours upon hours, crossing my fingers and grabbing my hind end while praying to the gods of software for a possible resolution?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What 3rd party is to be blamed this time?&nbsp; (firewall, antivirus, although all my stuff is Microsoft, silly me)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is it the fault of the Man-in-the Moon?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>What did<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I</span> do wrong this time?</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Should I abandon Edge, begin using FireFox and install Google Chrome?&nbsp; They don't seem to have problems cause by 3rd parties like Microsoft
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always </span></strong>does.&nbsp; I wonder why that is?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, I do know that the Microsoft code for&nbsp;Edge&nbsp;that was released to us customers is 100% flawless.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft is not to be faulted here, clearly the fault is elsewhere.&nbsp; I just need some help trying to reduce the hours and hours and hours of
 trouble shooting that I'll have to do to find the non-Microsoft culprit that won't allow my desktop to display a webpage using Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; At the same time I have to figure out why Firefox works beautifully well.&nbsp; (And, I just love fixing software problems.&nbsp;
 Who the hell actually wants to use their software?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thoughts on the culprit here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Okay...first things first. Since Windows 10 also comes with Internet Explorer try using that instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll find it in your apps under "W" for Windows Accessories:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Click photo to enlarge if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF it works (and it should) then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open default apps, click Microsoft Edge and change it to Internet Explorer</p>

<p>I don't know why I would bother with IE when I can just click on my firefox icon and pop that open.&nbsp; Which it usually is anyway because of constant issues with Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for resolution as to why this keeps happening. It's happening as I type and have had to resort to using Firefox.&nbsp; I've got edge open with 3 tabs. One is yahoo news (that's fine) and one is my local news station (that's fine) and my email but
 when I click on an email to open it I get, "Your message can not be displayed right now. Please check your internet connection or try again later. I'm also able to access my email via firefox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone answer as to why this is constantly happening and how to fix the issue?</p>
<p>

    <title>Was FORCED to upgrade Skype for Android despite my device NOT meeting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Was FORCED to upgrade Skype for Android despite my device NOT meeting the system requirements</h2>
                    <p>Inbelievable frustration with Skype for Android. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Two Android Tablets in the family, both running Android v4.4.4 (Kitkat), previously able to run Skype.&nbsp;We were&nbsp;able to dodge previous Skype upgrades (or, rather, reverse previous forced Skype upgrades when those&nbsp;versions&nbsp;would not run properly on our tablets).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, recently, we were FORCED to accept a Skype so-called "upgrade" - since if we did not accept it, Skype would just log out. Ridiculous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having allowed the "upgrade", there are problems. Here are the issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I looked at the System Requirements <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=system+requirments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
(Android System Requirements)</a>, it says you must have OS v6.0 or 7.0 for Skype to run properly!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give me a break! Why force an upgrade on devices that don't have the systems to run it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) A major problem is the missing Skype status notification on the Notification bar (top Left). Now there is nothing there to say that Skype is running or that Skype is Online etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really important problem. Please fix it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust me, all of the "allow notifications" settings are turned on wherever they can be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>1) It is very interesting that the very day I posted this, the System requirements were changed. I suppose that's a good thing, however I'm still very annoyed that Skype can ever FORCE an upgrade. &nbsp;But that is a fight for another day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It would appear from your response that you do not understand the issue with the new Skype version. I will include some screenshots from my tablet to make it perfectly clear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first shot is from the version of Skype I was using <em>prior </em>to having this 'upgrade' forced on me. It properly shows the "Skype Online" symbol in the top left Notification Bar:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98cd10c1-f75f-4d0f-8050-42d3e5bb2ede" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98cd10c1-f75f-4d0f-8050-42d3e5bb2ede" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>HOWEVER, after this 'upgrade', you can see that Skype is running BUT there is no icon appearing in the Notification Bar to show that Skype is running and that I am online (or offline, or whatever the situation is):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc04e45e-55d9-4ea6-8a27-35c9446e3f11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc04e45e-55d9-4ea6-8a27-35c9446e3f11" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking you to fix this. There needs to be a Skype status in the Notification bar so we can again, at a glance, know the status of our connection (whether Skype is running and online etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this has helped you understand what I am saying. You will clearly see that this is quite a different issue than how one goes about managing/changing one's status in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Some users with Device Guard enabled in Windows 10 1809 are reporting Code 39 errors on some drivers such as camera drivers.
<br />
<br />If you have Device Guard enabled you may have to disable core isolation:

            Ah alright so you've already gone to device manager and attempted to get the drivers/troubleshoot through there?
<br />
<br />Do you mind me asking what kind of webcam it is?

 I want to mention that before this error appeared, I had another one(something like MSVCP110.DLL is either not compatible and blah blah blah...ending in error code 0xc000012f) , and my little brain thought it was a good idea to delete the msvcp110.dll and
 download it again...obviously it wasn't. </span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>So how can I fix this? If you need further details (to bo more specific if you need me to explain something again since I'm awful at this.</span></p>

            I purchased Windows 7 Professional because the networking on Home premium is so awful.  Professional was just as bad.  I got a refund, now 4 months later my computer is telling me that I have an unlicensed copy of windows 7 Build 7601.  So now do I have to reload everything on my computer because windows 7 is such a piece of ****?  This is truly mind boggling. Is Microsoft trying to force everyone to buy Mac by creating products that are so awful?

            If you still have professional installed after getting a refund that is likely the reason your windows is showing as not genuine. The refund will cause the pro product key to be blocked. You will have to reinstall your original windows.

            At this point it's almost worth the $150 to re-buy that garbage "upgrade".&nbsp; So now because Microsoft makes abysmal software I again have to spend hours and hours of my time to fix it?&nbsp; It is absolutely mind boggling how bad this company is.&nbsp; If I could
 run Autodesk on Linux I would NEVER NEVER NEVER use another Microsoft product. It is truly the most pathetically engineered garbage out there.<br />

<h2>            Problems aplenty&#59; including the last attempt disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I thought that I may have reached some preset limit of words because suddenly I could not type and the cursor sat in the last place it landed and something happened and everything disappeared. This time I'm copying the URL address and every word in the subject
 and body of this post. It seems very possible that whatever happened the last time will happen again and I have yet to state what the problem(s) are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with this: this " new to me, store purchased laptop " was sold to me as a " close out " but when I tried to register it HP said that the warranty had expired because " the warrenty starts ' in the store ' from the moment that it is connected to the
 internet." To make matters worse I discovered that someone named Darrin DeYoung was listed as a user along with " retail administer " With lots of searching and calling it seems that Darrin DeYoung is a default user along with Retail Administrator so a slick
 video demo playes like a screen saver after there is no use for a period of time. Turns out that these two user should be removed before selling to the public but they weren't removed and the instructions for removing these users is confusing at best since
 there are numerous sites informing me how to remove them. Several sites seem to suggest that doing this will wipe the hard drive and reinstall windows 10. At this point in time I have created a few files that I would like to keep and I know that I can transfer
 them to an external device But I would think that either HP or MS would want to do the right thing and walk me through this process rather than posting in a forum in hopes that someone will give me THE right answer instead of a version that I've already read
 about on the net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are numerous features turned off and finding a post here to tell me exaxtly how to turn on " settings and more " in Edge and how to turn on the Favorites or Bookmarks ( whatever it is called ) would help some while I'm waiting for the right answer(s).
 Try doing a search for that answer. What would you call it? I tried what I thought was the obvious: " turn on settings and more in Edge Broswer " check it out to see what that brings up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created an MS account using outllook so I could post here and use OneDrive. But the joke continues and the skit can be used on South Park or Monty Pyton as it is so hard to believe it can only be used in a comedy skow for others to relate to the insanity
 of getting a straight answer of the giants of the industry. Outlook wants me to name the last 4 emails sent, the subject in each and the name of the users. Ironically I always test my emails by sending to myself in an older email account. The subject is often
 simple and the same. So when I got a reply to my recovery account saying there is not enough information to verify that it is me I decided to post here in hopes that an MS employee could address these disasters/cruel jokes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more major nightmare is the " I'm not a robot " words. I'm losing my eye-sight so the longer I stare at these letters the harder it is to identify what they are. The audio feature is also a mystery. All of this leads back to the practice of " no customer
 service " except a robotic " virtual chat tech " or this forum. I'd like to hear an defense of using this system for helping your customers. So for instance, suppose you had to answer the questions before congress. What would you say to a question like: "
 How do you provide help for the handicap?" Would love to know the answer to that?</p>

            Hi, Sonny1so2,
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear about your experience. I never faced such as an HP product owner. 
<br />
<br />Let me start with HP's description of a refurbished product.
<br />
<br />"Refurbished HP products are clean, fully functional models that have been returned for a variety of reasons. A refurbished model could be a system that was returned because customer changed their mind, newer model took its place, a cancelled order, opened box, cosmetic blemish, or simply because the packaging was marred."
<br /><a href="http://www.hp.com/sbso/buspurchase_refurbished.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hp.com/sbso/buspurchase_refurbished....</a>
<br />
<br />These refurbished products actually come with a standard 1 year limited warranty. The warranty will cover hardware. HP also makes Care Packages available for those wishing to extend the warranty.
<br />
<br />The seller of the product should make good his refurbished product by reimbursing or replacing the product which should have been wiped clean prior to the sale regardless of it being a "closeout". I'd report them to the Better Business Bureau. By doing so, you may just get that New computer with warranty intact.
<br />
<br />Before wiping the Drive clean and starting fresh, upload your files to your OneDrive account. 
<br />
<br />Did you contact Microsoft Account Support about your Email issue? This is the link to email them and they will contact you back.

<br />
<br />Have you tried to reset password or recover the account?

<br />
<br />Exactly which "turned off " features are you referring to?
<br />If you look in the upper right corner of Edge browser, you will see 3 dots. Click on those dots &gt; Scroll down to Settings. You'll see a fly out menu appear.

<p>Smittychat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks so much for replying and all of the into. I'm going to copy and past just about every reply and question that you asked and maybe somehow someway this will help someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's interesting that you mentioned HP's definition of a " refurbished " computer because when I reached HP ( surprisingly they answered quickly but I could tell it was a foreign country ) I avoided using the " refurbished " word for 2 main reasons 1 it
 wasn't sold to me as such. and 2 I was told that after serving as a demo and based on the year of manufacting it did not seem to fit MY understanding of " refurbished ", moreover the operative word that keeps poping up in you're discription is " returned ".
 I was told that this laptop never left WalMarts and it was in the back room waiting for this one day that they bring out ALL "Demos" from the back and usually sell them all in one day. This laptop was about an 800.00 dollar computer offered to me for 285.
 It was clean and it seemed well worth the price considering hardware and software preloaded. When I saw Darrin DeYound I immediately thought it was a returned computer and they once again told me that all returned computers no matter the reason are sent to
 a 3rd party clearing house. I also discovered that Darrin Deyoung IS the goto user name created by MS I'm told and as mentioned this professional video commercial runs after a few minutes sitting idol. The screen did not go to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP was absolute about NO WARRANTY. That said it was ironic that they gave me the build date and the activation date but the end date for the warranty was the exact day that I purchased the PC and it was sitting in the back room for a couple of months. I
 did buy and extended Warranty from Assurian who didn't want to do the fix over the phone but instead wanted me to send it in. I didn't want to do that since I could use the computer with my own name and if I found the right person who knew how to remove the
 two preloaded users that would be my preferrance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact Walmart told me that they charged me too much money for this " Clearence " model and they gave me about $125.00 back meaning that I paid about $175.00 for it. Then they offered to take it back and give me the $175-00 back plus a $50.00 gift card.
 By then I had it set up and working in my name but wanted to remove the other two users. They had nothing anywhere near comprable to this for anything close in price. So I've found a shop that claims they can remove the 2 users for $40.00 But I still think
 that someone at MS should be able to walk me through deleting them or I'll wait until I find someone I trust who can do what I want them to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have you tried to reset password or recover the account?&nbsp;</span><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17875/...</a><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;YES I created my own and Darrin doesn't
 have a PW and the retail admin has a standard generic PW that is listed numerous places on the net.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before wiping the Drive clean and starting fresh, upload your files to your OneDrive account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The email I created on outlook is the one I wanted to use for one drive but that recovery process is off the wall. I suppose I can use an old outook email account that I have. I THINK that will work with one drive?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Exactly which "turned off " features are you referring to?&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>If you look in the upper right corner of Edge browser, you will see 3 dots. Click on those dots &gt; Scroll down to Settings. You'll see a fly out menu appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm guessing that as a DEMO the functions in EDGE are disabled. I can not bookmark any pages and the "SETTINGS " at the bottom of the 3 dots on the right hand side of the menu bar is GRAYED out meaning that I can not
 turn on the Bookmakrs. I can not right click answer on the page to access funtions that way.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've tried to search in the forum for answers and can not find anything relative.</span></p>
<p><span>I downloaded another broswer so I can bookmark pages and have other functionality that seems turned off in EDGE.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Lastly about the handicap issue; as mentioned the strange letters that are required to " prove that I am not a robot or a spammer " are mostly impossible to know with my eye's or my ears. And when I get the one that
 says: pick the pictures with a BUS or STREET SIGNS with-in a minute or two I can't see anything so I always get them wrong.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope that explained better what I'm dealing with.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One more thing: I had a few months left on a MacAfee subscription. It ran out this week and I'm being bugged to renew. I just wanted to use defender for now but I'm told that I do not have permission to change the settings.
 My account is ADMIN as is Retail ADMIN. It doesn't seem that either one works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again,</span></p>

            Why I use the word "refurbish" is due to the system should have been wipe clean prior to being sold.
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select PowerShell (Admin)
<br />Type Net User into the window &gt; Press Enter
<br />This will show Accounts on the system
<br />Note the accounts
<br />Type net user (username) /delete &gt; Press Enter
<br />Note: username should be the name of the account you wish to delete.
<br />
<br />You should see a message saying the command was successful in both cases.
<br />
<br />Try to reregister Edge browser while still in the PowerShell window
<br />Copy/Paste the following command into the Window &gt; Press Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}
<br />
<br />When finished, reboot the computer.
<br />Verify the accounts are gone by launching PowerShell (Admin) and type net user into the window then press Enter
<br />
<br />Check Edge browser to determine all is functioning as it should.
<br />
<br />When you view "captcha" items, Press Ctrl key and use your mouse wheel to zoom in by pressing the middle mouse button and scrolling it forward or backwords.

                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I have two Windows 7 computers running on a simple local network. One is connected to the router via ethernet, the other is connected to the
 router via a wireless access point. The network is functional for both computers in terms of connection to broadband. Having satisfactorily set up a homegroup on either of them, when I try to add the other one to the homegroup it tells me that there is no
 homegroup existing on the network. At one time I did have a homegroup but it has obviously disappeared although I have not made any major changes to the computers in the meantime. I have tried disconnecting the firewalls and virus software, and checked that
 the Peer Networking Grouping and HomeGroup Provider services are running. I have also run the troubleshooter many times. How do I proceed?</font></font></font></p>

<p>The Mail app in Windows 10 has no way of storing messages like Windows Live Mail does. What you can do is upload your messages using an IMAP account, e.g. at Outlook.com, Gmail or Yahoo and then add that same account in Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're normally signed in in Windows Live Mail, all you have to do to is to add the same account as you sign in with to the People app in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not normally signed in in Windows Live Mail, then you will have to export your contacts to CSV, then sign in with a Microsoft Account at people.live.com and import them there. Add this same account to People in Windows 10 to synchronize the contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could just install Windows Live Mail and carry on using it. This would take some preparation, so please post back if you'd like to explore this possibility. In your reply, give the version of the program you were using. To find it, in
 Windows Live Mail press Alt-F B.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the detailed reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue is that I was using Windows live mail in the old PC I used. Now I have moved to another place and in the new PC I am using Windows 10 mail. I will be signing in Windows 10 mail henceforth. However, I would like to get access to the earlier mails
 in the Windows live mail directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to try out the last option you mentioned&nbsp; - install windows live mail to get access to the earlier mails, but I would prefer to use Windows 10 mail to get access current mails (if possible I would like to get mails in both clients. Otherwise,
 I may not sign in windows live mail, which will still give access to my earlier mails).</p>
<p>

    <title>After Factory Reset, stuck in a Loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After Factory Reset, stuck in a Loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>My computer was encountering some issues so I decided to factory reset it, to make sure that I could properly install everything I needed to help it run optimally. I stuck in my USB with Windows 10 Home on it and I effectively restored the computer to its
 factory settings. Now, though, whenever I try to set up my PC I am in an endless loop of choosing my country, language, timezone and another slide where I can personalize my computer by using custom or express settings. I do not have access to my computer
 at all, the only things I have access to are BIOS and these two pages. Whenever I click “next” after choosing my personalizations, my computer restarts and goes back to the same page. Any help? I have no idea how to access my USB or disc from here. Whenever
 I put the USB back into my computer, there is no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi llama482 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

<h2>            Skype</h2>
                    I've been using Skype for more than 10 years but since Microsoft took it over, I can't do any of the things I used to do.&nbsp; There is nothing intuitive about it.&nbsp; It needs a user manual!!&nbsp; How do I remove/delete contacts from my contact list?&nbsp;
