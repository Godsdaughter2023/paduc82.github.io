<p>So, I haven't actually found this trick on the internet yet but it's by far the easiest way to get trittons to work with the xbox one. Obviously the issue is that the puck connector that plugs into the 360 does not fit into the controller adapter's 2.5mm
 to 3.5mm adapter that it comes with. Well, all I did was rip that little adapter apart. Inside the box of your stereo headset adapter is that little extension cable, the female end has too much plastic around it to plug into the puck connector. I used a small
 knife to cut off enough of the plastic that it could fit into the puck, however, i also had to use a pair of pliers to rip some of the plastic on the bottom of the puck off so it would fit as well. I'm having trouble attaching pictures to help you out, but
 it's not really too hard, just look at the connections and scrape off whatever is in the way of making the connection.</p>

            <p>It could be a sub-process or application that's running in the background <br />
and taking all the CPU resources.</p>
<p>To find and display what could be the problem try Process Explorer:<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a><br />

<p>Worth Reading: The Case of the System Process CPU Spikes<br />
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2008/04/07/3031251.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2008/04/07/3031251.aspx</a></p>
<p>Once you have Process Explorer installed and running:<br />
In the taskbar select View and check:<br />
'Show Process Tree' and the 'Show Lower Pane' options.<br />
Move your mouse cursor over any column in the right hand pane and<br />
right click and check the following boxes: <br />
'Command Line' and 'Version'.<br />
Then expand the process named 'Explorer' (click on the + sign)<br />
In the column on the left named 'CPU', look for any high CPU usage.<br />
Next click on the CPU column to sort the processes by %CPU usage<br />
(Highest to Lowest).</p>
<p>You can also mouse over and check any spike or high/low point in the CPU graph.</p>
<p>Move the mouse cursor over any process, <br />
you should see a popup with some detailed info.<br />
Then mouse over the process that's using most or all the CPU %.<br />
Then click on that process to highlight it,<br />
Now that&nbsp; it's highlighted, right click and from the options listed select: <br />
'Search Online'.<br />
This should display what out there on the web about that process.<br />
You can also double click on any process to open up a more detailed <br />
'Properties' window.<br />
Note: some entries like Explorer, System/Services, and Svchost <br />
may need to be expanded to show the detail (sub processes),<br />
in this case click on the + located to the left of the entry.</p>
<p>An alternate method when using Process Explorer <br />
is to double click on the Graph just below the Menu bar.<br />
This will open the 'System Information' window, which has a larger display <br />
of all three graphs. Move your mouse over any spike in the <br />
CPU Usage graph to see what process/application or service is the cause <br />
of the spike.</p>
<p>Another tool available is: RAMMap<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation, drivers, diagnostics, and ask in<br />
their forums about known issues. That could be hardware and as OEM the System Maker is responsible<br />
for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. Since it is a new system the warranty is<br />
still in effect.<br />
<br />
Check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device<br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
==========================================================================<br />
<br />
Some methods to troubleshoot however do not fail to contact the above :<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I bought the 360 Version of Ghosts Preordered @ Wal-Mart and was told we would be able to pay $10 more to upgrade it when the One came out. I can't find any info on this anywhere other than a digital edition which I dont have. &nbsp;Am I going to have to
 buy 2 more full copies (both my son and I) Friday when we get our Xbox One's?? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Walmart is not one of the participating retailers that offer a trade in of the physical copy for the Xbox One version for $10. It would seem in this case that you'd have to buy the full version of the Xbox One game.<br />
<br />
The $10 digital offer was only for folks that ordered using the Xbox LIVE Marketplace.<br />
<br />
More information on this next gen offer is available <strong><a href="http://www.callofduty.com/ghosts/nextgen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the One your download history is basically your "Ready to Install" section. You can find that in your Games and Apps. If it's not listed there, check the store and see if it gives the option to install it instead of purchase.</p>
<p>If you need more assistance, it's best to create your own thread since this one is old.</p>

<h3> jgcrews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Home Premium 32-bit &#38; USB Mass Storage Devices</h2>
                    Suddenly, my installation of Windows 7 Home Premium no longer detects USB Mass Storage devices.&nbsp; This includes external USB HDDs as well as USB flash drives.&nbsp; Everything has been working since my June 2010 install up until about a week ago.<br />
<br />
I have not made any changes to my system nor installed any new software.&nbsp; Windows automatic updates are turned off.&nbsp; Only essential updates are manually installed.<br />
<br />
The drives do not show up under Disk Management and there are no "USB Mass Storage Device" entries under the "USB Controllers" category&nbsp; in Device Manager.<br />
<br />
I no longer get the normal USB Connect &amp; Disconnect sounds in Windows.<br />
<br />
When I plug in a USB flash drive, the drive's LED illuminates for about 1/2 second then goes out.<br />
<br />
Hijack This, avast, Spybot S&amp;D, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, TDSS Rootkiller, Rootkit Buster &amp; RUBotted all come back clean.<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss.&nbsp; I'm hoping it is something simple that I'm overlooking but I don't know what.

<p>Just a quick update -- it was indeed something quite simple.&nbsp; As it turns out, a single USB port had died.&nbsp; In swapping out the two drives and the USB flash drive, I apparently omitted checking a different USB port.&nbsp; I certainly meant to and I thought that
 I had but it became obvious today that I had not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All is working well and as expected.</p>

    <title>Number Keypad does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theplow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Number Keypad does not work</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.0 Very Odd - when I log in, the numbers keypad works well and I can use the numbers.&nbsp; I know this because one of my passwords is numbers only, and it works well.&nbsp; After I get past the password and the tiles appear, only the arrow keys work, not
 the numbers.&nbsp; I can press num lock and the indicator light goes on and off, but I do not get any numbers, only arrows and home, PageUp and so forth.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is an even odder wrinkle - I have two machines One a desktop dell and the second a laptop Gateway, brand new.&nbsp; There was no problem with the Dell desktop, until I started using the Gateway.&nbsp; When I started using the laptop, I signed in using my Microsoft
 account, and I am now using that same account on the desktop as well.&nbsp; That is very cool - I like how it synchs the desktop&nbsp;background&nbsp;and the bookmarks.&nbsp; BUT - the keyboard number issue started on the Gateway laptop, then moved onto my desktop Dell.&nbsp; Now
 neither machine number pad works properly.&nbsp; All other keys on both machines work well.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update and the Medic Services</h2>
                    <p>WaaSMedicSvc - Windows Update Medic Service</p>
<p>wuauserv - Windows Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As no information is apparently available, still after multiple threads on the Web having tried to cover this, I will ask again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does the&nbsp;WaaSMedicSvc service do?&nbsp; <strong>What is the design and purpose?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, everything I have read implies more shadiness from Microsoft.&nbsp; This all stems from the Windows Update service re-enabling itself each day and running after I disable it - more about reason due to wasted time and money on my end below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not interested in Microsoft dictating how they will manage my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started looking into this new service that popped up during a recent, forced, MS update...Windows Update Medic Service.&nbsp; Based on what I read, its shady and making calls to servers overseas over the Web.&nbsp; So, I tried to disable until I understand more about
 it.&nbsp; And.....I get Access Denied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More Microsoft BS as their OS is weak.&nbsp; This clearly is their way of protecting their intellectual property.&nbsp; So, I will play this game, write a program and disable every day, multiple times a day if MS wants to play.&nbsp; I wasn't one that would go to this
 level, but Microsoft leaves me no choice given all the hours they have wasted of my time and money due to the hours my laptops needed to be plugged in in order to complete forced Microsoft updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. Windows 10, Microsoft's recent celebrated OS update, is a failure it seems as I still have strange Explorer issues like new folders not showing up and unable to easily share files across the Intranet as well as poor performance.&nbsp; In addition to the
 above noted wasted time, I have spend countless hours researching the Web for tips on Win10 options to improve everything.&nbsp; Never resulting in a long term fix.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your stunning lack of intellect and inability to answer the question is amusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update Medic Service exists on paper to "repair Windows Update from damage" but the reality is it exists to force Updates on the user and give them absolutely no choice whether or not they receive them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not, not everyone wants your precious "Updates."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I understand as someone with limited intellect you cannot fathom why anyone would have a qualm with this service and therefore are unable to answer the question but rather regurgitate the official information you read from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Since no one else has thus far provided a solution to this problem, here is the one I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use the&nbsp;WUMT Wrapper Script found on majorgeeks.com to disable this service and prevent windows from performing unauthorized updates on your system. It is pathetic and embarrassing that Windows does not incorporate this feature to begin with and
 that 3rd parties have to write scripts to disable it, but for now, this is the only solution I can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/wumt_wrapper_script.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>How it works: The script first checks if the OS is older than Windows 10 and if so it bypasses the Windows 10 Update Hijacker disable portion of the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This script creates a smart Windows Defender Update task "WDU" that updates Windows Defender if it's running and enabled, and doesn't update it if it's not running and disabled,&nbsp;auto-elevates, uninstalls and removes the Windows 10 Update Assistant, renames
 the %programfiles%\rempl* folder, resets and removes permissions from and disables these Update Hijackers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>remsh.exe*<br />
EOSNotify.exe<br />
osrss.dll<br />
UsoClient.exe<br />
WaaSMedic.exe<br />
WaasMedicSvc.dll<br />
WaaSMedicPS.dll<br />
WaaSAssessment.dll<br />
MusNotification.exe<br />
MusNotificationUx.exe<br />
SIHClient.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>it also makes sure the task "wub_task" is installed that runs wub at boot (to stop updates from turning updates back on), runs wub.exe and enables and starts the windows update service (wuauserv) if disabled (*wub can be disabled using the included Configurator.cmd
 script, leaving Windows Updates always running so you can use Store and Defender at any time), then runs the correct version of the Windows Update MiniTool in "auto search for updates" mode for your OS version's architecture (x86 or x64), then disables and
 stops wuauserv giving you full control. No more forced automatic updates or surprise reboots. This was written for Windows 10 Pro and Home, but works with all<br />
versions of Windows 10. Don't change any settings in lower left of WUMT while running the script.</p>

            Conspiracy theories set aside, windows if failing to update day after day multiple times in a day, automatically even after disabling windows update service. It has done this on my computer and many computers at my place of work.... If Microsoft would
 fix that this wouldn't be needed, but their updates are junk. So how about a solution rather than being a smart ass?

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Wifi and Bluetooth adapter stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that there is something that I have not tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with the i3, 4gb, 128GB. It has performed flawlessly for the past couple of years. Until, suddenly, I lost the network adapter. When I look in Device Manager, I can "see" it when I "Show hidden devices". When I check the properties,
 it tells me that "Currently, this hardware is not connected to the computer (Code 45).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried so many things, and I fear that the hardware has failed. I am posting this in hopes that someone out there has been able to fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Tried to update drivers (Using SurfacePro3_Win10_14393_1703702_1 drivers package)</p>
<p>2. Network reset</p>
<p>3. Computer reset</p>
<p>4. Computer Recovery (from USB drive)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I did the recovery, the network adapter was there for a bit. When I tried to connect to my WLAN, it could not connect. I tried several times until the network card disappeared, again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm willing to try anything at this point!</p>

<p>Oh, boy. That's what I was afraid of.&nbsp; I ran a full USB recovery, again, last night. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info on "out of warranty" service. I am disappointed that this is my favorite computer EVER, but also the shortest lived. I am not near a Microsoft Store, so I will have to deal with them over the phone.&nbsp; I really prefer email or chat. If
 they are available options, they must be a well kept secret, as I have not been able to find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for the confirmation and information.<br />

<p>I was able to connect with a "chat" session (why is that so difficult?), and after a bunch of troubleshooting, they were not able to find a fix. Then, when I asked for details on the "replacement program", they said that for $599 I would get whatever they
 sent. They said that the replacement would likely be a SP3. When I asked if I could get a new version, they were pretty emphatic that the answer is "no".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty disappointing.&nbsp; The text of my reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the response, but I am concerned with this replacement policy. Here’s why:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>My SP3 is only a couple of years old and should not have failed. Other than the Marvell Unit malfunction, my SP3 is flawless. If it was serviceable, I would have it fixed already.&nbsp; I have an HP laptop that is at least 7 years old and I have never
 had a problem with it. Even if it did have an issue, I could get it repaired for substantially less than $599 (i.e. network card would be easy and cheap).</span></li><li><span>An $800 computer should not be disposable!</span></li><li><span>The Surface Pro 3 is several years old at this point (old tech), the Pro 4 is a couple of years old, and I assume the Pro 5 will be coming out this year.&nbsp; I can buy a refurbished SP3 for less than $599 &nbsp;(i.e.
<a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FProduct.aspx%3FItem%3D9SIAEWJ6DB6170%26cm_re%3Dmicrosoft_surface_pro_3_refurbished-_-9SIAEWJ6DB6170-_-Product&amp;data=02%7C01%7CSURFC.SURF.NA.00.EN.STR.CEB.TS.T01.SPT.00.CH%40css.one.microsoft.com%7C50267eed25274c31409b08d59a81af8d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636584804150986076&amp;sdata=PuDDBexJDsclyAwZIXyzVtc9xlhDWfhUIIk8cALSFdU%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAEWJ6DB6170&amp;cm_re=microsoft_surface_pro_3_refurbished-_-9SIAEWJ6DB6170-_-Product</a>), so I don’t see the “replacement service” as a value if it is replaced with a SP3. If you can replace it with a current
 version (i5, 4GB RAM, 128GB) for $599, then I see value (Since you are selling a current version (SP4, i5, 4GB, 128GB) at YOUR store for $799, just $200 more.)
</span></li><li><span>If the SP3 failed this soon and is non-repairable, I would hesitate to buy another one. If I did replace it, I would want the latest. If you would offer the current version for the $599, I would not hesitate to try another one (but last chance).</span></li></ol>
<p><span>As a loyal Microsoft customer, for many, many years (going back to Windows 3.1), I would have hoped for a little better treatment with this SP3 that has failed WAY too early. I am hoping that you can talk with a supervisor or Bill Gates himself to
 see if there is another replacement option for me. There are a couple of options:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Offer to replace with a current version (i5, 4GB, 128GB) for the $599 (you could even throw in a touchtype cover and pen as goodwill )</span></li><li><span>Offer a $200 coupon that I could use to purchase a new one at the store of my choosing. Costco has a package with everything for $899.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please let me know if there is anything you can do to make this a positive experience for me. I really LOVE my SP3, but am disappointed with this process. I hope someone there can bring this around.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft reply:</span></p>
<p><span>This is XXXX from Microsoft Surface Support. Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp; In this case, this is the only option that you have. You can check the Surface Plus. Here is the link:

            <p>Since you are getting the message, something must be trying to use it.&nbsp; It was used to project your computer screen to a wireless display.&nbsp; So perhaps some other software is involved, which might be a wireless adapter or the software with it or possibly
 the Intel video drivers or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I would check into updating those if&nbsp;Windows has not already done so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check the startup items listed in Task Manager to see if anything there might be truing to start it.</p>

<p><strong>If the steps mentioned in my first post failed to resolve the issue , please follow these suggestions&nbsp;</strong></p>

<br />
C:<br />
<br />
CD %windir%\system32<br />
<br />
diskpart<br />
<br />
list volume<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: After running the "list volume" command, it will show all partition.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
select volume &lt;volume number&gt;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: Please replace the "&lt;volume number&gt;" to the volume number that you want to shrink . For example,&nbsp; Suppose If you want to shrink C and if the volume number of drive C is 2, we need run the command "select volume 2"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
shrink desired=&lt;N&gt;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: Please replace the "&lt;N&gt;" to the disk space you would like to shrink. After run the command, it will shrink &lt;N&gt; MB space on drive C. (1GB=1024MB)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After the process finish the command, please restart the computer and check whether we have shrunk the drive successfully.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>If problem persist Shrink the volume in Safe Mode<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
Check Disk</strong> <br />
<br />
=============</p>
<strong>This issue can also be caused by corrupted drive or incorrect permission. Thus, I suggest we first perform the following steps to check the issue.</strong>
<p><strong><br />
1. Click the Start Button, type "cmd" (without quotation marks) in the Search bar.<br />
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Please type Y and press Enter.<br />
<br />
5. Please restart the computer and let the tool check the C: drive on the computer.</strong></p>

<h2>            Battery Drain</h2>
                    <p>i use a HP laptop and since windows 10 upgrade, there has been a major battery drain. after full charge, battery dies after just 1 hour. During windows 8.1, it used to work for 4.5 hours.</p>
<p>I am very unhappy with the using of windows 10. first the shut down &amp; sleep problem, then taskbar not working sometimes. and now this. very displeasing&nbsp;experience using windows 10. very unsatisfactory product so far.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that most users or even all users have experienced fast battery drain after upgrading windows 10. I also have the same problem. We must keep up-voting this issue until Microsoft fix this completely.</p>
<p>In another page, a Microsoft engineer had replied to this issue by recommending us to update the drivers and denying that it is Windows 10 problem on its own.</p>
<p>I and most of users have already updated all drivers in Windows 10. In fact, I have personally tried to disable "Hey Cortana" feature, Location, and switch to power saver mode. But, still Windows 10&nbsp;drains the battery&nbsp;about 30% faster than windows 8.1.&nbsp;
 I used to have 10 to 11 hours of on screen standby time and now with windows 10, I just can get up to 5 hours 30 minutes with the same scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have to tell Microsoft this, Come on... I know that Microsoft has fixed the worse battery drain issue in insider preview, but that's not enough. At least,&nbsp;windows 10 should&nbsp;be as good as windows 8.1 in terms of battery longevity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep this up. Upvote every battery drain feedback in Windows 10 feedback app.</p>

<h3> gurdil  say:</h3>
<h2>            External HDD corrupted by bitlocker...</h2>
                    
<p>i encrypted 1 of the 3 partitions on my external HDD using bitlocker. it is a 60 GB partition on 250 GB HDD. while decrypting it, there was a power faliure and the error occured, windows 7 x64 shows the drive not formatted and the bitlocker also doesnt detect
 it.</p>
<p>i tried using the bitlocker repair tool in command prompt with the command&nbsp; "repair-bde m: e: -rp &lt;recovery pwd&gt;" , but it hangs on pressing enter and nothing shows up except</p>
<p>" bitlocker drive encryption :&nbsp;repair tool version 6.1.7600</p>
<p>copyright &lt;c&gt; microsoft corporation "</p>
<p>i can access the other 2 partitions on the drive and they r visible in the explorer, but the corrupted partition is not accessible. It is sometimes visible in explorer and sometimes not. When it is visible,the computer asks me to format it. When it is not
 visible, i try to look for it using 'Disk Management' but then even the 'Disk Management' wont start. If i start the 'disk management' before and then plug in the&nbsp;HDD, all the partitions r visible but this corrupted partition&nbsp;is not accessible,it doesnt have
 a drive letter and i cant see its properties&nbsp;</p>

            Hi <strong>Gurdil</strong>,<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Did you check if the drive that you encrypted appears in BitLocker Drive Encryption Control Panel?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For your information, if there is a power failure while performing BitLocker Drive Encryption or decryption, then the process will resume from where it left off the next time Windows starts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;So, what exactly happened when the power came back in your case? Did you see whether the decrypting process resume from where it left or the drive was completely inaccessible?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to use the BitLocker Repair Tool to get the recover data from the encrypted drive. Visit the link below for the same.<br />

<p>here's some more food for thought....</p>
<p>the Bitlocker Drive Decryption window appears asking me the password just when i had removed the HDD fom USB and will go away after 3-4 seconds.</p>
<p>the 3rd partition is not there till the time HDD is plugged in (i can see the other 2 partitions). but it will appear with a icon of bitlocker locked drive for 3-4 sec after i have removed the HDD from the USB.</p>
<p>If connect the HDD in windows XP and use some partition manager program then it shows all the 3 partitions with the file system of the 3rd partition</p>
<p>as " Other(Bitlocker encrypted)"</p>
<p>IS THERE A USB ISSUE WITH WINDOWS 7 ??</p>
<p>plz help me out of this, this problem is driving me crazy...</p>

            Any solution to this, I encrypted my external hard drive and it worked perfectly for almost a month until I left for a vacation, Now it unlocks the drive but does nothing instead it is killing my system all the sudden but I couldn't see a single file.
 I am totally upset as it contains two years worth of pics of my two little kids, I absolutely need some help from you guys.<br />

            <p>Cmon MS. This is a top search result page. It is disappointing to see no solution listed here.

                    <span>My son just purchased Halo 2, he worked hard to earn the money to buy this game and now he cannot play. I have had this error and have spent a lot of time trying to get it to work.

 I was wondering if there is a definitive solution to the error. I have been gaming on computers for years and have never had such a hard time with a game. I would think since 2007 Microsoft would have gotten some sort of fix in by now. I am very disappointed!
 This kid worked hard for this and got nothing for his efforts but a bum game disc! When will Microsoft begin to back up what they sell? Reading all the posts for this error made me steam, it is shameful to let your customers suffer through trying to do your
 job! Knowing that once a box of software is opened most retailers will not take it back doesn't seem to bother Microsoft, after all you got your money who cares if the software works!&nbsp;</span>

<p>Found this in another post.&nbsp; It work for me.&nbsp; Although I did a lot of other things before hand that may have contributed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Load the latest Games for Windows Live Client. Before you load the Halo 2 game fire up Live and sign in. Then start Halo2. The game should run fine. It's a problem with Halo 2 not being able to start the Live Client properly on Windows 7/Vista.</p>

            Hi SRK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Install the full software package from HP here:
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-officejet-pro-8710-all-in-one-printer-series/7902014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br />While there make sure you have the latest firmware which is critical to the printer running well and lasting.
<br />
<br />If you've installed any other drivers from Windows Update or Window 10 remove all of them first as shown here:  <a href="https://www.wintips.org/how-to-remove-printer-drivers-in-windows-10-8-7-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wintips.org/how-to-remove-printer-d...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
