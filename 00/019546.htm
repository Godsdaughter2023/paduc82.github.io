<h2>            zune performance very low when WP7 syncing or upgrading</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I have my WP7 (Samsung Omnia 7) plugged in with the USB, and when I'm either upgrading the system or simply syncing the content (in fact when the USB port is solicited), the whole system is nearly frozen. My CPU is blocked at 100% of usage, and other
 apps are&nbsp;unusable&nbsp;until&nbsp;the operation completes or the sync is stopped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When not syncing, the system remains responsive, but in the task manager, I see zune (which is a simple media player) which takes between 30 and 50% of the processor time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I explain that, and how can I solve this ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS: My computer is a dell latitude E6400, with a Core 2 Duo Centrino and 4 GB of ram. My OS is W7 Enterprise X64.</div>
<div>This is not a high end laptop... but damn ! I only want to sync files !</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the suggested steps? (i.e. re-install drivers, re-install Zune software, try on a different PC)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I have seen this issue occur, a lot of the times it is because of the graphics card in the PC. The low end cards do not handle the syncing and playback animations very well. In some cases I have seen it freeze up the entire machine just as you are experiencing.
 The <strong>E6400</strong> has an Integrated<strong> Intel GMA 4500MHD</strong>. This is a low end card that even&nbsp;has a hard time decoding blu-ray, however it should be able to run the Zune software just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a methodical way of troubleshooting, I recommend you turn down the <em>Screen Graphics</em> within the software and see where that gets you. You can do so by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>-&gt; <strong>Software </strong>-&gt; <strong>Display </strong>
-&gt; and then sliding the <strong>Screen Graphics </strong>bar all the way to the left to the
<em>Basic</em> setting. <em>(A reboot of the software is required)</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have access to a new PC, you can try a new Windows User Account. Please refer to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Windows 7: Create New User</strong></a>&nbsp;if you need help with the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after all of the above said steps fail, you should try a reformat of the device. You will find the steps here:

http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/zuneplayers/solvingproblems/reinstallplayer.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still not working? You may need to re-install Windows or try a different PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope all of this information helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft walking away without fixing all the problems with WinMobile6</h2>
                    <p>As an owner of a Toshiba TG01 running Winmobile 6,5 pro I am distressed, but not surprised that MS is walking away from&nbsp;WinMobile6.X &nbsp;without fixing all the bugs in it.&nbsp; While I find a lot of things interesting about Windows Phone 7, I will not consider
 it for my next phone as a result.&nbsp; Probably will only consider a future Windows Phone when the only other choice is Ios.&nbsp; I would have done this as a private email to MS, but hitting "contact us" doesn't bring up an appropriate link.</p>

            This is the nature of a lot of technologies. As new technologies are released, old ones fade away. I don't think MS ever updated Windows 95 to support Firewire or Bluetooth. It's also true of carriers. I've been denied updates to my Windows Mobile device
 because Verizon didn't want to give them to me and no other reason. <br />
<br />
The link you provide only talks about the publication of apps and bugs in the app development. I actually saw most developers drop WM6x long before this. With the release of WP7, most developers have moved to that platform because it was growing while WM6x
 was just about dead and there wouldn't be updates coming from them in the first place.<br />
<br />
It could actually be viewed that WP7 is the fix to the bugs and shortcomings of WM6x. A lot of the complaints I had about WM6x could only be fixed by taking a completely different approach. That fix was WP7.<br />

<h2>            Sway Frustrations</h2>
                    <ol>
<li>The mobile app is triggering the sway to be reconfigured when in edit mode.</li><li>I often get stuck in read only mode after using the mobile app on ipad</li><li>Sway's solution to being stuck in read only mode is to duplicate the file</li><li>The problem with that is you can easily delete the wrong sway...which I've done. I've been a victim of the "sway screen of death" delete gone wrong. I assumed the copy on the right was the old sway...which I checked the url on before I deleted...and was
 sure it was the right on...but some how sway managed to delete the one I wanted to keep. BTW this was after the file was shared to everyone I know...how embarrassing.</li><li>Focus points - I can see where you"re going with it but it still needs to be easier to use. One point works great...but when you add two points you lose the image spread across the screen. I find my self either using one point or the whole image because
 it's too frustrating to deal with 2 and 3 points...due to the clunkyness</li><li>Let's go back to #4... We need to be able to assign a link to a sway...that way if sways have issues we can duplicate them and then the link that we originally posted to the world isn't embarrassingly dead forever. Imagine allowing the user to simply associate
 a link with a sway.&nbsp;</li><li>Drop everything and focus on #4 and #6</li><li>It feels like a beta. These are basic issues any focus group would have caught. Do more research and development.</li><li>On a lighter note...it would be nice if we could double click pictures to add them instead of drag and drop.</li><li>Also when toggling from preview to edit...it would be nice if the edit timeline was at the same point that I ended up before switching from the preview mode. When I switch over now...I have to search for the next edit spot that I've already identified by
 stopping on the preview screen.</li><li>The spellchecker needs more words...OMG- "Tday's jeneration wrek wordz tu da hiest poynt ohf rectivity." SG</li><li>Did you see #7?</li><li>In all seriousness, this is a powerful product but I'm not swayed until you work out these major swinks.</li><li>Close you eyes and imagine all sway users as Presidents, Kings, and Queens. Do you want to have to tell them that the sway they spent time perfecting and sharing has now inadvertently moved on or has to be duplicated to fix or that it re configures itself
 on the mobile ipad app?</li><li>To help avoid embarrassment, &nbsp;I made a sway and vow to never return to adjust it in any way because I honestly feel like something may brake...again.</li></ol>

            <p>It's clearly a product with great potential, but it feels buggy to me. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>At certain points in a sway, when I select several image cards, the 'group' option appears, but at other points in the same sway when I select a different set of images it doesn't, and I've no idea how to group them.</li><li>If, for example, I drag a 'group' card into the storyline, it typically goes somewhere other than where I want it and refuses to be dragged to where I want it.</li><li>Sometimes, when I'm clicking on the green 'plus' icon at the bottom left of a card, the option for a heading appears, and sometimes it doesn't.</li></ul>
<p>These get very frustrating!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback, SKYGIF!&nbsp; I'll do my best to respond to it all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The layout of a Sway is dependent upon screen size and device.&nbsp; That way, you only need to make a single Sway and it should display optimally for all your viewers no matter where they view it.</p>
<p>2. There is currently a limitation that a Sway cannot be opened in edit mode in&nbsp;the iOS app and the website at the same time.&nbsp; In order to open on the website, you must first close the Sway in the iOS app completely.</p>
<p>3. We are working on making it easier to close your editing session so that you can open it on the website easier.</p>
<p>4. We've heard similar feedback from other users about accidental deletion of the wrong Sway.&nbsp; We are looking into ways of making this clearer.</p>
<p>5. Can you be more specific with this one?&nbsp; What do you mean by spread across the screen?&nbsp; Also, what navigation and design types are you using?</p>
<p>6. This sounds like a great suggestion and I encourage you to post it in our suggestion forum:&nbsp;

<p>8. Keep pointing out any issues you find and we'll do our best to fix them!</p>
<p>9. Great idea.&nbsp; We'll look into it.&nbsp; You may also want to add this to the suggestion forum.</p>
<p>10. This is useful feedback and we will look into ways to improve this transition.</p>
<p>11. Sway doesn't actually have a spellchecker and relies on whatever the browser and any addins it has does.</p>
<p>12. I saw it and I felt it!</p>
<p>13. We are sworking on Sway everyday and I hope that we can sway you stick with us!&nbsp; I'm positive you'll be swaytisfied if you do!</p>
<p>14. Based on what I said about #2/3, I'm hoping that you won't have to use duplicate anymore to get out of this situation.&nbsp; And if I'm going to be talking to any Presidents, Kings, or Queens, I need to go shopping because I have nothing nice to wear!</p>
<p>15. I think your Sways will be fine now.&nbsp; If not, send me another post and I'll jump right on it and get it fixed for you.</p>

            The reason you can't make them happen is because, presumably, you aren't making the mistake I was making. I hadn't noticed that the cards I was having problems with had accidentally been combined in a group. I was on a slow data connection, which made
 it harder to see what was going on. Perhaps if there was some way of indicating more clearly (for the benefit of those still getting used to Sway) that cards are in a group, it would reduce the possibility of this frustration arising?<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now,&nbsp;if the download has commenced, I suggest you not to interrupt the download and installation of the latest build, as it may lead to performance issues if the installation status is incomplete.</p>
<p>Now, Windows offers the option to Rollback to the previous Windows builds. So, once you have the latest Windows build successfully installed, you can use the following steps to perform the rollback.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Settings &gt; Update &amp; security.</li><li>Click on the ‘Get started’ button in the ‘Go back to an earlier build’ option to start the recovery process.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to us again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is designed to automatically receive and install updates. Now, since the scheduled upgrade is already set, I suggest you to go ahead with the upgrade and then perform a
<p>
</p><p>Next, launch the <strong>Settings app</strong>, and navigate to <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>,
<strong>Windows Update</strong>, and inside <strong>Advanced options</strong>, click the
<strong>Stop Insider builds</strong> under "Get Insider builds". </p>
<p>This is a way of absolutely preventing future Windows 10 preview builds from installing in your PC. (Not Recommended)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of stopping the future Windows builds, my suggestion to you is to check if you are receiving Insider builds 'Fast' or 'Slow'. If it is set to 'Fast', set it to 'Slow'.</p>
<p>However, you would still continue to receive those builds even when you are on Slow Ring, but&nbsp;these tend to come after much delay and also will be more stable.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi if it's set to download but you do not want it right now...you change the updates to 'Slow Ring' and go to 'Services' &nbsp;&nbsp; and 'Stop' Windows updates for the day &nbsp;&nbsp; that will kill the download process.</p>
<p>Then the next day you can re-start the Windows updates thru 'Services' again.</p>

            <p>The advice about the rollback is the safest. &nbsp;Go ahead and restart and let it finish. &nbsp;Then do the rollback. &nbsp;That will ensure that all process, including registry settings, gets set back to where they were when you started. &nbsp;As a precaution in case something
 goes wrong during all this, make a system image using Control Panel/System and Security/Backup and Restore (Windows 7) upper left corner (the system image tool has nothing to do with Windows 7). &nbsp;Make the image to external media and make the Repair Disk (you
 will use it to restore the image). &nbsp;Of course if you have a commercial product that does the same thing, fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change from Fast Ring to Release Preview ring now or after. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Been given N73. Can&#39;t get it to call out.</h2>
                    Hi, I've been given an N73 that is locked to tmobile. I'm on a contract with them so I have transferred my simcard and entered the unlock code of 12345 but when I tried to phone out to test it, I got a message saying "emmergency calls only".<br />
I know I'm in credit so its not that. I didn't have the user guide included with the phone but having just looked at it on the website, it doesn't say there is anything more I need to do. I read that the sim is an ESIM but having phoned tmobile, they have confirmed
 that my sim should work. Any ideas?

            Hi, did it about 3 times and eventually it worked. Next problem, despite getting tmobile to send me the right settings by text, I can't send texts. I messed around with the settings (changed "Reply via same centre" to yes) and managed to send one and get
 a reply but when I tried to reply to this, it failed again.<br />
It's v frustrating considering it should be set up for my network.<br />

If you go to: Settings/Network/Network mode, what's it set to as you haven't said whether GSM or UMTS?<br />
<br />
Have you tried getting the settings sent to you via Nokia site: <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4222200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It gives two options... GSM/UMTS or Packet Data and the first one is enabled.<br />
Will try getting the settings from Nokia and see what happens.<br />

See the first reply Ben gave you. Once you've moved everything to that new pst-file within Outlook itself, close Outlook and copy the pst-file to your backup medium.</p>

            It was registered with my office 365 account. &nbsp;I have tried to remove the records, I have cancelled my subscription (at this point I thought I was cancelling everything but obviously not) but on trying to remove my domain email address from office 365
 it asked me to sign out and now I cannot sign back in to try cancelling anything else. &nbsp;I was trying to follow their help menu but now I can't get back in to do anything further.

            Well the good news is that I had a very long phone call that did remove my domain records eventually from 365. &nbsp;I was then able to log into Window's admin where I could copy the MX records but when pasting them into Melbourne IT where my domain is registered
 I get the following error message: "<span>Zone Integrity Error</span><span>&nbsp;- A relative MX record should point to an existing A or AAAA record." I don't know what my A or AAAA record is so I don't know how to fix this error message. &nbsp;I really appreciate your
 help, thank you.</span>

    <title>Sync Outlook 2016 with Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinmaroon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Outlook 2016 with Outlook.com</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Could someone please help me?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have been trying for a week to sync my Outlook 2016 with my Outlook.com account. I have followed all the instructions I have been given, deleted email accounts and tried to add a new email account; however, I cannot get past the little pop-up window headed
 "security", on which it says "Microsoft account/*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and, it does not accept any password. Therefore, I cannot set up a new email account!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have been passed from pillar to post, via chat and advice from forums but, it seems almost impossible to find someone with the exactly the same problem and therefore a solution.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Currently, my Windows phone is integrated with Outlook.com. I had the same problem with my phone after the upgrade of my Outlook.com last Wednesday, but just deleted the account and added a new one. No problem! Sadly, not the case with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run various diagnostics but they seem to be designed for 365 and, I can't log in there because there is no password and I suspect that was the problem with adding an email account. I am running Office 2016 Pro, although I have Office 365 on another
 device, for which I'm paying the fee. However, Office 2016 Pro was expensive and I expect to be able to get some support for this issue, which only arose when my Outlook.com was upgraded last Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Palcouk's suggestion is what first comes to mind.&nbsp; Double check you don't have two factor auth configured.&nbsp; If you do then to configure the account in Outlook you will need to use the app password rather than your Microsoft Account password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps and see if it shows you an App Password.&nbsp; </p>
To get an app password
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=529561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>Under <strong>App passwords</strong>, click <strong>Create a new app password</strong>. The new, unique app password will appear on your screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the app or device you’re trying to use, enter that new app password instead of your regular password.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>App passwords are only necessary if you use two-step verification. If you don't see the
<strong>App passwords</strong> section on the Security settings page, you may not have two-step verification turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no App Password try this next:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try creating a new profile and see if the account will configure for it, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-F544C1BA-3352-4B3B-BE0B-8D42A540459D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>However, with my "Upgraded" Outlook.com, I send an email and it doesn't show in Sent Folder, plus ALL previously sent emails have DISAPPEARED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in Calendar, if you open an appointment to amend it, it seems that the only thing you can do is send it someone else, you can't save it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working superbly well until the downgrade, sorry "upgrade" - it really is NOT an improvement over what was there before.&nbsp; Much preferred being synced with my Hotmail account, rather than going back to my ISP account.</p>

                    I have a nokia N70 phone and a nokia 616 car kit. I can connect to the kit through bluetooth and use it OK, but I can transfer my contacts. Whenever I try the phone drops the connection immediatly. I've looked on the website and cant find the software
 to download for this phone, although it is there for the n71.

            Hi - N70 isn't like the N71, it's more like the N90. So the download for this should work:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4144399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4144399</a><br />
<br />
and click on the third option which lists loads of phones with N90 last in the list. The second item in the list (SISX) is for S60 3rd Edition phones, looks like the third item (SIS) is for S60 2nd Edition and the fourth item (also SIS) is for S60 1st Edition...
 Once you install it, make sure it's running and then try the transfer again. I think it will drop the normal connection then reconnect a couple of times! Good luck Andrew

            <p>IMHO...</p>
<p>e.g. Youtube detect if the browser can HTML 5 Videos, if not YouTube use the flash player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there will be a time, when this will be not needed, or a web deleveloper think HTML 5 is enough a lot of Browsers support it.</p>
<p>But if a web developer think "Play movies always in flash" only if this not work, use HTML 5, that's the wrong way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, from the user point of view it should make no difference if Flash is enabeled or not, in Edge, Videos should be in HTML 5.</p>
<p>Flash is only for old sites who don't care about HTML 5, sites that use Flash anyway (e.g. games) or sites that can not, or want not, dedect Edge as a HTML 5 browser.</p>
<p>(Or sites that use Flash for other reasons, e.g. advertisement)</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>I recommend the latest update over the air from Nokia for the N8, the phone is responsive and smooth and just the N8 we all wanted after this update. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>I take back my earlier post - in addition to being noticeably less responsive, it seems to hang more often and the bug where the lower menu bar of the web browser disappears seems to happen more often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have right now:</p>
<p>Release: PR1.2</p>
<p>Software version: 014.002</p>
<p>Software version date: 2011-03-01</p>
<p>Custom version: 014.002.269.03</p>
<p>Custom version date: 2011-03-21</p>
<p>Product code: 059C8T6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a lot of people applied the latest update?&nbsp; If so, what has your experience been so far?&nbsp; I wonder if it's just me; I didn't do a hard reset (as I would have with the N97) when I applied this update - is that recommended?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i did the last update as usual when it came through but now my n8&nbsp;was unresponsive and kept shutting itself down, it was also drinking it's battery and stuck in offline mode, has anyone else had this issue? I tried the hard restart several times as that
 got it going again with the last set of problems but no luck this time. It starts working for a few minutes but then it freezes up again and i can't use the unlock or the touchscreen.</p>
<p>After removing the SIM it became responsive again but upon recieving a text it has promptly crashed again. Any help would be really appreciated x x x</p>

            <p>Hi Kathleen,<br />
<br />
In most cases, Office products like Office 365, Office 2016, and Office 2013 are automatically activated. But sometimes it needs to activate manually by providing Product key or by signing in to your account if it ask to. To better you, kindly provide the following
 information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What Office version are you using?</li><li>Does it asks you to sign in to your account to activate Excel?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Activate-Office-365-Office-2016-or-Office-2013-1144e0de-e849-496e-8e33-ed6fb1b34202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to know how you can activate Office.<br />

<h2>            I just purchased Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 and wont take Product KEy to download on my personal computer</h2>
                    I am a Federal Employee and work at home and we were offered a Microsoft Home use Program to purchase for $9.95 Program code Is 8D25208061.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010&nbsp; Full license-English<br />
<br />
Well not thinking as I purchased it through the government laptop I work with at home I put my gov email instead of my personal email.<br />
<br />
I am not authorized to download anything on the gov laptop and forwarded the email to my personal laptop hoping it would download.&nbsp; It doesn't<br />
<br />
My gov email is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but should have signed up on *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
My purchase confirmation is CNL11098211<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to make my personal computer take the Product Key D29CQ-YVB4G-2JFYH-RXW4R-QXYGH to take and not be rejected to download.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; I purchased Microsoft Officer Professional 2010 un der the DOD Home User Program and installed on my Gateway. &nbsp;That laptop is no longer working and i purchased a MacBook Air. &nbsp;I want to install Mac Office Professional
 2010. &nbsp;Can I reassign Office Professional 2010 from Windows to Mac? </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>ok, I know I can't run Office on Mac. &nbsp;According to the Apple web page I can "reassign" the program by getting a code and then deleting it from my system. &nbsp;Then to contact the technical manager to check my elegibility and
 reset it. &nbsp;I can then go back in and down load it again by paying the $20 again and install the Mac version. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<p>I also have problem with BT connection. After pairing device with notebook, it asks for some files to be installed, asking me for location for such files? Any idea what to do? With my old 6500s I've never had such issues. I have also tried pairing via PC
 Suite, but ended up with message "unable to connect". However I can send files from N86 to laptop when I choose option "receive a file" (on laptop).</p>

<p>i got the same problem as you guys. it is slow like hell. using the USB cable is better. i guess it is because of the applications that PC Suite/OVI Suite install the first time you connect it to your computer. i think they continuously poll for data through
 the bluetooth connection, therefore minimizing data bandwidth for syncing or file transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>look into the bluetooth icon at the upper right corner of your screen when you switch it on and after sometime, a &lt;----&gt; appears, indicating a current data connection with the computer and something is transferring through the bluetooth link.</p>

 message from MS to reconnect my account. I deleted the acount from outlook, created a new email profile from control panel, reinstalled the whole Office and even ran the fix it tool, but the issue is still persisting.

<p><span>I installed the Office 2016&nbsp;(with Office 365 Home account) also to see if the account will work there, but no matter what
 configuration type I am using it either fails to connect or after configuration the account does't receive mail.

<p><span>The only way i managed to make it work was when I changed my primary alias on the MS account to @outlook.com.
</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately this is not a possible solution for me. I need to keep my custom alias in order to proceed with my work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Upgrading from 11099 to 14251 boots into recovery mode</h2>
                    When upgrading from 1099 to 14251 the update begins installing then reboots into recovery mode with no option to simply upgrade like it has previous builds. I simply have too much stuff installed to reset my system and if that's the only recourse I'll
 just drop out of the Insider program and go back to Threshold 2.

<p>Not blaming you just pointing out guide lines that MS has posted about using beta software, I have been on here for over a year and have found that a lot of problems are because of 3rd party apps/programs that people have install on a test system, the purpose
 for the Preview is to test the software and when a problem occurs report it and see if we on here can help fix it, many times a simple fix came by way of removing a added 3rd party software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The whole purpose of beta testing is to use the releases as if they were the live OS and install software and programs that one would normally use in real life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YES one should back up frequently and expect a degree of failure with both the releases and 3rd party products but that's the whole point of testing! How can MS and 3rd parties correct their products?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that some people put a lot of effort and software into a release shows that they are trying to&nbsp;explore the full features of the insider program.</p>

<h2>            Windows Game&#160;Mode&#160;et al</h2>
                    <p>Windows Game Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great concept, flawed implementation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no independent support for&nbsp;Game Mode.<br />
No independent feedback topic.<br />
Very little information on it other than a few basic control mentions in the hype-up articles.</p>
<p>Thank you for the ability to customize shortcuts.<br />
One question though, why all the extra steps for a screen grab?</p>
<p>Press Prntscrn and be done.<br />
<br />
Though that is not my actual gripe here.<br />
Game Mode is actually causing more problems than it fixed.</p>
<p>Sure there are those out there that think money is solution to everything. </p>
<p>Slow computer? Buy a new one with better specs lol,duh derp.<br />
<br />
Game Mode needs to be approached as if everyone using it is on a desktop.<br />
Therefore not using tablet or phone and probably has a smattering of&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;where settings are concerned.<br />
There needs to be a better control system in place that expands the users ability to control Game Mode.<br />
A better UI, more control, better indication of Game Mode activation.<br />
<br />
I am testing game mode on an older machine with only 8gb ram, 64bit amd 2.3 ghz quad core, with a GTX 690 GPU.<br />
These specs are typical for the everyday user with a typical usage requirement. The target audience for Game Mode.<br />
For those about to lose their minds,&nbsp; the set up is average. This is not my gaming rig.<br />
My game rig has everything that is not needed stripped out of the OS (lots of bloat) settings that a normal user can not access and some that even hardcore system admins don't want to share, changed.<br />
All to alleviate the stress of windows based gaming.&nbsp; (Want to know these settings?? R T F M)<br />
<br />
The problems that I am having in game mode involve the interaction with video. <br />
There seems to be an override in GAME MODE that induces an 8x32 pixel Windowed rendition of the&nbsp;game being played.</p>
<p>To alleviate this simply turn off game mode, and restart the game.....only...that is not an option because&nbsp;once something is added to game mode...you can not remove it with ease.<br />
<br />
Proposed&nbsp;Solution:</p>
<p>A Control Panel App that increases control of Game Mode. IE add/remove tick box, drop menu, sub-app support for game launchers like Steam, Origin, GameFly,&nbsp;the ability to browse a directory and rightclickmenu add or remove a program.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to keep two files on two computers updated with each other.</h2>
                    Hi I wonder if some-one could tell me the best way to keep two files on two different computers, containing the same information, up to date with each other. I keep a list of places and addresses on two different computers in two different places and I
 use a portable hard drive to bring the file with me between the two locations. I add entries to the file at either location and that means that I have to check through the opposite file when I return to the first location to make sure that I have copied over
 any new entries from whichever file I have added the entries to. It is rather tedious and time-consuming so I wonder if there is a way that I can ensure that the two files can be kept the same when I copy one version of the file onto one of the computers and
 vice versa. If I use copy and paste all that happens is that I get a second listing underneith the original list, which is not what I want. I want to find a way to be able to update either file from the opposite file when I connec

<h2>            Unable to Left Click in OneNote with Mouse or Touchpad</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a persistent issue where the OneNote app won't register left clicks with the touchpad or with a mouse on my computer. I'm still able to use the mouse properly in menus and navigation, and the keyboard still functions. However, any attempt to click
 or move objects is ignored by the OneNote window, which is especially frustrating considering it still registers my cursor as being present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a two-in-one laptop and have found that touch controls still work properly, and am currently on OneNote Version 16001.10325.20049.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this? I love OneNote and would really like to get it working again.</p>
