<p>
</p><p>I was prompted to restart my pc after installing 2 updates - Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (KB890830) and Cumulative Update for Windows 10 KB3124263 today. After the restart, I wan't able to connect to the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc is connected to a router using WIFI. I've tried unplugging and plugging the modem and router to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no third-party security application installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what you suggested. Both troubleshooting generate the same message: <em>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WIFI icon in Network connections has disappeared. Some of the network adapters are hidden in Device Manager. The following adapters are found:</p>

<p>All the "revealed" adapters state that<em> This device is working properly</em>.</p>

<p>All but one (Microsoft Kernel Debug Network Adapter) have the following message:</p>

            <p>I finally got my wifi working.&nbsp; I tried everything listed by the various experts on several different posts except for modifying the registry.&nbsp; I didn't want to go into the registry until I took one last look at various wifi settings.&nbsp; I looked at my wifi
 properties and decided to see what the "configure" button showed.&nbsp; As I looked at each parameter, I noticed that my 802.11n setting was set for 20MHz only, so I decided to change it to allow higher speed connection.&nbsp; Once I changed this setting my wifi started
 working again.</p>

            Hello Krishna, could you please tell me why the latest Windows 10 update changed my wifi adapter configuration to 20 MHz only?&nbsp; I don't understand why this latest update would do anything to the 802.11 configuration, but based on my experience it looks
 like the update modified the wifi adapter configuration to 20 MHz only.

            <p>A. My pc is a Samsung one and unfortunately after the update the ipconfig/all itself does not show anything apart from Bluetooth.</p>
<p>B. My pc was working fine before the update. I have done the restore as of 6 Jan 2016 and still to no avail.</p>
<p>C. It is not the device driver version as it cannot suddenly change within a day and that too after restore.</p>
<p>D. It connects to the WiFi but windows is screwed up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now how are you going to fix this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;I JUST bought a new Dell XPS laptop and also am getting NO INTERNET CONNECTION</p>
<p>&nbsp;whether wired (Ethernet) or wireless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Folks: Once again, we've been sold a piece of junk by Microsoft. Win 10 (which I didn't want</p>
<p>anymore that I wanted to be an "early adopter of Win 8/8.1) has rendered me with an expensive</p>
<p>investment which will NOT connect, nor work in the 3 travel destinations where I need Internet connectivity. &nbsp; Shame on me. Tx Mary</p>

            Yes. It's a 12-month subscription. What I'm looking for is what "type" of subscription I have. There are subscriptions listed at https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates?language=en# but I don't see anything that tells me which one I'm paying for. Thanks.<br />

            Purchase history is the only place where you can see you active subscriptions. But I understand what you want and this information is currently not displayed in account.
<br />
<br />You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to get this required information.

<h2>            Error when trying to download &#34;Microsoft Remote Desktop Preview&#34; App on Lumia 950XL</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problem downloading "Microsoft Remote Desktop Preview" app on Windows 10&nbsp;Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 950XL, regularly updated (not on Windows Insider); yesterday I tried to download the app and at first seemed to acquire the license and all.. but then I got an error and the installation stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, every time I try to install the app, I got <em>instantly&nbsp;</em>the error "Try the download again, something happen on our end". The app appears as owned, install button available, but that error every time I try. My locale and language are set
 to English US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any problem to either install or update other apps, everything works fine except for this very specific app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve the issues? (please consider an hard reset&nbsp;should be the last&nbsp;option,&nbsp;given it's my business device)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago I found the phone asking to log in my Outlook account data again (the one used to register on the phone), after doing that the download started without problem and I was&nbsp;able to install the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what happened, nevertheless happy conclusion and thanks for helping.</p>

<h2>            Digital Games purchased when selling a console...</h2>
                    
<p>I am about to sell my Xbox 360 console and games so that I can switch to Xbox one. However, I am not 100% sure of what will happen with all the digital games saved on my Xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I delete all information about the accounts used so far on this xbox, the digital games should all still remain, right? (e.g. Destiny, Dead Island, Minecraft, etc.)</p>
<p>So in theory I would be selling an xbox + all the games I have purchased digitally?</p>
<p>Also... I bought Destiny and its expansions on the 360 digitally. This gives me free access to download the xbox one versions, since I bought it when it came out, and such offer existed. Correct?</p>
<p>I simply need confirmation that what I think to be true is in fact true haha! Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>On the 360 any game you purchase digitally is licensed to both the gamertag and the console. &nbsp;That means the licenses would remain with that console regardless of ownership.</p>
<p>However, to see a console with the digital games attached is considered Marketplace Theft as you are attempted to provide them to a person that hadn't initially purchased them. &nbsp;This could result in both the console and/or your gamertag being banned from the Live service if caught.</p>
<p>If you are planning on selling the console I would definitely recommend clearing the hard drive entirely to prevent this from happening.</p>

<p>Let's see. Multiple times I sent you invites when I needed a fourth or fifth player. Remembering back you sent me zero invites. Finally accepting an invite from me you quit before the match started (without saying what happened or letting me know later I'm
 implying you just turned your Xbox off). I was on a <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
65 win streak</span>&nbsp;that ended that game. Coincidence? Our randoms were so bad that we got slaughtered by kill streaks. Now I'm not saying it's your fault but you not giving me a reason for leaving later made me angry.
 I guess it didn't help that later you sent <i>me and everyone on your friend's list</i> a message cussing us out because you kept getting invites from a few players to games you didn't have. That was bad judgement and was unnecessary. That's too bad cause
 I like to win and won't even play Black Ops unless I have a decent team.<span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">

<h2>            System keeps trying to update and screws up</h2>
                    <p>I run Windows 10 on a 2011 Gateway pc. I keep drivers, BIOS and firmware up to date. The latest Windows 10 update is messing things up. Other updates seem to do okay but this one:&nbsp;Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709. Fails to update. When it does
 try to update my system stops and will not restart on its own. I wind up powering down myself and start back up again. I have left the computer to do its thing and its stalled at certain percentages. I've gone into the system file to stop the updates and that
 doesnt work. I have read articles and other forums and tried their suggestions-no go.</p>
<p>Today I got the Blue Screen Of Death with options. So I booted from the back up drive. Honestly, I'm ready to go back to windows 7. Or is this system too old?</p>

</p><p>This might be caused by a corrupted update file. Version 1709 is the latest Windows update version. If the update is not installing, try resetting the Windows Update components first then install it manually. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how you can reset Windows Update components. Then check our
<strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=1709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong> to manually download and install the update.

<p>Thank you for the response. It might be caused by a corrupted user profile. Try creating a new account and run the update as admin. See if the same error will occur. Refer to this

<p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to some corrupted system files. Let us try a different approach in resolving the error. Kindly make sure the following first:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you are using a WiFi connection, try switching to a wired connection using a network cable, and disable or uninstall your wireless network card.</li><li>Remove any connected USB devices (except the keyboard and mouse) when attempting the upgrade.</li><li>Make sure you’ve installed all the latest Windows Updates and latest drivers and updates from your hardware and software manufacturers.</li><li>Check your motherboard manufacturer’s website for any BIOS updates for Windows 10.</li><li>Uninstall any unnecessary hardware or software prior to updating your operating system.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you <span>run the <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong>. To do this, check this

    <title>Windows 10 Tablet install problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kayanow2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Tablet install problems</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba windows 8.1 tablet with 1 GB ram 16 GB Hard drive and 32 GB SD Card. I have made a number of attempts to upgrade to windows 10 but keep failing because each time I try I run out of room. I don't know how it happened but I can no longer re
 set to Factory default although the system restore folder seems to still be on the drive. I guess it was during an attempt to upgrade (I have a feeling that a lot of the room has been taken up by left over files from previous attempts to upgrade but I could
 be wrong about that).<br />
The last time I tried I allowed it to use 8 GB of space on my SD card but then it said it also needed more than 4 GB on the hard drive (C:) which I haven't got. I have tried un installing everything I don't need from the hard drive but there is a folder called
 WinSxS that holds about 5 GB of data that will not allow me to move temporarily or even do anything to it (read only).<br />
What I think is that the best way to get this sorted would be to do a format of "C:" and a fresh install of windows 10 but how would I do that and still get an activated official upgrade. Is there a way to do this. I hope someone can advise me, I've tried to
 get a back up from Toshiba so I can revert to factory settings and start again but they want more than £40 for one (perhaps they know and are taking advantage of this issue)Anyway, I would rather have an official Windows 10 upgrade but if I can't find a way
 I suppose I will have to install an android OS which would be a shame as I bought this with windows 10 in mind as I already have a windows phone and PC. So, is there a way to upgrade&nbsp; via a fresh install to a formatted drive instead of upgrading from 8.1 and
 still get an activated free upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thank you Andre this looks like the answer I'm looking for although I have found it impossible to back up my 8.1 (it says some files are missing) I have managed to get my Windows 8.1 key using Belarc Advisor which is a freebie which gives you the keys for
 anything on your PC that has a key, the only problem is I don't know if this is the Toshiba OEM key or my key but as this was originally Win 8 and I upgraded to 8.1 then perhaps it is my key. Tommorow I will back up what I can and take the gamble.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, am I right in thinking that because I am on windows 8 upgraded to 8.1 I need to download UPDATE: Build 10586 and I can then create a bootable usb drive using that build to fresh install windows 10 and then activate using my windows 8.1 product
 key. Do I need to do anything like register my intent beforehand.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I have come upon unforseen problems. I can get into boot select screen via The tablet "on" button and volume up at same time until boot select screen shows. My&nbsp; USB flash drive containing windows 10 shows and is selectable. I select and it
 takes me to the blue microsoft screen where you can select your country, keyboard language type etc. but unfortunately the touch screen is disabled I guess because I am not using OS and therefore drivers aren't in use.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have an old generic USB Hub. I connected the hub to the tablet and connected a USB keyboard and mouse to the hub and also the USB Flash drive containing the Windows 10 install and they all showed up and were useable in the boot select screen so
 I can select the drive containing windows 10 but (and I have tried this many times with all combinations of mouse and keyboard) but it wont take me to that keymoard and language select screen that I get with just the drive connected, instead I get the Toshiba
 boot screen and then, if I leave it long enough it gives BSOD and then the repair process.</p>
<p>So to sum up, I can get to the instalation menus with just the drive but can't inter act with the menu's because touch screen not working.</p>
<p>But when using the hub and any combo of mouse keyboard and flash drive containing Windows 10 it gives BSOD (eventually).</p>
<p>I have a wireless mouse/keyboard combo which I can try when I get some batteries for it tommorow but I don't see why it should be any&nbsp; different. The hub is not independantly powered so maybe if I can get one that is, then that might be helpfull but at this
 stage any suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks to all that have helped anyway. I appreciate it.</p>

            I have to say that I am in same situation like you are. If you've tried with mouse and keyboard already&nbsp;and you get BSOD, I am not sure if I should even try that. When I asked my manufacturer, they told me it's Microsoft bug because of November update
 and I should wait for their fix. They also assure me that Win10 should be upgradable on my tablet and tablet has 16GB flash memory, 32GB sd.&nbsp;I really want&nbsp;someone to&nbsp;confirm that it's a bug because this is the only post I have found that makes sense and the
 only situation I have found so far that makes it almost identical to mine. Have been looking for 3 days to find this.

            <p>Hi Greg Carmack. The image was created using windows media creation tool, can't wipe the disk as 8.1 must be on the PC being upgraded for activation purposes, this also excludes your other suggestions re installing to a different PC and deleting my OS via
 the repair process (this is a free upgrade from W8.1 I am doing). I have already said that I have tried every combo of mouse/keyboard that I have available except for a wireless mouse/keyboard combo that I need to get batteries for and that I may try to get
 a self powered hub as opposed to the one I am using which is powered via USB, thanks for the suggestions .</p>
<p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b5ed416b-6760-48b2-b50a-40eaf0349ad4" title="JankoA">

<p>By bsod I am referring to the blue screen windows takes you to when it fails to work properly. In my experience I have had this happen to me a few times in particular with an old PC that kept overheating and I actually suspect that this is what happened
 here. I goes in to the Toshiba boot screen just the same as when just the drive was connected but when the hub is connected it then goes into one of those situations where it keeps trying but for some reason is unable to complete a process and so overheats
 or just goes to blue because it can't boot. I'm pretty sure no long term damage was done because it still works with W8.1 just as before.
</p>
<p>Also I looked into Andre Da Costa's suggestion to you <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>jankoa but you should be aware that the fix he is referring to only applies to people upgrading from "Windows 10 to Windows 10 Nov. update" and not to people upgrading from "windows 8.1 to windows 10" like myself.</p>
<p>I'm going to get batteries and try the wireless keyboard/mouse I have, other than that I'm stumped.</p>

            <p>Yes, well I did a bit more research. I have Win8.1 as well and I want to upgrade to Win10. After finally finding some proper information, I realized that my 16GB tablet has WIM on it self. Which means that it has hidden 4GB that is reserved for compressed
 version of Win8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the&nbsp;reason why I can't upgrade it to Win10. I can't find link for the article since I'm on work and I have&nbsp;pasted it to my brother yesterday. This is what it said in article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>We’re working on bringing upgrade to low capacity devices.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The reason Windows 8.1 devices using WIMBOOT are not yet able to upgrade to Windows 10 is because many of the WIMBOOT devices have very limited system storage. That presents a challenge when we need to have the Windows 8.1 OS, the downloaded install
 image, and the Windows 10 OS available during the upgrade process. We do this because we need to be able to restore the machine back to Windows 8.1 if anything unexpected happens during the upgrade, such as power loss. In sum, WIMBOOT devices present a capacity
 challenge to the upgrade process and we are evaluating a couple of options for a safe and reliable upgrade path for those devices.</em></p>
<p>Now I know that I should not brute force it with clean install.</p>

            Had the same problem on my Alienware. Stopped at 0% due to unspecified error. Clean Boot and Disabling Starter Applications (save for Microsoft ones) both failed to solve the problem. Just deleted WebSetup and it is now functioning. Hoping it goes all
 the way to 100% because I have seen people report problems at 30% and 87%. Wish me luck!
<div><br />
<div>Deleting WebSetup in your AppData folder definitely helps!</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>EDIT: Success, deleting WebSetup allowed me to upgrade with no problem.</b></div>

<h2>            Problems playing and ripping CDs in WMP, Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm trying to play some CDs that I burned a long time ago (in windows media player), and now windows media player won't even play them! I have windows 10 now and pretty sure I had windows 7 at the time I burned them, possibly xp for the older ones... I
 keep getting this error <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or a required codec might not be installed on your computer."</span>&nbsp; The files are CD audio tracks (.cda
 files) which WMP is supposed to support... and when i check the default app associated with this type of file, it's WMP. But for some reason it won't read them... But the PowerDVD program that came with my computer will play them fine, but I can't figure out
 how to rip them in that program... Also not sure if it means anything, but all the files say 1kb in size. Which seemed a little odd to me... I could really use some help, I have a lot of old music I made that I would really like to back up, but am having a
 lot of trouble... any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

            Hey MDK,
<br />
<br />You're right, Windows Media Player is supposed to support .CDA files. Maybe this is something you should report to the Feedback Hub (Windows key + F), since the only workaround I can think of is using third party software.
<br />
<br />If you're able to provide a link to your newly created feedback, I can upvote it at least. I'd like for Microsoft to look into your issue. Let me know.

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thank you for you reply.</p>
<p>I had already seen that post in technet but there are some problems with that approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I have to create a new volume in storage spaces (he created a mirrored volume which implies having even number of disks and I have 3 disks). I don't know if creating a simple volume will do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second he says we have to move all data to the new volume. In my case we are talking of 10TB+ of data and I have roughly 3TB free space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating a simple volume and after moving (cut and paste) some folders I get the message saying not enough space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my case this is not doable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't mind loosing the 0,05% data and force that disk removal but I can't find a way to do it.</p>
<p>So its stuck in "preparing for removal" and if I disconnect that disk it says Lost communication and I have the option to remove it but if I try to remove I get an error saying I have to add another disk, I have already done that and still cant remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already tried with cmdlets thru power shell to remove it, it says running and shows the graphic bar going up and down but never ends.</p>
<p>I have to close Power Shell and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for some reason the process got stuck and now I am stuck...</p>
<p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem. Took me a bit to figure it out. Windows told me that the drive is degraded so I removed it. In my case it was because there were bad sectors forming. I was stuck on 2%. Windows is trying to move data located on bad sectors to the
 other drives in the array. I simply cloned the drive I needed to remove to a healthy one, plugged it back in and finally I was able to remove the failing disk. Or should I say "the now healthy disk"? But at least it wasn't stuck anymore.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>What backup utility are you using?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>This could be Volume Shadow Copy service and SPP
 services are not started.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>To restart the Volume Shadow Copy service and
 SPP services </span></p>
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Administrative Tools.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Double-click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the SPP service is disabled, double-click it to open the service properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If Volume Shadow Copy service is double-click it to open the service properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Startup type list, click Automatic (Delayed Start), and then click Apply.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under Service status, click Start.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using
 a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><span>Note: After troubleshooting, make sure the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the
 above KB article.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Event logs are special files that record significant
 events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur, Windows records the event in an event log that you can read by using Event Viewer</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>To view the Event:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Applications and Services Logs vary. They include
 separate logs about the programs that run on your computer, as well as more detailed logs that pertain to specific Windows services.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Event Viewer.‌ If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the
 password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click an event log in the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Connect Local XBOX Profile To Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I am struggling to find a way to connect my daughter's local XBOX profile to her Microsoft account.&nbsp; A small bit of history - my daughter has been playing games on our XBOX 360 for a number of years, but we have always used a local profile for a number
 of reasons.&nbsp; In the past year I setup a Microsoft account which we use to control her activity on a Windows 10 computer.&nbsp; I have also been adding a number of avatar 'goodies' to her Microsoft account but she has not been able to use them yet as the account
 is not connected to the XBOX profile.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I now want to have the Microsoft account connected to her local XBOX profile.&nbsp; We don't want her to lose achievements, saves or anything else on the XBOX but want to have the local XBOX profile and the Microsoft account become one and the same.&nbsp; I am sure
 this is easy, but I am struggling to find how to accomplish this.&nbsp; Directions to make this happen would be greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please follow these steps,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Only a parent using the Microsoft family group feature can change Xbox privacy and online safety settings for a child account. If you're having trouble changing your child's settings, make sure your Microsoft account is a parent
 account in a family group. See whether you're listed as a child or an adult in a family group by signing in at account.microsoft.com/family. To change your child's settings:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both for your prompt responses, but I suspect I was unclear in my original post.&nbsp; I have the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Online Microsoft Account not related to any XBOX gamertag.</li><li>Local XBOX profile with no online gamertag as it is only local to the single XBOX 360.</li></ul>
<p>The plan is to have the local XBOX profile be connected to the Microsoft account.&nbsp; I am unable to follow HFAI's suggestion as it looks to be based on already having an online XBOX profile.&nbsp; I am not looking to transfer anything - I just want to have the
 local XBOX account connected to a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many years ago I was able to take my local XBOX profile and connect it to my Microsoft account, but the process I followed at that time no longer works.&nbsp; I thought I could simply be in the local profile on the XBOX and then choose to sign into the Microsoft
 account, but I do not see the option to do that though I could be missing it.&nbsp; While I noted the child details, I don't believe this&nbsp;<em>connection
</em>has any relation to child or parent Microsoft accounts as it should just be having an XBOX account that I then log into the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clears things up a bit and thanks for the quick responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

 it is not possible to turn an offline account into an online child account. Since you've already created an online account that is used on Windows it would already have an Xbox account attached, you would not be able to use that to connect to an offline account
 either since it's already an account (hence the information about transferring and merging accounts). So your child would need to either continue using the account she has now, or use the new account that has already been created but she would have to start
 over. </p>

            Thanks, I've found that upgrading by going through the Microsoft App store it is slightly less expensive than other routes.

<h2>            Unable to sign in android 6.0.1. skype version 7.32.0.490</h2>
                    Hi, half an hour ago, after I've finished a skype call the app dropped me out. When I tried to sign in again, I receive the Unable to sign in message. I stopped the app and restarted, it did not help. I'm still not able to sign in on my Samsung while I'm
 using the skype desktop app on win 10 without any problem.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Danida_U,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I acknowledge receipt and thank you for your assistance and answer but, my situation is a different of your answer were approached above, b'cause as I mentioned earlier my Android version is 4.1.1 and Skype version 4.5. As well as I can say that these bundle
 was working till about the middle of last week. </p>
<p>One note about my Android version: I couldn't upgrade the version, b'cause the manufacturer stoped the support long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards: BK</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>The original poster's Android version as per the subject of the post is Android&nbsp;6.0.1 wherein the new Skype on Mobile is available for download. However, if you are still using Skype for Android v.4.5 this is already an outdated Skype version. Unsupported
 and outdated versions might experience issues with signing in, calling, messaging or the over-all performance of the application. The&nbsp;latest version of Skype for Android for Android OS 5 below is v.7.46</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per Skype's <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=system+requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system requirements</a></strong>, you should still be able to download the most compatible
 version of Skype for Android which is v.7.46, but if your manufacturer is the one putting restrictions on the services you can avail on the device, Skype does not have any control for that anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best advice that I can suggest is to upgrade the Android version of your device, however, if your manufacturer has retired support for it already,&nbsp;you might want to consider investing on a different device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.&nbsp;</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p>
</p><blockquote>A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />
Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />
Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment <br />
Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart <br />
Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) <br />
Log in once Windows starts in safe mode <br />
<br />
Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system <br />
<br />
B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />
1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />
OR <br />
2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />
C. Last option could be Reset this PC. <br />
In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files.
<br />
All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled. <br />
<br />
Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            <p>Both operating systems will run 'about the same' on such a processor. &nbsp;10 may even run better than 8.1 in some ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 would be much cheaper right now (free) . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you do - make a full system image backup of each machine before upgrading - so you have a CLEAN and FAST way to revert back to EXACTLY where you were before the upgrade in case you do not like it or the performance.</p>

<h2>            Problem with Live Apps</h2>
                    <p>The live apps on my Windows 10 install are viewing incorrectly. The colors of the the live tiles appear blackened and are darker than the set accent color. The icons of live apps are also pixelated. Furthermore, some of the live apps have show blackened
 boxes. The problem is not limited to one windows live app but appears in multiple apps, suggesting that this is a problem with how live apps are rendered by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following are pictures supporting this. The red boxes are not part of the problem by the way.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately, uninstalling the driver did not work. My laptop has two graphics cards, an Intel HD Graphics 4600 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760M. Windows 10 drivers were not available for both from the manufacturer website (ASUS). I
 installed the Windows 10 drivers for both from the respective card manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be with the Intel HD Graphics 4600. Disabling this adapter from the device manager resolves the graphics issues I've mentioned. However this also removes the ability to change the screen brightness and put the computer to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the driver, however, Windows reinstalls a new driver upon restart, and the same problems persist. I also tried to rollback the driver, which led to my computer screen having frequent short blackouts (accompanied with a notification sound
 that a device was unplugged/plugged into the PC). I also tried to download the latest driver from Intel. Installing this driver also does not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I have PC functionality by disabling the Intel graphics adapter and relying on the NVIDIA adapter. However I also do not have functionality to adjust screen brightness and put the computer to sleep.</p>

            I think you should be able to clear up these errors with the right information.&nbsp; I believe I found a fix for the Security Center errors a few months ago.&nbsp; I will have to look through my notes to make sure.&nbsp; I am dealing with the same 2 errors for&nbsp;the Immersive
 Shell and Runtime Broker issues.&nbsp; I have changed the properties for Immersive Shell and PerAppRuntimeBroker to give myself activation privileges multiple times without eliminating the errors.&nbsp; These errors were occurring in Windows 10 Version 1809 and possibly
 earlier.&nbsp; I am now on 1903 and they are still occurring.&nbsp; I have not yet found a solution.&nbsp; If I find my notes on the other errors, I will post them here.

If anyone is not having problems with Windows 10 downloads, it can only be because they never log on.&nbsp; If you do log on, the best thing to do, in view of the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, which is a bit more Critical than most, the best thing to do would be to
 install another operating system while you can still log into your computer user account, because in this case you can install without the need for a bootable flash drive or disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For more information, check out the Update page in the sweetdreamsinc.net Visual Studio site project, which you can currently download at this address - sweetdreamsinc.net.temprary-domain.com.&nbsp; How long the site will be available at that address is inknown
 at the moment.&nbsp; Today is 11-06-2019.</p>
<p>
If you are using another operating system, make sure you turn off automatic installation of downloads.</p>

</p><p>I have a similar error after updating&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro on my laptop. I see these errors when I try to connect to VPN using UI on the taskbar (network icon near the clock icon on the taskbar) in Event Viewer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</p>
<p>{2593F8B9-4EAF-457C-B68A-50F6B8EA6B54}</p>
<p>&nbsp;and APPID&nbsp;</p>
<p>{15C20B67-12E7-4BB6-92BB-7AFF07997402}</p>
<p>&nbsp;to the user HomeDesctop\User SID (S-1-5-21-2365256478-1039703005-3152255673-1001) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services
 administrative tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to add Local Activation permission for the COM Server application. It doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a new interface to connect to VPN: Start-Settings-Network&amp;Internet-VPN. It works.</p>

            I am experiencing the same errors and they&nbsp;are logged right before my laptop freezes so there's no option but to hard crash it. I've found this connection in community reports from 2012 and earlier, so just ignoring it isn't necessarily an option.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure out which applications are triggering the error since the proposed solution is to reset their permissions and I don't want to give higher access to some random app.&nbsp;
