<p>The defrag reports lists files that cannot be defragmented - is that what you are talking about and what are the names of the files?</p>
<p>Did you click the View Report button?<br />
<br />
If you are running low on disk space the Windows defragmenter may have difficulty defragmenting your HDD.&nbsp; XP needs 15% of the total HDD capacity to run properly (you would get an informative message if you don't have enough room).<br />
<br />
The XP defragmenter cannot defrag files that are in use (like the registry files, event logs, pagefile.sys, etc), so they may show up as fragmented files in the defrag report.&nbsp; These files must be defragmented before XP loads up all the way and starts to use
 those files.</p>
<p>The correct answer for you depends on what the report says. &nbsp;Usually, the reported files are registry files, event logs and the pagefile.<br />
<br />
On a healthy system it is certainly possible to have zero fragmented files (according to the XP report). &nbsp;One way is to use PageDefrag.&nbsp; It does not always mean you will suddenly see more free space on your HDD though, so don't let your expectations exceed
 reality when you get to zero defragmented files and still have no more free space.</p>
<p>If the files handled by PageDefrag are not the files you see in the report, you need to tell us what files you see or copy/paste your report back here. &nbsp;You can also check out some free third party defragmenting tools. &nbsp;The built in one is okay, but the
 some others are prettier and make you feel better when they are done. &nbsp;If you install a third part tool, sometimes that will break the built in XP one (you can easily fix it though), so make your choices wisely after some research.<br />

<h2>            Locking a Console to prevent new profiles&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is there an option I can set somewhere that will not allow any new profiles to be created or any profiles to be recovered via live?&nbsp; I have an original elite console if it matters (but I doubt).</p>

<p>Obviously I want this NOT to be permenant but want to disable the features until I decide to re-enable them.&nbsp; I also don't want to prevent any existing profiles from being logged into (both local and live).</p>

<p>Odd, get an error on the url when I click on it but when I paste it into a new tab, it works. &nbsp;Meh.</p>
<p>Checked it out Danno but it allows local profile creation but prevents new live accounts. &nbsp;Will have to test recovery later. &nbsp;Have to move one of my profiles off and then try to recover it back.</p>
<p>But, thanks for the starting point though!</p>

<p><span>I hadn't heard about the feature until I saw somebody asking about it... they weren't sure if recovery was prevented since the doc didn't mention it, and somebody else confirmed it.<span>
 It seems odd that local profiles can still be created, but it does say "Live membership creation" not "profile creation", so clearly the distinction is important. I don't know what the goal is here, but with local profiles somebody could end up with saved
 games on various local profiles and cause confusion, I guess.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sorry about the error in the link; I had trouble with the link editing and didn't confirm it... There was a '/' missing.<br />

<p>The goal is to prevent any new profiles, live or not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a &nbsp;"Anyone1" and "Anyone2" pair of profiles for general use and I don't care if they change the avatars or gamer pics as thats what I made them for. &nbsp;But it seems like every time one of the 4 granddaughters has someone over, they make a profile. &nbsp;Its
 to the point I have 40+ profiles and its taking longer and longer when you hit the (X) menu and it starts loading/counting profiles before you can actually log in. &nbsp;Many &nbsp;are one time profiles and I delete them but I would like to restrict the creation in
 the first place.</p>
<p>The girls know but they seem to forget in the excitement of having friends stay over and such.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anywhere to block local profiles to be created as thats what they are creating. &nbsp;To be honest, the parental controls seems VERY lack luster in its ability to restrict common things, such as which profiles can get into memory management to
 delete things, create profiles (local or otherwise), etc. &nbsp;From just tinkering last night, the parental controls section seems like its there simply in name only so MS can claim the XBOX has it.</p>

<h2>            access of flash drive denied</h2>
                    My laptop is running Windows 10 and I was suddenly denied access to one of my flash drives. I can access other drives.

            Hi Becky,
<br />
<br />Have you tried the flash drive in another non-Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />What exact message are you getting when you try to access that Flash Drive?

<h2>            input not supported</h2>
                    Even after I tried rebooting with safe mode I can't get the "input not supported" off and the resolution back to where it should be.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?

<p><span>Hi Hannah1063,</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur if the resolution was set&nbsp;way too high for the monitor to support.
</span></p>
<p><span>In this case you may first try to
<strong>disable display card in BIOS or remove it</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>You may check the system manufacturer’s manual to get in touch with the system manufacturer for information on how to do the changes
 in BIOS.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>:
 Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>
 If this is a recent issue, then you may try performing <strong>System Restore</strong> booting from Windows Vista full version Disc.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Insert the
<strong>installation disc</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;<strong>Restart
</strong>your computer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;Click the
<strong>Start button</strong>, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If your computer is not configured to start from a
 CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;Choose your
<strong>language settings</strong>, and then click<strong> Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp;Click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;Select the
<strong>operating system</strong> you want to repair, and then click<strong> Next</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. On the
<strong>System Recovery Options</strong> menu, click <strong>System restore</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>8. &nbsp;In the System Restore dialog box, click
<strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click <strong>Next.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>9. In the list of restore points, click
<strong>a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue</strong>, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>10. Click Finish</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful</span></span></p>

<h2>            Game Bar says &#34;Sorry, this PC doesn&#8217;t meet the hardware requirements for recording clips.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to get a screenshot of it, but whenever I click record lat 30 seconds, it says&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry, this PC doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for recording clips."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel Core i5</p>
<p>Ram: 8 gb</p>
<p>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GT 1030</p>

<br />
Yes you may need all the versions 2005, 2008, and 2010 for either x86&nbsp;(32 bit) or 64 bit<br />
depending on which version of Windows you are running. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hello Robin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this inquiry to our attention here on the forums. I recommend you look in the store and search Audio CD Player App. This app will play audio CD's for music but I'm not 100% certain it would play all file formats such as MP4 but it is
 definitely worth a try. Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>

    <title>Why does Xbox ban the Confederate flag profile picture&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duplexfuzzball  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Xbox ban the Confederate flag profile picture&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Im not really sure why Xbox live is so intent on banning my Confederate flag profile picture. I strongly support southern heritage and it's kind of annoying that they'll ban something like this. They're basically telling a lot of people with Southern Heritage that they can't express themselves just because a couple of people think the the flag is a symbol of racism.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Dont you think that with cause problems? Saying that anything that offends someone will be ban? I see alot of LGBT profile pictures...what if that offends me? Will they all get banned? You cant ban an American flag...that americans fought and died for...but
 not ban a rainbow flag or LGBT on profiles...</p>

<p>343 and Microsoft Studios,</p>

<p><span>I love it how your company states, they care about the consumer and wish to make it right. Never once, in the forums, have I seen any response back from you guys&nbsp;</span><span>on</span><span>&nbsp;the Xbox Forums. Instead your halo waypoint site has been
 how can I put this professionally, extremely unhelpful and a complete waste of my time. I am &nbsp;doing what I now have to do and filing a formal better business bureau complaint against 343 and Microsoft Studios.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All of this could of been avoided, if they did a beta and tested the server integrity/stress test. This is my six Xbox Live&nbsp;</span><span>accounts</span><span>, because of having unauthorized access. I am a die hard Halo fan and quite frankly, disgusted
 how these patches are just band aids don't work. I think it's best and you may not agree, fix the problems and until then, don't allow multi player matchmaking. I&nbsp;</span><span>just want</span><span>&nbsp;to play a game, team be balanced, not disconnected and bought
 the game, to reminisce the good old days playing multi player or</span><span>LAN</span><span>&nbsp;with friends. I just want the game to be fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>I did notice an improvement of match making by uninstalling and reinstalling the game. I posted in the forums my steps, to help out with getting the updates/patches to work better. I&nbsp;</span><span>still, unfortunately</span><span>, can't keep my party
 in the same lobby when searching for games. Does anyone else agree that 23 days later and still having significant problems is getting to be ridiculous?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I agree completely, we shouldn't get a Halo 5 Guardians a free copy. Halo fans should caution, asking for a free&nbsp;</span><span>games,&nbsp;</span><span>as this may threaten the final product completeness. Losing profits out of a company, means cuts
 have&nbsp;</span><span>to be made</span><span>, which in the gaming world means campaign line shortened, more glitches, and overall final product to be a lesser version than intended. In speaking with using this game, as an example end result unfinished game, Halo:
 The Master Chief Collection for Xbox One.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I think a good compromise is the following: more maps remastered for&nbsp;</span><span>a Halo 2 anniversary</span><span>, more playlists and different game types in the playlist bumper, constant server and patch updates. I don't believe, it is fair to punish
 a for the most part until now,&nbsp;</span><span>a reputable game</span><span>&nbsp;developing subsidiary of Microsoft. Please just fix the game and put into consideration, opportunities for improving the overall end product.</span></p>
<p><span><span>On a side note, campaigns to most gamers aren't what they bought the game for. If people just bought the game for campaigns, there wouldn't be: MMOs, Shooters, etc. and Xbox Live community. I buy the games and most do, to play the multiplayer
 with their friends and the Xbox Live community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I bought my first Xbox and Halo Combat Evolved to play Halo in&nbsp;</span><span>LAN</span><span>&nbsp;and when Xbox Live was available, played Halo 2 both for: mult iplayer enjoyment and competitive nature. Achievements mean nothing to me anymore,
 the real challenge and enjoyment comes from playing with the Xbox Live Community. Halo to me, I love and enjoy the multi player aspect, I could&nbsp;</span><span>care less</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>about</span><span>&nbsp;playing the campaigns and getting achievements.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Update: December 5, 2014</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I just played 10 multiplayer games with my friends in the party from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM. You might want to try this, which I did and it helped. Completely close out of the game, to do this you would need to click your three line button
 on your controller, while having the game selected on your home screen. Select the Quit feature, then either use voice command, "Xbox go to settings" or from the home page, click your three line button on your controller and&nbsp;</span><span>clock</span><span>&nbsp;settings.
 Go from settings and select system, then scroll to the right under storage, click clear local saved games.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span>This is your&nbsp;</span><span>choice</span><span>&nbsp;from what you from time to time, had to clear on the Xbox 360. All games except for Minecraft are saved&nbsp;</span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span>cloud</span><span>, therefore you are essentially cleaning
 temporary files that just bog down your system and are unnecessary. (Please note Minecraft doesn't save to the cloud, therefore you may want to put that game on an external drive, or&nbsp;</span><span>USB</span><span>&nbsp;approved Microsoft flash drive). Once you clear
 local saved games and click A, then let your console&nbsp;</span><span>, reboot from</span><span>&nbsp;there it will restart and remove any background items.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Load the Halo Master Chief edition, just as you normally would, then let the game sync to the full 100%. This should improve your overall matchmaking experience. I did from time to time, have to sign out completely from Xbox Live and Quit the
 Halo Master Chief Edition from time to time, but noticed a huge improvement. Teams were balanced,&nbsp;</span><span>the connection</span><span>was green, didn't kick the party in the game, and overall multi-player game connectivity and server performance improved.</span></span></p>

<p><span>You may also, want to try and change your player ID to R5T and RS5t for service tag. This use to be a command prompt and still works, to reset your&nbsp;</span><span>characters'</span><span>&nbsp;connection and your probability odds of being matched up with
 other players. This is what I have so far, which worked for my friends and me. I hope it works for the rest of you in the&nbsp;</span><span>meantime</span><span>, be patient clear and your local saved games. FYI, if you are host in a party change your player ID
 to G5T and GH5T for service tag. I have been getting in the habit of before starting the game, clearing my local saved games and starting out with player ID U51 and F1XM for service tag, which seems to help.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate all Halo fans comments and everyone's concerns. You might want to try my solutions, to improve the overall connection issues. I have been using my frustration and trying different things, to improve my overall experience and others.
 My friends can attest, that after I walked them through what I did above, it improved our overall multi player issues tremendously. What does 343, Microsoft studios and the Halo, community have to lose, if&nbsp;</span><span>anything, you</span><span>&nbsp;have everything
 to gain?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I think&nbsp;</span><span>though, and</span><span>&nbsp;this is my honest opinion and past experience, I for one have had no problems since uninstalling and&nbsp;re-installing&nbsp;my game until February 10, 2015. I then&nbsp;cleared my saved&nbsp;</span><span>game</span><span>&nbsp;data,
 then loaded the game.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If 343, Microsoft Studios, or Halo fans are skeptical, try it first and I might&nbsp;</span><span>be</span><span>&nbsp;able to help. Feel free to private message me for a game&nbsp;</span><span>invites</span><span>, or any questions. I ran into
 similar issues on Halo 3 and Halo 4, your best bet to have the patches and updates is clearing your saved games (cache on the Xbox 360).&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>To clarify. Clearing your local saved games on the system worked. It should restart your Xbox. Let it run its course and wait until it loads your Xbox home screen. Launch the Halo: Master Chief Collection. Let it load through the loading and title screens.
 Click the three line button and you should get a message: "Syncing data for Halo: The Master Chief Collection...". As I stated in the past, your saved games are saved on the cloud except for Minecraft Xbox One version, therefore you don't need the unwanted
 temporary saved game files.</p>
<p>I want to be clear before I did all this, myself and my friend completely uninstalled the game and reinstalled. This then allowed a 10.6 MB update and 1.4 GB update to load first. I still think a lot of people aren't unplugging their Ethernet and disconnecting
 their power cord, which by doing so completely shuts down and restarts your Xbox One.</p>
<p>Think of the Xbox One as the Xbox 360 operating system. To get the most recent patch or update, you had to clear your cache from time to time, or uninstall or reinstall the game/ downloadable content. There's an obvious update/ patch flaw and I tried everything
 these past couple of weeks. I noticed though since I uninstalled and reinstalled the game it has improved tremendously. I also force of habit, clear my local saved games everytime I go to play any game. Give it a shot, you aren't going to lose any achievements.</p>
<p>I am about to play now, if anyone wants to join my game. I already cleared my local saved games before starting Halo: The Master Chief Edition. Got my syncing game prompt and already playing with no problems.</p>

<p>Created another forums and offered through my own time and testing fixes for all multi player and campaign issues.</p>
<p><span>Update, I just played 10 multi-player games with my friends in the party from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM on December 4, 2014. You might want to try my tips and solution, which I did and it helped. You may also, want to try and change your player ID to R5T

 the like button on my posts. I would have no problem tomorrow, or this weekend playing with anyone interested. I have a few things to try and happy to share going forward.</span></p>
<p>Over the course of Thursday and Friday (December 4 and December 5, 2014) a total of 50+ multi player games. This includes the following: no lag, green connection, teams are balanced, party stays with you, party on same team. Clearing your local saved games
 works and letting it sync its data. I also have my friends using, player ID R5T, and service tag RS3T. That command code should reset lobbies and not harm the integrity of the game. FYI during end game carnage report, you have to let everyone else hit B, before
 the party leader does.</p>
<p><span>End December 5, 2014 through December 7, 2014 update</span></p>
<p><span>Update December 8, 2014</span></p>
<p>Update, I called Microsoft support and notified them of my solutions. I believe for it to take its full effect, you have to uninstall and reinstall the game. It's being pushed up the ladder and they are testing it. When you uninstall and reinstall the game,
 the updates and downloadable content should load first. Don't play campaign, or load the game while it is reinstalling. Let it take its course, it took me about three hours for it to totally install.</p>
<p>Once the download is complete, then go to your settings, then system, and clear your local saved games. Your console will restart. Wait until it takes you to the home screen. Load the game and from the start menu, hit your three lines button. You will get
 a message syncing game data, just let it reach 100%. From there click on campaign or multiplayer.</p>
<p>Note just like other Halos and games, if you don't find players found and joining game in 1 min to 5 min, back out and search again. My friends and party leaders, back out when searching all game modes and then go to back to the playlist. Also for the interim,
 change your player ID to R5T and service tag, RS3T (Unlocked after 50 missions or multiplayer matches). Those are command prompts, to improve your chances to get a match and best connection.</p>
<p>That's all I've for now, if anyone wants to play or has questions, just message me. I realize you may lose your saved games, but you'll be able to play multiplayer. Following will improve: Connectivity, Chances to find a match, Teams balanced, little or
 no lag, and makes the patches work. Just remember, to clear your local saved games before playing and you'll have the most recent patch or update. Hope it helps.</p>
<p>End December 8, 2014 update</p>
<p>Update December 11, 2014 update</p>
<p><span>I understand 343, Microsoft Studios and Halo fans are skeptical like I was at first. There are some obvious flaws to the game and those who have tried my solutions have reported it helped. If you have an Xbox One, I'll be more than happy to remove
 your skepticism and show you it works. Keep it professional and only trying to offer my incites and knowledge. I'm just trying to help.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Not everyone has the bandwidth to keep re-downloading Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Even if 343, Microsoft Studios or Halo fans have the disc, you're looking at like an additional 15 GB, and without (like me) around 60 GB. I have zero desire
 to pay an extra $10 when I go over on my bandwidth so I can see if your solution works. I also don't care to simply waste that much bandwidth next month hoping it works. This game should have shipped in a playable state. Microsoft really shot themselves in
 the foot with this. Just when they began salvaging their reputation, this shoots it down again. Its made even worse by the fact their not giving out refunds for their broken product.</span></span></p>
<p>Phantasystar77, I see where you are coming from. I only uninstalled and reinstalled once. I have stopped clearing my local saved games, as others who uninstalled the game and reinstalled the game and played reported that worked. Also I noticed something
 new, before I start the find a match or campaign playlist, I get a blue screen message, that says downloading content.</p>
<p>I believe that the original game install might have gotten corrupt on mine. Being there's no yellow message saying it is corrupt or way to view your content in your hard drive, or flash drive there's no way knowing for sure. I agree the game should of been
 publicly beta tested and stress test. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and is a huge problem.</p>
<p>I think more new people buying the game and having problems, downloading the updates and patches poses a problem too. If you want to not clear your local saved games, perhaps we can trouble shoot together? I can show you after uninstalling, clearing my local
 saved games, and running with certain Player IDs and service clan tags works.</p>
<p>Bottom line it is improving and have helped my friends out. My intention is not, to hurt the integrity game and I'm just reporting what worked for me. It would be nice, if Microsoft and 343 looked at my Xbox One activity and screen prints and run diagnostics
 why I've no issues. I just want to help you all get back to enjoying the game.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response and I'd be happy to play with you, if you want to run in a party. It works for me and those who've done the steps above, or some of the solutions. Hang in there and happy killing.</p>
<p>End December 11, 2014 update</p>
<p>Update December 12, 2014 update</p>
<p><span>I understand 343, Microsoft Studios and Halo fans are skeptical and I'd be happy to show you. View my clips and notice, how fast my game loads and I've no connection. Plus I also, have people in my party, on the same team, and great connection. Invitation
 still stands, if 343, Microsoft Studios or Halo fans want to party with me and remove your skepticism. This forum was intended to help people, not lead you astray. Just let me know when your free next and I'll show you firsthand, I do know what I'm talking
 about.</span></p>
<p><span>End December 12, 2014 update</span></p>
<p><span>Update December 20, 2014 update</span></p>
<p>I still am 99% sure that prior to the last update and patch for it to work right, you'll have to uninstall and reinstall the game just once. Once the game reinstalls, then try it and see, if it improves your Multi Player matchmaking and party issues.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then try to clear your local saved games. As I stated before, if you have Minecraft Xbox One, you'll lose your saved game data, because it doesn't save, to the cloud. You can however, purchase an external USB flash drive, or external
 hard drive and save your game data for Minecraft Xbox One on the flash drive or external drive.</p>
<p>Clearing your local saved games, should improve the matchmaking issues and campaign. Also I have for my player id, R5T and correction service clan tag, RS5T not RS3T or R3ST. It might just be me, my friends, and others seems to help improve matchmaking experience.
 Of course like you all, I am just an enthusiast and what works for me and my friends, might not work for others.</p>
<p>End December 20, 2014 update</p>
<p>Update December 24, 2014</p>
<p>Question: I don't think wiping out your saved games was the same as clearing the cache on the 360. Cache is a way to store data for faster access later. In other words it's not needed. Not the same as a save game file. Is that what you are telling people
 to wipe?</p>
<p>Answer: To clarify. Clearing your local saved games on the system worked. It should restart your Xbox. Let it run its course and wait until it loads your Xbox home screen. Launch the Halo: Master Chief Collection. Let it load through the loading and title
 screens. Click the three line button and you should get a message: "Syncing data for Halo: The Master Chief Collection...". As I stated in the past, your saved games are saved on the cloud except for Minecraft Xbox One version, therefore you don't need the
 unwanted temporary saved game files.</p>
<p>I want to be clear before I did all this, myself and my friend completely uninstalled the game and reinstalled. This then allowed a 10.6 MB update and 1.4 GB update to load first. I still think a lot of people aren't unplugging their Ethernet and disconnecting
 their power cord, which by doing so completely shuts down and restarts your Xbox One.</p>
<p>Think of the Xbox One as the Xbox 360 operating system. To get the most recent patch or update, you had to clear your cache from time to time, or uninstall or reinstall the game/ downloadable content. There's an obvious update/ patch flaw and I tried everything
 these past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>@Ephesians</p>
<p>Question: Why is my update taking a long time, isn't downloading, or is stuck at a certain percentage?</p>
<p>Answer: Try this, power off your Xbox One let it fully turn off, then unplug your Ethernet cord and Xbox power supply unit in the back of the Xbox One. Wait 30 seconds, or until light turns from white to orange, then plug your Ethernet and power supply in
 the back, then press your power button for the Xbox One. Your console will restart. This should fix the above problem you are experiencing.</p>
<p>@Ephesians</p>
<p>Question: What do I do, if clearing my cache (restarting my Xbox through above steps) and clearing my local saved games doesn't work?</p>
<p>Answer: Unfortunately, like I found out the hard way this happened to me, therefore I had to completely uninstall and reinstall the game. Ever since I did the following: uninstalled and reinstalled the game and cleared my local saved games, I've seen a significant
 improvement in my overall Campaign and Multi-player matchmaking experience.</p>
<p>What happened to mine, is it got corrupt when it was initially downloading, because I started to play the campaign, while the rest of the game was downloading. I can't not stress enough, YOU don't want to play the game while re-installing, if it's a downloaded
 copy, then play another game in the background, download it when your busy doing something else, but don't play the game while it is installing. If you have the disk like I do, then let it download in the background and play something else, watch tv, read
 a book, or play another application on Xbox One.</p>
<p>Once it's COMPLETELY done downloading, then clear your local saved games, just follow the steps above and it will walk you through painlessly as possible. Let your console restart, sign in to your Xbox One profile, and then load Halo Master Chief Collection
 from the home page, or my games and apps tab. Let it go through the beginning load screens, then click your three line button on your Xbox One controller. You will get a message, "Syncing data". Let it place you in the menu button, don't hit cancel. as it's
 installing the most recent patches, as it did so on the Xbox 360 after clearing cache.</p>
<p>@Ephesians</p>
<p>Question: If I go in and clean configurations saved games , the what will exactly be excluded from my hard drive? Will I lose all my saved games from other games?</p>
<p>Answer: All of your games save to the cloud except for, Minecraft Xbox One Version. I just checked last night after clearing my local saved games and my Halo 2 Legendary saved check point was still there. If you have Minecraft Xbox One, I wouldn't recommend
 clearing your local saved games, because it might delete your worlds, etc.</p>
<p>If you wish to avoid clearing your local saved games, then I believe what works best is uninstalling and re-installing. This would avoid clearing the local saved games for other games, that don't save to the cloud (Minecraft Xbox One Edition). I force of
 habit, just clear my local saved games everyone before launching any game. It is just like clearing cache on the Xbox 360. It's the best way to ensure you have synced and installed all the recent updates and patches.</p>
<p>@ Ephesians</p>
<p>Question: How long should I wait in lobby playlist selected before I back out?</p>
<p>Answer: Sit in the lobby for about 1 to 5 minutes, if you don't get a game, then back out by hitting the B button on your controller. You may want to force of habit for me, click on a playlist, then back out and do this for all the playlist, then select
 the playlist. If you still don't get a game, then quit the Halo Master Chief Collection game and load it again. If this doesn't fix the problem, then clear your local saved games and try it again.</p>
<p>Side note: Also, I tried every player id and service clan tag, I noticed and others, if you put R5T for player ID and service clan tag RS5T, it resets your connection and loads lobbies quicker after you clear your local saved games.</p>
<p>@Ephesians</p>
<p>Question: If I uninstall and re-install the game, do I have to unpin Halo Master Chief Collection from the home screen?</p>
<p>Answer: Go to your games and apps, then highlight Halo MCC. Click on your controller, the three line button and select manage game, it should give you an option to uninstall the game. Please note when you reinstall, it will prompt you for an update, and
 hit the A button to continue.</p>
<p>You don't have to remove the pin on the home page, but for it to work right, I can't stress enough importance, to not start the Halo MCC. I did this when I initially installed the game at launch and believe the game became corrupt. I am in the U.S.A. EST
 time and normally on my Xbox One in the evening. Hopefully this fixes the problems you are having and don't hesitate, to message me, if you have further questions.</p>

<p>Update December 26, 2014</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear you are having problems and it sounds frustrating! You might want to message on twitter @XboxSupport and they should be able to help. In the past, they've helped me tremendously!</p>
<p>It sounds to me from the forums posts and twitter posts, that it's a know issue and they are working on it. I hope Xbox Support is able to get that resolved for you. Disclaimer: I don't work for Microsoft, or 343 so it would be best, if my tips don't work
 for you to contact Xbox Support directly. Best of luck and I hope your issue gets resolved soon!</p>
<p>Is any other countries, having similar multiplayer issues like Japan? I am so sorry, that everyone is having problems. It must be extremely frustrating! I really hope those who are having issues, hopefully get them resolved by my tips, if you are still having
 issues, then reach out to Xbox Support, 343 directly. 343's Halo's twitter page is @Halo.</p>
<p><span>I just sent a twitter to @XboxSupport and there response was, "Sorry to hear they are experiencing issues and for the latest status, check the Halo Waypoint site</span></p>

<p>Update January 9, 2015</p>
<p>have one other thing, to try revolving fixing your connection and multiplayer issues. I noticed after you clear your local saved games, if the following doesn't work: quitting the game and rebooting, or clearing your cache (powering your Xbox off and unplugging
 the power supply in the back.</p>
<p>First after clearing your local saved games, load the game up and let it sync Data to 100%. Hit your Xbox guide button (white x), then with the game window highlighted, hit the three lines button on your controller. Select Quit, then go to My Games &amp; Apps.
 Highlight Halo The Master Chief Collection, then hit your three lines button, then hit Manage Game. Scroll using your left thumbstick, to SAVED DATA and select Delete from everywhere. Then load the game up.</p>
<p>Please note this will erase your saved data and you will lose your Campaign progress. It will however, make the following improve: finding a match quicker, most recent patch update, or at least it did for me.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a Xbox, Microsoft employee, 343, or Bungie. This is intended to be helpful, if these don't work for you, then it could be a one off problem. You may want to message Xbox Support on twitter @XboxSupport, or 343 @Halo. I am deeply sorry
 you are having problems and here to help. Don't hesitate to private message me, or send me a tweet. My twitter is @eph3s1ans, or search @EpH3s1aNs. I generally respond fairly quickly. If you are wanting to play with me message me at my gamer tag EpH3s1aNs.

<p>My contact information is located in that forum post. I also provided my thoughts on the beta Content Update so far. It appears to be doing good, so far I will continue to test it. I was selected by 343 and Microsoft to test this coming soon Content Update.</p>
<p>Wondering how I got selected? I am apart of the Xbox Preview Program and opted in to beta test updates and upcoming approved games. You have to be invited to the program by others who are in the preview program, or selected by Microsoft. Once you are approved
 and download the preview program dashboard, then you do the following: fill out surveys, offer feedback, feedback application, to screen print your screen when problems arise, and in this case install the Content Update before it gets released to the masses.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with either: Microsoft, 343, or Xbox Support. I do work for a different company in the banking business. I have tested games in the past and in specific Halo and Rainbow Six franchise. I am a problem solver by nature and going
 to school, to get a degree in this gaming/technology field. I have been playing video games since I have been 5 years old and now 29 years old. I do know for a fact, Halo and Microsoft products.</p>
<p>I am here to solely help, please keep your posts professional before posting. Thank you for your time. Hang in there and I am seeing improvement overall so far with this Content Update.</p>
<p>Good morning all interested parties. Yesterday from 3:00 PM to 6:35 PM I tested out the new content update, which will be rolling out to the masses in the near future. Here is actual facts about my experience yesterday with the beta content update.</p>
<p>Waiting for games: On average to join session... 1.5 minutes. Players found and establishing connection... 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Xbox Live Party Chat: Friends able to stay in no lag.</p>
<p>Halo Party System: Worked great and was able to do the following: with odd team members (3 friends), remain in party, teams balanced, 2.5 minutes waiting/finding game, and remained connected. Tested ability to remain in party and connected to party host,
 if backing out and bringing party, and this actually worked.</p>
<p>Connection: My connection overall was no lag and no ping showing, which worked out real well, friends connection was the same. I did have an red lobby in Halo 4 playlist, however that was, because there was two individuals cheating/modding/hacking, which
 complaint filed.</p>
<p>Bullet registry: It was pretty solid, but had hard time registering headshots and body kills on Halo 4 playlist.</p>
<p>Hit markers: I noticed significant improvement, to the lesser hit markers and able to get my kills.</p>
<p>Teams balanced: Overall each game started with balanced players, and my party stayed on same team.</p>
<p>Playlist that were quickest to load: Team Slayer, Team Hardcore, Swat, Big Team, and Halo 3.</p>
<p>Fixes that need to be made:</p>
<p>Halo 4 playlist: Connection wasn't good red pinged. Took over 5+ minutes to find a match. Grenades would not register, had hard time registering head shots, please see my file share on Skyline. Playlist needs work.</p>
<p>Team Halo 2 Anniversary: Had to back out twice and stuck on Joining session..., then backed out and stuck on players found..., thus it took 5+ minutes to find a match. This needs fixed.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is my observation so far, please Microsoft and 343 fix the flaws in the game I identified. If anyone wants to run with me and test out my beta content update, then feel free to do so. I am not an Microsoft, or 343 employee, however I have
 been playing Halo since the original Xbox and PC version. If there is one thing I do know is Halo games and their command prompts and performance flaws.</p>
<p>I will keep everyone posted, but so far I am about 4.5 stars out of 10 satisfied with this beta content update. There is no release date just yet, but through my feedback I hope things that are flawed gets fixed. Please and thank you for the opportunity.</p>

<p>This is what I have concluded so far in my testing. I hope this is helpful to 343 and Microsoft, so this issues, problems, and testing results can be pushed up the ladder.</p>
<p>End February 6, 2015 update</p>
<p>February 8, 2015 update</p>
<p>2/8/2015 Beta test new content update feedback and thoughts:</p>
<p>Good morning all interested parties. Between the following dates: February 4, 6, 7 and this morning I tested out the new content update. This is only available to selected players under the Xbox Preview Dashboard and updates program and will be rolling out
 to the masses in the near future. Here is actual facts about my experience with the beta content update compiled from these dates.</p>
<p>Waiting for games: On average to join session... 3-10 minutes. Players found and establishing connection... 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Xbox Live Party Chat: Friends not able to hear, stay in party, or game.</p>
<p>Halo Party System: Didn't work great and was not able to do the following: with even team members (2 friends), remain in party chat couldn't, teams were balanced in lobby, 4 to 10 minutes waiting/finding game, failed to connect, joining session and when
 we did find a lobby, couldn't remain connected. Tested ability to remain in party and connected to party host, if backing out and bringing party, and this didn't function properly, it dropped my friend and migrated host.</p>
<p>Connection: My connection overall was no lag and no ping showing, which worked out real well, friends connection was the same. I did have an yellow ping lobby in Halo 4 playlist, which had to do with person picked to host, they were dropped and host migrated.</p>
<p>I did the following trouble shooting in this order: 1) Hit the Xbox Guide button on controller, 2) Hit the three lines window button on controller, 3) Highlight and selected quit feature, 4) Started game back up. This didn't fix my connection issues, dropping
 parties, failure to connect in lobbies and longer times to find matches.</p>
<p>I then did the following connection trouble shooting: 1) Signed out of my Xbox live account on the Xbox One, 2) Powered off from hitting power button and holding power button until it completely turned off, 3) Unplugged my ethernet chord, 4) Unplugged my
 power supply unit completely, 5) Waited 45 seconds, then plugged back chords including: ethernet and power supply unit chord, 6) Powered Xbox One up, 7) Waited until home screen loaded, 8) Cleared my local saved games, 9) Waited until console restarted, 10)
 Waited until home screen loaded, 11) Signed into my Xbox live account, 12) Loaded Halo: The Master Chief Collection from home screen. This didn't help with unable to connect, getting kicked from parties, and losing friend when we finally found a game.</p>
<p>I then did the following: 1) Quit the game completely, 2) Went to settings, 3) Went to Network tab, 4) Checked Nat Type: Open check, 5) Current Network Status and Xbox Live status All services are available check, 6) Test Network Connection It's all good
 check, 7) Testing Multiplayer Connection It's all good check, 8) Detailed Network Statistics following: Download speed, 22.48 Mbps; Upload speed, 2.27 Mbps; Packet loss 0%; MTU 1480; Latency 99 ms check. I &nbsp;ran diagnostics on my router checked out fine, then
 unplugged, reset and tried again. I concluded it had something to do with the actual Halo: The Master Chief Collection game servers and patches on 343's end.</p>
<p>Overall game experience</p>
<p>Bullet registry: It was pretty solid, but had hard time registering headshots on Halo 4 playlist.</p>
<p>Hit markers: I noticed significant improvement, to the lesser hit markers and able to get more kills.</p>
<p>Teams balanced: Overall each game started with balanced players, and my party stayed on same team. This was evident on February 4, 2015 and February 6 until 4:30 PM. Between the hours of 6:30 PM to 9:40 PM, I only got to play 1 game with friend, then the
 rest we lost connection, couldn't join session, failed to connect and searching for playlist. We attempted several times to back out and try again.</p>
<p>Playlist that were quickest to load: Team Slayer, Halo 3, Big Team, Swat and Halo 4.</p>
<p>Fixes that need to be made:</p>
<p>Halo 4 playlist: Connection wasn't good red pinged. Took over 5+ minutes to find a match. Head shots and body shots at time would not register. I had hard time registering kills, please see my file shares. Playlist needs work.</p>
<p>Team Halo 2 Anniversary: Had to back out 4+ times and stuck on Joining session..., then backed out and stuck on players found..., thus it took 5+ minutes to find a match. This needs fixed.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is my observation so far, please Microsoft and 343 fix the flaws in the game I identified. If anyone wants to run with me and test out my beta content update, then feel free to do so. I am not an Microsoft, or 343 employee, however I have
 been playing Halo since the original Xbox and PC version. If there is one thing I do know is Halo games and their command prompts and performance flaws.</p>
<p>I will keep everyone posted, but so far I am about 4 stars out of 10 satisfied with this beta content update. I feel terrible, that it was working fine from January 26, 2015 through February 6, 2015 but now it is getting progressively worse. Please view
 my file shares, screen prints, data, and twitter posts for more details. It was very frustrating from February 7 through morning of 8, 2015 to have the following issues: server connectivity issues, failed to connect, longer wait times on average 8 to 20 minutes,
 inability to remain in party, inability to hear each other talk and unable to stay connected.</p>
<p>It definitely felt like yesterday evening and this morning, there was a negative decrease in performance and server connectivity.</p>
<p>I realize there &nbsp;is no release date just yet, but through my feedback I hope things that are flawed gets fixed. I am not sold in this beta Content Update, just yet and if anything it has digressed since February 4, 2015. Please don't take this as talking
 negative to the game, but there are some huge issues that need resolved in a timely manner. Please put my thoughts into action, fix the problems, and thank you for the opportunity.</p>
<p>*Correction to be made; Teams balanced: Overall each game started with balanced players, and my party stayed on same team. This was evident on February 4, 2015 and February 6 until 4:30 PM. On February 7, 2015 from the hours of 6:30 PM to 9:40 PM, I only
 got to play one game with friend, then the rest we lost connection, couldn't join session, failed to connect and searching for playlist. We attempted several times to back out and try again.</p>

<p>February 19, 2015 Last Beta Content Update post</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection was working great for the multi player on February 9. 2015, however, since this date, how could I put this, Halo (she) has been extremely temperamental and extremely moody. Since February 15, 2015, the game has had nothing
 but problems for me and my friends, while playing the multi player. For starters, it took over 10+ minutes to find a game, then when we found a game, it's either got stuck on searching for players, or failed to connect.</p>
<p>During the duration of hour in a half on February 15, 2015, I had problems remaining connected with my friend at a party, not to mention, while in the party my friend and I had difficulty hearing each other, but tried a different game, party and party chat
 worked great. When we did find a game, the connection was extremely large, kept migrating to host, at times stuck in limbo waiting for map to generate and stuck waiting in the lobby for the game to start. &nbsp;After patiently clearing our local saved games, three
 attempts to restart our xbox one console, unplugging, then resetting router, all attempts were futile and we gave up.</p>
<p>During the duration of hour in a half on February 15, 2015, I had problems remaining connected with my friend at a party, not to mention, while in the party my friend and I had difficulty hearing each other, but tried a different game, party and party chat

<p>During the duration of two hours February 15, 2015, I had problems remaining connected with my friend at a party, not to mention, while in the party my friend and I had difficulty hearing each other, but tried a different game, party and party chat works
 great. When we did find a game, the connection was great, but, at times stuck in limbo waiting for map to generate, which took over 10+ minutes and stuck waiting in the lobby for the game to start. We initially before starting the game cleared our local saved
 games, restarted our xbox one consoles, unplugged, then reset router, after continuously, losing each other, failed to connect, teams unbalanced and being put on different teams we called it a night.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the game worked perfectly on February 9, 2015 and since then has had nothing, but problems. It leads me to believe that my beta content update since February 9, 2015 has been removed and I'm quite frankly putting it lightly, irritated that
 it gradually gets worse, then better. I have zero confidence in future content updates going forward, because for starters 343 isn't listening to the consumers, which are identifying the problems and it seems as, if they are giving up on this game.</p>
<p>I find this to be upsetting, until the new content update gets released, I'm not going to spend time on it, if that day Halo is being temperamental. I am extremely disappointed in the turnaround time for the content updates to be released and 343's inability
 to within their company, identify the problems and fix them. I would definitely rate this launch, as the biggest plunder to date in Microsoft's Xbox consoles game releases. In a perfect world, going forward, 343 would learn from its mistakes, attack the issues
 head on in a scrum management project development and fix this game already.</p>

<p>Twitter posts February 21, 2015 to 343 and Microsoft studios</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/eph3s1ans/status/569081305872388097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">twitter.com/.../569081305872388097</a></p>
<p>In conclusion on what needs to happen</p>
<p>I love how 343, Microsoft Studios is using Microsoft and Xbox Live as a scapegoat. Furthermore, I like how you continue to make the game worse than better and it has been over three months, as the game came out on November 11, 2014. I have proof of purchase,
 I paid this game in full before the release date at Gamestop across from the Dayton Mall in Dayton, OH.</p>
<p>I personally work for PNC and must remain compliant with all procedures and investor specific guidelines. I have to also decision loans and underwrite loans, which I have to remain in compliance of CFPB and OCC consent order.</p>
<p>I have been logging my time spent and so far, I have accumulated from November 11, 2014 to yesterday at 1:30 AM eastern standard time the following: during the week, averaging 2 to 3 hours a day at least 3 times a week since November 11, 2014, so approximately
 9 hours during the week and at night or during the weekends averaging 5 to 8 hours Friday, Saturday and Sunday since November 11, 2014.
</p>
<p>The way I see it, is I should be paid for all my efforts and think reasonably most administrators, moderators, or programmers make at least $35 to $60 per career builder, Forbes and most sites I have visited this is comparable. Clearly I don't have a degree
 in this, but I have beta tested in the past on different games, updates, dashboards and products for Microsoft and Xbox Live, please see gamer-tags: Im The Guff Man, YouTube H3kt1k, MARVEL GHO5T, iiDSR L3G10N x and this gamer tag.

<p>To be fair, I would be willing to accept a job instead, or being reimbursed 16 hours a week since November 11, 2014 at $40 per hour at 16 hours= $640 per week at 3 months and 10 days, so to be fair 2 months (give a month's time for an average for not being
 as active) 10 weeks. $640 per week * 10 weeks= $6400.</p>
<p>I believe this is more than reasonable, as I been extremely helpful and then get a lame message from Microsoft on February 9, 2015 that states, "After further evaluation, the next Halo: MCC content update will no longer require a Content Update beta test.
 Thank you for your interest. Select 'Launch site' to view more info on Halo Waypoint (please see my twitter posts on February 9, 2015 starting at 9:54 PM).</p>
<p>I find three months and 10 days to be unsatisfactory with no real resolution in fixing the game both for either: campaign, spartan ops, all games, multi player experience and servers in general. In my opinion, which is clearly warranted, great concept integrating
 all Halo games on Xbox One, however, it never was truly even 75% (game releases in the past average completion when the games were released comparison) ready to be launched and clearly was a marketing ploy and fast way to earn cash for 343 and Microsoft Studios.</p>
<p>Failure to release a actual working and functional patches and content update in the last 3 months is definitely evident. 343 and Microsoft Studios has made a great concept a huge irritation to the Halo enthusiast, loyal fans for franchise, as a whole. I
 really hope you take notice of my complaint and fix the game soon. </p>
<p>Here is the main gist of what should happen for all who are affected (Microsoft, Xbox Support and Halo consumers); Halo Reach and ODST should be free period. I think that your close minds and secrecy needs to cease immediately and stop this 343 and Microsoft
 Studios closed testing of patches and content updates, so this fiasco doesn't happen for Halo 5 Guardians (pre-ordered already), open to all Xbox Live community members at least, two more open beta testing and going forward all patches and content updates
 released in a timely manner (it should never take more than a 2 week period). You should release the beta Content Update given to select Xbox Live Dashboard and Xbox Live updates to the whole Halo community immediately.</p>
<p>343 and Microsoft Studios should implement an internal way of scrum project management (overall a way of developing policies, patches and content updates with tight daily and weekly deadlines maximum 1 week turnaround time). I really hope for 343 and Microsoft
 Studios future, don't give up on this game and ultimately fix it in a timely manner (I think a month to two months should be your actual deadline). It's time Microsoft and the Halo consumer listen to what problems have occurred and reprimand in some sort of
 law suit against your company losses for this blunder of a loss. </p>
<p>I stated beforehand this game released date was rushed and it clearly shows Xbox One interface wasn't compatible with 343's server and developing software. It almost seems as if you just took the games on the Xbox 360 and tried to migrate them to Xbox One
 and assume it will work properly when it was released on November 11, 2014. </p>
<p>343 and Microsoft Studios it's time to become aggressive to fixing this game already and learn from your mistakes before Halo 5 Guardians is released sometime this year. Stop being so secretive and just be honest with Halo consumer and Microsoft and its
 subsidiaries executives. </p>
<p>It's time for 343 and Microsoft Studios to accept responsibility and that publicly state, it has nothing to do with all the issues with Microsoft, Xbox Live period. Show some respect, integrity and formally apologize to all those you have impacted.
</p>
<p>Never in all my years of playing video games, have I seen a game that get progressively worse, then better and band aid fixes evident. Putting it all perspective, if I took to decision a file over 30 calendar days to decision and underwrite a loss mitigation
 retention or liquidation, I would personally be fired and run the risk of compensatory cost taken out of my paycheck, or 401 K. I think video game companies, should be responsible like the banks and mortgage companies are for improper handling of consumers
 affairs.</p>
<p>Take this as my formal notice, I am going to file this with the <a href="http://www.bbb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bbb.org/</a> and personally filing a complaint with Microsoft over the phone on 343 and Microsoft Studios. I thank you as an ambassador, forums moderator, beta tester, Halo fan and former administrator for Halo and other games for personally, wasting
 my time these past couple of months. I think it really speaks volume on what I have done and others have done, versus what 343 and Microsoft Studios has done in the last 3 months and 10 days.
</p>
<p>I personally think it's time, you hire consultants like (FISH, or JD Power), people outside of your company, to evaluate 343 and Microsoft Studios. It is evident that clearly, you weren't ready to take over the Halo franchise from Bungie.
</p>
<p>I thank you again for taking my hard earned money $60 + tax, plus 1 year membership and downloadable content (averaged to over $100+). I thank you for releasing a game that clearly wasn't fully functional and ready for launch on November 11, 2014.
</p>
<p>I find your company to be at fault, for profit share losses at Microsoft, returned Xbox Ones, returned games and for the most part, ruining 343's reputation in keeping a great Halo franchise prominent and profitable. I really hope you hire some loyal fans,
 people outside of your company and fix the game already. Best of luck to you and I am always going to love Halo, because I still play with my friends to this day and was the whole reason I bought my first original Xbox within a year from initial launch.
</p>
<p>I feel this has been a huge disappointment and I hope a civil action lawsuit will be put towards you in the near future.
</p>
<p>Best regards in your future endeavors, </p>
<p>Ephesians aka Guff</p>

<p>Over these past days since, February 20, 2015, February 21, 2015 and February 22, 2015, I have played 30+ multi player games. I have been playing using the following: clearing my local saved games first, then restored my character to default setting. In
 order to do this you need to change the following back for your character: emblem foreground, MJOLNIR, background Star, colors, primary, silver, secondary, white, background, steel, avatar, MASTER CHIEF 6, Service ID, 117, Edit Clan ID, UNSC and nameplate,
 first blue BLANK. I think it resets your connection, but for this to work properly you have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then clear your local saved games. Please note that Australia, New Zealand and Asia this might not work. It will work for US, Canada,
 Mexico, UK and Europe. Give it a shot.</p>

<p>Update February 20, through February 22, 2015:</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to give a shout out to forums poster and my newest Xbox Live friend, AnonymousNarc. Over the course of this week, AnonymousNarc and me have been trying different things. Here is what works and doesn't help so far on what we concluded.</p>
<p>Over these past days since, February 20, 2015, February 21, 2015 and February 22, 2015, I have played 30+ multi player games.</p>
<p>I have been playing using the following: clearing my local saved games first, then restored my character to default setting. In order to do this you need to change the following back for your character: emblem foreground, MJOLNIR, background Star, colors,

 then clear your local saved games. Please note that Australia, New Zealand and Asia this might not work. It will work for US, Canada, Mexico, UK and Europe. Give it a shot, what you have to lose?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>AnonymousNarc</p>
<p>On a side note, I personally have played with others then him and AnonymousNarc would agree this helps as well. Go to settings, then System and rename your console the following: GH5TXB0XON3 and see, if your gaming and Xbox One's performance improves. I
 stumbled upon this through trial and error, punching in sequences into my console name at this improved performance tremendously. Furthermore, I have proven that adding me as a friend and playing a couple games with me, seems to improve your overall multi
 player experience.</p>
<p>New Zealand, Asia and Australia still can't play pretty much all the playlist since the futile patches and content updates released. I partied with GoldenDemon89 and we kept getting hung up with players found... and that's how far I get with him and he's
 in Australia. Apparently, multi player has never worked for him since the patches and updates came out, so I will do my part in trying to get him and others able to play again. Stay tuned and I would be happy to play with anyone, but for now that's all I got.</p>
<p>Ephesians,</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 file name sort order</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I need help...<br />
<br />
I am having a problem with Windows 7 (x64) file alphabetization, they are organizing in a strange manner and i cant seem to find a solution anywhere. Let me attempt to describe it... I have three files say<br />
<br />
Elmo<br />
Elmo 1<br />
Elmo 2<br />
<br />
now instead of being in that order (which i believe to be the correct way the system should alphabetize) they appears as<br />
<br />
Elmo 1<br />
Elmo 2<br />
Elmo<br />
<br />
if i reverse the order of the files they appear as</p>
<p>Elmo</p>
<p>Elmo 2</p>
<p>Elmo 1</p>
<p><br />
What is going on here and how do i fix this? I am including a screen shot to help explain better.<br />
</p>
<p>I created a post on the Neowin forums that include pictures. Located at http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/975328-windows-7-file-alphabetization/</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. And let me know if you have questions that can help with the solution<br />
THANKS!!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<div>(which i believe to be the correct way the system should alphabetize)</div>
</blockquote>
<div>The problem is that there is no universal standard for sorting, and what works well in one situation for some people might not for others. Another recent poster expected 'ASCII sort order' - fair enough for English language, but what about other languages?
 ASCII sorts upper case letters ahead of lower case ones, and has some symbols before numbers, some after, some between Z and a and some after z. Would that poster really expect file names containing symbols to be sorted like that? (999).txt, [001].txt, {555}.txt?
 Charlie.txt, able.txt, baker.txt? It's a perennial problem, even requiring MS to assign two different language codes to Castilian Spanish according to whether the alphabet uses the traditional sort order or the modern one.<br />
<br />
Two of your examples include spaces. Where should these fit into the sort order? Should 'nothing' always sort before 'something' or<em>&nbsp; vice versa</em>? If you replace the spaces in your examples with, for example, underscore characters, you will get a different
 result again. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>MS Excel has, for good reasons, a well-defined sort order which anyone who uses that program will recognize. It's different from many others, and looks like this in English (the numbers are the ASCII code points):</div>

I guess that what I'm trying to say is you may have to adapt your filenames to suit the W7 sort order, rather than the other way round. I'm sure a lot of thought went into determining the order most likely to satisfy the majority of users (otherwise why would
 they have changed the system between Win2K and XP?). The main reason why I prefer the Win2K system is that it sorts hex numbers numerically; the XP system doesn't.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Apart from that, there are lots of situations where filenames including spaces are a nuisance, and sundry software will change those spaces to %20 or _ or something else.</div>

<p><span>MS Office (including Publisher)&nbsp;does not come with Windows 7 (or any other version of Windows) - it is an application suite that must be purchased separately. If you had it before
 and did not purchase it, it was probably an 'OEM' version that came bundled by your PC manufacturer (&amp; which you paid for at the same time as your PC). You should also note that OEM software is tied to its original PC and cannot be transferred to a new machine.</span></p>

    <title>taskbar icons disappear and then reappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ben coram  say:</h3>
<h2>            taskbar icons disappear and then reappear</h2>
                    somewhere between once every 10 minutes and once every minute, my taskbar icons disappear and then reappear after about 10 seconds, and I can't alt+tab into the window, this is especially frustrating because when I am playing a game, it goes out of the
 game and I can't get back in until my taskbar icons appear, I have seen another forum with a similair&nbsp;problem and there were 3 solutions, one was to go into command prompt and type sfc/scannow, another was to check if another account had the same problem,
 it did, the third was to perform a safe reboot, I tried the first two with no luck, so I tried the third option, which worked for a week or two but then I was back to the same problem. I have tried scanning for viruses in windows defender with no results and
 I have looked through the internet and no one seems to have the same problem as me, which is very uncommon. if this has happened to anyone else help would be much appreciated.

<p>hi, I think you are misunderstanding my problem, it is just the icons but not the entire taskbar that is missing, also I'm&nbsp;not sure what you mean by&nbsp;<span>Win+Shift+CursorRight</span><span>. and&nbsp;</span><span>Alt+Space,
 M, CursorRight. </span>&nbsp;Do you mean to just move the cursor right? I've tried these and nothing on my screen changes so I thinkI'mm doing it wrong, I've also noticed that when this happens the cursor has the loading wheel on it, if that helps. anyway thank
 you for trying to help</p>

</p><p>Thanks for clarifying.&nbsp; Then that symptom could again be explained by a switch from a primary monitor to a secondary one, so again, missing windows would be off-screen.&nbsp; However, if that was happening randomly it would suggest a hardware problem or at least
 a video driver problem which would be signalling such a change.&nbsp; In any case, a good thing to do would be to use the Project dialog (<strong>Win+P</strong>) to change the Display configuration to Duplicate; then it wouldn't matter which "monitor" the windows
 were opened on and associated with and your Taskbar would always be rendered the same way.&nbsp; Note that the Project dialog only appears on primary monitors so if you did it when you were looking at a secondary's Taskbar you would have to be prepared to imagine
 using it.&nbsp; I suppose our hypothesis would have to be that the current state would Extend, so then to make it go to Duplicate you would then just need to press CursorUp, Enter.</p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The idea is that you will be moving windows using keyboard sequences only.&nbsp; Please try practising those commands on windows that you can see so you can understand what they would be doing on windows that
 were only able to imagine but could give keyboard focus to.&nbsp; <em>CursorRight </em>
may be regarded as a placeholder for any of the Arrow keys, depending on which direction you would be wanting to move the windows.&nbsp; In the case of UpArrow and DownArrow you will find, especially in the case of the Snap windows commands that they have their
 own meaning to Maximize or Minimize the window that you are operating on.&nbsp; However, in W10 there is another in between state which allows snapped windows to be moved to a particular quadrant, so this description may be a simplistic model of the real possible
 effects.</p>

<p>Hi Robert, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling my monitor drivers but that hasn't worked, probably because I'm on a laptop with no external monitors and using the&nbsp;win+shift+cursor right doesn't work because it only goes out of fullscreen games (not
 borderless fullscreen, though) but I think it might be something to do with a background process because of the loading wheel so I'll have a look at background processes&nbsp;and get rid of some to see if that does the trick.&nbsp;

            so I've&nbsp;also discovered that when the taskbar icons disappear&nbsp;my CPU usage goes up to 100% and that it's not just one background process going to 100%, a lot of them go from somewhere between 1% and 0% CPU usage to 15% or something similar, and when I
 look in windows problem and reliability reports there are about 100 critical reports of file explorer, so I don't know what that means. Also, I&nbsp;tried setting my projection to duplicate and that helped a bit by making the taskbar icons reappear a bit faster,
 but they still disappear, and when the items disappear, also, I think the narrator says "desktop, taskbar: program manager page: desktop, selected, supports multiple selections, over 100 items selected" I'm not sure he says that but it was something along
 those lines. Anyway, I hope that helps.

<p>
</p><p>Remember that you are going to use Alt+Tab to set keyboard focus to the task, even when you can not see its window.&nbsp; After that you will be able to use any of the keystroke sequences that I suggested.&nbsp; Note that the success of Win+Shift+CursorRight depends
 on the window being on a different monitor, so if it is only associated with the current monitor but off-screen, then you should use one of the other sequences.&nbsp; The Alt+Space M CursorRight (plus sufficient extra movement from either your mouse or cursor keys)
 would be the most general but the Win+CursorRight would be the simplest, though it might have to be applied more than once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using all those methods so you get familiar with how they work?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 it happen with all the CD/DVD?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: Try and check if the disc works with another computer.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clean the CD or DVD. To do this, use a disc-cleaning kit. Or, gently wipe the silver side of the disc by using a soft,
 lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper cloth that can scratch the plastic, and leave streaks. When you clean the disc, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion. If the problem continues to occur, clean the disc by using a damp
 cloth or a commercial CD or DVD cleaning solution. Dry the disc thoroughly before you insert the disc in the drive.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3</strong>: If it happens with all the CD/DVD, run the fix if from the following links.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>This issue could be caused either due to a permission issue or due to some corrupted system files for that user account. I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1: Change File history location<br />
</strong></div>
<div>To check if this issue is caused due to restrictions on the location where you save the file history, I would suggest you to change the file history location from the network drive to some local drive or to a different location and check. Refer to “Select
 a different file history drive” section in this link:<br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-something-goes-wrong-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-something-goes-wrong-file-history</a></div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 2: Change account type and check<br />
</strong></div>
<div>I would also suggest you to change the local account to an Administrator account and then check if you face this issue. To change the account type, refer these steps:<br />
<div>a) Press Windows key +X, select control panel<br />
b) Click on “user accounts and family safety” and click on “user accounts”<br />
c) It will display the current user account and what type of account it is<br />
d) If it is not an administrator account, then click on change your account type<br />
e) Select “Administrator” click on change account type.</div>
<div>For more information, you can refer this link:<br />

    <title>blank screen after logon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crawfo  say:</h3>
<h2>            blank screen after logon</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes after login to windows 8 I get a blank screen. Sometimes it seems to lock there for a llllong time. Other times it lasts for a few seconds and the start screen comes up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to use &lt;ctl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;del&gt; to bring up the task manager and log off. The logon screen then comes up again and all seems to work fine..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what is going on?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Crawfo,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you are facing issue with the blank screen while after booting to desktop. I would like to know more information, so that we could help you better.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you get any error code or error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does this issue started recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us try the following methods; I am sure this will help you resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot state and then check if the issue persists. Placing the computer in clean boot will help you determine which app/program is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ window type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Enable half of the services<br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong><span>: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5:</span></strong><span> Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 6: </span></strong><span>Resolve the problem<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 7: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ window type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Upgrade the video card driver from the manufacturer’s website or from Windows update.</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to update the Video card driver:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <b>Windows Key + X key</b> and click
<b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Expand ‘Display Adapters’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click on the Video card listed and click on ‘<b>Update Driver Software</b>’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue started recently, then perform System restore and check.</span></p>
<p>Follow the steps to perform system restore:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the <b>Search</b> option in
<b>Charms bar</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “<b>System Restore</b>” and then click
<b>system restore</b> under <b>Settings</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Once you get the <b>system restore</b> window, click on the
<b>System restore</b> button.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <b>Next</b> and then select the restore point when the computer was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you better.</span></p>

<p>The problem has been happening ever sense upgrading Win 7 Home to Win 8 Pro. It does not happen every time. The delay is sometime none, sometimes seconds, and sometimes until I bring up the task menu and select log off. Then I get the logon screen again

<h3> keatonbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t finish multiplayer tests</h2>
                    When I first start up my xbox, it says in the bottom right that "there's a problem getting this content right now" and it's been doing that since yesterday. When I go to test the network, NAT type, and multiplayer connection, the NAT type is fine and it
 says it's connected to the internet but that it can't finish the multiplayer test. It says that if it failed multiple times then there might be a network issue, which it has. I don't know why this is happenening as no changes to my knowledge has happened with
 either the xbox or my internet. I have a wired connection which should alleviate most internet problems and I have no idea what's going on. Help?

            Hey, I appreciate the info and the quick response. I had already tried power cycling to no avail and I'm about to try the reset. Before I do though, will the "reset and keep my games &amp; apps" allow me to keep the save data for all the games as well? Might
 be a stupid question but still. Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there Keaton, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with completing a multiplayer connection test. I recommend to try replacing the Ethernet cable being used. If the issue persists, try power cycling the console and network hardware to help refresh the
 network signal. </p>

                    I can no longer log in to my admin user profile. It gives me the error message 'The User Profile service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded', and will not let me log in as an admin under a guest user for admin functions... What can I do? I
 left on vacation for a week, leaving the computer on (it stays on even when I'm home), but it had restarted (for some Windows updates, I believe), and now I can't log in. I've lost all my documents, since I can't log in to my profile.

These methods should help for Windows 7 or Vista.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>

Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to
