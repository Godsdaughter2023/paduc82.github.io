                    Have Windows 7 running for ages now. Have had a Canon Pixma MP150 printer for ages as well. Windows updates automatically, checked that, nothing strange there and then OUT OF THE BLUE my computer doesnt recognize my printer anymore. It says "USB device
 not recognized). Tried everything what I know but nothing changes the situation. Anyone any ideas as this is pretty frustrating.

<p>Hi Divya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your reply but unfortunately it still doesnt work. I personally think it's not the printer but it must have something to with the USB ports. I have tried to plug it in all other USB ports but it just wont communicate with the computer.
 Every time it come up with USB Device not recognized. Is there anything I can do? E.g. resetting USB ports or so? I have no idea how to do that though. I hope you will be able to help me further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>You can download the drivers from this page to install:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp150#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp150#DriversAndSoftware</a></p>
<p>Thats for the 64 bit version, but you can change the drop-down menu to the 32 bit version if needed.</p>
<p>Here are the Cannon instructions for reinstalling the driver:</p>

<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong>&nbsp;You must have Internet access in order to reinstall the printer driver.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn the printer off.<br />
</li><li>Select 'All Programs' from the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;menu.<br />
</li><li>Select the Canon MP driver you want to uninstall, and then select 'Uninstall' from the menu that appears.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to get rid of unwanted Windows updates for 32-Bit when my Laptop uses 64-Bit and can I also update the Window update history.</h2>
                    <p>Had to restore my 64-Bit Window 7 HP Pavilion Laptop after trying to download iTunes and getting 32-Bit corruption.&nbsp;&nbsp; I restored my PC to an earlier point on my 64-Bit Windows 7 HP Pavilion G6 Laptop so everything back to normal.&nbsp; But my view update history&nbsp;still
 shows some 32-Bit&nbsp;updates installed.&nbsp; For example Definition update for Microsoft Office 2010 (KB982726) 32-Bit Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click check for windows updates it presents me with a list of updates 64-bit and unwanted 32-Bit.&nbsp; Have installed the 64-Bit ones&nbsp;&nbsp; I have hidden&nbsp;the 32-Bit ones for now to avoid them being automatically uploaded&nbsp;by Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I use a tool to remove the update history&nbsp;-Windows Updates for the 32-Bit or refresh it some how so I don't get offered any more 32-Bit updatesI Can I use&nbsp;a program called Windows defender which can remove Windows history, but when I attempted to open
 it failed to open giving a with timed out error.&nbsp; Any suggestions how avoid&nbsp;getting prompted for&nbsp;32 bit updates which I believe would corrupt&nbsp;my 64-Bit Windows.</p>

            <p>Hi Ken</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modern Windows versions include a 32bit sub-system that allows 32bit programs to be installed on a 64bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the reason that you see a C:\Program Files and C:\Program Files (x86) folder. The former is where the 64bit programs are installed and the latter is where the 32bit programs are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also see a C:\Windows\System32 folder for the 64bit System Files and the C:\Windows\SysWOW64 folder where the 32bit System Files are stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system isolates 32-bit applications from 64-bit&nbsp;applications, which includes preventing file and registry collisions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows Update runs it will detect any 32bit applications and offer to install any updates that apply to those 32bit applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a good idea to ignore the 32bit updates since this could potentially cause problems with the 32bit programs. This is especially true with security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference:</p>

            <p>Hello Vincent, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The cellular connection option is usually listed on the right side of <strong>
Network and Internet </strong>tab of <strong>Settings </strong>on Windows 10. Since you mentioned that it's now missing after the upgrade, we'll need to check first if it's just disabled or totally nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your cellular option still appearing under Network Connections? Here's how you'll find out, on your Search option, type in
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; click on <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> &gt;<strong> Network and Sharing Center</strong> &gt;
<strong>Change adapter settings</strong> &gt; Check if your cellular option is still there. For example, you should see a name like "Mobile Broadband 1", then right-click on it and click
<strong>Enable</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know what happens after. We're so much interested in the results.
</p>

            This issue is root and stem within the 'Creators' update. My MSI GE62 7RD Apache is running like an 80 year old dung beetle because of this update. The previous build was excellent... I could run 170 or so channels of 44.1Khz audio at 24bit... now it strugles
 to move data via SSD to USB 3.0 among a whole assortment of weird corruptions and missing registries. I have been escalated to level 2... perhaps there will be answers tonight. Might I suggest logging the behavior of resource monitor relative to your troubleshooting
 proceedures. Bet you have lots of blue writing and blue lines in your CPU tab of resource monitor... 5 weeks I have not been able to work on my design projects... not even an MSI Silverwater factory reset helped. I am zero writing this awesome computer...
 sad that a failed update is going to cost me a bunch of time doing system integrity instead of actually doing what it is I do to make a living.&nbsp;

<p>Sumit, Mate, if that is your question... this one is way over your head/paygrade... Missing update files of a security type nature? 9 missing on my system? This is bonkers mate... your chief developers need to liase with a whole bunch of different manufacturers
 to resolve this totally amature collapse of Win 10 system integrity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are the specifics...</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GE62-7RD-Apache.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have watched countless level one agents follow exactly the same troubleshooting proceedures, none of them except for one would actually listen to my input. I know where the issue lies, my level two calls either keeps getting postponed or I get a level
 2 agent that has less idea than the level one techs... 3 times a level two has not understood the situation resulting in them ending the call and then back to the start I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooting proceedures that microsoft are employing are what I have already tried weeks ago and to NO AVAIL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of complex documents that I have discovered on the microsoft website pertaining to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Windows Update Errors</p>
<p>-MSI software update registration corruption issues</p>
<p>-Resetting Windows update Components</p>
<p>-Update Installation Corruptions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 10 installation media available on the website is incomplete in the sense that the cumulative update is absent. Yesterday I made several unsuccessfully attempts to install that shocking cumulative package after the Creators update has already
 run... that makes no sense to me. It is like trying to shut a door after the hurricane has blown it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Service Registration is stuck in a loop of being either corrupt, missing, repaired then same repeated ad nauseum...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC and DISM scans are yeilding no results, this just further indicates to me that the most recent update has SERIOUS problems that are impossible for me to address as a user of home edition. I attempted to download what appear to be the problematic update
 packages and replace them... yet still NOTHING is working at a home/client level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zero Writing did NOT fix anything.... THESE ARE ALL THE SAME ISSUES THAT I HAVE BEEN FACING FOR 5 WEEKS NOW!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any minute now I will hear from a Southern Hemisphere agent... last time I let one if the phillipines call centre folk into my computer it was destabilised further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pathetic situation that the Windows Developers have burdened an innumerable amount of end users with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This near exact issue presented at an Enterprise level recently... servers were clogging due to old update files not being deleted upon new update files being installed. Why has this issue not been address at a home level?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to upgrade my windows 10 to enterprise... yet I know for a fact that this registry conflict/corruption issue will carry over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have witnessed the suspended processes in resource monitor on more machines than I have fingers and toes...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guess why there are few complaints being raised...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because most Windows Home users are merely syncing their phones and watching Netfilx... how is the average Joe supposed to know that their system is running at a fraction of its potential?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am disgusted in Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<div>The creators update turns out to be pretty damned good... the problem in fact was the automatic update delivery method... it took one obvious wrong turn. My laptop is on the compatibility list hence has permission to auto install itself... that
 nonsense is in the BUILD 1073 EULA... nothing can be done about it... I actually initiated my download early... problem was a crucial compatibility proceedure was overlooked...</div>
<div>The automatic delivery sent its payload to boot before the EFI partition had booted... U/EFI can be accessed from the moment of system power in by striking F3 as you would to enter BIOS. If Windows is allowed to install before the SSD can launch
 the EFI partition OS recovery/restore/installation interface... this is the best bit... a Zombie boot is installed that is not visible at user/client level... that is the blue line of death... it is at least another one or more windows boots thrashing behind
 the scenes... &nbsp;it gets even cooler from here...&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you get your hands on &nbsp;Gparted via Grub or whatever and boot and conduct your affairs from a USB stick; you can then zero your system reserved partition. Then choose your favourite method of Windows install boot from bios... that OS install
 will sneak on into the newly made space without the EFI partition batting an eyelid. You will notice two possible EFI boot selections you can make to launch Windows... it gets better...</div>
<div>Thanks to the Zombie being deftly placed in the ghost partition of zeros and thus formatted automatically and registered off the same service registration key in the UEFI solid state circuit found on the motherboard without the EFI partition
 shutting it down... that is why crucial system exes are suspended... lol... at one point I had at least 4 instances of Windows 10 running each of which were visible from Diskpart from pre boot to windows client/user GUIs cmd launcher who these days would think
 to really question up to 5 partitions in an SSD [one of which the EFI partition that I had to zero write now my EFI is missing thanks to these incapable techs.]

Windows 7 ________ Edition, __-bit?<br />
Make &amp; Model of the system?<br />
Do you have the product key readily available (and/or can get it with something like Belarc Advisor or ProduKey, etc.)?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You can download a legitimate ISO image of the DVD from Digital River to create an actual DVD (or USB stick) to utilize in repairing the system.<br />

Very likely you are going to - somewhere in repairing your issues or in normal use of the computer - lose something that you haven't backed up.&nbsp; Back up now and start backing up periodically from this point forward (as I assume you would not ask such a thing
 if you were already backing up.)&nbsp; External drives/CD/DVDs are inexpensive.&nbsp; Most of your personal data, you cannot recreate without backups or hours of work.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Once you have a backup, read through this:<br />

            Yes.&nbsp; But....<br />
<br />
What you provided an image of (DVD) in your earlier reply is an OEM Windows 7 DVD; it is not a "Factory" restore/recovery media.&nbsp; It is an actual Windows 7 installation DVD - just OEM license.&nbsp; The difference is that a "Factory" restore/recovery would essentially
 be an image of the system when it left the factory - including all the bloatware and so on they usually give you.&nbsp; What you seem to have is a true Windows 7 installation DVD, so if it were used to do a clean install (*IF*, that is not your intention with those
 instructions) it would do the same thing as one of those ISO images from Digital River.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The DVD you attached a picture of seems to be a plain old Windows 7 OEM installation DVD - so it should work fine for this process.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Again - none of this is relevant until you have backups of your important data, your other installation media and product keys/serial numbers, bookmarks, email, pictures, music, databases, documents, saved games, etc.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You can lose stuff for a variety of reasons on a computer and given how easy backups are - there is no logical reason to NOT back up.&nbsp; Given what you are about to attempt is a little more extreme than 'surfing the Internet" or "checking you email" - you are
 about to step into a situation where knowing you have a good recent backup is prudent.<br />

    <title>Xbox One controllers don&#39;t work in coop games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianzc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controllers don&#39;t work in coop games</h2>
                    I have 2 Xbox One controllers and I am trying to use them on my windows 10 64bit PC to play co-op (2 person) games. I have tried with both Lego Marvel Superheroes and Monaco. Both of these games will recognize only 1 controller but not both. I have 2 XBOX
 One controllers plugged in and they are registered on ports 1 and 2 in my devices. When I asked the LEGO game developer about this they said that they designed the game to work with the Xbox 360 controller and they won't comment on supporting other controllers.
 So I am wondering if the One controller isn't very compatible with the majority of games that are out there and isn't recongized the same way the 360 controller is. I downbloaded the Xbox accessories App and have updated the controllers to the latest drivers.
 My next option is to try and get my hands on a set of 360 controllers so see if the problem gets fixed - unless someone has any ideas on what the problem might be here. It weould be nice if the One controller was recognized

            Usually it is because the hard disk is locked because a program using it.<br />
<br />
If you don't mind trouble I suggest you install a program called "LockHunter". In that way you can check exactly which program locked your hard disk. Then you can deal with that program by closing it.<br />
<br />
Well... Use at your own risk.

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Multiple Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Multiple Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 I've been experiencing a few issues, possibly unrelated or they may all point to the same issue.&nbsp; I'm not very PC savvy but if you ask me to elaborate or give you more info I'm sure I'll be able to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll start from the top:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Fujitsu Lifebook A Series AH531 that had Windows 7 or 8 (can't remember which one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the free Windows 10 upgrade as I heard so many good things about it and it seemed great at first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the problem started.&nbsp; I had an issue where I switched the PC on and I got a blue screen of death not long after start up and when I put the error code in google it came up with a driver fault on the webcam (apparently a common issue on Lifebook AH531's)
 something to do with the Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error on the BSOD was snp2uvcW10.sys&nbsp;(there was another but I've since deleted that photo I took of it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the drivers&nbsp;in device manager (for the webcam) to cure the fault as most websites were saying this was a fix as it might be something to do with the webcam driver and Windows 10 auto updates causing the issue. I also thought it was a good
 idea to update all the other drivers in device manager at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seemed ok for a while but I don't use the PC every day (when you have tablets and smart phones, laptops get used less and less these days)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I needed to back up my iPhone on iTunes the other day which I managed to do but then got the BSOD error code mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time the laptop rebooted after the BSOD within 3 mins the BSOD reappeared and rebooted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get&nbsp;to the PC repair screen where you have&nbsp;3 or&nbsp;4 options (on a blue background if that helps you understand what I mean as I've never seen that screen before, I think it said your computer didn't start correctly or something like that).&nbsp; I
 think the options were: switch PC off, continue to windows or repair PC&nbsp;keeping files and another option.&nbsp; I selected repair PC and keep files which brought up a black screen with a blue Windows icon and at the bottom it said "Preparing automatic repair".&nbsp;
 I know this, as I still a have a pic of the screen when this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the process was complete the PC switched on and loaded Windows 10 and the&nbsp;laptop didn't switch off anymore.&nbsp; Also the&nbsp; icon for the webcam doesn't appear&nbsp;in the icon tray anymore (doesn't matter as I never use it anyway)&nbsp;but since then 2 more errors
 have started to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main one was that my apple iPhone doesn't register when connected to the USB port.&nbsp;It didn't even charge or register by saying "trust this computer" on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB ports don't even register a USB stick.&nbsp; When searching the internet the problem seemed to be the drivers (again!!) for the Universal Serial Bus Controller in device manager.&nbsp; When I searched for this in device manager it wasn't there to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then onto my next issue, the common fix for the missing USB drivers&nbsp;in device manager seemed to be resetting the BIOS to the default settings.&nbsp; But that didn't fix it.&nbsp; Then updating the BIOS is the next fix but reading about that seems to be a risky thing
 to do as if you mess it up then the PC might stop working altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when reading about the possible BIOS issue my PC informed me that my "File History Drive was disconnected for too long".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to post here as trying to fix all individual issue may not help as some one might spot a single fix for all issues The root cause seems to be when I repaired the PC&nbsp;where it re installed Windows.&nbsp; It seemed to cause most of the issues (although
 it did fix the original issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main questions are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me with my current issues which are the "Disconnected file history drive" and the "USB controller not working/not recognising or charging my phone" and also do you think the problems are related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for everyones help in advance and if I've missed any vital info for you to help me, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steven</p>

            <p>What I would try doing is, open Device Manager, expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each of the entries, then click uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exit Device Manage, then restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 should reinstall them, see if your devices are then recognized. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest though, I think the overall issue here is that your issue is not supported by Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.fujitsu.com/hk/products/computing/pc/microsoft/ </p>
<p>
</p><p>The best recommendation if you would like to restore full functionality to your system is to go back to Windows 8.1 with Update 1.</p>

    <title>Game stutter caused by Xbox One Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmarks2001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game stutter caused by Xbox One Controller</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I started to experience severe game stutter while playing games on my Windows 10 PC. Everything runs fine for the first few minutes of playing...then a few stutters would happen here and then, and it eventually progresses to unplayable. I thought
 it was a graphics card issue at first, but it was only happening in some games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while, I realized that it only happened in games where I was using my wireless xbox one controller to play. I tested this out more and notice that the problem occurs when ever you actually press inputs on the controller. For example, the game would
 run smooth if I left the controller alone, but as soon as I pressed forward on one of the analog sticks the stutter would start. Then I'd let go and it would return to running smooth immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried direct connecting the controller via USB, but that didn't help the problem. &nbsp;I did find a workaround by uninstalling the device, then installing it with the original drivers (downloaded here:&nbsp;http://wccftech.com/xbox-controller-pc-drivers-download-courtesy-major-nelson/).
 It works fine with these drivers, but they don't support wireless connectivity which is kind of cramping my style as I like to stream to my TV in the next room with the controller direct connected to the PC wirelessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>For Suggestion #1 - there is no "Hardware and Devices" option in the Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Suggestion #2 - the driver for this device is installed by Windows 10 automatically. I haven't found anywhere to download and can't install it per your instructions as a result.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Vink,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What do you mean by "when i turn camera on the picture is upside down?"</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What is the make and model of your camera?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Are you referring camera to webcam?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Are you referring to pictures that are copied from camera to the computer?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Are you facing this issue will are the pictures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to the pictures that are copied from the camera to the computer, it depends how you had captured the picture. I would suggest you to refer the links and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>&#91;Solved&#93; Crashes while gaming in WIN10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zplus05  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Crashes while gaming in WIN10</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, specification of my computer:</p>
<p>CPU: intel Core i7-8700K</p>
<p>Motherboard: GIGAGYTE Z370</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB DDR4-3000MHz (2x8GB)</p>
<p>Display: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 3GB</p>
<p>Storage: 256GB SSD &amp; 3.5" 2TB HDD (7200RPM)</p>
<p>Power: ANTEC BRONZE 550W Power supply</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this computer this week, i have just installed the anti-virus, some games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, whenever i tried playing those games, no matter it is in full-screen, windowed (full-screen), it crashed and exited
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">within 15 minutes</span>. In worse cases, i even got BSOD. All those games performed perfectly on my other laptop with similar specs (also WIN10), so the problem should come from this pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried reinstalling the whole WIN10, and the retailer helped me to perform tests to prove that those hardware are all running in normal conditions. (I also ran memtest myself, all clean)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon BSOD, i got 3 different kinds of messages: <strong>1. memory_management&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Driver_overran_stack_buffer&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</strong></p>
<p>And by using Blue Screen viewer, all those BSOD point to the same cause: <strong>
ntoskrnl.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal documentation or net-browsing would not trigger the problem. I can log in without difficulties, only when i play games will the problem emerge. I tried installing different versions of the display card driver, didn't seem to help. I also reset the
 BIOS to default, in case overclock would be the cause, but the problem sustains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to use the verifier, but the system became so laggy. When I played my games, they just crashed and exited everytime, no BSOD happened and I couldn't get those analysis on which drivers are rogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide with any necessary data, I just want the problem to be solved, thank you.</p>

<p>Temps are good, No worries there.</p>
<p>There are two non-hardware things I can think of that may cause games to crash after playing for a period of time...</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Anti-virus software. Try disabling or uninstalling your AV temporarily (or disable Windows Defender if you are using that).
</p>
<p>Fortunately you don't have much software installed, so this helps reduce potential for conflicts from other software.</p>
<p>- I've only heard of this affecting one game, Far Cry 3 (crash after 15min).&nbsp; <em>
Tablet Mode</em>. In <em>Settings &gt; Tablet Mode.</em></p>
<p>Verify - <em>When I Sign</em> - In is set to&nbsp; <em>Use Desktop Mode</em> (I think this only crashed the game, not the machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The error messages implicate several things, as you seem to be aware, but your drivers are all up to date, so we should be able</p>
<p>to rule them out.</p>
<p>RAM is not necessarily the source of the crashes, however, because the crash happens after a period of about 15 minutes,
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">if the two items above don't help,</span> I would be looking toward the RAM, but also run a disk check on your SSD &amp; HDD, as errors</p>
<p>there could also lead to the <em>memory_management</em> error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you use the Windows Memory test tool, or <em>MemTest</em>86 ? I'm not sure if you can setup Windows memory test for more than
</p>
<p>two passes, which is (unless things have changed) not always adequate, particularly with RAM intensive things like games.
</p>
<p>Eight passes are traditionally suggested for a proper test. If you can run Windows memory test for eight passes, no need for MemTest86.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit tedious, but you should test one stick at a time, and test in the two slots your mobo uses for two stick Dual Channel</p>
<p>(some mobo's use two adjacent, and others use alternate slots) as well, as a test for the mobo slots.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- You may want to try repairing the games, but I think the issue is more likely hardware related. Especially as you said you haven</p>
<p>not installed anything other than your AV and some games.</p>
<p>Both Steam and UPlay have tools for this in their client software.</p>
<p>- With Steam R/click on the games title and go to Properties &gt; Local Files and run the Verify Integrity of Game Files tool.</p>
<p>- UPlay - R/click on game title and click on Verify Files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I don't know much about BIOS, so I don't dare to fiddle with the settings,"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- I thought you had tried some over-clocking because you mentioned it in your first post. I just wanted to verify you set full defaults.</p>
<p>because a lot of people (myself included about twelve years ago) try to set their RAM speed to match what is on the label, which is
</p>
<p>the maximum overclock speed for the RAM, not what the cpu/memory controller is capable of without overclocking it as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboards generally use the lowest 'failsafe' speed by default, but you can generally setup BIOS to use the
</p>
<p>RAM's XMP speed ( 2600MHz with your RAM I believe) without the system crashing.</p>
<p>- Note that if your graphics card is a factory over-clocked model resetting the motherboard BIOS to default would not</p>
<p>affect the gpu factory OC. It's not common but some brands of the Nvidia GTX500 series had issues with factory OC's due
</p>
<p>to poor gpu BIOS.&nbsp; This was remedied by using tools such as MSI afterburner to set the clocks to the base speed for the model,
</p>
<p>and in some cases with a new gpu BIOS .</p>
<p>People at the Nvidia forums would know if this is an issue with the GTX1000 series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Personally, if I bought a pre-built machine from a retailer (I'm assuming OEM pre-built, or custom retailer built ) I would have wanted
</p>
<p>to run a game so the retailer&nbsp; could see what is happening, unless of course he is happy to use your description of the issue and
</p>
<p>take the machine in for warranty repair. Which is what you are paying a premium for when buying pre-built machine.
</p>
<p>You've done your bit to this point (hopefully you will find what the cause of the problem is soon, and it's not hardware,
</p>
<p>before having to take the machine back. It's a drag to not be able to use your machine potentially for weeks).</p>
<p>The sooner the better though. If hardware is faulting you want to get in during the initial return to base warranty through the retailer
</p>
as having to do a RMA warranty through the mfg of the suspect component later is more trouble, and takes more time.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 USB Driver Shutting off USB Mouse and Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitchellbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 USB Driver Shutting off USB Mouse and Keyboard</h2>
                    <p><strong><em>In the past week I have had 5 systems unable to use USB Mouse 4 desktops and one laptop.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The problem seems to be when a USB Device, no matter what it is, new Mouse, New Combo Mouse and&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Keyboard, and in one case an odd Flash Drive gets plugged into a system, Microsoft provides a driver</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>and as soon as it's installed, it shuts off USB Mouse and sometimes Keyboards.&nbsp; Have fun doing anything to your
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>system.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>The best fix for this is to either put a Windows 10 Disk or USB into the system and boot up to it.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The mouse and keyboard will work during the boot up, will shut off as soon as Windows loads.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>When booting into the USB or Disk, go to Repair option before reloading. Go into Troubleshoot and</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>restore your system to a previous point. Hoping you have restore points, I went back a day which was the earliest point</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>even though <strong><em>I just saw my system switch off&nbsp;the mouse and keyboard minutes earlier.&nbsp; Once the system successfully
</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>restored it was functional and I updated the system.&nbsp; It is running fine now.</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>Someone has corrupted the MS Driver Library with drivers that shut off USB Mouse and even keyboards.</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>Two systems I just installed a new Logitech MK320 combo mouse and keyboard a few days earlier.&nbsp; Keyboard worked, mouse did not.</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>I even tried plugging in a different mouse, wired or wireless, still wont work. It lights up on the corded and I see</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>Microsoft loading the driver, but no response with any mouse. Had to navigate in windows mode with the
</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>keyboard.&nbsp; Another system which is a laptop, a Logitech MB320 was loaded, and then mouse failed. This customer</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>bought a different mouse and still would not work.&nbsp; The touchpad on this laptop worked since it is not a USB but PS2.</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em>I restored system prior to that date and it is now up and running.</em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>Another customer had been using the same mouse and keyboard for months, but must have plugged in something.&nbsp; Turned on her</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>computer and could not even log in, no response with keyboard or mouse.&nbsp; Using a USB Windows 10 restored to 2 days prior
</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>and now back up and running.</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>I just had the same issue on my personal computer. I loaded an old flash drive into my system to see what was on it. It was a small,</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>256MB Wintel Flash Drive. It took several seconds to load a driver for it.&nbsp; As soon as I saw the message for the driver has been installed,</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>I saw the lights on both my keyboard and mouse go off&nbsp;with no responses&nbsp;on either.&nbsp; Rebooted and no response at all.&nbsp; I loaded USB W10 and restored to previous day and up and running fine now.</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>Has someone hacked into MS Driver Library and replaced a few drivers with what I would consider Malicious Software?</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>I have a case ID with MS due to update issues causing Unbootable Systems, and I added the USB Mouse issue as well. I tried to contact</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>MS earlier and was told they would call back in 2 hours. I got the call back in the two hours, but the line was dropped while being transferred from operator&nbsp;to a Tech.&nbsp; Never heard back so writing this story
 here.</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>I did not get a call back, they had my case number and phone on record and should have called.</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>I have customers now calling me where they had Bootup failures due to MS Update KB4056892 and they called&nbsp;MS instead of me and they &nbsp;had them Reset their system which wipes out all software including many MS
 Software.&nbsp; They should have tried to Restore first.&nbsp; I have had to reload&nbsp;over 20 systems in the past month since I wasn't able to retore. I was able to restore about&nbsp;10 units.&nbsp;
</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>Microsoft is releasing updates that are not fully tested. Yes they are trying to plug a leak in Intel systems security but they are causing just about all AMD System Bootup Failures and several Intel Bootup
 failures as well.&nbsp; I actually now have customer thinking very strongly to switch over to Apples.&nbsp;
</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em><strong><em>I have been using computers for over 40 years.&nbsp; I worked in the Semiconductor industry building parts for everyone's computers, Apples, PC, Supercomputers, Space Computers, and Telecommunication Devices all
 over the world. I have dealt with Viruses and Malware and worked on Thousands of systems just&nbsp;in the past&nbsp;5 years.&nbsp; I always thought the only people what would benefit from any of these issues where no money was involved with the users, would be Apple trying
 to convert people over.&nbsp; Out of the thousands of users I&nbsp;&nbsp;have helped, only 1 has converted over and loves it.&nbsp; In the past month I have seen 2 customers strongly thinking about switching over. They rely on their systems for their livelihood and can not risk
 system failures like these. Most of these types of people I have made sure they have 2 systems just in case one fails.&nbsp; In some businesses they have two network carriers in case one goes down.&nbsp; This is a way to prevent downtime.&nbsp; The cost of putting 30 operators
 off line for just an hour is more than a months cost of a second carrier.&nbsp; Windows 10 started strong and worked well.&nbsp; The Creator version came out and wasn't too thrilled with some of the changes, but was working ok.&nbsp; Got nervous when the Fall Creator came
 out shortly after meaning to me they released the Creator too early and developed problems along the way.&nbsp; The problems are quickly adding up the a Vista Fiasco. I am surprise that has not been completely put to rest.</em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></em></strong></p>

<p>I stated 3 desktops one Home Made, ASUS P8Z68-V LS MB, Intel i7 3770 Processor. Other desktops HP 500MT Intel Dual Core E5800 and Dell Inspiron 560s Intel Pentium E5400, Laptop Dell Studio 1749 Intel Core i5-M430 Processor.&nbsp; All systems are on Windows 10
 Professional 64 bit 1709.&nbsp; I forgot I have a Sony Vaio VGC-LV150J AIO System, originally had Intel Core 2 Duo E7200 @ 2.53GHz, upgraded to E8500 @ 3.16GHz. All Are Intel Systems of various types.&nbsp; The timing of when a USB device was installed to the time of
 failure varied. On my system it was very quick.&nbsp; On the Sony I upgraded the processor and put in a SSHD, used the MK320 Keyboard Mouse, and failed a while later, not sure what triggered it.</p>
<p>The HP 500MT I did notice looking at the Microsoft Updates, the Update for Windows 10, Version 1709 for x64 based Systems (KB4057291) was successfully installed many times, maybe twice in one day, where one was KB4057291 and another KB4057291 (3), I see
 KB4057291(2) installed 6 times on 6 different days and not even consecutive.&nbsp; The last was KB4057291(7) on the 19th.&nbsp; SO it was installed Twice in 2/8/18, Twice on the 10th, once on the 12th, once on the 13th, the once on the 14th, once on the 15th, 16th,
 17th, 18th, and 19th.&nbsp; System failed in the morning of the 19th. &nbsp;</p>

            I also noticed if you looked at the Device Manager, even though you would see notices the new USB Device was loaded, you would see it listed as no driver available. I would ask to update and keep saying no driver available.&nbsp; I would download the Logitech
 Set Point Software and still nothing.&nbsp; None of the desktops have PS2 sockets for Mouse/Keyboard, but I bet that would work. The Dell Studio Laptop never lost the Touch Pad.

<p>Elaland,&nbsp; Thanks for the Thread.&nbsp; Microsoft has had two major issues with their updates.&nbsp; First the KB4056892 to take care&nbsp; if the Intel Leak issue. I found most AMD Would not boot and many Intel's as well.&nbsp; That was out 1/3/18, and wasn't fixed till 1/31/18
 when KB4058258 came out.</p>
<p>The KB4074588 is also a recent update, causing trouble with USB Mouse and sometimes Keyboards.&nbsp; I uninstalled KB4074588</p>
<p>and restarted the computer and my mouse and keyboard were up and running, but of course, the KB4074588 wanted to go back in.&nbsp; I used the wushowhide.diagcab to hide that update so it wont go through. I hope it keeps it away.&nbsp; It seems after the KB4074588
 is installed, it needs a trigger to set it off. Installing a new USB Device seems to be a trigger.&nbsp; Someone better tell Logitech, 4 of my failures involved MK320 combo Keyboard and Mouse, and the MB320 stand alone mouse.&nbsp; Maybe it's the 320 series only?? My
 system shut down USB when I installed an old Wintel 256MB Flash.&nbsp; I haven't heard the Term Wintel for a long time.&nbsp; Back when Digital Equipment developed the Alpha Chip, a processor far more superior than the Intel Pentium. I would run 6 times faster and that's
 without any clock doubler. DEC was waiting for Microsoft to develop an Operating system for their chip so I could work with most of the PC Software that was out.&nbsp; They were told by Microsoft (Windows) that Intel (Win(In)tel) is their priority and they wouldn't
 develop an OS System for them. They should have gone to Apple to develop an OS System, Apple was working with Motorola and IBM for a while to develop a processor and here they had something that could have changed the whole industry.&nbsp; Typical Bill Gates if
 he can't buy your business, or steal your idea (Windows), he would put you out of business.&nbsp; There are soo many What Ifs?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>While I encountered the USB problem with the MS update on my personal computer at home, in my job I oversee an Industrial site with many networks, computers, and real world machines operating (not the IT side of the world).&nbsp; This type of update problem is
 exactly why industries are careful or hesitant to update their Microsoft based computers in control systems - it is because a problem patch could cause as much harm as a security intrusion.&nbsp; As I saw in one recent article think of it like patching a self driving
 car while you are in it and going down a busy interstate highway!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do enjoy the old history stories like you shared; I've been at this a long time too.&nbsp; Back in the early-mid 90's I had started doing some engineering consulting on my own.&nbsp; The PC I built for myself used a 486DX4 chip (almost equivalent to the first Pentium's)
 and I had it running IBM's OS/2 which I really hoped at the time would become the preferred PC OS.&nbsp; IBM didn't take advantage of that time period effectively (after Win 3.11 and before Win 95), but while everyone else was still using Win 3.11 my OS/2 computer
 was using SCSI drives (hard and CD), playing music, answering telephone calls, recording messages, and faxing
 Excel, and dBase IV for small database applications.&nbsp; We were still using billboard sites via telephone back then because no internet yet!&nbsp; Of course the real world stepped in and with all my customers at the time going Microsoft I needed to maintain full
 compatibility so eventually that's the way I went too.</p>

<p>Thanks for your followup. &nbsp; I started working for National Semiconductor in 1988. I was using an IBM XP Desktop with a Monochrome Monitor. I had one of the nicer computers where I had a 5Meg Hard drive and a 5 1/4" Floppy Drive.&nbsp; Many of the other computers
 had 2 5 1/4" Floppies, one for System and the other for Data.&nbsp; I remember a 250Meg hard drive being as big as a Washing Machine.&nbsp; Had removable platters with heads built into them.&nbsp; Today I have several hard drives over 1 TB, I have a 5TB External the size
 of a small book.&nbsp; That hard drive is equal to 20,000 of the old 250GB Hard Drives.&nbsp; I was using a Color Plotter. If you wanted a color Pie Chart, you sent it to your plotter, it had about 6 color markers with a fine tip. The plotter would move around and draw
 what you needed.&nbsp; May take 30 minutes to an Hour to draw out a nice color chart.&nbsp; Then we got a Color Laser Printer, that was $5,000 and about $800-$1000 to change cartridges and maintain it.&nbsp; Oh I graduated from a Monochrome Monitor to Color.&nbsp; A 17" Color
 Monitor was about $900 and a Video card to go with that was around another $750 or more.&nbsp; I remember Lotus 123 and Quatro Pro with Word Perfect and Works.&nbsp; Things have changed for the better, but still plenty of gremlins out there causing headaches.&nbsp; I don't
 think I have ever seen a New Program Launch go out without any problems.&nbsp; We are all Humans and make mistakes.</p>
<p>Even though Steve Jobs was a Hard Ass and would make people trash their first attempt to complete a project and would make them do it all over again. I know personally I could do a better job on the second attempt, so that's what he was striving for.&nbsp; Good
 luck and let's hope Microsoft does a better job testing before releasing.&nbsp; These were two very preventable issues but in a rush to get something out to plug a leak. They let the whole ship sink with their repair for the leak.</p>

<p>Just some little history for you,</p>
<p>I started with my first PC in 1970.&nbsp; It was a used Model one TRS80 by Radio Shack.&nbsp; It had 4K memory and used a cassette tape drive to hold the operating system and programs.&nbsp; It lasted me 2 weeks until my wife sat down at it and in 2 hours said it did not
 have enough horsepower.&nbsp; She was a Fortran 4G programmer working at Gulf General Atomics in San Diego.&nbsp; She was als&nbsp; one of 2 that were the first females to take a computer class at San Diego State College. The next day I was able to get another used TRS80
 that had 16K memory.</p>
<p>Later I got an Expansion Interface where I could have a disk drive.&nbsp; Later on I also had OS2 and did Linux on one laptop.</p>
<p>I gave my TRS80 to the San Diego Computer Society for their museum.</p>

<p>Amazing History we all have.&nbsp; I remember the Radio Shack computers.&nbsp; A brother of a friend of mine was building his up around then.&nbsp; I ran into him years ago in charge of the IT Dept for Fleet Bank.&nbsp; My family has a Metal Recycling Business, have for 120
 years. We would by Old Mainframes and sell them as is so they can reclaim the gold from the contacts.&nbsp; I got a call from UNUM Corporate Office they wanted to get rid of theirs.&nbsp; I told him with my crew going up there and picking it up, they wouldn't get much
 for it. I told him to donate it to the local tech college, let them play with it for a couple of years, take a huge tax writeoff and I'll eventually get it, and you know in 2 years I did get it.&nbsp; I remember this was a system they used the Heat from it to help
 heat the entire Corporate Office in Portland Maine.</p>
<p>That's awesome your wife was a programmer back then.&nbsp; Glad you found a nice home for your old system.&nbsp; I'm sure there was plenty of gold in that as well.&nbsp; I was 10 in 1970 and my friends brother was about 14 playing with Radio Shack and Commodore Computers
 and upgrading what he could. And you're right about IBM they should have controlled more of the PC and Laptop market.&nbsp; Big mistake I think.&nbsp; I was working with ATT Connect Tech and I got a call from a couple of IBM Engineers, they were trying to get the VP's
 Video Conference System up and running and were blaming ATT for blocking it.&nbsp; I talked to those engineers and the IBM VP, he asked how much would it be to fix the problem and I told him $100, he said per hour?&nbsp; I said not just for your one issue.&nbsp; I told him
 it was a matter of finding out what the Video Conf Manufacture need for Ports forward and other security settings to be changed in the Router.&nbsp; We had him up and running, But I was afraid a couple of Engineers may have lost their job since they didn't understand
 Routers and Port Forwarding.</p>
<p>We could go back and forth on stories, it's fun to reminisce, but work needs to be done.&nbsp; Let's hope MS Smartens up, they asked me to fill out a survey, they didn't get great scores and a nice long comment about Intangible Assets and never over look them
 cause it can cost Billions.</p>
<p>Good Night, Mitch&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Graphics Card Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariusbarbu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Graphics Card Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems with my graphics card since I've updated to Windows 10. At first it was just some weird crashes, but eventually my graphics card just stopped working, and instead of logging into Windows, the screen starts flashing different colors and
 eventually the computer restarts itself. From what I understand Windows 10 does not get along with the graphics card's driver, but I'm not an expert - far from it, actually. It seems like a small problem that would be easily solved if I could just go into
 safe mode when I boot up, but since I can't ... this small problem just wrecked my PC</p>
<p>I'm thinking of reinstalling Windows 8.1, but I have no physical copy of Windows, since it came preinstalled with the PC. Do I need to buy a new copy of Windows? Is there somewhere I can download it? Can I revert back to Windows 8.1 without logging in to
 windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p><span>I think you can pretty much deduce from my previous response that my question hasn't been answered. As for resolving the issue, I just bought a copy of Windows 8 and reinstalled that.</span></p>
<p><span>Having the possibility to go into safe mode when you boot up was a wonderful feature. I don't know why you thought it was a good idea to remve that option. I still have an old computer that runs Windows XP and it boots up in under a minute. We're users
 so desperate for shorter booting time?</span></p>
