<h2>            PPT VBA code skips slides how can it be corrected</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using this code that I found on the internet.&nbsp; If I F8 through the code it picks up each slide and each shape on the slide and provides the slide name and shape name, and what is written in the shape and whether or not it is a text box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BUT</strong>, when I run the code it skips over many of the slides - only prints outs whether it is a text box or not - if it is a text box what is written in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HUGE ppt deck I'm coding VBA for.&nbsp;It is taking a long time to F8 through each slide of this deck.&nbsp; I would like&nbsp;to use this code&nbsp;on other decks but don't have the time to F8 through all the slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This code would be perfect <strong>IF</strong> I could get it to stop skipping slides and shapes.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem. &nbsp;I have blocked many, many times the same senders (approximately six or seven consistent and constant offenders) and yet there they are -- still appearing in &nbsp;my inbox. &nbsp;They are NOT in my safe senders list. &nbsp;How does this happen?
 &nbsp;Or should I just forget you guys and move to someone else as this is a real waste of my time.</p>

            If messages from a blocked sender are being delivered to the inbox, then the junk filters aren't working. This seems to be a problem for some users after a new or re-installation. The usual cure is to repair the installation, which kick-starts the filters.
 To do this, with all programs closed, press Windows key + R, type <strong>wlarp</strong> into the box and press
<em>Enter</em>. In the window that opens, select the <em>Repair ... </em>option. When it's finished, reboot the computer, launch Windows Live Mail and wait for a message to arrive from a blocked sender.

            <p>Sorry to hear that. Is any mail at all being delivered to the <em>Junk email</em> folder?
</p>
<ul>
<li>If it isn't, then the filters aren't working properly and another repair might be called for.</li><li>If it is, then the filters are working properly but there's something wrong with blocked senders.
</li></ul>
<p>For a start, can you confirm that the address as shown in the <em>Blocked senders
</em>list is identical to the address given in the <em>From:</em> line of the received message?</p>
<ul>
<li>To see the blocked senders list, press Alt-F O S.</li><li>To see the <em>From:</em> line, select the message in the message list and press Ctrl-F3.
<br />
This may look overwhelming, but not far from the top there is bound to be a line that starts with
<em>From:</em></li></ul>
<p>For the block to work, the two addresses must be absolutely identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of account is this: HTTP, POP3 or IMAP? If you're not sure, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. The type of account is given at the top of the <em>Server(s)</em> tab. The properties dialogue for an HTTP account has three tabs, for a POP3 account four and for an IMAP4 account five.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who is&nbsp;your email service provider? This is usually apparent from the part of&nbsp;your email address&nbsp;after the '@' symbol.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The accelerator keys are quite standard throughout the program. Of course they only apply to an English-language installation. What happens when viewing your message list if you press and hold the Alt key and then type F O S? If this doesn't show you the
 Safety Options dialogue, do you have any other software that might be interfering with the keystrokes? The available accelerator keys should light up on the ribbon as soon as you press Alt - is this not happening for you? Could it be that you're using an out-of-date
 version of the program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ctrl-F3 is a keyboard shortcut that has been around for a long, long time (since 1998?) to reveal the source of a selected message in successive programs. If it doesn't work for you, I'd again ask what other software you might have running that would interfere&nbsp;with
 these keystrokes?</p>

            Sorry, but I am unsure then what you mean by "Message List." &nbsp;To access the Blocked Senders List I go to Junk, then Junk Email Options, then Blocked Senders List. &nbsp;In my bigpond account via Outlook Express when I hold down the Alt key and type FOS I only
 get as far as typing the FO which takes me to some sort of Open screen where following from that it seems that C opens Calendar and O opens Outlook and I opens Import/Export. &nbsp;When I hold down the Control and F3 (at the same time) it does nothing. &nbsp;I am assuming
 you want the cursor in the email inbox. &nbsp;So all I have been able to do is access my Blocked Senders List via the method I stated above and compared those email addresses with the email addresses on the individual offending email and they are the same,

            Thanx, however I assumed it was all the same and that my bigpond.com account was Windows Live Mail mediated through/via Outlook. &nbsp;I only seem to have had these issues since bigpond went to outlook. So clearly from what you are saying I am in the wrong
 area.

<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to know what gave you that idea. Where do you make the connection between Outlook (a web-based email service) and Windows Live Mail (a mail client program)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have more success with blocked senders if you add them in Outlook. Mail delivered by a blocked sender doesn't even make it to the
<em>Junk</em> folder in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I'm going to shuffle this thread over to the forum that deals with Outlook Express. I hope whoever comes across it isn't too confused by our exchanges born of a major misunderstanding. I'll wish you luck and bow out ...</p>

    <title>Unable to open Outlook 2013 due to incorrect settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samfromsouth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open Outlook 2013 due to incorrect settings</h2>
                    <p>I attempted to configure my new email address that I set up via one of those companies that allow you to have your own domain. I used the settings they gave me to enable me to get my emails in Outlook however on the first attempt I think I got it wrong and
 pit the details in the Exchange Server section. Eventually I managed to sort it out after hours of phonecalls and was helped by Microsoft and the company I bought my new laptop from. They helped me to put in the IMAP codes and I was eventually able to successfully
 send a test email to myself via Outlook. However, when I now try and open Outlook get a message saying 'The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action'. This comes up in a box and the programme
 will not open. Then another box comes up when you click on OK. A box with Microsoft Exchange comes up with the original incorrect settings that I inputted and there is no option to change it. I then (after clicking ok) get another box with the message saying
 'Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened. Your profile is not configured'. It's been like this for a couple of days and the tech support guys at the shop were I got&nbsp; my laptop and the Microsoft&nbsp;Office product&nbsp;told me to uninstall
 Microsoft Office and reinstall but that was unsuccessful and it's still doing the same thing. I've spent says trying to sort this out and I am really losing patience.&nbsp; I really would have thought that Outlook would have an easy way to correct errors like this.
 Please help!</p>

    <title>Outlook.com Exchange ActiveSync &#40;EAS&#41; Authentication Failing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colinbowern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com Exchange ActiveSync &#40;EAS&#41; Authentication Failing</h2>
                    I reinstalled my PC with Windows 8.1 RTM bits. The Mail app connects fine to my Outlook.com account (running on a custom domain).&nbsp; When I install Outlook 2013 however it is no longer able to connect. This was working fine prior to reinstalling my machine
 from what I recall. It looks like in the past few weeks there have been some EAS issues with Outlook.com so I'm not sure if this is related but since this is the only support channel offered by Microsoft I thought I would add in my report.<br />
<br />
After installing Outlook 2013 I followed the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/add-an-outlook-com-or-other-exchange-activesync-mail-account-HA104025313.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
guidance on setting up an Outlook.com account</a>. This has worked flawlessly many times before. This time it does not want to accept my credentials:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a34e639b-8a4b-46f2-b564-5ef42db843bf" /><br />
<br />
Using Fiddler I can see the call to the server is returning an HTTP 401 Unauthorized as well:<br />
<br />
POST /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync?Cmd=FolderSync&amp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&amp;DeviceId=4BB0759DD9A74D9EA1B032913059EF50&amp;DeviceType=WindowsOutlook15 HTTP/1.1<br />
Connection: Keep-Alive<br />
Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-sync.wbxml<br />
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate<br />
User-Agent: Outlook/15.0 (15.0.4517.1504; MSI; x86)<br />

Content-Length: 13<br />

Authorization: Basic ---password hash removed---<br />
<br />
The password is <b>100% absolutely correct</b>.&nbsp; I have typed it out in Notepad, copied and pasted into the field to verify that there is no typo.&nbsp; Because the Microsoft account behind this also has two-step authentication enabled I have also tried creating
 another app password but that also fails with the same error.<br />
<br />
To summarize:<br />
<ul>
<li>Connected to Outlook.com account on my Windows Phone 8, Windows 8.1 Mail app, but cannot connect using Outlook 2013 on Windows 8.1 (RTM)</li><li>Unauthorized error returned from server</li><li>Same process worked previously while running on Windows 8, Windows 8.1 Preview</li><li>Tried using "www.outlook.com", "m.hotmail.com", "s.outlook.com", and "snt-m.hotmail.com" as server addresses</li><li>Have gone to the <a href="https://status.live.com/detail/outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">service status page</a> and reported problems signing in and syncing email even though it feels sometimes like those reports get routed to /dev/null<br />
</li></ul>
Anyone else having issues connecting to Outlook.com using Outlook desktop client?<br />

            I believe that I found the solution. I used the same server that my Hotmail and Live accounts are using blu-m.hotmail.com and now my Outlook.com email finally works! Wow, what a waste of hours of trial and error. I hope that Microsoft will make changes
 to its documentation and give the proper server name to us!

<h2>            Someone else is using my account but NOT signing in</h2>
                    I receive email from my own account everyday that is NOT from me. It is definitely junk mail...advertisements from companies. I go to security privacy and settings everyday and it shows that I am the only one that has logged into my acct. &nbsp;I cannot block
 the emails because they are from my own email address. How is this possible? I hope someone can tell me how to fix this.

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a spoofing attack, I would suggest you&nbsp;to try changing&nbsp;your Junk filter settings to
<strong>Exclusive</strong>,&nbsp;this setting will only allow emails from your contacts list&nbsp;or safe sender's list to move to Inbox, rest all the emails will be moved to the Junk folder.&nbsp;Therefore, make sure you add&nbsp;all the important domains to the safe senders
 list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Login to <a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com/</a> through your Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;use&nbsp;Outlook.com&nbsp;interface, then&nbsp;follow the steps below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click on the <strong>Gear (Settings) </strong>icon and select <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under <strong>Preventing Junk Mail</strong>, select <strong>filters and reporting</strong>.
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Select <strong>Exclusive&nbsp;</strong>to change the filter level&nbsp;and then select
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use <strong>Outlook.com (Preview)</strong> interface, then follow the steps below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click on the <strong>Gear (Settings) </strong>icon and select <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Expand <strong>Mail &gt; Junk Mail</strong>, click on <strong>filters and reporting</strong>.
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Select <strong>Exclusive&nbsp;</strong>to change the filter level&nbsp;and then select
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately, there’s no option to disable the feature. Skype is now under Microsoft and this is part of their campaign to have the products

                    Suddenly all music files from my music+videos folder was gone. But if I search each song individually from the search bar I could find them and play them but they still wouldn't show up in the music folder. I tried restarting my phone. Didn't help. Same
 problem occurred before. But was fixed after updating my phone very recently. Please let me know if anyone else is facing the same problem and provide me with the solution if possible.

When you close a magnet to a computer screen, you will see the colore change.So, I thought it is not got for small screen in the mobile.

Mind you I think my phone was faulty anyway as it had been repaired once as the scren kept going blank and has now gone back to Nokia for repair. it was only two weeks old, I hope to get it back this side of Christmas.......

There are various technologies for LCDs. But in most cellular applications they are TFT.

    <title>Excel 2016 pauses &#126;10 seconds before responding to some clicks, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorenamelang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 pauses &#126;10 seconds before responding to some clicks, reads MSORES and hits net each time...</h2>
                    <p>I had a VOLUME_KMSCLIENT version of Excel 2016 that was working properly on my Surface Book with the latest Win 10, but I disconnected from the licensing organization. So I just bought a standalone version directly from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Randomly when I click somewhere in the Excel window, on a cell, or an interface button or dropdown selection, or pretty much anywhere, there will be no response at all for about ten seconds. Then the proper event happens normally. Over and over, sometimes
 more than once per minute. In Resource Monitor I see the hit in the CPU graph, and see at least one of several events:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a970125-60fc-4922-9692-3a12699191af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a970125-60fc-4922-9692-3a12699191af" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As caught there, Excel typically reads MSORES.DLL, and C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\VFS\ProgramFilesCommonX86\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE16\Mso40UIwin32client.dll. It also typically hits at least one of 40.122.129.128, 137.116.77 120, or 168.61.149.17,
 all Microsoft servers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another event I frequently see when this happens is a write to C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Application-Experience%4Program-Telemetry.evtx. Looking at that log, these happen over and over, maybe twice an hour, with exactly the same message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/620bdd94-ebff-4faa-87c8-53648f7aa872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/620bdd94-ebff-4faa-87c8-53648f7aa872" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are not logged nearly as often as the paused clicks happen, and about twenty different apps get the same "fix" reports over and over in the log, so that may be a separate problem, but I did notice some of them happening during the click pauses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This random nagging delay makes the new Excel very clumsy to use. The old Excel never did this, on exactly the same Surface Book. Needless to say I'm frustrated that Microsoft's premier product won't run properly on their own flagship hardware...&nbsp; I did
 uninstall the previous version from Programs and Features before loading the newly purchased one, but maybe some registry setting got left behind?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet is very slow and expensive so I've tried to turn off all the "telemetry". Is there some way to stop Excel from calling home?
</p>

            Hi Loren,<br />
<br />
There are some possible reasons why Excel 2016 is not responding or is freezing. The registry entries from the previous Office installation that you had would be less likely to cause such. However, it's performance can depend on the file size of the spreadsheet
 that you are working with or the add-ins that are affecting the functions of Excel 2016.<br />
<br />
To resolve issues with Excel 2016, you may follow the steps provided on this link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Excel: How to Troubleshoot Crashing and Not Responding Issues with Excel</a>.<br />
<br />
Regarding Telemetry, you can also check if the Telemetry logs are enabled. If it is, disable it as well and check if it helps. Simply open
<br />
<strong>Telemetry Log for Office 2016</strong>, go to <strong>System Info</strong> worksheet, then set the "<strong>Telemetry logging</strong>" to
<strong>Disabled</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            <p>Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Troubleshoot" page was surprisingly thorough and accurate, but no help. The only thing OffCAT found was an update needed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update downloaded 365MB (took 23 minutes here) to update Excel that was newly installed a week ago. It restarted in about ten seconds. Problem as bad as ever.
<br />
<br />
Safe mode showed first start setup choices...&nbsp; Problem bad as ever, even button highlights on mouseover are delayed.
<br />
<br />
Disabling add-ins made no difference. <br />
<br />
Problem happens with a new blank workbook, or no open file at all. <br />
<br />
Defender is the only AV installed. <br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt; Simply open <strong>Telemetry Log for Office 2016</strong></p>
<p>I can't find any such thing. Is it a file? Where? </p>

You can disable the Telemetry by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start Menu</strong>, type <strong>Telemetry Log for Office 2016</strong> and hit enter.</li><li>Go to <strong>System info worksheet</strong>.</li><li>Set the Telemetry logging to <strong>Disabled</strong>.</li></ol>

            <p>Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the Start menu - "No results found".&nbsp; It looks like your system has the huge telemetry management system installed. Mine does not. I've seen the pages about how to set it up for a corporate environment, but it seems like way too much effort for the
 slight chance that's what is causing my delays. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The more obvious symptoms are that Excel typically reads MSORES.DLL, and C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\VFS\ProgramFilesCommonX86\Microsoft Shared\OFFICE16\Mso40UIwin32client.dll. It also typically hits at least one of 40.122.129.128, 137.116.77
 120, or 168.61.149.17, all Microsoft servers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So is MSO "Microsoft Online Services (MSO)"? Or is it just "MicroSoft Office"?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MSORES.DLL responsible for all the internet activity? Why should Excel need to read parts of dll files over and over again? I have many GB of free memory it could be loaded to. And why should it need to contact Microsoft every time I move my mouse?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The volume license version of Excel I had before didn't need to do all this...</p>

            <p>I live in "Northwest Nowhere" and pay more for my WISP bandwidth than most people pay for cellular data - and it is slower. I can't even do a "repair" from here - Microsoft eventually decides I'm not connected. I did find out how to download an "Offline
 Installer" (sign in to your Office account), but it will have to wait until I get to a city.

<p>
</p><p>Will be interesting to find out if that helps...&nbsp; Nothing the MS phone support people recommended did. They finally said re-install.

            Yesterday, on a proper Comcast cable internet connection in the closest thing our county has to a city, I downloaded the 2.7 GB Offline Installer. Twice. The first try failed with no explanation at about 2.5 GB.
<br />
<br />
Today I uninstalled Microsoft Excel 2016 - en-us&nbsp; 9/24/2016&nbsp; 821 MB&nbsp; 16.0.7167.2060<br />
Installer process stayed on "step 1 of 4" until the "complete" dialog appeared...<br />
Restarted<br />
Deleted Roaming Excel15.xlb<br />

Left Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.v9.0.ni.dll (looks like part of VisualStudio)<br />
<br />
Installed Excel Retail Image 16.0.6741.2048 - complete at 161012-14:42<br />
Installers say 16.0.6701.1029<br />
Data says 16.0.6741.2048<br />
<br />
Office Updates says 16.0.6741.2048<br />
<br />
Offline Installer didn't ask 32 or 64-bit! <br />
About Excel says 16.0.6701.1029, 32-bit<br />
Oh, well, at least now we know both 32 and 64-bit versions have the same problem!
<br />
<br />
In the initial setup, the "Let's stay in touch" (Forced!) choice of English already showed the delayed reaction bug!<br />
<br />
Put my Product Key into the online account, and it says:<br />
Microsoft Excel 2016<br />
For 1 PC. Added to account on Friday, September 9, 2016 (date of the original purchase, install).<br />
But now it wants me to install again! <br />
And there seems to be no way to install the downloaded image... &nbsp;<br />
It shows up in Explorer as a DVD drive, but didn't trigger any "insertion" actions.
<br />
<br />
But if you abandon the web path and go back to Excel, <br />
"Redeem Online" is now checked and it says <br />
"This computer has been added to your account"<br />
<br />
Seems alive, but ridiculous delays and huge CPU usage are as bad as ever. <br />

<br />
Called Support back, referred to original debugging session case. <br />
They went through the whole ritual again, I told them item by item, each one had already failed last time.
<br />
<br />
So then they told me that was all the support I could get unless I paid $150 for a premium service. I got a bit angry and yelled at the rep, I'm not going to pay more than the cost of the product for support of a brand new package. After I went through that
 scene twice, she arranged for an escalation tech to call me tomorrow. Should be interesting... &nbsp;<br />

            <p>So Microsoft Support called back today. Set up a remote control session, and despite my explanation that downloading a new install would be impossible (and wastefully expensive) on my rural internet connection, immediately began the multi-GB download. Once
 again I had to get angry and order her to stop. She insisted she was not downloading anything, but I pointed out my Resource Monitor tray icon pegged to max, and after much arguing she finally stopped. About the fourth time I explained that I had downloaded
 the full DVD image in the city earlier this week, she finally agreed to use that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Excel re-installed. Strangely it did not require the product key or re-registration to the Microsoft account - I guess because she did not uninstall the previous version first?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before opening Excel she killed my Resource Monitor tray icon, so neither of us could see the CPU usage...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Excel opened she immediately changed my preference of "Show Tabs" to show the full Ribbon full-time. I had no idea that mattered, and with that setting Excel appeared to work normally! We could navigate all over the Ribbon and the choices highlighted
 instantly as the mouse moved over them. Actual commands happened immediately. I had to agree that the problem seemed fixed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after she disconnected, I noticed a right-click left of a row and then Insert or Delete was still delayed. I set my preference back to "Show Tabs", and the whole problem was instantly back with a vengeance. With the Ribbon items in drop-down mode, the
 CPU usage spikes up above 50% on all four, and stays there until I click back on a cell in the sheet and the ribbon items get hidden again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was watching this in the Windows Resource Monitor app, and happened to notice that while the Ribbon was showing, the MessageEase Macro Writer entry also began creeping up until it was the top CPU consumer - but still only a nominal 10%, not the over 50%
 shown by the third party Resource Monitor tray icon. (I've seen that before, the recent Adobe Reader bug they just fixed would show maybe 10% CPU in the numerical displays of the ResMon app or even Sysinternals Process Explorer, but would show well over 50%
 of all four CPUs on the tray icon, and would paralyze all other apps and make the screen uncomfortably hot to look at.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close MEOK and the Excel delays go away. So I guess Microsoft can say my problem is caused by a third-party app. But it doesn't cause any problem for any other app, OR FOR THE VOLUME LICENSE VERSION OF EXCEL 2016! At some point it seems they should take
 a bit of responsibility...&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And I can't help but wonder...&nbsp; Did she change my ribbon preference because she knows there is a problem with "Show Tabs"? Otherwise why would she intentionally do that? Seems a basic principle of support and debugging is to test things using the customer's
 preferences. (This is probably attributing way too much intention and intelligence to what was probably just a personal habit, but it does strike me as strange.)

<p>So, I'm not really quite sure I understand your question.</p>
<p>If you are NOT using Wi-Fi and are "connected", then you must be connected using your Data plan.&nbsp; On my device (Blackjack), when I am connected the icon in the upper right corner changes from the standard tower symbol to a symbol with an "E"
 and a strength meter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have a smartphone with Wi-Fi but on a pocket PC, you change how you are connecting via connections.&nbsp; I'm assuming on your smartphone, you would make that change in a similar fashion via Settings/ Connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, on my Pocket PC devices, the icon reflects the connection status in the upper right.</p>

<p>Thanks for answering!<br />
so what do you mean by data plan?</p>
<p>i guess the&nbsp;E is for edge and when i use it, it appears on the upper right as well. but i was really shocked that i could surf on the internet / get directions (which normally works through gprs or wifi, but wifi was deactivated) and no sign
 in that upper right corner appeared (as it usually does then).</p>
<p>i dont really know now if it was a bug, cuz i restarted the phone and i tried both applications one more time, and it connects to gprs now!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but anyways, ive see a wm phone of a friend of mine, and everytime he just opens a program which needs internet, like the internet explorer, he is first getting asked which connection he wants to use! but on my phone, it just directly connects
 to gprs. even when im connected to wifi, and i check my emails through windows live / outlook, it connects to gprs which is not necessary at that point.</p>
<p>any ideas? ;-)</p>

<p>And that is correct.&nbsp; The settings on your device are set to use your Data connection when you access the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Data connection is that little extra you pay for with your phone plan to have the ability to connect to the Internet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to use the Wi-Fi to connect to the net, then you would have to go into the connection settings and change them to use use Wi-Fi rather than the Data connection.</p>

<p>okay thanks, makes sense!</p>
<p>is there any other opportunity except of deleting the gprs connections (because i maybe sometimes use gprs)? i think this is maybe phone specific in windows mobile..!? and in this context, what does gprs authentification mean?! is there any
 option where i can just say, use wifi instead of gprs or where i can just deactivate gprs?</p>

<p>You have two options:&nbsp; GPRS or Wi-Fi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you decide to access the net via GPRS (your phone's ISP) then you cannot access it via Wi-Fi and visa versa</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You set your connection through the settings depending on what you are going to use.&nbsp; For example, I use a Palm 750 and a Cingular 8525 daily.&nbsp; If I am driviing, I prefer to use the Palm.&nbsp; It is the better overall device for one handed operation.&nbsp;
 SO when I get at home, I may decide to surf the net and check my email on the 8525 but my SIM is in the Palm 750.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I set the connection to use "WORK" rather than My ISP and turn on Wi-Fi.&nbsp; Now I can surf via my home wireless network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I decide to put the SIM card back in my 8525, I then go in and change the Connection setting back to My ISP so I can use the Data connection (GPRS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<h2>            Integrating outlook 2016 with mac mail, contact and calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I am looking for a solution to integrate mac mail, mac contacts and mac calendar with Outlook 2016 for mac. The problem I am facing is here. Today our company is using about 30% of human resource coming from outside the full time hired employee perimeter.
 In this scenario often we need to share information based on a multiplatform scenario from the applicative point of view. Some of us is using Mac mail since ever and was not considering using Outlook since now. Moreover the subscription 365 brings advantage
 where a domain is established where integrating Mac calendar in outlook or viceversa may be very useful. Still seems vey difficult or maybe even not possible to use both application together updating reciprocally information from calendar, contacts and mail.
 If the two application will be not updatable together, the only possible choice for a Mac user will be to establish an MS mail user in Mac mail not using Outlook at all. This will permit to receive and update internal agenda on calendar with the only limit
 of not being able to have a full pic of the enterprise scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that this area is where "user fidelity" is more "built", but is not that because word, powerpoint and excel are a standard Mac user will resign from the OS and his main features...</p>
<p>So finally here the question summarised !!</p>
<p>Have you any possible idea of how close integrate the two applicative environment in a single mac ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank in advance for any serious suggestion any of you may have..</p>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p>
<p>I know you want to integrate the Mac service (Mail, Contact and Calendar) with Outlook for Mac so that the change in any side can be updated to the other side. If the situation is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>If so, it is not feasible to do that. You may submit your feedback to our related team via the link:
<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/299916-office-365-service-updates-and-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office365.uservoice.com/.../299916-office-365-service-updates-and-changes</a>. Many&nbsp; features have been designed or upgraded based on customers’ constructive ideas.</p>
<p>In addition, based on my experience, we can try to back up the data in the Mac service to Outlook for Mac and vice versa so that the data can be viewed simultaneously. To do so:<br />
1.&nbsp;Export the data from the Mac service into a “PST” file or “OlM” file and <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-items-into-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
import the data file into Outlook for Mac 2016</a> (or <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-information-into-Outlook-for-Mac-2011-b641c4ea-ece2-47c5-8bd5-9d3159ae6186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook for Mac 2011</a>).<br />
2.&nbsp;Create corresponding folders in Finder and drag and drop the messages from within Outlook to that folder. Then you can import to Mac services from those folders/files.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: The above steps can integrate the Mac service with Outlook for Mac. But, it can’t achieve the upgrading with each other.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi MLSchuk,,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>About the issue, I would like to explain that the Excel files larger than 10M in SharePoint library can’t be opened with Excel Online. This information can be found in the article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/File-size-limits-for-workbooks-in-SharePoint-Online-9e5bc6f8-018f-415a-b890-5452687b325e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
File size limits for workbooks in SharePoint Online</a>. Given the situation, the best practice is opening and editing the large excel files with the Excel desktop client.</p>
<p>In addition, you can also submit feedback via <a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273492-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Pete,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Here is what I did with the answer using your formula coming out as 6.00 not 6.25:</p>
<p>
</p><p>B3 = 5:15 PM</p>
<p>A3 = 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Formula typed in:&nbsp; =(B3*1440-A3*1440)/60</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal EXCEL subtraction of B3-A3 gives 6:15 which is 6 hours and 15 minutes.&nbsp; I want it to show 6.25 hours.&nbsp; For some reason your answer came out as 6:00.&nbsp; Looks like it truncated the 15 minutes off the subtraction.</p>

<p>C:\windows\ie7</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed instructions 1 to 5:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To uninstall Internet Explorer 8, follow these steps: </p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carefully select and then copy the following command:
</p>
<p><b>%windir%\ie8\spuninst\spuninst.exe</b></p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run</strong>.</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <span>Open</span> box, type <span>Cmd.exe</span>, and then press Enter.</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right-click inside the <strong>Cmd.exe</strong> window, and then click
<strong>Paste</strong> to paste the command that you copied in step 1.</p>
<p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press Enter to uninstall Internet Explorer 8.</p>
<p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the program is removed, restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following window appeared:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use this wizard to remove the following software update</p>
<p><b>Windows Internet Explorer release Candidate 1</b></p>
<p>To continue click next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did and got:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Setup cannot copy the <b>file hmmapi.dll.mui</b>.<br />
Ensure that the location specified below is correct, or change it and insert&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Windows NT service pack Uninstall directory" in the drive you specify."<br />
<br />
The <b>hmmapi.dll.mui</b> file can be found in folder ie8(2).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ie8(2) has a folder called <b>spuninst</b> but it is empty, so when I change&nbsp;</p>
<p>the path&nbsp; to read:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b>%windir%\ie8(2)\spuninst\spuninst.exe&nbsp; </b>It obviously does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried uninstalling&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Windows Internet Explorer release Candidate 1 </b>
using the add/remove program<b>&nbsp;</b>from the control panel with exactly the same result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 8 for windows XP, keeps being offered under Optional Software Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, II have no idea how ie8(2) got there so I did not attempt anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>It seems that you are facing issues while uninstalling Internet Explorer 8.

 8 and the duplicate entries. Refer to the link for more details:</span></p>

</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you
 don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>

            You can use a report and a sub report for this provided your table design is correct. The event would go in the main report. The participants would go in the sub report. The master/child links would be the event's primary key and the event key in the participants
 table.

            The first thing you need to do is create a query that lists all the data you want on your report. Don't worry if the query repeats some data (like event info) on each row. Once you have this query, use the Report Wizard to create your report. Select to
 Group by Event. You can then move event info into the Group header and display the participant info in the Detail.&nbsp;

<div>The Report Wizard will walk you through the basic process, then you can modify your report to format etc.</div>

            <p>Before you start designing reports you need to tell us - or establish! - the structure of the Tables involved. Do you already have tables set up? or are you working backwards, designing the report first and then fitting the tables to the reports? If so don't:
 it's vital to come up with a properly normalized table design first. The report is an end product, not&nbsp;a good design tool!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to identify the Entities - real-life things, persons or events - relevant to your application. I'd see tables for Sites, Participants, Instructors, Events, Topics, and a many to many resolver table Participation (linked to Events and to Participants);
 given these tables, a Report could be based on a Query and you could use the report's Sorting and Grouping dialog to display the event data in a group header and the participants in the detail section. But starting with the report as the first step is the
 cart before the horse putting!</p>

                    <p>Original title: Reformat and Reinstall Builds since ... </p>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem with Build 10166, that Windows Crashed while Setting up your Apps, so I rolled back to Build 10162.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am thinking because it doesn't fix anything in rolling back to the last Build installed, where it does indeed work and the operating system works, Windows Update, fails to offer again Build 10166.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I think I need to reformat and reinstall Build 10162. (Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit), because Windows Build 10162, fails to offer again Build 10166.</p>
<p>

                    About 9 mos. ago, I received an email from Microsoft directly. It wants me to buy a copy of Office 2010 Home and Student. It premised me that if I did so then when Office 2013 is issued publicly, I'll receive the 2013 version of the Home and Student for
 free. Now the Office 2013 has been out for some months, but I never heard from you about your promise. Microsoft has always complained about those Chinese pirates steeling your software. I think what you have don't to me is similar to those pirates' action.&nbsp;

<h2>            Win 10 mobile update - not enough storage issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>Anybody know how to get round a Win 10 update for a Nokia phone with 8gb storage when the system tells me it needs 700mb space for the upgrade and I have no ability to create that space. Everything installed on the phone is Microsoft apps etc and cannot
 be moved or uninstalled (greyed out) so I cannot make sufficient room. Mail and calendar is over 2gb in size (why?) but no options to reduce this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install gets to 100% preparing installation and then complains about lack of space. Have masses of space on sd card but can't move anything to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas - apart from getting a phone with more storage! Thanks</p>

            The extremely unpleasant solution for your issue is to perform a hard reset and then do the update before restoring, i.e. do another hard reset after installing the update. I'm afraid there is no other way.

            <p><span>Hi Gary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your update via private message. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, your third party application crashes when they try to connect to Outlook client, and the Outlook client is working fine with the email address.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business online service and Outlook client works fine, for the third party application crashes issue, I would suggest you look for help from these third party application support.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your understanding. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Poppy</span></p>

            Upon running some more tests it seems 3rd party application crashes when the executable file is packed with a exe-packer such as ASPack. Uncompressed executable file works fine. Until the last office update the same executable file worked without any issues
 with any version of Outlook.&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I am glad to hear that you find the root cause of the issue. I would like to make a summary of the case:</span></p>
<p><span>Issue: 3<sup>rd </sup>party application crashes when send emails in the Outlook client.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Root cause: The executable file is packed with an exe-packer such as ASPack.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Solution: Unpack the executable file for the 3<sup>rd</sup> party application.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Poppy</span></p>
