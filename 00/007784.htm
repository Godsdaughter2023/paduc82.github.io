    <title>Is there a permanent fix for the recurring Large Operation error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there a permanent fix for the recurring Large Operation error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been having trouble with this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The operation you are about to perform affects a large number of cells and may take a significant amount of time to complete. &nbsp;Are you sure you want to continue?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix Alt-F11, Ctrl-G, ActiveSheet.UsedRange fixes the problem temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I hid all the unused rows and columns in the worksheet, that no longer works. &nbsp;I was hoping the Hide option would eliminate the problem with it thinking the page is bigger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs only on a very large spreadsheet with the range rows CD to columns 18969 on one sheet (there are 5 sheets but the other 4 are much smaller). &nbsp;Pretty much every time I use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the huge amount of data on the spreadsheet, manually copying everything across to a new spreadsheet is not an option. &nbsp;It's several years old and was originally saved in .xls format. &nbsp;Courtesy of the change in colours between Office
 2002 and Office 2013, I would get constant error messages on the .xls spreadsheet every time I tried to save it, saying that some features were incompatible. &nbsp;Therefore I saved it as an .xlsx spreadsheet and now I have this new problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are around 4 basic formulas on the spreadsheet so it can't be that. &nbsp;3 only refer to cells with existing data, and the other formula points upwards into the existing data in the middle of the spreadsheet. &nbsp;None are referencing cells outside the current
 existing data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot move columns on the spreadsheet without hiding most of the empty cells. &nbsp;If I hide the cells, the fix doesn't work so I can't add more rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening, as far as I can tell, EVERY TIME I use the spreadsheet. &nbsp;Trying to fix it means I'm spending more time trying to fix it than I am actually working on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a permanent fix? &nbsp;Will saving it back as .xls format remove the Large Operation problem? &nbsp;(I am going to try that as a temporary fix but jumping between formats sounds a pretty stupid way to do things.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, I am unable to use Excel 2013 as it is wasting my time. &nbsp;I upgraded so I would be up-to-speed on a recent version. &nbsp;Now I'm up-to-speed on going on the Microsoft community and Google trying to find fixes for all the problems it's coming up with.
 &nbsp;I thought the idea of upgrading things is to make them better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, both my upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 and my upgrade from Office 2002 to Office 2013 haven't impressed me. &nbsp;There are far more things that don't work than that do. &nbsp;Namely, the things I USE. &nbsp;If I can't use the program, I see no reason for
 having it. &nbsp;I'm still vacillating on rolling back to Windows 7 because of the non-working functions in Windows 8 (I use 7 Pro and Microsoft is apparently going to support that until 2020, so I'd have 4 years or so before having to upgrade, by which time they'll
 probably have brought out Windows 11). &nbsp;The bugs - I mean features - in Office 2013 aren't impressing me. &nbsp;I just want it to do some basic calculations and for me to be able to move data around easily. &nbsp;I can't move data without error messages left, right
 and centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to restrict the number of rows/columns in a spreadsheet? &nbsp;Permanently, I mean. &nbsp;I don't want to have to mess around changing things every time I use a file.</p>
<p>

            <p>I believe the problem may have been with a hyperlink I didn't know existed. &nbsp;I've used the spreadsheet twice since clicking to delete all hyperlinks and haven't had the problem. &nbsp;I will have to wait and see if it crops up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I previously tried to highlight all unused rows and columns and clicked Delete which didn't fix the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Katerina, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are conditions that can prevent you from changing your country/region. Here are the reasons why:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You changed country/regions within the last three months.</li><li>Your account is currently suspended (for example, the credit card on one of your subscriptions has expired).</li><li>You are a minor (as defined by applicable law) in your current country/region and will not be a minor in the region you’re moving to.</li><li>You are not a minor (as defined by applicable law) in your current country/region but will be considered a minor in the country/region you’re moving to.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know the error message or code that you received when changing your region?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 </h2>
                    I purchased a Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 about 3 months ago and it was working flawlessly until last week when it just stopped.&nbsp; I changed the battery; deleted and reloaded the drivers and software; confirmed the USB ports were working; and did additional
 troubleshooting through the control panel to no avail.&nbsp; When removing the tranceiver I noted that it was very hot to the touch, I also noted that when I plugged it back in after letting it cool the computer would either not register the device or say there
 was an unknown device on that particularl USB port (I tried multiple ports as well).&nbsp; The mouse also wouldn't work on my wife's Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; Is the transceiver just bad or what?

<br />
Your question is vague.&nbsp; A concrete example would help, showing both the original data and some demonstration or clear explanation of how you want it changed.&nbsp; See instructions below.<br />
<br />
But perhaps this will help....<br />
<br />
If your data is in A1:A500, click on Data, Data Analysis and select Moving Average.&nbsp; Enter A1:A500 into the Input Range field, enter the number of "days" (cells) to average into the Interval field, and enter B1:B500 (some new range) into the Output Range field.&nbsp;
 Then click OK.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are many other ways to smooth a curve.&nbsp; If that is not what you had in mind, you need to be more specific.<br />
<br />
To provide a concrete example, upload an example Excel file (devoid of any private data) that demonstrates the problem to a file-sharing website.<br />
<br />
Then post the "shared", "public" or "view-only" link (aka URL; http://...) in a response here.<br />

<h2>            Problem with viewing pdf files on Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello<br />
<br />
<br />
I am unable to access links to pdf files using Internet Explorer (IE), although I can do so via Google Chrome.&nbsp; The response I receive on attempting to access the relevant links via IE is a white page with a small icon (typically a circle with a diagonal line&nbsp;across
 the diameter) in the left-hand corner.&nbsp;I have both Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat installed on my computer. The version of IE used appears to make no difference. For example, updating to Internet Explorer 11 did not&nbsp;solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I noted that
 when&nbsp;another person&nbsp;logged onto my PC using their separate account, the problem disappeared. The person who did this was a&nbsp;member of the computing support staff at my&nbsp;university and the PC belongs to the University, which in turn means that my logon details
 originate with the University.&nbsp;&nbsp;The computing support staff member was baffled as to the source of the problem and how it could be resolved. Can you&nbsp;help, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 IS NOT FINISHED&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> obi_alfred  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 IS NOT FINISHED&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I've said this months ago. Microsoft is rushing Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have <strong>9 days </strong>until the official release of Windows 10 and the OS STILL feels unfinished in many areas. Don't get me wrong Microsoft. You guys have made a lot of progress since the earlier builds and the bugs are going away, but what hasn't
 left is the unpolished feel of the OS. I know you guys are relying on continually updating after the release but I still think you need to hold your horses and get this release right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to push the release back into September 29th and polish the OS. Finish the Tablet Mode because it does not feel finished and whole, let the mobile and Xbox One version of the OS catch up in development, continue bug smashing, and give every
 insider a small survey asking if the OS is polished to their liking. If more than 70% say no than they should push the release again. I don't see why they can't dedicate two extra months to actually sit down and listen to our feedback along with polishing
 every nook and cranny of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Before I end this, here's a quick list of things that need to be polished:</p>
<p>
</p><p>+The Music Store is super bland. Get rid of some of the white spaces (especially in the Album pages). Add more space for cover art and add more transparency elements.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>+As I am typing I found something that needs polish. When I right click a misspelled word it shows the old Windows 8 right click menu. Change it to the current Microsoft Edge menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Groove Music (hate the name) needs serious polish. The layout needs to be changed for easier browsing and things need to be organized better. The App feels like it is missing a lot of things too. Even a logo or art. For example the tile is just some bland
 tile with a disk on it. I'm assuming you guys are not finished but that proves my point that you need to delay Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Tablet Mode needs attention ASAP. They're is a huge thread right on this site, and it is not being heard. Tablet Mode is unfinished. It is missing many features from Windows 8.1. Heck its missing many basic animations such as the flip when a user opens
 an app. It feels like Microsoft totally forgot about the tablet experience. That needs an extra two months of attention.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Consistency. Get rid of anything that does not fit with the new design language. Hide legacy things such as control panel and make the Settings app more robust. Get rid of every little remnant from older windows versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Windows Security. Windows gets the most viruses out of any operating system. It's about time Microsoft does something about it. Windows Defender needs to be far better than what it is right now. Malwarebytes works so much better and finds far more malware.
 Windows Defender needs to be heavily integrated into the OS and needs to PREVENT malware and virus from getting in the system. The program also needs to be updated to the Windows 10 Modern UI design and needs to be an app not a program. The OS should be virus
 free like Mac OSX. Bloatware should not be allowed in Windows anymore. From now on 3rd party hardware vendors should not be able to add bloat but instead offer optional apps. (Like in Windows Phone).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Listen to feedback. Take the two months to add things people want. </p>
<p>
</p><p>+Make the OS as lightweight as possible. Shed all unnecessary bloat. Decrease the file size and optimize the OS to be a fast smooth experience on any device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Don't focus too much on business and productivity. It is important but also focus on the fun things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Even on Build 10240 there are missing animations and many many bugs. Come on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>+Make us <strong>WANT</strong> Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I like Windows 10 but Microsoft is rushing the living hell out of this OS. Windows is such a big operating System and this is one of Microsoft's most important updates. They really need to listen to our feedback and they need to set a few months solely for
 polish. </p>

            <p><em>"+Consistency. Get rid of anything that does not fit with the new design language. Hide legacy things such as control panel and make the Settings app more robust. Get rid of every little remnant from older windows versions. "</em></p>
<p>Do that, and it won't be Windows! I don't want Control Panel hidden, I want "legacy" things PUT BACK in Control Panel!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"+Listen to feedback. Take the two months to add things people want. "</em></p>

</p><p>They haven't listened up to this point, Why should they start now?</p>

</p><p><em>"+Make the OS as lightweight as possible. Shed all unnecessary bloat. Decrease the file size and optimize the OS to be a fast smooth experience on any device. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>What? I guess that depends on what YOU call bloat! I don't want a phone OS on my desktop PC. The way they are going with this, they wouldn't be done till Dec. 2050!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't seen an app that is worthy of my time.&nbsp; I'll keep my Win32 programs instead! They're much better anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it YOU want to take away CHOICE from the rest of the Windows users? The OS as it stands is bland, ugly, and on my testbed, slow as well. It's even slower that Vista HP was on it. And I've added three times more RAM (1GB to 4GB) and upgraded the processor
 (1.5gHz to 2gHz) since.</p>

            <p>With possibly &nbsp;1 billion users Microsoft will never come close to satisfying every user.&nbsp; They have received input from close to 1 million Windows insiders. I can see in the different builds that they have made changes and I see a lot that looks good. I
 have used Windows operating systems starting with Dos until the present and I really feel that Windows 10 has the most to offer. I can truthfully say that while it still has some issues I like it. While they plan to continue upgrading I do not think that they
 plan to release a product that functions poorly. With that said, I agree 10 days does not seem like enough time. However I think it is like writing a book no matter how many rewrites you do it is always just a rough draft until you publish. I look forward
 to July 29th and I will continue to send in feedback. Windows 10 is free the upgrades or free now and in the future and if one should wish to continue with windows 8.1 or 7 that's an option.&nbsp; There are positive features to Windows 7 and 8.1 that might be favored
 over some features in Windows 10 but in a feature by feature comparison I think Windows 10 would win hands down.&nbsp; I would love to see some of the features you noted in your comment on Windows 10 and maybe we will.
</p>
<p>Microsoft is a business if they offer wifi or any other product that I do not have a need for I just do not use it.&nbsp; You provided good detailed information and it should give Microsoft something to think about.</p>

            <p>Recommended.</p>
<p>And I would add this list too:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><span>Final RTM Build - 10240 - Bugs and Feedback List V1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NEW:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar Live Tile doesn't update itself (Tablet Mode);</strong></li><li><strong>HERE Maps app crashes on opening after a while (Tablet Mode);</strong></li><li><strong>Native Maps app doesn't have Bus/Metro paths, but only on Foot and Car (Italy);</strong></li><li><strong>Right clicking on an App in App List, and clicking to "Add to Start" does nothing, and app isn't added. Dragging it with a mouse or with touch work fine (Tablet Mode);</strong></li><li><strong>Tablet Mode: when opening File Explorer or any legacy desktop program/window there is a "double-animation" of the window opening in full screen. Annoying;</strong></li><li><strong>Lock Password Image "blinks to white" before I can enter my image password, I assume it's a bug. Never seen something like that on 8/8.1;</strong></li><li><strong>When rebooting, it often appears a window saying "Waiting for the programs to close before rebooting". Very Windows 7-Style and annoying, never seen something like that in 8/8.1;</strong></li><li><strong
<p>Plus:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Full Screen/Immersive Edge is missing (auto-hiding and animated menu bar / address / favourites&nbsp;bar while scrolling + Swipe Back/Forward like Metro.IE11);</li><li>Official support of TPLs (Tracking Protection Lists) inside Edge settings pane (manual hack doesn't work anymore);</li><li>Better Multi-Display support (Tablet Mode on one display, Desktop on another for example);</li><li>3+ Snappable Apps in Tablet mode.</li></ul>
<p>Plus:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make "Auto-Hide Taskbar" setting independent between Tablet Mode and Desktop mode (with independent Sync between devices);</li><li>Give the option to disable the hamburger menu at start screen in Tablet mode;</li><li>In notification/action center give the option to adjust brightness level from 0-100% just like charm bar;</li><li>Give the option completely disable the taskbar at start screen in Tablet Mode;</li><li>Fix the switching language on touch keyboard just like ios/android keyboard behavior;</li><li>Enable Swipe Virtual&nbsp;Keyboard like Windows Mobile 10</li><li>Import Metro.IE Web&nbsp;Live Tiles into Edge Web&nbsp;Live Tiles missing;</li><li>Improve snapping with mouse while in Tablet Mode.</li></ul>
<p>Plus</p>
<ul>
<li>8.1 Start Screen will not transfer over to Windows 10. Not only does 10 make no effort to import my Start Screen, it no longer supports key features of it:&nbsp;<br />
* Tile sets are limited to 1 large and 1 medium tile wide. Some of my groups are 3 large tiles wide<br />
* Web site live tiles no longer show live RSS content consistently - some sites work, others don't<br />
* Start backgrounds are no longer supported<br />
* Start colors are not customizable -- they follow the accent color</li><li>In tablet mode, opening a new app when two others are snapped erases the snap relationship requiring the user to re-snap apps (i.e. the app opens full screen instead of asking for a target pane like in 8.1).</li><li>Resizable snap is only available in Tablet mode, and Tablet mode is not available when using multiple monitors</li><li>Resizable snap and resizable desktop windows are now mutually exclusive. Allow option to resize desktop apps in tablet mode.</li><li>8.1 allowed snapping from the task list but the task view that replaces it does not allow snapping. Snapping is also impossible from the task bar.</li><li>In Tablet mode, snap is limited to two panes per monitor -- down from four in 8.1</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally, I suggest you to copy this whole list, and report it to your Insider Feedback App, UserVoice, and official Gabe Aul Twitter account too at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Well I guess Microsoft can keep polishing and adding this stuff after release but that's not good. It's better to polish and get a good OS out THEN worry about adding new features instead of now having to polish it after release.&nbsp;

</p><p>No, but it doesn't look like they're satisfying very many users at that either.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

</p><p>The most requested changes have been largely ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I too have been using Microsoft since DOS. (v3.3) through the present. I don't know how you can say it has the most to offer, when it has the least amount of options since Win3.0. The only thing truly new to the OS DIRECT FROM Microsoft, is the ability to
 have multiple desktops. Up until Win10, that has been a third-party option.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>While they plan to continue upgrading I do not think that they plan to release a product that functions poorly.

<p>
</p><p>I'm sure they don't want to release a poorly finished product, but IMHO, they are anyway.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrades to Win10 are free, but only for the lifetime of the device. As quite a few people will be upgrading on PCs that are probably as much as 5 years old, how long will they get it for free?</p>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Myself and a host of others ave been asking through the "feedback" app, for options to add themes (i.e.: Win2000, Win7, Win8, etc.)and FULL controls for them. We have been asking to be able to change borders, title bars, the start menu, etc. (again), but
 we've been ignored. Personally, I have a hard time discerning window borders, I need something that is easier to see. Looking at title bars and finding the one that is active compared to the inactive one is only possible by actually clicking in the window
 I want to use, as ALT-TAB doesn't seem to work (or at least not on my system). I prefer a cascading(fly-out) start menu. therefore, I use Classic Shell on my Win7 PCs, because I'm only allowed the little boxed in POS menu the gave us.</p>
<p>Classic Shell doesn't fix those, and like Start10, and the other&nbsp;"Start Menu"replacements, it truly only gives us start menu options, and nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, feature for feature, Win10 looses hands down.</p>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to see all the features that have been asked for since Win8 was released, but Microsoft, in its infinite insanity, has done nothing but take away features starting with Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you. I try my best, but it doesn't appear that Microsoft is listening to anybody that doesn't like the vision they have for "one OS to rule them all".</p>

    <title>Is it possible to recover anything from a 0 KB PST file&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrybenson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to recover anything from a 0 KB PST file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey folks! I'm in big trouble. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The day before yesterday, my Outlook data file turned into a 0 KB file. When I tried to open the PST file, I received an error. And when I checked the file size, I found it was 0 KB. The actual size was near about 5 GB. I do have no earthly idea what happened
 here. I searched a lot on Google about this issue and found many articles there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This article contains some useful and relevant information -&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.semnaitik.com/outlook-email-recovery-0-kb-pst-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://semnaitik.com/outlook-email-recovery-0-kb-pst-file/</a>&nbsp;It says there's no
 way to recover anything from a 0 KB PST file. But some are recommending me a 3rd party PST Recovery tool to recover content from it. Have I really lost my mailbox or is there any chance for recovery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>No, you cannot recover anything from a 0 KB file as reported in Windows. If you want to try one of the applications, choose one with a free trial - it will show you what it can recover - it should be nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the data file opens in outlook and the folders are all showing 0 file size when you right click on a folder and choose Properties &gt; Folder Size but the data file is large in windows, then yes, you can recover.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am trying to map SharePoint to a network drive and I am getting the error, "Access Denied. Before opening files in this location, you must first add the web site to your trusted sites list, browse to the web site, and select the option to login automatically."</p>

<p>Which offer a hotfix for windows 7 and 8 (not 10), or which require me to go to the "Library ribbon" (which does not exist on my SharePoint site) or to click the "Library Tab" (see: does not exist on my site). They aren't "grayed out"... they just aren't
 there. A few things suggested to edit the AllItems.aspx file, which (surprise, surprise) does not exist on my site. I have administrator rights, so I would be able to see it if it existed, correct?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I either get the Library tab to show up, get the library ribbon to show up, edit the AllItems.aspx form, or just get the network drive to map?</p>

<p><span>Hi Ron_902,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you encountered the following issues.</span></p>
<p><span>1. When you try to map a network drive location, you get the error message “Access Denied. Before opening files in this location, you must first add the web site to your trusted sites list, browse to
 the web site, and select the option to login automatically."</span></p>
<p><span>2. You can’t find the Library tab in the SharePoint library.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>a. About the Library tab doesn’t exist, provide us with some related screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>b. If you are in the SharePoint modern page, I suggest you click Return to classic SharePoint&gt;Settings&gt;turn on the Ribbon tab to see whether the Library tab appears.</span></p>
<p><span>c. About mapping a network drive location, check if the issue can be resolved by following the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>1. If you can see the Library tab, click it and click Open with Explorer in IE.</span></p>
<p><span>2. When the Windows Explorer window pops up, copy the URL at the top of it.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Close the window and click Map network drive.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Paste the URL in the Folder part and click Finish to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, as mapping to a network drive location may cause some issues, I suggest you use

<h2>            Word 2007 - How can I alter the colours used in Brochure templates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having a go at creating my own tri fold brochure using the Word 2007 templates as a starting point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The various ones provided all seem to work the same - I can alter the text and images, but cannot alter the colour schemes, ie the background boxes.&nbsp; Does anyone know of anyway I can do this so that the boxes reflect my own colour schemes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Without knowing which specific template you're using, my guess is that the background color is a shape anchored to the page header. Or, if the boxes are different on different pages, they may just be formatted as Behind Text (in the document body). If
 you are unable to select them by clicking on an edge, then, on the Home tab, in the Editing group (far right end), click on Select and choose Select Objects. This will give you an arrow pointer that will allow you to select drawing objects without affecting
 text.

            <p>Hello Suzanne</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried what you suggested, but it made no difference.&nbsp; When I go to Editing &gt; Select &gt; Select objects, the cursor&nbsp;stays exactly the same which is a four headed arrow.&nbsp; When I click on any of the coloured boxes, the whole page is effectively selected and
 I can make the (collective) coloured boxes smaller, larger etc but cannot select an individual box, change the colour etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried it with a couple of the brochure templates and they were more of less the same, but the one I am trying to alter the colours
 on is 'Brochure (Modern Elegance Design)' which is one of the templates offered as standard in&nbsp;Word 2007.&nbsp; Stangely, there is a box for a photo on the page.&nbsp; This has the same coloured green border as some of the boxes use.&nbsp; I can select and alter the colour
 of the border, but nothing else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded one or two from the MSN website, and they work quite differently.&nbsp; When I open them, the open up in Powerpoint and I can alter the colours through the Design tab.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Okay, I've created a document based on that template. It's interesting looking at it in Draft view, as it contains only a page break and a following paragraph--not even a paragraph before the page break. Everything on the first page is a graphic anchored
 to the page break, and everything on the second page is anchored to the single paragraph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad news is that the colored boxes are formed by a single background art piece anchored to the page break. I&nbsp;hoped they might be grouped shapes, but instead everything except the photo box is a single picture. The text boxes are added in front of the
 background art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way you could change the colors of the panels would be to create a new background. For this purpose, I would suggest you create AutoShapes anchored to the header paragraph. If you want to tackle this, here's how I suggest that you proceed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Switch to Draft view and display nonprinting characters (Ctrl+* or click the Show/Hide
<span><font color="#000000">¶ button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab).</font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">You'll see a Page Break followed by a paragraph mark (<span>¶).</span></font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><span>Place the insertion point to the left of the page break and press Enter three times. This will create three paragraphs
 before the page break.</span></font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><span>Insert a page break (Ctrl+Enter) between each pair of paragraph marks. You'll now have
<span>¶, Page Break, <span>
¶, Page Break, <span>¶, Page Break,
<span>¶.</span></span></span></span></span></font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><span><span><span><span><span>When
 you switch back to Print Layout view, you will have two blank pages before the two pages with color boxes.</span></span></span></span></span></font></span></li><li>On either of the blank pages, you can double-click in the header area to open the header for editing. The contextual Header &amp; Footer Tools | Design tab will be displayed.</li><li>In the Options group, check the box for "Different First Page." This will give you a separate First Page Header so that you have different color blocks on the first and second pages.</li><li>With the insertion point in the First Page Header, draw blocks of your desired size and color.</li><li>Repeat for the Header.</li><li>When you have the color blocks to your satisfaction, double-click in the body of the document to exit the header.</li><li>Select one of the text boxes on the first page of the brochure (now page 3) and Cut it (Ctrl+X)</li><li>Move to page 1 and paste (Ctrl+V).</li><li>Repeat for each of the text boxes on the first page, then move to the second page 
<p>The reason I've described this rather roundabout procedure is to preserve the existing color blocks for reference while creating the new one. A much more efficient solution that would not require creating blank pages (or moving the text boxes)&nbsp;would be this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print a reference copy of the brochure so that you can measure the sizes and positions of the color blocks.</li><li>Open the header as described above and enable "Different First Page."</li><li>While still in the header, draw the desired color blocks.</li></ol>
<p>A third approach that is more efficient still but requires a leap of faith is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Without deleting the background graphic, open the header as described and enable "Different First Page."</li><li>Draw color blocks directly on top of the background, matching the size and position. Because the header is always the farthest-back layer, you will&nbsp;not see the colors you select until after you have deleted the background.</li><li>After you've created all the required shapes, click Close Header and Footer, then select and delete the background graphic. Your colored shapes will be revealed.</li></ol>
<p>Note that no matter how you&nbsp;handle this, the colors of shapes anchored to the header will be dimmed when you're working in the document body, but they will print at full strength.</p>

            <p>Thank, Suzanne, that's very helpful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I'm just about there.&nbsp; Can I just check one or two things with you - you suggest that I 'draw blocks of the desired size and color' and I have done this by going to Insert &gt; Shapes &gt; Rectangle.&nbsp; Is this the best way to add colour blocks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the original template, I can't get the&nbsp;photo box on the first page with the green border to work.&nbsp; Do you think it's a colour box?&nbsp; When I&nbsp;add an image, it drops down out of the 'frame'.&nbsp; If I use Position to place it, it seems to throw out everything
 else on the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the other templates are much easier to alter than this one, especially those which open up in Powerpoint, although I haven't tried a print test yet.</p>

            <p>Yes, I would use rectangles (and did in my tests). I didn't investigate what the color box was, but if it isn't working for you, I would suggest just adding a photo without the box and then applying a color border as desired. FWIW, if you have Publisher,
 you may find it better adapted to producing brochures than Word, which is really better suited to continuous text. Putting all the text of a document in text boxes is really going counter to the way Word is meant to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the bizarre things about this template (which, if you display text boundaries,&nbsp;is very obvious after deleting the background graphics) is that the margins are set to some generous amount (1.25" all around, I'd guess), so that all the text boxes are
 outside the margins and have to be positioned relative to the page. That's especially inconvenient in the case of the center text box on the first page, which I assume is meant to expand upward as required, yet its position can't be set as Bottom Relative
 to Margin, which would be the simplest way to place it.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Suzanne.&nbsp; I agree, the margins are very generous.&nbsp; I might just print it out and use it as a rough guide for a similar document, but use columns as I want a tri fold leaflet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have Publisher, but do have Photoshop.&nbsp; I wonder if I might be better using that.</p>

            <p>I can't speak to Photoshop, as I've never used it, but I do have the Corel Graphics Suite, and I believe that Corel DRAW (comparable to Adobe Illustrator) would be the appropriate application rather than Corel PHOTO-PAINT (comparable to Photoshop).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW, the brochures I've created in Word have used Word's Columns feature (see
<span><a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/UsingColumns.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/UsingColumns.htm</font></a>), and even if I wanted to add color blocks behind
 the columns, that's still the approach I'd use. My sense is that designers who create Word templates using only text boxes and graphics either don't know how to use Word properly or assume that the users of the templates will not be sufficiently expert in
 Word to do more than type in provided boxes (and will be content to use the boxes provided). I imagine that both assumptions are largely correct.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your comments re Corel products vis a vis Adobe.&nbsp; I've heard of Adobe Illustrator, but don't know much about it.&nbsp; I'll perhaps look into it sometime soon.</p>

<p>Hi KavinaSoopramanien,</p>
<p>Technically, the anti-spam server won’t affect the mailbox migration in the hybrid deployment. When trying to do a remote mailbox move, you just need to make sure the following things:<br />
1. The <strong>Outlook Anywhere</strong> service is enabled on your Exchange on-premises server.<br />
2. The <strong>Autodiscover</strong> service works fine.<br />
3. The <strong>MRSProxy</strong> service is enabled on your Exchange on-premises server.<br />
4. The required administrative permissions (<strong>Organization Management</strong> and
<strong>Recipient Management</strong>) are granted.</p>
<p>For more details, you can just refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj906432%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Move mailboxes between on-premises and Exchange Online organizations in hybrid deployments</a>. And you are always free to ask any relevant questions.</p>

<p>You can't ! A couple of work arrounds would be to use Opera Mini as a shortcut, which would allow you to save 9 web pages in the window or leave browser open on the page you want, running in the background and hold menu button to show open apps. Also having
 Snaptu as a shortcut leaves you quick access to a lot of sites.</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p>If you paste the table as RTF Formatted Text, it will appear as a table in Word and you can then use the Repeat Header Rows facility to have the first row appear at the top of the continuation of the table on each page.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Ranges like 60-65 and 65-70 are abiguous. Where do you want 65 to be counted?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you say 60-65.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose your data is in D1:D23.&nbsp;Select F2:F7 and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>array-enter</strong></em></span> the following formula (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>press ctrl+shift+Enter</strong></em></span> instead of just Enter):</p>
<p>
</p><p>=FREQUENCY(D1:D23, {65, 70, 75, 80, 85})</p>
<p>
</p><p>All values less than or equal to 65 are counted F2. That includes any values less than 60. All values greater than 85 are counted in F7. That includes any values greater than 90. I purposely omitted 90 from the array constant {65,...,85} for that reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can enter the text "60-65" etc (without quotes)&nbsp;into E2:E7, if you wish. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest turning off the Battery Saver app, then try updating apps on the Store again. Also, try updating the software by going to
<strong>Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Phone update&gt; Check for updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above workaround wouldn't fix the problem, back up the phone and do a hard reset. Go to
<strong>Settings&gt; About&gt; Reset the phone</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Backing up the phone is very important before performing a hard reset as the phone will be wiped out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us for further help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Continuous line break - problem</h2>
                    Most of the continuous line breaks in my document are fine. But some of them spread the words so that they justify to the right side. It looks strange with such wide distances between words.

            <p>Is the paragraph immediately before the section break justified? That's the only way I can reproduce this symptom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is what you're seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5166d9d6-14b1-474c-a51d-fe86928ad007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5166d9d6-14b1-474c-a51d-fe86928ad007" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>the cure is to position the cursor at the beginning of the next paragraph instead of at the end of the preceding paragraph before you insert the section break. In the picture, notice that the (invisible) first section break sits before the paragraph mark,
 while the second section break sits after the paragraph mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can fix an existing problem paragraph by selecting the paragraph mark and dragging it to the position between the period and the invisible section break.</p>

            I like to share my sollution:
<div><br />
<div>i tried all the already mentionned thinks like</div>
<div>- deleting helpfolder</div>
<div>- deleting keys in registry</div>
<div>- etc. etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>till i found somewere one little remark about that setup uses the tasksheduler ... so i checked but the service was inactive and i could not start it.... The service was dependent on two other services and they also were inactive... activating both services
 and then the task sheduler service did the trick...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>office installed in 2 minutes :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can check in the taskmanager very simple if your task-sheduler-service is activated... if its inactive i think setup will fail most certainly... at least, mine did.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>hope i helped someone out&nbsp;</div>

            <p>you can use an expression in the text box to convert the value to positive, but it would be better to leave the text box's value alone and just display it without the minus sign.&nbsp; This can be done by setting the text box's Format property to a custom format
 such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; #,##0.00;#,##0.00;#,##0.00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI:&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, you do not need any VBA code to do what you want.&nbsp; Instead you can do it all with an expression in the text box:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =DLookup("Balance", "CustomerInvoiceLastZeroBalanceQ", "CustomerID = " &amp; CustomerID)</p>

I have found that Windows 7 compatiblility issue so far is a joke... I have not found one old program from xp or vista that works completely yet...

<p><span>Hi Richard D Harris,</span></p>
<p><span>As mentioned by Thahaseena, Master Cook application is not yet compatible with Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p><span>However there are few workarounds to make it work in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Workaround 1: To use web import tool, you will need to run IE as administrator.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run IE as administrator.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to
<strong>start</strong> and type <strong>internet explorer</strong> in the search field.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on Internet explorer from the programs&nbsp;list and select
<strong>“Run as Administrator”.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Test and see if you can use the web import tool after this.<br />
<br />
If you still face the same problem, follow the next&nbsp;workaround method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Workaround 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After installing MasterCook and you launch the Internet Explorer web browser there should be a MasterCook icon in your toolbar.
 If there isn't, it could be caused by several things. See below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It won't appear until after you
<strong>restart your computer </strong>after installing the program. So, restart your computer and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have
<strong>customized your Internet Explorer</strong> toolbar at some point in the past, you may need to do that again to get the icon to appear in the bar.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click on a blank area of your IE toolbar and choose
<strong>customize</strong> from the menu that pops up. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the left side of the screen find the icon for
<strong>Mastercook Web Import Bar.</strong> </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select/highlight it and press the
<strong>ADD</strong> button. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Close out of the
<strong>customize </strong>window and look for the button on your toolbar.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, you can toggle the Import Bar
<strong>off</strong> or <strong>on</strong> by selecting Explorer Bar &gt; Mastercook Bar from the View menu at the top of the IE web browser window.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Customize the Internet Explorer toolbars</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Customize-the-Internet-Explorer-toolbars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Customize-the-Internet-Explorer-toolbars</a></span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Web tool bar doesn’t work properly if your Internet security settings are set too high</span><span>.
 You may reduce the security level of IE to make it work.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To do so</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to Tools in Internet Explorer</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Internet Options and navigate to Security Tab</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the
<strong>Custom Level</strong> button at the bottom of that tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the drop-down list in the
<strong>Security Settings</strong>, make sure that the security level is set to <strong>
Medium</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Configure the following settings in the security tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the steps from 3 to go to security tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under" Active X Controls and Plugins," these two options must be enabled:<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>--Run Active X Controls and Plug-ins<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>--Script Active X controls marked safe for scripting.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under" Scripting," all three options must be enabled, that is:
<br />

<p>I don't think you can be running a <em>Windows</em> program (Windows Live Mail) on your
<em>Blackberry</em> phone. You'll get better help in a forum where Blackberry experts hang out. Here are a couple:</p>

    <title>Always move conversation&#58; 2 pst files. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Always move conversation&#58; 2 pst files.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using office 365 outlook.</p>
<p>It started with some emails that automatically move into one particular folder (not because of a rule) when it arrives. And email that are filtered into that folder is not of any particular subject or from any particular person. Company IT contacted
 MS to check; reinstall outlook, create a new pst file and the problem still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the option to&nbsp;"Disable always move conversation...." was used for the filtered emails but new emails still get diverted into that folder. The percentage of such diversion is about 20-40 emails per day which works out to be 5-10%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now 3 issues persists.</p>
<p>1) Some emails still automatically move into that folder.</p>
<p>2) Old email from previous pst file is not sync into the new pst file.</p>
<p>3) See attached picture; error message pops up outlook is open.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83cda203-70f4-4822-a1c7-0b533c76711f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83cda203-70f4-4822-a1c7-0b533c76711f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Steven</p>

            <p>Hi everyone, apologize for not replying earlier. I do not know if the build has solved the issue but recently the email do not get automatically moved anymore and I discover the cause. It is not a clever discovery but a dumb thing in fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I punch "M" and "O" as per my description in the thread above, one of my fingers is above "A" and each time that finger will accidentally punch "A". Coincidentally the short cut to move the messages automatically is "A". This explains why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the only thing I can say is to change that short cut to a non-A; otherwise we can only be more careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you everyone for your attention and precious time.</p>
