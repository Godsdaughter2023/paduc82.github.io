<h2>            Migration from old computer to new computer</h2>
                    <p>My old computer is dying and I am about to buy a new one.&nbsp; I am a 73 year old disabled vet with difficulties and I need a migration program that will transfer everything for me.&nbsp; I understand they will not transfer security programs. I prefer to move everything
 from the old computer to a backup external hard drive, then move everything from the external drive to the new computer.&nbsp; Can someone recommend the best migration program for this?</p>

            Hello, I understand that you are looking for a best way to migrate all your data from one PC to another. Disk cloning software in this case will do the job. EaseUS Todo Backup will clone the existing hard drive onto another. You will have to put the cloned hard drive into the new computer, however with this method, you have skipped the most annoying activation part. 
<br />Hope this helps!

            Will this also transfer programs as well as files?&nbsp; Can I transfer everything from my old computer to an external hard drive, then from the external hard drive to the new computer?&nbsp; I am looking for the best program to move everything from the old computer

            I also wonder about Z-Install and PC Mover which seem to be popular for transferring old computer to new computer.&nbsp; Microsoft no longer does the transfer program, so I feel abandoned.&nbsp; Anybody know anything about these programs/apps?&nbsp; I really need help
 on this, I want the best one, one that will move data, programs, everything<br />

            The migrator I recommended transfers absolutely everything. All your programs, files, and applications. You will have to take out the Hard drive and re-insert it into the new computer. I am not sure about the program you have mentioned. I would suggest checking reviews and the official page for extra details.
<br />Hope this helps!

<h2>            Microphone headset not working</h2>
                    <p>Today I bought a new headset, a Sennheiser PC 310 G4ME. While the sound coming from the headset is from excellent quality, the microphone doesn't seem to work. When I plug it in to the microphone plug, it doesn't even detect that it is there. Also, when
 I try to add a new microphone it comes up with this:&nbsp;http://gyazo.com/6c112e27789e9e1183234799c957c7c5. I've tried it on another laptop, and it works fine there.</p>

            If you can, try it on another computer. If it works, the problem is with your machine. It could be a problem with the mic input, so buy a really cheap mic and try it out. If that has a problem too, take your machine in for repair..

<h2>            Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3600 BT Freezing Issues - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As you can se in this question ( https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/sculpt-comfort-mouse-freezing-issues-windows-10/8bf73366-1af8-4443-8a3b-fbd40b50f03a).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My mouse periodically freezes. To get it working again I have to use the touch pad on my Lenovo Legion y720.&nbsp; I don't know what fire this issue and there is no time frequency for it happens. (i already disabled the option to save power in bluetooth settings)<br />
<br />
I am so disappointed, As we can see searching this problem in Google, many people have been suffering with this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find any solution for that, i am thinking buy a logitech mouse, but i don't know if it will works fine or it's a general bluetooth issue in windows 100.<br />

<h2>            Whats wrong with Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What's wrong with Windows 8? All the time you hear some whiner complaining about how much they hate 8 but why? Probably because they are don't know how or are too afraid to use it. Windows 8 is a great operating system! I changes the way you work with a
 computer. Now instead of a start menu you have a beautiful and fully customizable start screen. In fact when I started using Windows 8's start screen I found that the traditional start menu was kind of... boring. People see Windows 8's desktop and&nbsp;immediately
 start whining that there is no start button. If they would even give poor 8 a chance and stop complaining they would see Windows 8 DOES have a start button, Its just not on the taskbar anymore.&nbsp;I do admit that it is sort of strange how you close apps but&nbsp;it
 doesn't bug me I think its cool. I also love Windows RT. For what I use a computer for I don't&nbsp;need to many desktop apps but Office anyway so&nbsp;I think RT is cool!&nbsp;I have no problem whatsoever with Windows 8!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you agree with me please share your opinion of what like or dislike about Windows 8. I would appreciate hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I agree completely. Fast, stable, compatible with nearly all my software and hardware. And with the first truly new interface in 20 years, a long overdue change in my book.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to 8 on the day it came out and was skeptical about the new look, but within a few hours I had the basics down and loved the design.</p>

            <p>People are complaining about the absence of the Start menu but what they don't realize is that the start menu is 18 years old!! Since Windows 95! Isn't it time for a change? The start screen has so many ways to customize it and make it yours what's wrong
 with that??And your right it doesn't take long to master Windows 8, I pretty much mastered it in one day. &nbsp;People are strange.

            <p>Hi there!&nbsp;&nbsp; I like my Windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm no expert as I only started using a computer 11/2012 just as Windows 8 started so I had no experience of Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't use my pc for work only general browsing etc but as I see it why can't we have Windows
 7 (or updated version of same) AND Windows 8.1 operating at the same time so a person can choose which to use?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want my screen cluttered with desktop icons etc when I am just generally browsing - I want my WHOLE screen without "bits" - if I want the
 "bits" then I can use desktop!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried Windows 10 and I don't like it - I like my metro - Windows 8.1 has alphabetical list as well so what's the problem after all we've all paid our money don't we deserve a choice?&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft, understandably, is going
 after the most money and has to keep the most people happy but how about us small players?&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't be the only person (female) in the universe to feel like this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft must have thought Windows 8 would be a winner otherwise it would never have been&nbsp;
 - so why is it now so awful?&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody somewhere must have liked the idea of Windows 8 - now nobody wants to be associated with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want my screen to do and show me (or not show me) what I want.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 claims to give a "bit" free screen in tablet
 mode but there are still margins (unless I'm doing something wrong!) which irritate me immensely + I can't get Bing's everyday image anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a great one for my images and photos - most of my pc memory is filled with pictures!&nbsp;&nbsp; I just hope Windows 8.1
 doesn't disappear anytime soon!&nbsp;&nbsp; Pity we can't just press a button and choose what we want - and when!&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway as usual I find myself in a minority and no doubt the great minds think we are "no account" people and can be safely ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess those involved with computers since the early primitive days are so taken with the progress made that they
 see Windows 8 as nothing more than a bad dream and now they can go back to what they know and love (albeit updated and "improved"?)&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "........be gone foul Windows 8 I will have no more of thee......"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry to go on so!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weird female from UK (where else?)!</p>

<p>&nbsp;I love Windows 8.1 too! I think it's easy to use and I love all the different ways you can customize Start. You mentioned something about you hope Windows 8.1 doesn't go anywhere anytime soon, well It will still receive security fixes, and updates until
 2023 :) But, trying to buy a new PC with Windows 8.1 might be tricky, as mostly everything is shipped with Windows 10 now.</p>

            <p>There's nothing wrong with Windows 8.1! I like it. But I don't use the apps, so it's only booting to the old-school Desktop... I also like the Charms Bar - but I didn't like it ALLWAYS coming up, when closing a program!!!
<strong>:-D</strong> This was VERY anoying! But very easy to change, so I only has to move the mouse down to the lower-right corner!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tested the Windows 10, I really missed the Charms Bar...</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We would like to inform you that changing the user account name without backing up your personal files may cause file deletion. It is best to back up your files before doing so, or simply create a new user account instead of modifying it.<br />
<br />
You can try to <strong>restore your PC from a restore point</strong> using the recovery option on Windows 10. Kindly refer to the article below for the steps.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">Recovery options in Windows 10</a></strong><br />
<br />
In addition, modifying the registry may cause serious problems if you modify the registry incorrectly. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows
</a></strong><br />
<br />
Feel free to post again if you have other concerns.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files might still be there... just under the old account... They would not be available to you under those circumstances... But they may have been deleted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try putting the account back like it was, or maybe try a bootable 3rd party Linux based tool to see if you can access them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a tool called Parted Magic for stuff like that... It has a feature called File Manager that will let you browse your drive and see if the stuff is still there...</p>

<h2>            Purple and green lines on screen &#40;Unable to see menu&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've had the Xbox One for almost a month now, no problems have arose, until recently. &nbsp;After booting up my console i noticed an odd message on my TV saying 'Unsupported Mode'. I thought of this as odd, turned off my console and rebooted,
 only to find that instead of fixing my issue, it had become worse. Instead of being greeted with the usual startup followed by the menu, i was instead greeted with purple and green lines going up and down my screen. There was no resemblance of the original
 menu, only these lines, no actual menu was to be seen.</p>
<p>I thought of this as extremely peculiar, for a month i had no issues, the system ran perfectly, so why now would it suddenly give me this issue? I assumed it was an issue with the HDMI cords that i was using, but even after switching
 them out for a different pair there was no difference, still those lines. I eventually resorted to fiddling around with the cord while it was still plugged in. Nothing.</p>
<p>I looked online for any sort of related issue but as far as i can tell this hasn't happened to any others. Some reported a few lines appearing in the menu or a slight tint of purple in game, but nothing as bad as what i had. The
 menu isn't even being shown, I couldn't even launch a game. I tried multiple solutions to other problems, such as removing games from the tray, holding the power button for 10 seconds, all that jazz, as well as changing HDMI cables but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Normally I would think the console was faulty at this point but it strikes me as odd because for a month the console ran like a dream, no issues, and as far as I know nothing had changed between the last time I played and now. Is
 anyone else getting this issue like I am, and if so is there a solution i just haven't tried? Thanks!</p>

<p>Have you tried the Xbox on a different TV or try viewing something else on the TV to make sure it isn't the TV going out (since we know it's not the HDMI cables)? If it's not the TV, you could try booting up into low resolution mode. With the Xbox One turned
 off (if you need to turn it off do the 10 second hold), press the Xbox One Power button and the Eject button together for 5 seconds until you hear a tone. Once it boots up into low res mode, go to your Xbox Settings, Display Settings &amp; Sound, and change the
 display to fit your TV. See if that resolves the problem for you.</p>

<p>I recently moved and before I moved my xbox one played dvd in a higher quality than 480i. Now that I moved and set things back up, my picture quality on playing dvds has become crappy and play in only 480i. I am playing the exact same dvd as I was playing
 before I moved. I had no issues with it before and nothing is different other than my new location.</p>

<p>Definitely try the steps provided by xX Yggdrasil Xx first. If that doesn't work, make sure to also ensure that your Xbox One Console settings are optimized following the steps outlined in
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/adjust-display-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a>.</p>

<h2>            Game Keeps On Crashing - Please Can We Have A Fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p><p><br /></p><p>I would like to ask for some help in regards to the XBox One game - Powerstar Golf.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've been having problems with this game recently in which the game will freeze, create a loud buzzing noise and then places you back to the XBox One Dashboard. This mostly happens when I try to access certain features in the game, such as the Caddie Setup, the Golfer Setup and now it is known to also occur in the Rivals Game Mode. It is possible that some other areas within the game also trigger this ordeal with the game freezing &amp; crashing you back to the XBox One Dashboard.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have tried to reload the game and return to the same feature in the menu, but the game still freezes &amp; crashes out. I've deleted the game and redownloaded it onto the XBox One Console. I've also redownloaded all of the download content for the game, at the same time. I then reloaded the game once the download was complete, but when I tried to access the same m

    <title>Adding a Tablet as a Wireless Display to a PC with Three Existing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylorsteinfeldt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding a Tablet as a Wireless Display to a PC with Three Existing Standard Monitors.</h2>
                    <p>So currently I am having a problem using the wireless display feature, for something that I assume was not meant to happen and I'm looking for any possible help to remedy this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current setup is with a PC connected to three monitors, running with Windows 10. My PC specs are as follows --&gt; CPU: Intel i7-4790K ; GPU: GTX 1080 ; RAM: 32 GB Crucial Ballistix. I am an animator and use adobe on a regular basis. What I wanted to happen,
 is that I have a windows-enabled tablet (from CHUWI) that acts as its own desktop (essentially the same way a Surface does) and I wanted to connect the tablet to the PC via wireless display. (I have tried third party remote access apps, but they have far too
 much latency.) What I want to have happen is for this tablet to mirror the central display, while the outer two remain extended. This way, I can use it as a graphic design tablet with a screen to view what I am working on (such as drawing in Adobe Animate
 CC, Photoshop, Etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I connect the display, it functions as an extended display just fine, but that not what I want, because to use it for small amounts of work, i'd have to drag the Adobe Animate CC window over to the tablet, just to draw a little bit and then
 bring it back (a HUGE waste of time). When I go into displays settings to mirror the middle monitor with the tablet, the wireless display application on the tablet closes and then my main PC's application freeze and I can only be shut down with a hard-reboot.
 (This is a bug that hasn't been fixed yet.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a few questions to ask...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do you properly connect a tablet PC to act as a secondary monitor to a PC that already has 3 standard monitors</p>
<p>2. How do you enable touch screen with multiple displays</p>
<p>3. How do you get a touchscreen monitor to mirror a standard monitor being able to use mouse/keyboard functions on the standard &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;monitor and touch setting on the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any advice you may have!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To properly connect a tablet PC to act as a secondary monitor, you need to use an application from your manufacturer that will allow you to connect to a wireless display.&nbsp; If not, you need to purchase a modem that is capable of this feature. You need to
 open the application and connect to a wireless display. It’s like searching for wireless networks.</p>
<p>

            <p>You have already found how to connect the tablet "...However, when I connect the display, it functions as an extended display just fine..." Using only the display properties of the tablet is not what you will want, to meet your stated goals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply make the working files/images/documents available by network devices (like your tablet) and work on those files using the power of and software installed on the network devices (like your tablet.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtual KVM (Keyboard/Video/Mouse) software is what you will want to answer #3. Simply type 'KVM Software' into your favorite search engine.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />It sounds like your Minecraft account isn't recognizing your purchase. You'll need to get in touch with Mojang support to resolve the issue, as they can make sure your account is linked to your Minecraft purchase.
<br />
<br />See if you can find your proof of purchase (an email receipt most likely) and contact Mojang here:
<br />

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need any more support! Thanks!

<h2>            Can&#39;t access appdata folder on an account that no longer exists on my computer. &#40;But I can access other files&#41;</h2>
                    I have access to all of my account, let's call it /absol1, however, I had an old account that was /absol2. I can go into c:/users/absol2 and browse around, but when I try to access the appdata folder (I have files in there I want to access) it says "Windows
 can't find c:\users\absol2\AppData\Roaming" and when I click on a shortcut that links to it it says that "the drive or network connection that 'shortcut' refers to is unavailable". Any idea how I can access that? I would really appreciate it.

            Hello SirAbsol, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor. <br />
<br />
I would suggest running a system restore in order to get back the AppData folder.
<br />
To perform a system restore: <br />
Press Windows Key + R Key <br />
Type rstrui and press Enter. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you and good luck. <br />
Regards- Irisdiel H.

            Hi RonWilcox7<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to try the following methods and check:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a: Open the Photos app.<br />
b: Click/tap on the See more (3 dots) button, and click/tap on Settings.<br />
C: Under Microsoft OneDrive, turn on Show my cloud-only content from OneDrive.<br />
Select all folders or Pictures folders only for what you want to show in the Photos includes OneDrive content from drop down menu.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>ataport.SYS Bluescreen on New Windows 7 Computer&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justmiike  say:</h3>
<h2>            ataport.SYS Bluescreen on New Windows 7 Computer&#33;</h2>
                    My computer is new, only 3 weeks old running Windows 7 64-bit.<br />
<br />
I have received the same 2 blue screens about 4 days a part, one was when I was playing a game and the other when I woke the computer up.<br />
<br />
The error was:<br />
<br />
KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR<br />
<br />
STOP: 0x0000007A (0xFFFFF6FC400074F8, 0XFFFFFFFFC000000E, 0x0000000164D3D860, xFFFFF88000E9F008)<br />
<br />
ataport.SYS - Address FFFFF88000E9F008 base at FFFFF88000E86000, DateStamp: 4ce79293<br />
<br />
<br />
Would anyone know the cause? I have no minidumps either.<br />
<br />
I used Memtest86+ to test RAM but it found 0 errors.<br />
<br />
I ran Windows Memory Diagnostic and Chkdsk as well, they both returned with 0 errors.<br />
<br />
Image of the bluescreen can be found <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/crashes-debugging/169720d1313074870-bsod-new-computer-image-included-blue-screen-death.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            1. I got the computer brand new on the 28/07/2011. It has happened 3 times within that time period.<br />
<br />
This is the latest:<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/crashes-debugging/170214d1313343326-bsod-new-computer-image-included-blue-screen-death-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
Latest BSOD</a><br />
<br />
2. No changes to my computer. I got it and installed many programs. I noticed it happened every 4 days when the computer has not been restarted.<br />
<br />
The last time it happened was on the 15/08/2011 and I have kept the computer on since and I haven't had one since. It's the 21st now.<br />
<br />
What I did was re-create the pagefile.sys and I did a defrag of it and the whole computer used several programs to check for memory and disk errors several times. I did that many times.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I think re-creating the pagefile.sys has worked so far, what is your opinion on this? Could this be the cause?<br />
<br />
But then I'm confused as to my no minidump was created? Because it doesn't dump when it crashes. I thought that was because of hardware failure?<br />
<br />
Not sure.<br />

            Also note that Skype keeps your number reserved for 90 days. This means no one else but you can purchase this particular number during this period. You can renew your Skype Number subscription from your account.
