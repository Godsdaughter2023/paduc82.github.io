<h2>            the header for MSN is too large. Is there a way to make it narrower so I don&#39;t have to keep scrolling down for each slide</h2>
                    the header for MSN is too large when I go to a page with a slide presentation. I have to scroll down each slide in order to see pix plus the caption underneath. truly a nuisance and time waster. Do I have to get rid of MSN completely or is there a way
 to narrow down the header. Thanks.

            Thanks for simply deciding that long-time Hotmail customers such as myself were to be changed over whether we wanted to be or not. Hotmail worked and wasn't broken, so fixing it was not very smart. Why do you insist on irritating your own customers? I
 am personally in the process of removing my emails from Hotmail so I can close it out. I don't want Outlook, I won't use Outlook, and I am embarrassed by how you suddenly feel the need to seemingly dumb things down just to appeal to mobile users. What a waste.<br />

<h2>            How to get Word to stop opening a doc with &#34;restore down&#34; view</h2>
                    A few days ago, I opened up a few docs to occupy about 1/3 of my laptop screen's width, and saved them as well like this. Now, very often when I open up a document (even one created and saved a long time ago), the docs open up occupying this same exact
 width and spot on the screen. I looked on a Word tooltip and it says "restore down." It is what happens when a document is maximized, and then in the upper right corner, you click on the rectangle.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to get Word to forget this? I really like opening up documents maximized.</div>

            For the already-created documents, you'll probably have to use Method 1. For Normal.dotm, i<span>n Word, press Alt+F11; the Visual Basic Editor opens. Press Ctrl+G to activate the Immediate window. In
 that window, type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument<br />
<br />
and press Enter. Normal opens, but note that it may not be on top of all windows. You can close the Visual Basic Editor. Make the desired changes to the Normal file, and then save and close it. If the changes you have made have not been recognized as changes
 (the Undo button is not activated), press Spacebar, then Backspace to "dirty" the file, thus ensuring that the template will actually be saved.

<h2>            Firmware discussion - Pros and Cons</h2>
                    Hi Guys!<br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of interest on the issue of firmware updates. A lot of people have mentioned that they would like to have the ability to apply these updates themselves across the Internet, there are also a large amount of people who say they would prefer
 an authorised engineer from Nokia to do this for you.<br />
<br />
I also noted that a lot of people were making posts in the thread entitled <a href="http://discussions.nokia.co.uk/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;message.id=2235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sign The petition.</a> I have now locked that thread as there is very little discussion taking place there and the current theme of that thread wont really stimulate any new discussion.<br />
<br />
So, I am going to float this thread to the top for everyone for one week, you can discuss the pros and cons here. After a week I will take it off the top, I am pretty sure this type of thread will see a lot of interest.<br />
<br />
To get you started, how do you all feel about software on Nokia phones? Why do you want to be able to install it yourself? What do you see as the possible benefits of being able to do this? Why do you feel that it may be better for an engineer to do this for
 you?<br />
<br />
If you would like a quick poll thrown up, I will take suggestions via PM. Also please don't treat this like a petition and dont post demands to Nokia, I want to see a discussion on how this could benefit everyone ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, and remember to be nice - the last thread got a little heated :)<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
-<br />

            Given the flaky software flashing system provided to service centres, Nokia would have to come up with something a whole lot better and idiot proof before releasing it to consumers!

            I think Nokia seems to forget that the software installed on any product has to go through stages of testing.<br />
<br />
The first will be done by competent testers relying on a script of possible scenarios.<br />
The second will be some form of user acceptance testing (UAT).<br />
The third and most important piece of testing is carried out once the product has launched to the mass market. Testing can be done in two ways, the first - test every possible scenario, or the second - test the most popular scenario's.<br />
<br />
Most of the software bugs will not be found until the product is used by customers. Microsoft for example admit that their software contains bugs, and regularly supply updates via the internet for their software. Apple listen to their customers and provide
 updates for their products including Ipod's.<br />
<br />
What I think people would like to see is Nokia taking a proactive stance and supporting all of their loyal customers and listening to problems that arise. I can see lots of threads throughout many different forums that have the same problems come up time and
 time again. Nokia has the software developers in house, why not listen to these problems and fix them.<br />
<br />
Nokia would then gain a bigger customer base that are more satisfied with their products, knowing that the people who make them are not going to launch a new phone and then leave them high and dry.<br />
<br />
We all know Microsoft software is flakey at best but why do we put up with it - because they fix the reported problems.<br />
<br />
All mobile phones have, at most, an 18 month shelf life, we're not asking for life long support for a Nokia 2110 we're asking for support for the latest smartphones, the new generation of handsets that are supposed to do everything except make the tea. We just
 want someone to listen when things go wrong, pat us on the shoulder and tell us everything will be ok and they'll try and sort it out.

            from careful reading of previous topics like this, a good size chunk of problems seem to occur when variant software is used. You will notice that people with generic software report faults or problems with their phone, instead they seem to list features
 they would like to see, or improved usability. so maybe there should just be no more variant software and a comprehensive bug tracker introduced?<br />
<br />
UAT is used to test the interface between device and the real world, testing for bugs in the UI will take place at nearly every stage of development for the software as well as by having devices tested in house. I dont actually believe nokia tests on us, this
 wouldnt be practical for any type of manufacturer.<br />
<br />
One key issue to note here is that nokia very often listens to problems that occur, you only need to look at the phones forum to see that the moderator employed by nokia has taken a very proactive attitude by asking people who are having problems that cannot
 be solved here to call them up. I think this is a sensible idea.<br />
<br />
I do actually agree that nokia should tell us what is updated or resolved in updates, but bear in mind this; what they dont tell you is fixed in a feature release is what you need to worry about. MS needs to tell us what is fixed, but they dont need to tell
 us what they just broke or what will need fixing in the future.<br />
<br />
I do want to see updates from the internet or over the air or by an engineer, but i dont want it rushed out to meet public demand with out it working perfectly.<br />
<br />
and nokia do listen ;) they listen here ( to a certain degree) but we need to speak to them so that they can hear us :)

            like I've said before...<br />
I think Nokia should have an updater much like the windows update site Microsoft have.<br />
<br />
I feel we should be able to connect the phone via Nokia Suite and have the software check the phone and then install any software updates be if firmware or Life Blog.

            i think seraphim has made comments like this before. I am suprised that she hasnt left a post here yet...<br />
<br />
i would also appreciate a zero configuration update system. some of the newer s60 phones have wireless networking built in. would be fantastic if you could have a client on the phone that would download and update the firmware via wlan over night. just think,
 you couldset it up, press update and go to bed and it could be done by the time you wake up...:)

            one thing i think nokia should enforce with regard to variant firmware is that if a fault is found with the F/W and the network hasn't supplied nokia with a fix (within a reasonable time)then nokia must install generic firmware to rid the phone of the
 faults. after all, we have a legal right to expect faulty goods to be fixed, unfortunately some networks are flouting this law and nokia are allowing them to get away with it

            i dont think it is as simple as that. the networks must apply the software for a reason, if it isnt to add a specific feature to the phone there will be something that will be there to make the phone unique to that netork (and thus be a selling point).<br />
<br />
i think a simpler and much more elegant answer is this: dont have variant software

<br />
I couldn't have put it better myself!!!!<br />
<br />
Nokia could simply supply each phone with a cable to upgrade the software which we could download from the internet, simple.<br />
<br />
It would free up more time for the in house engineers to fix real problem.<br />
<br />
I mean Sony PSP, Ipod, many MP3 players, computer motherboard bios, optical drives manufacturers all provide firmware upgrades, why not Nokia?<br />
<br />
It would be a first.<br />
<br />
OH AND THEY WOULD KILL THE COMPETITION!!!!!!!!!

i disagree, i have found nothing that the networks add that don't work on a generic handset. in fact I've just had my 3230 debranded and everything now works better than before. my network said that I'd lose line 2 if i debranded but this isn't a network specific
 addition, its something that can be selected during the firmware update to be included.<br />
i created a thread in the phones section asking for anyone thats had problems after debranding to post the problems, but so far i see no complaints regarding debranding.

            no, thats not what i meant<br />
<br />
you are on orange arent you? so, the feature they have added there is orange homescreen, which they have added to make the phone standout from all the other networks who offer the same phone. so while it isnt such a great idea they have still dont this to make
 it more appealing.<br />
<br />
so again, a much more elegant soloution to this particular question is just dont allow variant software in the first place, as rich says very few people have any complaints with genuine nokia software...

<h2>            technical beta causes 2 hard drives to fail</h2>
                    I have a dell inspiron 5700 series, I have installed both builds of the technical preview.&nbsp; First build I was able to use for about a week and then my system stopped booting up.&nbsp; I contacted dell and we ran some hard drive tests and they told me my hard
 drive had failed.&nbsp; I bought a new hard drive installed new build of technical preview this time clean, used it for 3 or 4 days and pc would no longer boot.&nbsp; Ran same hard drive tests as before and error indicated the hard drive was no longer usable.&nbsp; Has anyone
 else experienced this?&nbsp; I have now had 2 hard drives fail as a result of the technical beta.&nbsp; Consequently I am out of the test, just looking for feedback<br />

            <p>There might be a conflict with your configuration or hardware and you were wise to quit the preview. I don't see a model Inspiron 5700 in the list of all dell computers. Is it an older model or was that a typo? I see an Inspiron 17- 5000 series. Check out
 the system requirements--</p>

            I also had a hard drive fail after installing Build 9879. Worked fine at first, but after first restart received an AHCI Port error. The hard drive (Samsung SpinPoint F3, 3 years old) is now completely dead. No idea what happened, was functioning fine,
 and I made no other changes.

            I have an HP Pavillion laptop and I had this same thing happen. &nbsp;I purchased WD 500 GB drive (Model WD5000LPVX) and it seemed to work ok with the first beta build but once I performed the upgrade to the newest build, the drive stopped working. &nbsp;At first,
 I thought it was defective so I obtained a replacement from Amazon. &nbsp;When I went through the same scenario again, the new drive failed too! &nbsp;There is obviously something wrong with the newest built that is causing hard drive failures. &nbsp;I can't keep going back
 to get a replacement because of a defective operating system!

            <p>Hi, Just read about this recently; there was a bug in the new W10&nbsp;code that powered down the hdd to save power but did not send the signal to the hdd to power back up when it came out of hibernate or standby. Even removing and re applying power doesn't make
 it spin up.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with your hdd; sorry to hear that you bought a new one before you leared this :(</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>New functionality added in Build 9879 uses PUIS (Power-Up in Standby) to allow the disk spin-up to be controlled separate from disk power. This allows greater control over the power usage of the drive
 and reduced energy consumption for the system. The firmware of some systems does not send the PUIS spin-up command and thus the hard disks platters do not spin when the system is powered on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue for a system that does not recognize the boot drive, a third party utility must be used to disable PUIS.</span></p>

<h2>            How to manage and process data from a survey&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I'm sending out a survey to approx. 1200 people. Unfortunately we can't afford to use a 3rd-party survey company, so I'll need to process the survey results myself, hopefully harnessing the power of Excel!</p>
<p>Can anybody provide advice or point me towards great online resources on this subject matter?</p>
<p>In particular I imagine I'd have to use PivotTables to really extrapolate information from the results, though I've never used PivotTables before.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I'd create a master spreadsheet with all the survey results, from which I'd build a PivotTable. Should the spreadsheet be laid out in any particular way?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You may want to see if free online systems will give you what you want.&nbsp; Search google (or bing) for 'free survey site' (or some search phrase.&nbsp; One site that comes to mind is<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surveymonkey.com/</a>&nbsp;though
 I have no experience with it.</p>
<p>If you decide to go with Excel, put your data so that the results from each question are in separate columns with one or more columns for identification of each respondent.&nbsp; Then, each row should have the result from one survey.&nbsp; You will then be able to
 use Excel tools like PivotTable for this data set.</p>

<p>Hi All, thanks for the advice!</p>
<p>The survey is going out to 1300 people, we're anticipating about 600 responses. We have no-budget for 3rd-party services. Unfortunately the free-online-survey websites only allow for 100 responses.</p>

<p><span>Hi Phill</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to email the questionnaire to your target audience?</span></p>
<p><span>If so consider using Excel dialog sheets to capture the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Better yet Microsoft Infopath though there may be a steep learning curve on that piece of software depending on your level
 of expertise.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm thinking that I'd create a master spreadsheet with all the survey results, from which I'd build a PivotTable. Should the spreadsheet be laid out
 in any particular way?</span></p>
<p><span>Things to bear in mind when designing the data capture and the analysis. Keep coding to a minimum number of characters, eg. colours, brw, blu, blk, gre, gry.&nbsp; Try to
 use the same number of characters for all codes.&nbsp; When using numeric values for&nbsp; range of opinions, never use an odd number.&nbsp; as for the layout of the spreadsheet, do not use blank rows and columns in order to make the data easier for you to read this will
 lead to problems.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If legibility does become an issue alter the row heights and column widths do not have unnecessary spacing in the data.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So row 1 will be filled with column headings, these&nbsp;are the questions or brief meaningful summaries of the questions eg, gender, location, driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Column 1 contains an index number of questionnaire record number or a file name if you are using emails to capture the data. This allows for second data entry verification
 if needed always a good idea if you want people to have faith in the resulting analysis.&nbsp; This much data entry can be a nightmare to verify and if you are capturing discursive data you may need to refer to the original so get yourself a filing system&nbsp;organisation
 plan in place before you start collecting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>row 2 column 2 (B2) is the response to question 1 from the first respondent, C2 the response from Question 2 from the first respondent, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have access to a web server, you may like to investigate how to feed the data straight into an SQL database using a php script to form the questionnaire&nbsp;then
 import the data into Excel.&nbsp; Just a few hours work there I feel ;-)&nbsp;may be not what you are looking for at this point.&nbsp; Especially if you are collecting data for a thesis for your masters.</span></p>

<p>Hi Patrick, thanks for the insight.</p>
<p>Yes, I'll be e-mailing the questionnaire directly to our list of clientele.</p>
<p>By dialog sheets, do you mean the UserForm feature? (did a Google search of course as I wasn't previously familiar with it). It looks like a great way to input data. I may or may not go this route depending on how I deal with issues listed below.</p>
<p>We don't have Infopath here in the office (workplace office, not Microsoft).</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips on the codes. <br />
As there are a few open questions on the survey, I think i'll be using 'codes' for each response, e.g. "I greatly enjoyed the service provided" would become "HAP". Now if the person gave a long answer for the open question, the answer may fit into multiple
 catagories and codes, e.g.: HAP, 123, ABC, DEF. <br />
How would I be able to input all these into the same cell, but still have Excel calculate them independently (e.g. I want to see the total number of 'HAP' responses vs. '123'</p>
<p>Also I've been slowly exploring Pivot Tables. I see that when I 'build' the Pivot Table, I can 'drag' the column header around in the table to build it as I see fit. Would it be possible to also be able to drag 'HAP', '123', etc.... around, and do cross-comparisons
 against other column headers?</p>
<p>Right now I'm thinking I'll be building a 'master spreadsheet' with all my data. Yes, my list of clients would run down Column A, with Row A being my question headers. From this I'll generate a Pivot Table. From the Pivot Table i'll go through every permutation
 to create information/charts for my report. So the readability of my master data sheet is of no concern to me as only I'll be looking at it, and I'm ok with ugly duckling spreadsheets (with my report being the beautiful swan of course). How does that sound?</p>
<p>Haha yes, I do have access (no Microsoft pun intended) to a web server (e.g. where we host our website on). However the learning curve for scripting (zero knowledge) may be too much as the report is due next month.</p>

<p>Yes a dialog sheet is like a user form but you do not have to construct it in Visual Basic.</p>

<p>What a good question. &nbsp;I might use the countif() function to gather some stats on that field rather than the pivot table, =countif(d2:d1000,"*HAP*") will return the number of occurances of the text string HAP in the column D no matter where the string appears
 in the combination of codes as the * is a wild card and will ignore everything but your search string. &nbsp;This could be extended to =countif(d2:d1000,AND("*HAP*","*ABC*") which will capture those who gave two responses you are interested in analysing.</p>
<p>Alternatively, set up sub fields for that question, one for each particular code. &nbsp;So hap column contains a 1 or 0. &nbsp;This is a lengthy process which is why I would avoid it with a short deadline as you have. &nbsp;There are means of processing the data within
 one column of multiple string sets based on the method above but rather than me explain at length here give me a shout if you need further help.</p>

            I had this exact same issue and found a really great solution on the web. Our annual survey was emailed as a spreadsheet to all of our members. They filled out the information and then emailed the Excel file back to me. After all reports came in, I did
 the following:
<div><br />
<div>1. Extracted all attachments from emails using EZDetach (30-day free trial for one-time use, or $50 for a license) and saved them to a folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.techhit.com/ezdetach/dl.html</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Merged all of the data from 300 workbooks into one huge worksheet using the RDBMerge add-in. You can select which sheets/cells/ranges to combine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.rondebruin.nl/merge.htm</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>It's a lot easier than it sounds, and if you're an Excel enthusiast like myself, you might even find it really awesome. :)</div>

            Most fonts do not include anything other than the most fundamental fractions. The program does not reformat the characters you type. All Word can do is substitute the fraction character
<br />
If you use the OS X Character Viewer as Phillip suggests you will find that other fraction characters are available in some of the newer fonts, but not to the extent you might prefer... The largest number of fraction characters I've seen - even in a typical
 Unicode font - is in the Cambria Math font included with Office. In addition to those indicated by Rich it provides:<br />
<br />
⅓, ⅔, ⅕, ⅖, ⅗, ⅘, ⅙, ⅚, ⅛, ⅜, ⅝, ⅞<br />
<br />
For anything beyond that you'll need to obtain a number-oriented font that provides more or construct your own.<br />
<br />

<h2>            installing office 365 on D&#58;</h2>
                    I'm trying to install office 365 on D: but the setup automatically tries to install to C: which has no space. Is there any way to get it on D: ?

<h2>            Account recovery failed - next steps&#63;</h2>
                    Hiya, I have tried to submit an account recovery form 6 times now and it keeps getting denied . I have had my hotmail account for 8 years and it has my whole life in there (CV, university info etc). I have tried calling a microsoft windows contact centre
 only to find out this was a scam. I would be grateful for any help as to how to get my account back. Many thanks, Kim.&nbsp;

            You need the assistance of the account support staff, but they don't operate in these forums any more (they did until a few weeks ago). You get in touch with them by selecting the appropriate option on the

<p>Hello Steph, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having difficulty retrieving and reading your e-mails with Outlook.com Connected Account functionality. I know how important this is to you, and rest assured, I will try my best to help you to resolve this together expeditiously.
<br />
<br />
Could you please provide us additional information about the issue? <br />
<br />
1. What is the <strong>error message</strong>? A <strong>screenshot</strong> is very much appreciated.
<br />
2. Does it work with other email accounts? <br />
3. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
I am unsure what "IPs" your web hosting provider is asking for from Outlook.com, but if you are a technician managing the email server, I guess he is asking what IP addresses you assigned for MX/DKIM/SPF records all those.
<br />
<br />
I suspect you have not setup your email account correctly. Please ensure that you have entered the
<strong>correct email configuration</strong> details. <br />
<br />
Helpful reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-connected-accounts-in-outlook-com-a99a1f0b-700d-4b3b-8f9a-28d463ff07f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubl...</a><br />
<br />
Otherwise, please try if you can setup that custom email account as IMAP/POP3 on <strong>
other email clients</strong>. <br />
</p>
<p>To attach a screenshot, please refer to this thread:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please ensure that you have a <strong>reliable Internet connection</strong> in the entire process.
<br />
<br />
I am looking forward for your reply. <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

            If you want to find the IP of 'mail.mydomain.co.uk', open a command prompt window (type cmd on the start menu to find it) then type this at the prompt
<br />ping mail.mydomain.co.uk
<br />
<br />It will list your server's IP. 
<br />
<br />This is for a mail server I use:

<br />Based on the description above, I guess the problem is: the window closes after you have inputted all your email configuration details when trying to add your custom domain mailbox as Connected Account?
<br />
<br />If that is the case, I am afraid we cannot help you with this. Although I am an Independent Advisor for MS Community, I regret to inform you that most of us here do not have access to Outlook internal systems. 
<br />
<br />There is a number of users experiencing the same issue, where the window closes and nothing happens after clicking save.
<br />
<br />Microsoft Community brings together consumers and expert users in product-focused online communities, so they can post questions, share answers, and solve technical problems. However, inquiries that involve privacy, user data or otherwise require a technical action has to be reached with Microsoft Support directly. 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, you may like ensure it is not a browser-related issue by trying with a different browser (preferably Edge/IE11)
<br />
<br />Hopefully this issue can be resolved soon and thank you for your time and understanding.
<br />
<br />Yours Respectfully, 
<br />Sutharsan       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>It's the IPs of the servers that Outlook.com use for my account that I am trying to find not the one for my domain name.</p>
<p>

    <title>how to increase the limit on number of e-mail recipients - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesclhollingsworth  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to increase the limit on number of e-mail recipients</h2>
                    <p>Having created a distribution list and then used it for sending an e-mail to 54 recipients, all appears to go well but an indeterminate number fail to arrive, with no indication at my end that anything is amiss&nbsp;until some time later&nbsp;those who don't receive
 them query why not when other members of the group have.</p>
<p>Sky, who are my ISP say that it's nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>I am using an outlook.com email address and the latest windows ten and office 365 system.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to send an e-mail to all of my team in one go, rather than having to split my list. This is particularly irksome as one never knows how to assess exactly the maximum permitted size.</p>

This is not a 365 problem. It is the same with all recent versions of Office and Outlook. I just thought that it would be helpful if those offering help understood my current set up.

<p>1. I am not using 365 in a business environment. I am the Hon Sec of a group of golfers and try to arrange matches between us, and I'm Hon Sec of my Masonic Lodge, both non commercial.</p>
<p>2. My e-mail address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>3. My free e-mail account has stayed the same, as far as I am aware since&nbsp; first use in outlook 2010&nbsp;or outlook 2013</p>
<p>4. I would welcome any advice as to how best I can proceed.</p>

<p>Thanks for this Palcouk.</p>
<p>In my e-mail tab it shows Hotmail. Will matters improve for me after migration to EAS?</p>
<p>I have now split both of my distribution lists and all is well. There appears not to be a finite number, it's just reduce until it works.</p>
<p>Using windows Live mail 2010, creating and amending contact/distribution lists is very easy, but it's about to become unsupported. Every attempt so far to create and update contact lists in outlook is nigh in&nbsp;on impossible. I think since 2010 but certainly
 2013, this has&nbsp;become a right pain. Perhaps we are being dissuaded from attempting this. Would&nbsp;it help me if&nbsp;I obtained a different e-mail account, e.g. from SKY who are my ISP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I able to purchase more "bandwidth" that might overcome my issue?</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>Charles.</p>

 a period of two weeks. When the limited time period expires those features will be deactivated and locked AND Malwarebytes will notify you with a "<em><strong>Trial Expired</strong></em>" message. Enabling the Protection Module feature again
<strong>requires registration and purchase of a license key</strong>. If you continue to use the free version, there is
<strong>no requirement to buy a license</strong>...you can just use it as a stand-alone scanner.

<div><strong>Quote:</strong></div>
<p>Once a free trial has expired, you may wish to eliminate the notifications about the trial being expired, or you might even want to purchase the software or activate it if you already own a valid license. To do any of those things you first need to select
 one of the options on the pop up; "End Trial" or "Buy Premium".<br />

If you select, "End Trial" this will end the trial features, and set the program into the Free version.</p>

            <p>Are the digits 1 to 9 with each appearing once</p>
<p>Or are they 0 to 9 with random frequencies?</p>
<p>best wishes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming 0 to 9 randomly: see screenshot. Note you could get a number with less than 6 digits if zeros get picked at the start. To have a list we need to resort to VBA. and there would be more that 13 million if we cannot pick the same digit twice (18*17*16*15*14*13)
 or 18^6 (over 30 million) is we can.</p>

            <p>Okay, hi, I'm not sure if this works for everyone, but it did for me. I have a dell inspiron with NVIDIA graphics 820M, and I was also getting the same problem, but unknowingly I updated both graphic drivers for Intel and NVIDIA together, then just for curiosity
 I checked for DX version and it showed 12! But do note that both drivers were downloaded through the Intel and NVIDIA sites and not the company support site. Also I'm not sure which driver was responsible for the change.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
One more thing, it also depends on if your graphics card can support the new DirectX, to check that you can contact the company that made your card</p>

<h2>            Adding&#47;Importing Videos into OneNote on an iOS Device</h2>
                    <p>Dear All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning for students in my school to use OneNote as a place to store all of their classwork, notes and homework. Our students all have iPads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found ways to easily import most things but there is also a need for our students to be able to import videos that they have created on their iPads. I can't find a way to do that so far on OneNote. These videos could be made in Explain Everything
 or just using the built-in camera app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be very grateful if you have any suggestions/ideas for making this work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there is no support for System Sweeper yet - we're doing the best we can here, but really have very little more information than you except some of us have researched to find some helpful links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I've heard that removing the network cable from the computer (or otherwise separating the system from the network even if it means turning off the router and/or modem) when you try the scan sometimes resolves that particular error message&nbsp;problem
 (no guarantees, but two people said it worked for them and nobody has said it hasn't worked at this point), so since that's relatively simple, give that a try first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work try the following two threads which essentially cover everything we currently know about System Sweeper and links to various articles and guides that may assist you.&nbsp; Beyond that, there's not much else to do.&nbsp; You need to remember two
 things.&nbsp; First, this is a beta product so there will be bugs and support will be limited (or in this case virtually absent).&nbsp; Second, this tool is intended to be suggested by Microsoft Support to people when they are troubleshooting an issue and can't scan
 any other way at first - it is not likely to be ultimately generally released to the general population or at least not advertised even if people can still access it if they know how.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>so my workaround so far, kind of cumbersome:</p>
<p>- I made a new sheet, just only with "welcome info" and I set up (on excel offline) to be this sheet as the only one browser enabled</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (the welcome info, includes a link back to my web)</p>
<p>- on my web, a message: "if you can not see the content, ACTIVATE THE LINK" with a link to a onlyView version of the "welcome info"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so users, have to pass trough the excel thing at least once before they can see the Embed content , kind of ugly ...</p>

            few minutes playing and already a flaw in my workaround, to be able to embed something, it is needed to be active in browser view options, so not possible to keep the "welcomes only" visible to everybody, and the embed only in my web ... (so really need
 a solution for this)

            <p>The easiest way will be&nbsp;to do the merge in two parts by splitting the data source into those that have an email address and those that don't and then execute the merge to the appropriate destination based on the data source in use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will need to get into some fairly heavy visual basic coding.</p>

<p>Office 365 requires periodic Internet access to activate. This allows the program to verify that your subscription is still active. The error you're seeing will persist until your Surface has Internet connectivity, either via wireless or a network cable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I understand it has to be authenticated, but Microsoft Service out of Brea location looked at my Surface and said, it's a hardware problem with network adapter...so I cannot connect to internet to authenticate.</p>

<p>What about a USB wireless adapter? That could be one way to get back on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Office: Office 365 requires an Internet connection, but one-time purchases of Office do not. You'd have to switch to a one-time purchase of Office (like Office Home &amp; Student), order the physical media and install it (or use the offline installer),
 and then activate by phone. The one-time purchase won't need periodic internet access the way Office 365 does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just renewed your subscription, you should be able to cancel it and get a refund. &nbsp;</p>
