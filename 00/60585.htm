<h2>            Windows 10 Reinstall Flawed Realtek High Definition Audio Driver Automatically after Shut Down</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded to Windows 10, Realtek High Definition Audio Driver has been giving problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the middle of playing video or Mp3 the sound suddenly vanishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do Troubleshooting Windows 10 cannot find any problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I uninstall the program hoping that Windows 10 native drivers will function instead of the bugged Realtek High Definition Audio Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 reinstalls the bugged Realtek High Definition Audio Driver Automatically after Shut Down.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works again for a few minutes, since new reinstall of Audio drivers and then back to same routine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never had this problem on Windows 8.1<br />

            When I upgraded to Windows 10, Realtek High Definition Audio Driver did not allow built in microphone to be active and in settings I see only speakers (working) but not microphone.

            <p>Same issue , same type of audio crash&nbsp; possibly caused by a Windows update to 1607. Uninstalling the drivers in device manager doesn't help -it just reinstalls. The rollback option is greyed out and can't be selected. Reinstalling the audio driver from the
 manufacturer does not help either (ASUS T100HA). Reinstalling&nbsp; Realtek audio drivers (latest Win 10) was a no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggested hide/show troubleshooter does not show any audio drivers in the listing so was no help in my instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stumped. Any other suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Defer updates is like using the show hide updates tool- does not work</h2>
                    <p>So after installing the curators update 1703&nbsp; and finding that win10 decides to reset the&nbsp;automatically install driver to on when it was off.</p>
<p>This caused MS to remove dd live 5.1 from my onboard realtek 5.1 sound and blocking the driver, reinstalling the ms&nbsp; broken driver.</p>
<p>Yea, selecting 5.1 dd live from the realtek audio manager, it gets reset to 16 bit 4800 hz&nbsp; automatically with a message this function is not supported on this device.</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;put the older cloned drive back in the system with 1607, select to defer updates and here comes the updates downloading again.</p>
<p>Months of anguish with this garbage and every time "we " think MS gets a handle on this&nbsp;&nbsp;or at least leaves the semi function drivers alone, they make it worse.</p>
<p>And all you MS techs and&nbsp; gurus out there, this is not just onboard audio but physical devices both old and "new".</p>
<p>Just tired of chasing MS constant mistakes !!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now to add to the mix.</p>
<p>I could never figure out why in the world my games keep steam and origin games kept disappearing from the hard drives when using win 7, 8 and 10, now I know.</p>
<p>Users beware !!!!!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Could not do anything with the drive. &nbsp;The os locked me out and did its repair before I could do anything to fix this.</p>
<p>It blocked the steam folder and marked it as in the first post.</p>
<p>Yea would have had the same issue if I tried to go back to 1607 from 1703 but could not do that because there was no option to go back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should have realized when I was getting duplicate folders on two different hard drives of &nbsp;&nbsp;different &nbsp;sizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other folders and files were fine on this drive but the steam one.</p>
<p>I can bet the new &nbsp;windows defender features had a lot to do with this as well as screwing up hardware drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The steam folder was on the drive &nbsp;before the 1703 was updated from 1607.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I am not running raid configurations in any form.</p>
<p>The sad thing is I just rebuilt this system recently and spent the better part of the last week copying and installing</p>
<p>over 3tb of data to have this crap go on, no more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, this has been an ongoing issue with microsoft operating systems long before win10 because MS thinks we are all idiots behind the keyboard.</p>
<p>The built in maintenance tasks are a joke and most often things like this are a results.</p>
<p>I and may others do not have hours, days or weeks to devote to having a working stable system, only to have you geniuses through a monkey wrench in on every single update.</p>
<p>Linux at least tries &nbsp;to warn the user of sts and lts and the road they will travel, but MS just goes down a blind path taking more systems with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had reinstalled, &nbsp;completely removed the realtek driver software and hardware (ghost drivers) &nbsp;on 1703</p>
<p>and on every reinstall of the &nbsp;&nbsp;realtek suite, no mater what version, source the same windows driver was installed (03-2017 even after setting win to not install hardware drivers).</p>
<p>There were no error messages, just the &nbsp;space still used on the drive and only one folder &nbsp;visible amounting
</p>
<p>too approx a few mb. </p>
<p>So, I put the drive on another system, (1073 using usb external) and it wanted to scan the drive also with the same issues and lockout.</p>
<p>So, copied what data I was able to to another drive and deleted the partition.</p>
<p>Now 1607 is in the pc with the issue but installing reinstalling the realtek driver now works.</p>
<p>I have deferred updates on that system until forever.</p>
<p>It is the only uefi bios pc I use, but except for the cloned drive, no changes were made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think MS needs to "stop intergrading installed games from other sources &nbsp;into the xbox
</p>
<p>ecosystem because it can not know if a game or folder is legit or not because it was not installed</p>
<p>and added by the programs option"&nbsp;</p>
<p>500 or 1000 steam games on a hard drive does &nbsp;not need to be installed, it is tied to the user account.</p>

<h2>            How To Delete Old Windowsapp Folder in C&#58;&#92;Program Files&#63;</h2>
                    So recently I had done a system restore point. In order to have done that I needed to rename the Windowsapp folder (which I renamed to Windowsappss) which I did and system restore worked. After the system restore I noticed that there was another Windowsapp
 folder beside the old one (Windowsappss) and when I tried to delete the old folder I was not able to and said I did not have permission to do so. So my question is how do I completely remove the old Windowsapp folder?

<h2>            After upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, my PPPoE connection no longer works</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PPPoE connection which I sometimes use on my work laptop.&nbsp; Since upgrading to Windows 10 it no longer works, and what I mean by this is - it appears to connect just fine (Shows as connected, and as having internet access by the Network &amp; Sharing
 Center), but when I load a web browser (I have several - Edge, Chrome, firefox, etc - all behave the same) I cannot surf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnosing so far, I can see the PPPoE connection is correctly receiving a public ip address, and the designated DNS servers from the host.&nbsp; It does not appear to be receiving a default gateway (shows as 0.0.0.0) - is this a bad sign?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to ping/tracert to a website gets nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I load the PPPoE connection properties from the adapters window (where the actual lan/wifi adapters also reside) and go to Networking tab, I can select Internet Protocol Version 4 but when I click on "Properties" nothing happens (no errors, no new windows
 or any observed effect, it's as if I didn't click at all) - should I be able to bring up a properties display or is this button normally unresponsive for PPPoE adapters?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a new PPPoE adapter and the problem exists with the new iteration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

    <title>Apps not connecting to the internet, even when the computer is - and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hdmastre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apps not connecting to the internet, even when the computer is - and it won&#39;t shutdown without direct intervention.</h2>
                    <p>My computer, running Windows 10, says that it is connected to my network, though apps will not connect, telling me I have no internet connection.&nbsp; This seems to resolve itself randomly after maybe two hours or more(At least, I think so, this only happened
 once), but it happens every single time I restart my computer.&nbsp; And additionally, I cannot restart my computer using the "restart" option, or even the "shut down" option; these just make the "Shutting down..." or "Restarting..." message with the spinning circle
 appear forever.&nbsp; (It's not frozen, either, the circle continues to spin.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the computer seems to be able to get information from the internet- the Twitter app told me I had a new message, but when I tried to view the message it told me I had no internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an answer for me?&nbsp; I have no clue what i need to do to solve the problem.&nbsp; answers I've found online require opening a safe boot menu, but when I try to access that, it just gives me an infinitely spinning circle like the shutdown or restart.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There can be numerous causes of your internet connection and shutdown/restart issue such as incompatible programs or device drivers running. To provide the most effective steps in resolving the issue, we'd like to isolate it by asking a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the error messages you're getting when using the apps that requires internet connection?</li><li>Are you able to load a page on your browser?</li><li>Were there any changes made to your computer settings or updates installed on your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>When did it start happening?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15287/windows-why-can-not-get-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> about correcting issues with connecting to the internet. You can also try
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">performing a clean boot</a></strong> to identify third-party processes that may be hindering your Windows from restarting
 or shutting down normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual</strong> after troubleshooting with clean boot of the knowledge base article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The error messages I receive on browsers are the same that appear when I don't have a connection; "You're not connected," "This webpage cannot be reached," etc.&nbsp; However, on some of the other apps, they just try to load indefinitely.&nbsp; Other apps say that
 they cannot reach the internet.&nbsp; The thing is, the computer tells me I have an internet connection and everything, and the modem works perfectly, as well as the internet on the computer I'm using now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure.&nbsp; It happened suddenly after a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started happening a few days ago, as I said, after a restart, and then reconnected two or three hours later, but it seems like the sudden reconnect was a fluke, because the next time I restarted, the same problem occurred, and it did not resolve itself.</p>

<p>If Windows 10 have features that are not working correctly, it's possible that some corrupted system files are causing it. We recommend running the
<strong>System File Checker </strong>and <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong> on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
link</a>. This tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as mentioned on our previous response, performing a clean boot may also help us in
<span>identifying factors such as third-party security software, system utility applications, system processes, and other software that may have also affected your computer's performance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it addressed your concern. </p>

    <title>Can&#39;t run, uninstall, or reinstall Forza Horizon 3 after HDD swap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davedegnan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run, uninstall, or reinstall Forza Horizon 3 after HDD swap</h2>
                    <p>Had Forza Horizon 3 installed on my D drive. Cloned D drive to a new hard drive and put it in. All other apps and games and files moved over fine, except Forza Horizon 3. Attempting to uninstall it returns nothing. Even using third party tools to uninstall
 and remove residual files does not fix the issue.<br />
<br />
I do notice now that there are two entries in my Store Library for the game, "Forza Horizon 3" with the XBOX logo on the thumbnail, and "Forza Horizon 3: Standard Edition" with no XBOX logo on the thumbnail. Both store pages say "This app encountered an error,
 reinstall it" and intending to reinstall it through either page starts a download that stops at around 37.85MB and hangs there until the install fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found anything to solve the issue. WSreset, and even purging the Store cache through PowerShell doesn't help. If anyone has a solution I'd be grateful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my Snipping Tool and Paint have stopped working, prior yesterday I had no problems, and no I haven't changed any settings or installed new programs.</p>
<p>What happens&nbsp; when I select an&nbsp; area using the Snipping Tool, and then try to <strong>
SAVE AS&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; a pop up box tells me Snipping Tools is not working. The same thing happens exactly when I try to use Paint&nbsp; and &nbsp;print screen.</p>
<p>I've tried to restart, and&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing works.</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>TIA</p>

            <p>To Aldwin Rod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, my Snipping Tool and Paint are back working, maybe because I tried over 50 times and the Microsoft computer eventually shorted out the problem, I think.</p>
<p>But back to your initial question,&nbsp;the pop up boxes were on the screen for a very &nbsp;short period then disappeared&nbsp;and what I can remember to the best of my memory was that which ever one I was trying to use, Paint or Snipping, the box would read that the&nbsp;program
 has stopped working and that windows was looking for a solution.</p>
<p>Much later on in the day everything was back to normal, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Trouble using remote desktop with an ad hoc network .....</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I want to control my desktop with my tablet - both run windows 7 however I am encountering some problems.
<br />
First I create an adhoc network on one computer and connect to it with the other via the wireless. No problems - I can file share. I enable remote desktop on both computers. In system I allow remote connection on both computers and have tried both network level
 authentification and "any" version of remote desktop.&nbsp; What happens is this , I get a warning that it isnt a recognised certificate but proceed anyway, then I have to give the password for the desktop, and then the desktop screen goes blank then goes to the
 startup screen where I have to login again and the adhoc wireless connection disconects..... any advice ?<br />

    <title>Lag Switching Hacks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> obsdianprime  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lag Switching Hacks</h2>
                    
<p><span>I know it's a pain in the butt: I'm talking about the arduous trek into the Doors of Pharros and the pvp ganking that it usually entails. I have taken my share of serious beat-downs from the combo of traps, npcs and human defenders
 of the covenant. I recently joined the Rat covenant and started my tenure defending the place from would-be adventurers. For the most part, it has been fun, challenging and rewarding. UNTIL I came across several players that have made an annoying habit of
 exploiting some serious lag switching techniques. Several times, after I had gotten the better of the two opponents in this example, I found them invulnerable to mine or the npcs attacks, and their ability to continually drink Estus flasks, uninterrupted by
 any sort of attack. At one point, my g/f watched as my toon, one of the area Mastodons, a Grym warrior and one of the rat mobs pounded on him as he continually drank, all to ZERO effect. Immediately after, he appeared behind me and managed a backstab critical
 attack. I won't bother posing the glaringly obvious D-Baggery of exploiting the game in this manner and will instead advise anyone reading this that two people in particular,
<span style="font-weight: bold">evildeadki117 </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold">
skyrimdevil1050</span> are shameless hacks exploiting this lag-switch invulnerability on xbox 360 and should be reported as I have done</span></p>

<p>I can understand your issues. But sometimes the lag is seriously a bad connection, not always the other person's fault. But if they were guaranteed using unfair or cheat methods, then they deserve to be reported. I deal with a lot of bad scenarios in PvP,
 but it hardly affects me. I've had a few issues with my friends in other countries, or right next door with a few issues that I was invincible, they could do no damage, but to me they were trying and failing horribly to do anything to me, and I defeated them.</p>

<h2>            Money disappeared on my account &#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Support,</p>
<p>I was asked to write a post in this forum for a little help. I just spent the last hour chatting with online billing/support and they spent a lot of time and effort and couldn't figure out what happened to all of my money that I had in my xbox account. Last
 seen last week.</p>
<p>Billing confirmed that I didn't have any promotional points or expiring points (currency) so they couldn't figure out why all the money in my account disappeared. Being the only one that has access to my account and my xbox, I'm not sure what happened. Billing
 took every avenue to verify if I lost anything but they couldn't find the cause of the missing funds, hence why I'm posting here.
</p>
<p>I would hate to lose almost $70 in xbox currency so anything you can do to help would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>Thank you !<br />
<br />

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;However, support was incorrect in sending you here. &nbsp;Anything to do with billing must be handled via phone support. &nbsp;No one here can get access at all to anything regarding your account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Give them a call instead of using online support for further assistance. &nbsp;If you live in North America dial 1-800-469-9269.</p>
<p>In the meantime log in to commerce.microsoft.com to see if the billing history shows any purchases that you weren't aware of. &nbsp;Perhaps someone else in the house made purchases on your account when you weren't around.</p>

            Hi,
<br />10016 errors are generic and are present on every functioning computer.
<br />When you say crash, does it reboots unexpectedly or something else?

 a player in South Korea. I have a GamerTag and I've got some screenshots just in case to make sure that I have the proof that my progress didn't save. All the time I try to bid something it says that The current server cannot check the profiles. I tried it
 all the time and it never works. I cannot buy any cars or bid cars though I have the credits. Also, I play Forza Horizon 4 SE in Windows 10 and everytime I exit the game and I join the game, I lost all my progress and savings. I have to start it over and over
 again, and it doesn't save. I've played it for about a week, and I've never seen it saved. All the levels, credits, cars, races...etc. Please I need help.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Homegroup cannot be set up on this computer</h2>
                    howdy all, upgraded to windows 10 last night and seemingly had no issues whatsoever. That was however, until I went to use homegroup , which gives me an error message saying 'homegroup cannot be set up on this computer'. It seems like my PC already thinks
 there is a homegroup established, but I can not delete or leave that group (not given the option to in settings) and of course I cannot remember the password to the old homegroup . This is probably the main function on use on this home PC and really, really,
 really, need help to either get past the error message or help to remove all old homegroup settings on windows 10 so I can establish a new one......any suggestions.....thanks

<p>It would help if you could quote the error message verbatim instead of your own interpretation.</p>

            dialog box is checked and after clicking next then I get a box asking which drives I wish to exclude and not re-format. So I check all drives except the new drive and there is also a message below the dialog box saying the drive with the system image is
 already excluded.<br />

            <p>I do not know what image creation/restoration tool you use. With the native tool the user faces this screen when restoring an image:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f56219c6-f62e-4066-b3e8-09a3d0b73b2f" /></p>
<p>Note also that all disks other than the target disk should be physically disconnected during an image restoration process.</p>

            I am using the windows 7 backup/restore for system image. OK so I have to disable all disk drives? But my system image is on a data hard drive disk, so what about that one?<br />

            <p>Backup and restore is used to back up / restore data files. It has nothing to do with images.</p>
<p>Image restore is used to restore the whole system partition.</p>
<p>I created the picture in my previous post by booting the machine with F8 into Repair Mode, then using Windows System Restore.</p>
