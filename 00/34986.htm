<h2>            I bought State of Decay 2 ultimate edition DLC not working.</h2>
                    It was working fine after the update and than I restarted my computer. My DLC stopped working. I tried to install the game, and the base game does work but not all the extra stuff. I tried to download the DLC and I get a message saying there is no applicable
 devices and I need to sign into my MS account, which I did. I have no clue how to fix this.

    <title>Duplicate Product Key - How to Fix&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Duplicate Product Key - How to Fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Because I had trouble with WindowsUpdate, I downloaded the ISO images and generated DVDs for 32-bit and 64-Bit using the Microsoft tool.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Everything </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">was done from my primary system.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then proceeded to upgrade my primary system from the 64-Bit ISO without incident. Later inspection shows Windows is activated and the Product&nbsp;Key is the one I had originally under 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did a 32-Bit ISO install on my secondary system. This was an upgrade over Windows 7 SP1 Pro 32-Bit. Because I was having problems with stability I decided to do a bare metal install using the ISO&nbsp;DVD. In that process I was prompted for my Product
 Key. I entered the one I used for Win7 SP1 but it was not accepted. Whenever prompted, I elected to skip entering the Product Key, figuring that I'd fix it later. The install completed OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked, Windows was already activated. The Product&nbsp;Key reported was the same as I am using on the primary system. I'm thinking that this was embedded somehow in the installation media when it was generated on the Primary system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to switch to my Win7 Product Key I get a response with code 0xc004f050.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the activation process to accept my original Win7 SP1 Pro 32-Bit Product Key? Or is this not worth fixing?</p>

    <title>Possibilities of X360 viruses&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lachlan ruhr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possibilities of X360 viruses&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Before I start I should note that if you can't be bothered reading the whole thing, just skip to the end. ( (^_^) /</span></p>
<p>So I thought this'd be an interesting discussion. Viruses are a common held thing nowadays, and can come in a variety of different shapes, colors and flavors, and our computers have a different taste for every one. Some eat up and poop out Trojans, or they
 might get wormed through a backdoor but still come out looking like they did when they went in. They're a beautiful piece of firmware that can do all sorts of nasty little things. But the question here is, where can they go and how can they get there?</p>
<p>It's not impossible for a computer to get a virus, regardless of whatever security you may have. One's bound to turn up eventually and when it does, you just kill it, right? Wrong. Depending on the type of virus these things can get into your system and
 intentionally leave traces of it behind after wreaking a bunch of havoc. It's pretty much exactly the same as having like a cold or a flu. You may get rid of it but for a few days afterwards you'll still feel a bit murky and drowsy and generally ill before
 your body returns to full health, and during this process your system becomes aware that it is vulnerable, and will always be vulnerable to that specific type of illness. All it needs is a kick - a little bit of fuel to zoom it off in the right direction.
 And how does it do that? It leaves a trace of the illness, so that next time you come across it, it'll infect your system much easier. Now most of that is true, The rest of it I've probably just excreted out of my ***, excuse the language. But let's stop for
 a minute and think of an alternate reality where the garble I just said about the human body actually does apply, so that we can use it as a foundation for our discussion.</p>
<p>Moving back onto viruses, these things leave traces of themselves on your computer in a much similar way. A carbon copy. A passive mindset. They leave themselves there so that when and if you do something potentially dangerous for your computer, it'll take
 advantage of your risk and use it to fuel its escape, otherwise rendering your computer back into the state it was in when it first contracted the darned thing. Let's say this virus in particular is one of those high-end viruses that can send itself across
 a network of computers, importing itself on each and every one and wreaking its own personalized type of havoc. In other words, it leaves a carbon copy of itself on each computer on that network of computers, and thus they're all infected. They can't travel
 wirelessly though, so they rely on cables. These cables let them go in and out, in and out, and they prance around like a pair of butterflies so that you can't even catch the damned things. Clever little nits.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong>Ultimately those three paragraphs have led to this point. Why, you may ask, have I wasted your time with all of this? Well I've basically infected you, just like a virus. I've sucked you in and you've downloaded all of my data, and you've
 seen so much that makes you want to find out what it's all about. Well now I can tell you.</p>
<p>This isn't so much of a statement, but more of an elongated question. Now I'm well aware that the Xbox consoles can 'allegedly' not get viruses, because they "can't download from Internet Explorer". In other words they lack the technology that our computers
 have that otherwise allow us to get viruses. But what about those viruses that can easily travel across a bunch of copper, from one device to another? Maybe not through a direct cable-connected Internet, but maybe through a USB port? If you can get a virus
 on a built-in hard drive, it's not really impossible that external hard drives can also get affected. Why would scanners allow us to scan external USB's? Why can we send stuff from drive to drive? Everything's connected in a way, and when that virus sees a
 connection it grabs it. It wants to make your job of removing it a total pain in the ***, and trust me when I say this, because I've removed about 24 high-risk viruses all in one major scanning - at least one quarter of those were all different Trojans. Trojan
 downloaders, trojan agents, trojan droppers... it was not a pleasant situation to be in.</p>
<p>My ultimate question here is that viruses possess the ability to travel from one place to another - that's how they get onto your computer in the first place. So if you can't download a virus onto your Xbox from the Internet, what if you can send one via
 direct cable connection? Not intentionally, of course, but you get what I mean.</p>
<p>^ I'm aware I could have just said those last four sentences in the first place, but where's the fun in that? You gotta get your audience hooked in before you make the big reveal... Gives it some drama. ;P</p>

<h2>            Grand Theft Auto&#58; San Andreas, Disk is Dirty or corrupted</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have recently purchased San Andreas off the market place for 800 ms points. I started off my save file in Las Venturas and the game worked fine, whenever I traveled to Los Santos the Game would stop and say it is corrupted or dirty, which doesn't make
 any sence seeing as I downloaded it. Do I deleted the game data, deleted the system cache, then deleted the game and redownloaded it and I still had the problem, it seems like whenever I go past a certain place in los santos it freezes or gives me that message
 so im guessing there is something wrong with the game download itself? I deleted the system update and tried downloading it again but I still got that error! I would really like play my game as its in my opionion one of the best games ever made, I would really

<p>Hi there Internal, I've been hearing quite a bit about issues with this game and seeing various forum threads pop up. Doesn't look like your alone on this one, so sorry for the troubles! Because that this is a Original Xbox Game title, I would imagine the
 issue is coming from that you have a Hard Drive that isn't from the first 360 Hard Drives that were designed for backwards compatibility. I would definately suggest trying to download the game on a original Xbox 360 HDD, but if you can't preform that action,
 your best bet will probably to call phone support for further help. </p>

<p>I understand you want to play your game, I know I definitely would! From your original post, it sounds like you've already done most of the troubleshooting steps I would have suggested other than this:</p>
<p>Delete GTA: San Andreas from your storage menu</p>
<p>Clear your system cache</p>
<p>Go to the Xbox Marketplace, and download approximately 4GB of demos or other content.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, go to download GTA: San Andreas again out of your download history or in the Xbox Marketplace.</p>
<p>As a last resort, I would again suggest contacting phone support for your region. If you're in the US/Canada, the phone number is 1-800-469-9269.</p>

<p>I tried what you said and it didn't work. I contacted an xbox ambassador on chat last night and they said they were sending a report(or whatever it was called) in to xbox support and it would hopefully be fixed in 24 hours and if not to contact them again.
 As other people are getting this problem too ill wait and only call as a completely last resort!</p>

<p>Hey Internal! This is something we're currently looking into, to help with the investigation, can you tell us the file size of GTA: SA that you have downloaded to your console? This will help us determine if the file size in the Marketplace is accurate.

<p>If I understand, it's one thing to change language &amp; region ON my XB1, and another thing to "migrate" my Live account, right?</p>
<p>I just want to know if I'll lose games after I switch my region from US to France.</p>
<p>I bought them on my XB1 while the region was set to USA, I want to quickly switch to France, where I live, so I can setup OneGuide with my FR TV provider, then switch back to US.
</p>
<p>Will this be possible? Thanks!</p>

<p>As I remember if you change regions, you would then have to wait 90 days to change it again, so it can not be done quickly. This link might help you:

<p>Yeah, no, that's the thing. There seems to be confusion with "Migrating Live accounts" and "change Xbox One regions."</p>
<p>You're correct that you can only change your Live account region every 90 days.
</p>
<p>But the Xbox One is a different beast. </p>
<p>I know for a fact that you can switch the "language/region" settings on you Xbox One as often you want. The first day I bought mine, two months ago, I did it at least five times.
</p>
<p>But that was before I bought any games.</p>
<p>If you're Anglophone and living in say, France (like me!) and you want your Kinect commands and games in English, you have to change the XB1 region to US, UK, CN, AU, etc...</p>
<p>So now that I have a decent amount of games downloaded &nbsp;from the Store, I'm worried if I'll lose them if I have to switch language settings back to France.</p>

            Hi Ernest.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Most reports are that it cannot now be installed even in Compatibility Mode, but you can try it: 
<br /> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/...</a>
<br />
<br />However there are some alternatives now to Money which users appear to like:

<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />If it's working on the older laptop with Windows 10 I don't see a reason why it won't work on the new one. Give it a try and let me know how it goes.

            It's in <strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Defender</strong> .&nbsp; A couple of notes:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Windows Defender is an antispyware program.&nbsp; You still need an antivirus program.
</li><li>Some programs with antispyware features, like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> , disable Windows Defender. </li></ul>

            <p>If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> &nbsp;(freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the full installer for Adobe Reader 11.0:</p>

<h2>            Untitled messages after start up</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Last night after start up of my ASUS laptop running Win10, a series of messages appeared on a blue screen as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>We have updated your PC</p>
<p>All your files are exactly where you left them</p>
<p>We've got some new features to get excited about. (do not turn off your PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now these were unannounced and untitled messages, so I have no idea where they have come from. I shut down the laptop upon reading the last line above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a Microsoft update/ message, if so why was it untitled? If it is not from Microsoft, do you have any ideas what I should do. I intend to send the same message to ASUS and my anti virus supplier.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p />

<h2>            Security for Windows Update&#40;KB2922229&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows Vista 32-bit SP2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this update on Patch Tuesday(14 April 2014)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started when I went into windows updates and clicked, "Check for Updates"</p>
<p>Checking for updates...</p>
<p>Then I gotten 8 updates, and installed all of them at once.</p>
<p>After installation and reboot, the windows start-up screen hangs. As in it shows the message, "Please wait..."</p>
<p>After ~3 minutes the message disappears and the log-in screen shows.</p>
<p>I log-in and the start menu changed into the classic start menu. I also got a pop-up message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"<strong>Failed to connect to a windows service.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. This problem prevents limited users from logging on to the system. As an administrative user, you can review the System&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.techguy.org/windows-vista/817522-solved-system-event-notification-service.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Event&nbsp;</span><span>Log</span></span></a>&nbsp;for
 details about why the service didn't respond."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After closing the pop-up I initialized a System Restore and restored to before I installed the updates.</p>
<p>After the reboots I log back in and everything went back to normal.</p>
<p>I checked for updates again and installed them one-by-one.</p>
<p>After installing "Security for Windows Update(KB2922229)", my start menu goes back to classic and got the pop-up message.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the update and rebooted, everything went fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading the update manually and the problem is fixed, somewhat.</p>
<p>The start menu hangs and outputs the please wait message, but after logging in, the pop-up did not show and the start menu did not change.</p>
<p>But being fussy about the hang time on start up, i uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am here, I hid the update and now looking for a solution.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            I had exactly the same issue. Downloading the update manually didn't help, same problem, so I have also applied System Restore and hidden the update, and would love to know the real solution.

            I got this Security update for Windows Vista KB2922229 last evening with 5 other updates and I selected the updates as I shut down. When I started up this morning my screen had changed and my standard grey back ground at the tool bar had changed to white
 and it had changed the appearance of my email and other applications. I did a restore to before the uploads and it restore everything to my normal views. I then started adding one update at a time and this was the last one- it called for a re-start and then,
 same again -it changed the views of my system and it seemed to slow things etc. I have now restored to before that upload and all is ok again. How do I get rid of that item off of my 'important security notices'?? I am not going to load that in again unless
 Microsoft fix whatever it is that is wrong with that. Can you advise please???

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not restart the computer after installing the Windows Update “<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB2922229” I would suggest you to restart your computer and check if that resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This might be due to any software/hardware conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have multiple security software installed on your computer? If yes, then it is recommend that you have only one Security software installed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keeping multiple security software will create issue like “System freeze, slowness, Conflicts”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            I'm having a similar issue with Windows 7 Pro x64. I have remote connections enabled on my system. Unfortunately, the KB2922229 Update breaks my remote connect and reports "This computer can't connect to the remote computer." There are no errors on my
 event manager. My temporary fix is to uninstall and hide the update. Please HELP!<br />

<h2>            3D Builder - Slowing down and locking, sometimes crashing</h2>
                    <p>I have a 3D project, that seems to be maybe too complex? or something because Builder is slowing down. It takes minutes to save, and like 5+ (still waiting!) minutes to "Merge". &nbsp; Sometimes it will crash, like doing a Subtract. &nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't seem that elaborate
 to me, its just a box with some mountings on it and a few holes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some kind of complexity limitation? &nbsp; Right now 3D Builder is burning 19% CPU, and 2,672 MB of memory on this Surface Studio and it is just not workable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I keep from getting into this predicament?</p>

<p>No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to know if a design is too complex for it? or is approaching some sort of limit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a work around, I cut the project into two .3mf files, exported them as .stl, and combined them in the 3D printer utility app provided by the printer vendor.&nbsp; But it would be nice to avoid such steps.</p>

<p>Yes, you’re right. There are limits on how many objects and design can be used in 3D Builder. OBJ and VRML files can only be loaded, while 3MF, STL, and PLY files can be loaded and saved.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the workaround in this thread. Having the capability to print your files without going through these steps would be an excellent addition to 3D Builder. Of course, we don't want this idea to go to waste. As such, we strongly believe
 that this needs to be heard in our Feedback Hub platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way, you can help our engineers improve the 3d Builder’s features and overall functionality in the future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On a Windows 10 device, type <strong>Feedback Hub</strong> in Cortana search, then launch the app.
</li><li>Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press <strong>+ Add</strong> new feedback.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.
</li><li><strong>Important</strong>: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done.
</li><li>Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong>.

                    I had a Windows update forced on me last night and this morning I can't get on my laptop because my password is not being recognized. I got on my tablet and went to Microsoft support and asked for a call back-- and that was three hours ago. No one is calling,
 I can't get on chat, and this website is letting me type like one letter every fifteen seconds. Is this normal? I'm beyond furious. I don't know what to do!

<p>Hi Gloria,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing with your PC might be due to corrupted system files upon updating, while there might be a bunch of people using the
<strong>Community</strong> support page which results in latency.<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that your PC recently installed an update, have you tried using your
<strong>Microsoft</strong> account password to log in to your PC user account?<br />
<br />
Have you tried doing a <strong>system restore</strong>? If not yet, you can follow these steps to see if you can perform a
<strong>system restore</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key from the keyboard, then click <strong>
Power</strong> -&gt; <strong>Restart</strong> from the sign-in screen.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>from the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Advanced options</strong> from the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen, then click
<strong>System Restore</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC didn't created a system restore point before the issue happened, you can consider choosing the
<strong>Refresh your PC</strong> option from the<strong> Troubleshoot</strong> screen or the
<strong>Startup Repair</strong> option from the <strong>Advanced options</strong> screen.<br />
<br />
Make sure that you also have a stable internet connection as there may be a system background process in progress.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens after following the above mentioned troubleshooting steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

            Hi sun-jun,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>OK I think its all clear to me now. </p>
<p>People who belong to counties with large populations and good internet infrastructure don't care about off line gaming because they don't have to put up, day in and day out, with substandard connection speeds.
</p>
<p>For those of us who don't have that luxury, seeking the level playing field of LAN gaming IS important. Removing this functionality is a step backwards.</p>

<p>Hi Ice, </p>
<p>I was not trying to suggest that MW3 was Xbox One. Merely that it is an example of a system linkable game.</p>
<p>Again, a bunch of other games refers to what could be done on the 360.</p>
<p>Regarding Titanfall. My observation is based on the fact that it is a minimum 3 versus 3 maximum 5 versus 5 game, which sits very nicely in the LAN arena. It's probably why they have made the beta for the private match. If it was made to sit, as you say,
 on the server side this is probably because there was simply no scope to design it any other way because Xbox one does not have system link.</p>
<p>I agree with your next few points as you back up my initial point well. Lack of demand. They are simply catering for what makes them money. Large populations with quality internet infrastructure make them money.</p>
<p>I assume you have heard the term the squeaky wheel gets the oil? It would seem that system link users are in the minority, ergo a small squeak and no oil. I accept this, but it does not change the fact that my gaming experience (and that of the 20 or so
 people that I LAN with) is being compromised by the lack of vision of this large organisation.

<p>Thanks for the link. I'll take a look. </p>
<p>Re Titanfall. Yes, I understand that it is all built for online only play. My observation is merely that it would be a fantastic game on LAN if was designed to do so. Unfortunately it is not.</p>

<p>Why not? Kids who don't remember LAN parties are probably too young to have mortgages, wives or children, competing for their unwind time. Those of us who get away from the grind for a weekend, really enjoy uninterrupted LAN parties.</p>
<p>Is LAN a threat to Live? Not likely. After LAN players still take the games home to play alone later.</p>
<p>Does EA really need to know who plays and when? Maybe that information could be sent via host partyleader, rather than every individual player requiring a connection and Live account logged in.</p>
<p>If LANners want a game, they check the back of the cover for system link compatible. COD has it = bang ten copies sold straight up. Battlefield doesn't = one copy sold, then bitched about at the LAN party.</p>

<p>Just a note: I (and many others) would happily buy a LAN compatible version of Titanfall, if/when made available. Anyone wanting to collect where the current version fails LAN customers might want to get on that. There's a niche gap in the gaming market,
 ripe for the picking.</p>

<p>I will add another note: When I (and my 20 fellow LANers) were deciding which of the next gen consoles were were going to purchase (XBox One or PS4) I can tell you straight up that we would have chosen whichever console had a system link type facility. As
 it turns out, neither of them did. I find it curious that a company would decide to drop a feature that could potentially give them an edge over the competition in what is a fairly cut throat market. It's not like they had to plan and design it from scratch.</p>
<p>In the end I purchased an Xbox one because of some notion of loyalty. I don't feel that loyalty is being reciprocated.

    <title>Windows 10 Desktop slideshow time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pmares57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop slideshow time</h2>
                    Microsoft forcibly updated my computer to the most recent version, and I lost the ability to have my desktop slideshow change every 10 seconds. I use it when that timing prior to conferences and lectures to set the atmosphere. The least available time
 now is 1 minute. However, when using a laptop and showing on a big screen, the picture that conference attendees see changes every 2 minutes because the 1 minute change alternates between the laptop display and the screen! How can&nbsp;I retrieve the 10 second
 change? I have tried the "regedit" command, changing the decimal value in "interval" to "10000" as was recommended by this forum, but as soon as I leave the "regedit", the value goes back to 60000! Am I missing a step? I see no where that I can save the change.
 What am I missing?

Are you able to access the "mailto" registry key, as explained in the above article. A permissions error or missing key can cause this as well.

I'm 99% sure I am not fully understanding how to modify the registry.&nbsp; I freely admit to not being an expert with windows.<br />

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My laptop freezes and Windows consistently has been unresponsive for the last few weeks. I have run disk repair and defragmented hard drive. &nbsp;I just realized that I do not have programs that I lost when I recently ran a Windows
 Reset'. &nbsp;I reinstalled some apps &nbsp;that I lost and &nbsp;Google Chrome but when I look at &nbsp;'Programs and Features' I can see that there are certain programs not listed that I remember being listed before I ran Windows Reset, although I do not remember the exact
 name of the program! One is obviously very crucial, as I remember it being on the computer ever since I purchased it. It's called 'Microsoft' something. please help.<br />

            <p>Hi Leon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you performed a reset on your computer, only the default applications and programs that came with your computer will be available. Any other programs will be removed and would require you to manually download or install them. Microsoft has a lot of
 programs and we cannot determine which one you are looking for.</p>
<p>

<h2>            xbox one controller only works with usb</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Xbox one for little over a month now. I bought my xbox one w/ a play and charge kit and began playing it with the charge kit in the controller via usb and had no issues then when i disconnect the usb ...within in 2 minutes the controller disconnects
 and reconnects. Its SOOOO FRUSTRATING OMG. So i reconnect and within 2 mins it does it all over again. I figured hey maybe its the controller and it just needs a update. Updated the controller and nothing has changed. Ok maybe its still the controller, so
 i buy a new controller today to find out if its the controller and i figure out the new controller does the same damn thing. So *** ***.</p>
<p>Is it my console?!</p>

<p>It could be actually, it could also be your positioning of the console. If you have the console in a case with doors that have metal or glass- that causes issues with the connection with the controller. If it's possible try to avoid that, and move the console
 away from those areas. </p>
<p>Also, it may in fact, be the console too. See if the controllers work with other consoles.

            <p>What version of win is installed?</p>
<p>Are the drive(s) configured in an array, if so what controler is being used?</p>
<p>Have you run the<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> win7 upgrade advisor</a>?</p>
<p>I suspect the hard drive is connected to a raid controler or scsi controler that first requires that the driver is installed (third party drivers) in the initial win7 installation process, before the drive can be detected, I also suspect your hardware is
 not supported on win7.</p>
<p>Any drive controler driver would be obtained from Dell, specific to your model</p>

<h2>            Receiving unfair&#47;unjust reputation on Xbox account.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. It was recommended&nbsp;to me by the Xbox support staff to post here&nbsp;about this concern.&nbsp;<br /><br />The issue I'm facing is that I have just&nbsp;received an&nbsp;unjustified "Reputation: Needs Work" branding on my account page. &nbsp;The only reason I could think of&nbsp;as to why this may have happened led to one game specifically I play:&nbsp;Dead by Daylight. If you're unfamiliar with this game it's notorious for players who&nbsp;once they&nbsp;lose at a match(or in some cases even win), send harassing inbox&nbsp;messages and&nbsp;report the account of who they've played against.&nbsp;<br /><br />Knowing that this game was like that early on&nbsp;definitely tipped me off that my account could be in jeopardy of receiving an unfair label. I had contacted the Xbox support team many times beforehand detailing my concerns with the unwanted messages and reports&nbsp;and now, lo&nbsp;and behold, I have a reputation associated with my account.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br

Please avoid these players in the future" etc.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>You're not the first and won't be the last with this problem. Players in competitive games like Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege regularly abuse the report feature on players they lose against as a way to get back at them. Microsoft has recognized this is a problem and announced "changes" to the rep system, but have shown no progress towards fixing it. The current rep system we have is something straight out of a 90's MMO and is an arbitrary, easily manipulated numbers system that mostly reflects how many people you play with instead of giving an accurate representation of the community's thoughts on your behavior.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Until Microsoft fixes the problem, the only thing you can do is stop playing the game in question.&nbsp;It's very sad that toxic communiti

<p>Hi pubspk,</p>
<p>Unfortunately once the data is completely wiped out you cannot recover it back in Windows.</p>
<p>You will have to rely on third party software that gives you this functionality. Please use your favorite search engine tool and browse for a software that is reliable and that can help you in retrieving the files from the formatted drive.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
