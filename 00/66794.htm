<h2>            App crash after Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hope someone can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a 32 bit App that used C++ 2012 Redistributable. On some systems after upgrade to Windows 10 the App stopped working for the user that performed the upgrade. If a new user is created on the same system the App works as expected. We have establihsed
 that the App Crashes when the first DLL call is made to a CLI &nbsp;library we used to hook C++ code to our WPF user interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried cleaning the App from the user and reinstalling it, the issue persists only for the user that performed the Windows upgrade.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> trivk85  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB wakeup boot fails after upgrading PC to Windows 10 Pro.</h2>
                    <p>I used USB Wakeup before installing Windows 10 Pro on Windows 8.1 and it worked just fine then. One tap on the keyboard, and my PC would power up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10, the keyboard will light up when I press it, indicating that it is powered, but the computer won't boot up along with it. thought USB Wakeup was mostly set in the BIOS? I checked it over, nothing seems to have changed there since
 I installed Windows 10 Pro. Does anyone know what might have caused this change in operation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The regular power button works fine, but I need the USB wakeup feature. My workstation isn't conveniently located next to my desk.</p>
<p>

I have two issues with this. First of all, it lacks a date stamp. I haven't been able to do a USB wakeup since I finished installing Windows 10, so this obviously can't be it. My best guess is that this data entry is a remainder of Windows 8.1. Secondly, as
 you can see it doesn't seem to be specific enough. Host controller. Controlling which device?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help so far. My Technet subscription ran out a little while ago and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get any help.</p>

            <p>Hello Kalpana Shankarappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. I'm running Windows 10, so Windows Update is pretty much activated indefinitely. I'm assuming I've got that part covered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the bios, I was hoping I did not need to alter anything in there, but you are likely correct. I am aware that Microsoft doesn't offer any guarantees there, it simply isn't their job to maintain my hardware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update my bios, but I may need to build up some courage first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi again, Kalpana Shankarappa</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to update the ASUS bios to the latest version. Sadly it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked device settings and found something odd. The option to do a USB wakeup with my keyboard has actually been greyed-out. I don't have the first idea why this has happened, or how to put it back. At least this does hint at a problem with Windows 10
 and not the bios or device drivers:</p>

<h3> david woodwx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Connect to home Wifi After Windows 10 1607 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my HP laptop from 1511 to 1607 I cannot connect to Wifi via my home router. The network connections are there and the Qalcomm Atheros AR9285 802.11b`g`n Wifi adapter is working (or says so when checked) with the latest driver installed.&nbsp;
 Other compputers can connect to the router and I have made no changes to the laptop except to upgrade Windows 10 from 1511 to 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgrade three computers from 1511 to 1607 and two have had problems. One had display problems which were fixed after several hours (no help fromMicrosoft for question posted on that). This laptop is working Ok except for the Wifi connection (IThe
 upgrade did change some Microsoft Word setting which kept crashing, but I have rectified that I think).&nbsp; As ever the Wifi Troubleshooter is useless and the only response I get when try to connect to the network is "Cant connect to this network". The details
 of the Troubleshooter report say:</p>
<p>Security attempt status fail 0x0004805</p>
<p>for the router the troubleshooter says "Connectible: No. Reason 0x00028006"</p>
<p>Lamentable performance by Microsoft. I hope that one day they will be made to pay a huge fine for the disruption they have caused through Windows 10 updates. I have had to write off one laptop totally after a few months working with 1511 . I now have another
 that is not usable for the purpose i was using it before the upgrade to 1607. In addition I have spent (wasted) a huge number of very frustrating hours trying to fix issues with Windows 10, with Microsoft not offering adequate support for problems that many
 are facing or even acknowledging that these problems are the result of the upgrades forced upon users.</p>

<p>Since posting the problem I have unplugged and replugged in my router several times and have now got this laptop to connect to it intermittently via the Wifi adapter.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, it fails to connect to it frequently and reliably.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It never did this before the 1607 upgrade and has connected to that router (along with several other devices) without a problem. The other devices continue to connect to it without a problem. It is not a problem with the router.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It seems that some security issue has arisen due to changes made by 1607. Has anyone else experienced this. I originally updated this laptop from Windows 7 in 2015 and it had no problems connecting to Wifi through the various Windows 10 upgrades.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It was running without problems on Windows 10 1511 before it was upgraded a few days ago to 1607. That is when the problem began.</p>
<p>I used to use this laptop frequently when travelling, and I am now concerned that it will not connect reliably to other networks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have not tried to do this yet.</p>

            <p>Thank you for these suggestions. I have successfully conducted the first three steps (but not yet updated the BIOS as it is not straight forward to do so; an HP failing rather than a microsoft failing in this case). I am travelling and the laptop successfully
 connects to my hotel Wifi and stays connected. I am not yet sure it will do the same with my hom wifi. I will know that on my return nect week.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Updating and installing the Qualcomm Atheros wireless driver to version 10.0.0.329 was not easy.&nbsp; The poor performance here by Windows 10 is that it tells you that the old driver is the most up to date one when you check it in device manager.&nbsp;
 Surely there should be some coordination between the network card providers and microsoft when rolling out a Windows 10 upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

            Having updated the various suggested drivers, as explained in my previous reply, the laptop's wifi connection to my home wifi system unfortunately remains intermittent. Prior to the 1607 windows 10 update it connected easily for many years, and I have
 other devices connecting to the wifi system without a problem. The laptop has has connected without a problem to new outside wifi sources, but failed to connect to one that it had connected with before.&nbsp; There seems to be some barrier that leads to the message
 "cannot connect to this network" from my home wifi system (and perhaps others it historically connected to) that was not there before?<br />

<p>
</p><p>For possible resolution, we have found this <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/unable-to-connect-to-any-wifi-connection-windows/8c75719e-80b2-40cf-984c-c85bf8491942">thread</a></strong>.
 Look for <strong>Annu Singh</strong>'s post. It includes instructions on how you can resolve this concern. Other Community members found it helpful. Give it a try.</p>

            <p>I have followed the instructions completely from Annu Singh's post as suggested (Methods 1 and 2), but it has not resolved the problem.&nbsp; I still get the message "Can't connect to this network" when trying to connect to my home wifi, which my other devices
 do and this device used to for many years before the Windows 10 1607 update.</p>
<p>I would welcome other suggestions</p>

            ok. so after hours of reading Microsoft stuff that isnt very helpful at all, i decided to try stuff on my own. I went into settings, network and internet, at the bottom of the window there is a network reset link. i did this and my wifi seems to be working
 correctly now. &nbsp;All those pretty brains at Microsoft and cant even release an update that actually works with no bugs. Figures..... I have a HP Envy laptop in case anyone was wondering.

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit-- Can&#39;t open 32bit programs after removing IE8 google redirect malware&#58; involving SysWOW64&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, I have a problem.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, and I recently had that "google redirect" malware that was giving me popups and problems with IE8 32bit.&nbsp; I downloaded Lavasoft's Adaware and Spybot S&amp;D, and it cleared up the redirect problem.&nbsp;
 Now, however, I can't get any 32bit applications to work.&nbsp; IE8 64bit runs fine, and that is how I am able to post this message.. but any and all 32bit applications do not work for me.&nbsp; They don't show up in the Task Manager, when I click them I get the "waiting
 wheel" next to the cursor, and then nothing happens.&nbsp; When I reboot in safe mode, I get the exact same problem.&nbsp; I can open folders fine, and in the control panel&nbsp;I can access Computer Management&nbsp;, Windows Update, Windows Firewall, etc, but not Java (32bit).&nbsp;
 &nbsp;No 32bit applications at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I figured the redirect worm infected some 32bit files, and the malware-removers cleared out something that was crucial to running 32bit applications?&nbsp; I&nbsp;remember that some of the problem files that were removed were located in the SysWOW64 folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea about this?&nbsp; I can't really use my computer as almost all of my programs are 32bit.. please help!!!!</p>
<p>I have tried sfc /scannow and chkdsk, both come up with no errors after running them each about 7 or&nbsp;8 times (I am desperate!).&nbsp; System Restore shows no recent restore points, even though I am sure I made some a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I can not run any antivirus
 or anti-malware programs anymore, and downloading a new 32bit program to get any kind of&nbsp;log file is not possible...&nbsp; Please please please help!</p>

            Maybe both tools deleted Windows system files.<br />
<br />
Please start the <strong>command prompt (cmd.exe)</strong> with <strong>admin rights</strong>[1] and run sfc [2]:<br />
<br />
<strong>sfc.exe /scannow</strong> <br />
<br />
Is it able to find and repair broken files?<br />
<br />
best regards<br />

<p>They might, but I am unable to open either of them as they are 32bit programs...</p>
<p>I do remember it quarantining or deleting the following files from the SysWOW64 folder:</p>
<p>iexplore.sy_</p>
<p>fastuv32.dll</p>
<p>lspab20.dll</p>
<p><span>taskcgr.exe&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>is there a way to tell if the problem is due to something missing from the SysWOW64 folder?</p>

            <p>I have the same issue as listed above by WM48312... No 32 bit processes running no matter what. I did the usual checks, no tampering noted. I also pointed Procmon 64 at internet explorer and found no explination in the output for the fails. (no entrys noted
 in event logs for this).. Spent time working on this issue with Microsoft support this evening.... They seem to think an inplace upgrade or reinstall will fix it.... Of course reinstalling will fix it... I called them to avoid that... Would be nice is they
 could assist down to root cause and write up a nice easy KB for us to follow which would resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was anyone able to make any headway with this or all just reinstall?</p>

<h2>            On Windows 8.1 I cannot access the Start Screen or the Charms Bar</h2>
                    I am using Windows 8.1, the computer works OK at first (I can temporarily access the Start Screen), then once I have been on the desktop for a short while I cannot get off the desktop. The Windows Start icon in the bottom left corner is white, it flickers
 black when I put the mouse over it but does nothing when clicked. Pressing the Windows key on the keyboard does nothing, the charms bar will not appear at all. This means I cannot shut the computer down and it is very difficult to start Apps. Other than being
 stuck on the desktop I have not noticed any performance issues, and I can open programs / apps by navigating to the exe in Windows Explorer or by starting them from a desktop shortcut and they run normally. I can even access the Windows Store because it is
 pinned to the task bar. Does anyone have any ideas about what could be causing this and what I can do about it?<br />

            <p>Windows has a number of recovery features to get "back up and running" quickly after a problem occurs.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option One: System Restore</strong> (Safest, try this first)<br />
You can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files. It only takes a couple minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn't fix the problem on the first
 try. When you aren't sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.</li></ul>
<ol>

<li>Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+R</strong> to show the Run box, type
<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore, or try another date.</li></ol>

<h2>            What happens when you select keep nothing when installing windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So, I'm trying to install windows 10 using a dvd I created with the official media creation tool, and I tried installing it and I was told that I would be unable to keep anything. I was wondering what
 exactly that meant. I have installed windows on the hdd and all my files are on the same hdd drive. If I select keep nothing, will I still have the stuff on my hdd, or will absolutely everything be deleted?.Any help would be appreciated.</span></p>

<p>If you wish to keep your files, you would be better to reset your PC rather than perform a clean installation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the Shift Key whilst clicking Restart, this will bring you to the Windows 10 Recovery Environment:</p>
<p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep all your files and Apps<br />
This will re-install Windows 10 whilst keeping your data and applications</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to clean install Windows from the installation media all your data on your C drive will be lost, however, what you could do is create a data partition on your C drive, copy your data to that partition and then clean install Windows 10 . . .</p>

            What I would do is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If problems persist go over this Checklist to optimize the install for upgrade: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            No.  Proceed with the steps I gave you, skipping none.  Report back results for other possible steps.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The error in a pop up window that appeared after the installation reverted to my old Win10 version and auto rebooted states that installation failed in SECOND_REBOOT phase during MIGRATE_DATA operation... this is after attempting a manual install with
 the downloaded ISO file...

            Hi again Bill -
<br />
<br />Did you try the optimizations steps in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> as these work for everyone who tries them all.
<br />
<br />Note that if nothing else works you can choose at the screen for Change What to Keep to save nothing or just your files and it should complete as by then the issue is most likely a program or setting conflict.
<br />
<br />But since these kinds of failures almost always point to the underlying install quality, what really makes the most sense is to invest now in the Clean Install because no one who's followed this install closely has come back with a single reported problem through repeated version Updates.  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Keep us posted.

<h2>            Samsung BlackJack II&#40;2&#41; Will Not Sync With Windows 7</h2>
                    Hey, I cannot seem to figure out how to Syncronize my Samsung BlackJack II(2) with my Windows 7, 64-bit based computer. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Mobile Device Center, and all that but... Everytime I connect my BlackJack via USB,
 a notification pops up at the bottom that says "The Devices Drivers Unsuccessfully Installed". And it just won't work! I was wandering if anyone could help me with this problem!<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my Direct-X Diagnostic File(DxDiag.txt)...<br />

Much support and help would be appreciated,<br />

            Hi Aaron Brewer,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Answers forums.<br />
<br />
Microsoft doesn’t have any information about its compatibility with windows 7. So I suggest you to contact its manufacturer for its latest driver and firmware.
<br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/info/contactus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.samsung.com/us/info/contactus.html</span></a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may also download and install, the Active Sync 4.5 and Windows Device Mobile Center 6.1, and check if this helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Download and install ActiveSync:<br />
<br />
1. Click the download link on this page, and then click Continue.<br />
2. Select whether you want to register for the Windows Mobile newsletter, and then click Continue.<br />
3. Click Download files below, and then click Download (next to the Setup.msi file).
<br />
4. In the File Download dialog box, click Run.<br />
5. Follow the instructions in the Installation Wizard to install ActiveSync.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/activesync-download.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/activesync-download.mspx</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Download and install Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1.<br />
Follow the link below to downlaod it and additional help.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx</span></a><br />

<p>In laptop dedicated slot is an&nbsp; 240Gb SSD with Win10 /64 bit (upgraded from 7 Pro license). Purpose: job, MS Office, etc</p>
<p>In a bay (in place of ODD) is an 750Gb SSHD with another Win7 64bit. Purpose: home use, multimedia, some old games.&nbsp;2 partitions on this HDD: 250 GB with OS and
</p>
<p>To switch boot I access BIOS and select: UEFI -&gt; for SSD with Win10&nbsp;&nbsp; or Legacy -&gt; priority&nbsp;to "bay" for SSHD/Win7.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is that otften volumes get dirty and need to check. </p>
<p>Not every time, just often, especially after updates on either OS.</p>
<p>After using win7 and boot in 10, the win7 hdd is checked at startup.</p>
<p>After use win10 then boot in win7, the win10-SSD is checked for errors.</p>
<p>On each OS the System Restore option is&nbsp;ON for respective storage and Off for other one (Win10 restore ON for SSD, Off for SSHD, and vice-versa in Win 7)</p>
<p>

</p><p>What cause this?</p>

<p>What can I do to avoid those long start-up disk checks?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I just just was on&nbsp;holliday,&nbsp;laptop was with us, used almost every 2 days with win7 system&nbsp;(from HDD).
</p>
<p>5 days ago I just saved all the pictures and movies&nbsp;from holliday on 2nd HDD partition!</p>
<p>When I came back to work, switched to Win10 SSD, it tells me that volumes D and E (C and D on that Win7 HDD) need to be checked ... done its job ...and disaster!</p>
<p>Computer don't load Windows 7 anymore!</p>
<p>1st partition of HDD can't be accesed in Win10</p>
<p>2nd partition is there, but all new data (including vacation pictures) are missing ...like a flash back or old-version restore of 2nd partition!</p>
<p>I will try to repair that hdd with an win7 instalation DVD.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a feature in Win 8, 8.1, and 10 called Fast Startup that may be aggravating your problem with the way it speeds up the boot time... It saves settings\configurations instead of reloading them at boot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be a problem when running multiple OS's...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>

    <title>My biggest gripe about Borderlands 2 and why It needs a more honest - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abadon-340dc684-5a6b-46ae-b820-08ff0375b99a  say:</h3>
<h2>            My biggest gripe about Borderlands 2 and why It needs a  more honest tagline.</h2>
                    
<p>I get so tired of seeing Borderlands 2 advertisements screaming "Over a gazillion guns!" What is should say is "Over a gazillion guns....and no where to put them!"</p>
<p><br />
Seriously 2K.....what is the point in finding so many guns and imeddiately having to sell or drop them.&nbsp; Pandora has all this space and you can't edit in a personal "vault" to store items?&nbsp; Yes. I understand having to make choices, but I prefer to test and
 fire the guns at liesure before selling them.&nbsp; I'm also sick of storing guns in limited slots while I wait to reach a level that will allow me to test them.&nbsp; The game constantly "defaults" to having a full backpack, then slowing down the action while you decide
 what to keep and what to trash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not have a burned out tank, vault, house...whatever, that I can dump everything in and come back to it when I feel like sorting through them instead of&nbsp;carrying weapons with me I can't use and having to sort through them&nbsp;mid-mission? It's so annoying
 that I haven't even bothered playing it online yet.&nbsp; I don't want people to have to wait while I figure out what I'm keeping and vice-versa. Please add this long overdue feature in a DLC&gt;</p>

<p>Looks like you have only played the game for 30 minutes. Get a little further in the game and Roland will let you use his vault to store whatever you would like. Also the point to the gazillion guns is never knowing what you will get when you open a loot
 chest or kill a boss. I understand some people have problems letting things go but you will find a better gun around the corner.

<p>I just don't pick up white items. I only pick up Green or better.. seems to make it a lot easier. After a while, I only pick up Purple and Orange. You can also purchase storage upgrades that add more slots to your backpack. As others said, you also eventually
 get a 2 banks&nbsp; to store items in, one is shared between all your characters. You just have to play the game for a while to unlock these features. Hopefully, you stick with it that far, because this really is a fantastic game and you would be missing out if
 you quit playing for only this reason.</p>

<p>You get storage to store items in Sanctuary and you can also upgrade backpack and storage slots with Eridium in Sanctuary.

<p>I try to only keep 1 of each weapon type and 1 of each effect so I'm usually carrying 6-8 weapons on me at any given time. I don't even use the bank to be honest, I keep everything in my backpack. I hold on to weapons until I find something better to replace
 them with and I only hold on to the old weapons that are worth money till I can sell them. If I replace a gun with something better and it's not really worth selling or holding on to, I just drop it and move on. In a game where the items you pick up get progressively
 better, it's pointless to horde older weaker weapons because there are some many different and better ones as you go along imo.</p>

<p>Why is Halo3 soooooo slooowww online? (I have a broadband connection ADSL2+, NAT is open)</p>
<p>Why do i get killed with 1 or 2 shots, and I can't kill opponents with a full clip to the head?</p>
<p>Why am I a Lieutenant in the service record but no achievement is unlocked? (Perhaps that's because some days I'm a GSgt gr2 in the record...it changes)</p>
<p>Why&nbsp;can other players move so much quicker than me in the game?</p>
<p>Why do I always get the BLUNT sword?</p>
<p>Why are my mellee strikes not effective? (Sometimes I have struck 3 times and the opponent strikes once and I die)</p>
<p>Why don't some opponents die when I shoot them IN THE HEAD TWICE with the SR?</p>
<p>Why is Halo 3 such a crap game compared to Reach (where I dont have these problematic things happen)?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a valid explanation from some sort of official. I doubt I'll ever get that though....my money has been got, and I'm just an old fool from the end of the world who just likes to play for fun.....only it isn't fun with these things
 happening, or not happening.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have these problems with Halo3?</p>

<p>It's almost all lag, but it's nothing wrong with the game.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) Since you're Australian, Americans typically pull Host over you. This means that your connection has to send information all the way to the US and then all the way back before anything looks like it's happened. That is your problem for the first question
 you had: the Host of most matches is miles away from you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2) I have no idea. I suspect you aren't seeing something that's important, but if not then it's just lag. However, this looks like extremely severe lag so I suspect there's something wrong on your end (playing while the connection is capped, playing while
 others are using your connection heavily).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3) I do not know about this Achievement, I haven't been after that Achievement for several years. However, the conditions changed when an update was released for the game. I suggest getting 50 EXP in any single playlist as I believe that grants you the Achievement.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>4) I suspect you are simply missing something again. There is no way to move faster than someone else.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>5) When the sword runs out of ammo it loses its blade but otherwise I do not know.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>6) When you melee someone, your connection has to go to the Host ---&gt; then the Host acknowledges it...... then it goes back to you ---&gt;. What this means is that you will punch someone and your connection will start going to the Host. However, if they are
 closer to the Host, they will punch you first (because players melee at roughly the same time and they're closer to the Host), it will register before yours does and it will kill you, preventing yours from ever taking place.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With regards to hitting someone three times I suspect you are playing when someone else is using your network, though I can't say, of course. A particular match could also have problems (sometimes the Host is poor and can't process information quickly, but
 this affects everyone) although this is not going to be common enough.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>7) Again, I'm going to say this is your network being used. This will be a cause for most of your problems beyond normal, long-distance Host issues. There is one other possibility you may have noticed that I won't discuss, though this is unlikely to have
 been an issue enough for you to have noticed it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, sometimes bullets simply don't count and this is a lag issue. It happens with all weapons but it's very obvious with the Snipe, of course.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>8) Personally I think Reach is the worst Halo game to date and I do not play it, but that's up to you. A big reason you'll find it more playable is because it's a newer game and newer games always have better netcode, of course. This means that many of your
 connection issues can simply be ignored because the better netcode can handle it entirely.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Reach also has better regional matchmaking settings so another major issue is generally avoided: you'll find people, and therefore Hosts, who are in Aus or close by, so you'll generally avoid standard lag due to long-distance Hosts.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>9) Lastly, I have issues due to American or other long-distance Hosts, as almost all of us do, but I don't have issues with most of the other things you mentioned. Like I say, I suspect most of the issue is your network being used excessively but I can't
 say.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, I'm no official but I can explain almost anything to do with H3 if you have any other questions.</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies, particularly your in-depth reply CSB.</p>
<p>The other &nbsp;thing I considered is that my game skills are not up to it.</p>
<p>I'm not a star, but I'm no slouch either.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when an unexpected event occurs in a game I replay the film to see what actualy transpired from the POV of the opponent as well. Yes there are still issues. I suppose that's the way it goes.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I have just purchased Dragon Naturally Speaking Voice recognition software for my 14 year old dyslexic daughter. I have installed it but have received the following error message: "Cannot find multi-media device. Check to see if your computer has a sound

 they also insisted I purchased a windows 10 platform. The store also assured me it was the best laptop to support the software and actually showed it to me in the store as a staff member was also dyslexic and used the same laptop &amp; software. I cannot however
 seem to replicate this now at home. All advice welcome. I'm trying to set it up so she can use it in school fro assessments this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With thanks</p>

</p><p>Since they (the store) sold it and demonstrated Dragon on the same make and model PC I would take it back to them and get them to install it, demo it,&nbsp;shut down the laptop, power on the laptop and demo Dragon again after rebooting to be assured it will work
 every time you use the laptop.</p>

<p>Check <em>device manager</em> for any warnings about sound devices. In <em>settings / privacy</em>, verify that microphone and voice activation are enable for Dragon. Also, go to
<em>settings / system / sound</em> and make sure the speakers and microphone are working, there's a troubleshooting option you can use and hopefully you'll find the fault.</p>
<p>If not, I agree with CK and you should take it back to the store.</p>

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>

<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the Spring Creators Version 1803 since successfully installing it   will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.
<br />
<br /> Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Michael,
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            insignia 11.6 ns-p11w6100 tablet drivers are missing after reinstalling windows 10 through the USB boot method</h2>
                    Hello I bought a Insignia 11.6 tablet with Windows 10 as its operating system. I started it up and everything worked perfectly fine, the touch screen keyboard, orientation, and tablet mode until I did an update through the Windows 10 update center. After
 it updated and rebooted I had lost my sound drivers. So I did the update driver and it told me to reboot. I then got hit with Driver Overrun Stack error and could not enter Recovery mode. The device kept looping on and off showing me the blue screen of the
 error. I couldn't enter recovery mode so I made a USB bootable Windows 10 flash drive and accessed the BIOS to boot from the flash drive. It worked and I managed to get Windows 10 up again but now I have zero tablet features. No touch screen, wifi, sound,
 camera drivers exist. Device Manager shows no hidden devices or unknown devices. The HID touch screen driver is missing and the Sound category is nonexistent. I've tried looking for Insignia drivers but there are none made available

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you have provided us, the best way to resolve your concern with your tablet's drivers is to contact your tablet's original equipment manufacturer. Kindly contact their support team and ask them for assistance. They are the ones
 who can assist you better with your concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>If you have internet access on the tablet, run Windows Update.</p>
<p>But see <a href="http://community.insigniaproducts.com/t5/Computers-Accessories/NS-P11W6100-Drivers/td-p/83273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this message board</a> to find all the drivers. I guess others have had the same problem.</p>

            Thanks for responding. Yeah I tried those drivers before posting forgot to say that and I also tried the NS-15 tablet drivers from those forums which had a lot of drivers even HID touchscreen drivers as well but my tablet kept saying it didn't support
 the platform or the drivers aren't supported. The NS-15 tablet drivers they have posted have a lot of drivers but I get not supported or the devices stay stuck with a question mark. The most I managed to get working with those drivers was the WIFI. &nbsp;Windows
 Update doesn't find anything besides updating virus definitions.

<p>Wow. I hope you didn't pay too much for that tablet.</p>
<p>Did you try the Intel update utility?</p>
<p>You might try running the installers in compatibility mode for windows 8. I'm reaching here. Sorry.</p>

            I paid like 70 bucks so it isn't too bad. Never tried installing with compatibility mode I'll give it a shot. I did the Intel update utility and it installed some drivers but no tablet drivers. Just regular intel stuff for the CPU and such.

<p>I had the same issue with trying to install the latest update to my tablet.&nbsp; I was all set to return it to Best Buy so was resetting it to clear all of my personal information.&nbsp; I selected the option to reset as if it was being recycled.&nbsp; It took a couple
 of hours and I noted that it completely reinstalled Windows 10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on that I went ahead and applied the latest update also. To a bit of my surprise it is now working great with the updates applied.&nbsp; No more driver issue for the WIFI adapter and I don't have to deal with returning the tablet that I really like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is good for everyone and it is time consuming but it did the trick for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your attempts.</p>

<p>A further update to this reply (also from me).&nbsp; I spoke to soon.&nbsp; The reset just put the tablet back to the factory version.&nbsp; The update that is causing the issue had not been applied.&nbsp; It has now been reapplied and the tablet is again broken (error opening
 the WIFI connection software) with no known fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like the design and price of this tablet but do not want to run old versions of software, especially with all the hackers trying to disrupt the world.&nbsp; I'm returning it today.</p>
<p>

            Do you mean you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Windows cannot display the volume control on the taskbar because the Volume Control program has not been installed. To install it use Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
That usually means that your system is now or has been infected with malicious software and your unspecified antivirus/antimalware program has quarantined (effectively deleted) the following file (assuming XP is installed on your C Drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\sndvol32.exe<br />
<br />
That part is usually easy to fix if by just replacing the file, and replacing the file will do nothing to relieve your system of malicious software infections, but we don't know anything about your system.<br />
<br />
I will take a guess and think that you are running some version of XP with Service Pack 3 and you have no genuine bootable XP installation CD.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the file for XP Service Pack 3 to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these two folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to replace existing files.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
You need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
That may not solve all your issues, but you will at least be past that part and then we can fix the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully you are curious to know how this happened, so answer these questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, no matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, I would follow up with this:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.</div>

<h2>            Windows error 0x800704cf</h2>
                    <p>I've had this issue with Windows 10 for a few months now, and after scouring the internet for solutions, I've yet to find one that works for me. In every other instance that anybody else has seemed to have this issue, support just stopped replying after
 their first two solutions didn't work. There doesn't seem to be a single solution on the internet.</p>
<p>The issue that I'm having is that Windows apps do not detect an internet connection, either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. But desktop apps, such as Chrome, Steam, etc. don't have any issues connect to the internet. In fact, I can access the store, and everything
 loads, but when I try to download an app, I get the error:</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>You'll need the internet for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't look like you're connected to the internet. Please check your connection and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0x800704cf</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network location cannot be reached. For information about network troubleshooting, see Windows Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Send feedback</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Clicking the "Send feedback" link gives me an error, that says, "To use Feedback Hub, connect to the internet." When trying to update Windows, I get a message that says, "We couldn't check for updates, because you aren't connected to the Internet. Make sure
 you have a cellular data or Wi-Fi connection and try again." Again, Windows claims that I have no network connection. When clicking my network icon, I get the message,"No internet, secured." I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling network adapters, flushing
 DNS, factory restoring, and all the works. I've tried every single solution I can find online, and eventually I run into the same "fixes" over and over again. Not a single solution has helped. I've read an instance from another user that said a support member
 remote controlled his PC and even the support couldn't fix the issue. I've run out of solutions, the only other one that I can think of is purchasing another Windows 10 license and starting fresh on another hard drive. Is there any way to fix this without
 completely discarding all of my data? Is there a way to possibly salvage this?</p>

<p>I have this same issue.&nbsp; It just started last week when I installed the April 2018 Windows 10 updates.&nbsp; I was unable to access my PC with my windows account, unable to login to the Windows Store, yet here I am online on the same PC with a local account typing
 this message online.&nbsp; There is a yellow triangle on the Windows Security shield in the task bar, but when I click on it; all green checks on the Windows Defender Security Center "Security at a glance" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a few diagnostics and read numerous posts as well...no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had 2 windows accounts on this PC and cannot access either so I don't believe that it is account related.&nbsp; Luckily I also had a local admin account that works.&nbsp; From the local admin account I am able to add more local users, but no Microsoft accounts.&nbsp;
 When attempting to create a windows account or login to the Windows Store I get the same error mentioned above:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

    <title>mouse drivers not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackskeleslug  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse drivers not found</h2>
                    <p>I was using my USB optical mouse Logitech m100 and it suddenly stopped working. Now when I plug it in it recognizes the usb optical&nbsp; mouse but it doesn't work because it doesn't find drivers, it displays the message (in italian) : "driver non disponibile".
 It's strage because it should not need drivers in order to work.&nbsp; I tried to reboot the pc, update drivers via device manager and unistalling the usb optical mouse device but it still doesn't work. I've also tried plugging in another mouse, wich didn't work
 as well, but if I plug in other usb devices such as a dvd reader and my smartphone as well and they worked fine. I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you fo you attention</p>

<p>It still doesn't work...</p>
<p>I think the problem here is that I can't find drivers to download or update because the mouse doesn't need them in order to work, I've tried all kinds of troubleshooting. It's really annoying.</p>

<p>That is normal and the default so the issue does not appear to be at that registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the mouse plugged in can you provide the following information which may help determine&nbsp;any issue(s):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp; &gt; OK &gt;&nbsp;File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via&nbsp;a public folder on OneDrive&nbsp;or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>eventvwr </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp;&gt; OK&nbsp;&gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .evtx file available via&nbsp;a public folder on OneDrive&nbsp;or similar site.</p>
