    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after installing 3rd hard drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dgoods  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after installing 3rd hard drive.</h2>
                    I have a Seagate external hard drive that my new PC would not recognize. &nbsp;So, I removed it from the case and installed it internally. &nbsp;When I start the PC with the new hard drive, Windows just spins at startup. &nbsp;My boot order is still the same, and there
 is NOT a copy of Windows on the new drive. &nbsp;As soon as I disconnect it, I have no issues. &nbsp;Thoughts?

    <title>How do I remove YourFile Downloader&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lt1042  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove YourFile Downloader&#63;</h2>
                    I am pretty sure my son downloaded something called YourFile Downloader last month while playing games on the internet. &nbsp;Since then, I get a popup at Start up saying that YourFile Downloader recommends an Urgent Update. &nbsp;When I tried to remove the program
 it will not allow me and tried to start a Trojan virus which my security stopped. &nbsp;The program files for this program are password protected and cannot be deleted. &nbsp;There were user files added the same day as the program so I assume they are from this program.
 &nbsp;I deleted the User files. &nbsp;My Trend Titanium and Microsoft Safety Scan show no viruses, malware or spyware. &nbsp;I mainly want to stop and remove the irritating popup every time my computer starts. &nbsp;I am also afraid that someone may click the update and launch
 a new problem.
<div>Can anyone help with this?</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>

            If you're not sure it's malware, try opening Control Panel, navigating to Add/Remove Programs, and removing it. Some malware can't be removed this way.
<br />
<br />
You could download malware removal tools such as malwarebytes (free,) try running it, and see if that will identify or quarantine the issue.
<br />
<br />
System Restore may solve the problem. <br />
<br />
If you're sure it's malware and your security is very crucial, reinstall the operating system. Do not forget to attempt to backup your personal files.<br />

            Hi Glenn, 
<br />
<br />I'd try to remove and re-add your account. See if you have better luck. 
<br />
<br /> Also, check out the link below:

<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/18614/windows-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/18614/...</a> 
<br />
<br />Microsoft no longer supports Windows Live Mail. This means they won’t intentionally try to break the app with updates, but they aren’t trying to keep it running either.
<br />
<br />We can also try this:
<br />
<br />I would try to setup your account with "Mail" for Win 10. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type "mail" and launch, you should be able to add your account by following the prompts.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps!
<br />

<p>Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; Strangely enough, after two days of no email receipt or send, my Windows Live Mail delivered email just as I was about to remove and re-add my account!&nbsp; I'll be looking into setting up an account with "Mail" for Win 10 given Windows
 no longer supports WLM!</p>

 work. </p>
<p>I have tried to locate themes in services to activate it but themes is not there.</p>
<p>I have also re installed the graphic card drivers and that didnt work, I tried to roll my pc back to before the issue happened but the option is not there to go back that far (about 2 weeks or so).&nbsp; I have run updates, I tried microsoft fix it and microsoft
 aearo fix it but nothing worked. </p>
<p>I assume it has to do with themes missing from the services local folder. Any ideas on why this is missing? I know I have not deleted it myself.</p>
<p>I really dont want to have to do a clean install of windows 7 as I have way too much software that I use on a daily basis for photography and videography, not to mention graphic design and website design.

<p>If anyone can help I would really appreciate it. </p>

<h2>            How can I find what programs I need on startup of puter, I went to System Configuration, but don&#39;t know what to uncheck to stop running on startup of puter</h2>
                    <p>I ran a report on my puter, trouble shooting report.&nbsp; It detected that I needed to check in System Configuration on the programs that were running at startup of computer.&nbsp; I have several there I will list the ones that are there and maybe someone can tell
 me what I don't need on startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Microsoft Security&nbsp; by Microsoft</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Java (TM)Platform SE Auto updater by Sun Microsystems</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Localnet Express 3.0-Propel Software Corp&nbsp;&nbsp; (Localnet is my provider and this express is suppose to help my computer go to sites faster)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Roc_Roc_NT_unknown-AVG security search (I was told that I didn't need AVG antivirus, so I deleted it off)</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Default Manager by Microsoft</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Adobe Acrobat by Adobe Systems</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Adobe Reader by Adobe Systems</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; AVG Tray-unknown</p>

<p>I hope someone can help me for it takes 15 min for a site to load and approx. 30 to load the game after I finally get it, then the game is froze up and won't do nothing.&nbsp; Same for all other sites I go to, at my wits end and don't know what to do.&nbsp; I have
 dial up and have Windows 7.&nbsp; Just started having problems after got this new provider service.</p>

            <p>Hello Wanda,</p>
<p>A tall order, but lets see what we can do to whittle the list down. First, dial-up internet connection is slow, so keep that in mind as we work here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, just about all of your startup programs are valid and advisable to load when Windows starts. Some possible changes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) If you don't have a specific need for Java, such as the game you're trying to play might have, then you don't have to have it started at startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) As for the Adobe programs, why do you have Acrobat on your computer? Do you need to create PDF files? Adobe Reader, which has many freeware alternatives which are faster, allows you to read PDF files. So if you only need to read PDF files, you can stop
 loading Acrobat at startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) The other startup programs are all legitimate. And remember, just because you don't start a program at startup, doesn't mean you can't start it later on if you find that you do need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) The problems you're having at 'all the sites you visit' could be a function of malware. You do have AVG Antivirus functioning on your computer right? I'd recommend you do a deep scan and then quarantine and delete any infections it finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) After you run the antivirus scan I'd suggest that you&nbsp;try downloading and running these two scanners. First MalwareBytes' Antimalware, here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html</a>;&nbsp;&nbsp;second, SUPERAntiSpyware, here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html</font></a>. Quarantine and delete any infections they find.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) After doing all that, reboot your computer and see how it operates. Please post your results here, and should you have any questions during this process, post them here and I'll assist you. Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion. It was one of the very first things I tried and no joy! The error messages indicated that there might be write permission problems or missing items. And, yes, I was sure that I had administrator privileges.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final solution was to capture the Windows 10 key value, roll-back to Windows 7, and then download an .iso image for another attempt -- this time with a clean install that will resolve any pre-existing registry or sxs issues.

            When I right click on "start menu button-&gt;search" nothing happens. This probably relates to the non-functioning status of Cardano (and store). Been struggling with this for over a week. Ironically, a big motive for changing to 10 was to improve "start".
 So far 10 has been a zero on that front.

<p>
</p><p>My homedirectory has been encrypted since Win 8, and I found I needed to unencrypt the
<strong>"AppData"</strong> folder in my homedirectory, and rerun the Get-AppXPackage script referenced above. Immediately thereafter the windows button, internet exploiter (er, Edge) and other stuff started working. Of course, having that folder encrypted is
 pretty damned important, so this "fix" is all kinds of not awesome.</p>

</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 installed</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. Starting somewhere in April/May I was constantly receiving the blue "Memory_management"

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The other bug was the sleeping thing. Once it goes to sleep, I cannot wake it up without restarting the laptop. I try all sorts of things and techniques, but nothing works. Sometimes it
 even takes several restarts to get the display working. And it's like the stuff is infecting my laptop performance. Now my Windows start-up tab cannot be opened, I cannot open any video files.</span><br />
<br />

 that I have ever had in my entire life!!!!</span><br />

            <p>No problem using filedropper for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minidump files show a consistent MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (1a) stop error that may be disk related:</p>

            Hi Auggy,<br />
<br />
I did as suggested: uninstalled the ESET software and got you a .evtx file. Here it is:<br />
http://www.filedropper.com/formmrmngmt<br />
<br />
Usually the MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_ERROR thing happened to me while I was playing something and rarely while I was browsing. Hence, after uninstalling ESET I tried to play game. The first time after a while laptop randomly quit it, the second time it restarted itself
 and I got another blue screen called UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the help!!!<br />
<br />
Darius<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Looking through the Event Logs showed in May 2016&nbsp;the following errors occurred:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Volume C: (\Device\HarddiskVolume4) needs to be taken offline to perform a Full Chkdsk.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>A corruption was discovered in the file system structure on volume C:.</em></p>
<p><em>The exact nature of the corruption is unknown. The file system structures need to be scanned and fixed offline</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The file system structure on volume C: cannot be corrected.</em></p>
<p><em>Please run the chkdsk utility on the volume C:.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then this warning :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The file system structure on volume C: has now been repaired.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However after that the MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error started appearing followed by this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The IO operation at logical block address 0x75a0340 for Disk 0 (PDO name: \Device\0000002e) failed due to a hardware error</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is quite possible the hard disk may be failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things I might suggest besides considering that the drive is failing is to uninstall the Intel Driver Update Utility as it may be causing some other errors in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, turn off fast Startup as it may be problematic being enabled on your computer:</p>

<p>
</p><p>And you could try installing the Intel SATA controller which may work better the Standard controller - download the SetupRST.zip, extract&nbsp;and run the SetupRST.exe :</p>
<p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25165/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-RAID-Driver?product=55005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25165/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-RAID-Driver?product=55005</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, if you have not already, back up any critical files beforehand and create a System Restore Point.</p>

<h2>            ReadyBoost</h2>
                    <p>I have two windows 10 machines, changed over from mint Linux after a brief moment of thriftiness, anyway I'm trying to get them to be more stable, less prone to poor performance etc. anyway I found out about Ready boost, I've got two drives dedicated to
 ReadyBoost, but I looked at Services and there's no SuperFetch running, should I be concerned? both machines are 32bit windows 10 X64 processor, 4GB Ram, about a 500Mhz FSB and spinning hard drives with plenty of space. is there a reason that SuperFetch isn't
 running or isn't visible? Also, all I have is USB 2.0 ports (I think) but I've got two USB 3.0 16GB flash drives connected and they're both dedicated to ReadyBoost, or at least it allowed me to configure them that way in the properties for each drive. Recently
 run that powershell program I think it's called DISM, checking the OS for flaws or missing stuff.&nbsp; ANyway what do you think? Is it just a fluke that SuperFetch isn't running? Help!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time!!&nbsp;</p>

            Hey TB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />ReadyBoost will never work half as well as simply adding some more RAM if your PC supports it.  Running Crucial Memory Scanner will tell you for sure:  <a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/</a>.  They also have discount prices for quality RAM backed for life.  
<br />
<br />One way to tell is look at Task manager or Resource Monitor graphs comparing Memory and CPU.  If RAM maxes out faster than CPU you can afford more RAM.  If CPU is maxing out with only partial RAM use under load then more RAM is superfluous because the processor is the weak point.  
<br />
<br />As to Superfetch, some mistakenly disable it because it uses heavy resources while initializing but like Search this tapers off soon.  Here's how to enable it: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/99821-enable-disable-superfetch-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/99821-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Troubleshoot Superfetch here:  <a href="https://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-superfetch-has-stopped-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-superfetch-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Tried to Enable SuperFetch via Powershell, copied and pasted the command in the prompt, looked at services and it wasn't there. SysMain was on, though I noticed that. Should I restart or something? I also noted that the usb drive I recently made a readyboost
 dedicated drive has not been accessed yet, could be it's using the one on the backside of the computer. Anyway is there a reason it might be not running or is there something I should enable in bios? I'm going to try restarting see what that does.</p>

<p>OK. From the article it mentioned using exFAT instead of FAT32 format, so I formatted both drives after undedicating both, then re-dedicated both. Now instead of being only 5gb full they are almost completely full, again both are 16GB 3.0 USB flash drives.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm going to check the services again and see if that is active now, get back with you in a bit.</p>
<p>

            What did SFC report from Step 10 in the checklist I gave you.  If Superfetch doesn't appear in the Services panel then it's a seriously damaged system which should attempt to repair itself running SFC.

<p>sfc reported integrity intact. ran DISM and it said the same thing. Sysmain is running, tried deleting the prefetch and rebooting, nothing, I'll just check again on the services.msc . not there. Is SuperFetch pre-win 7? this computer was designed for VISTA,
 got downgraded to XP, upgraded to Linux Ubuntu, then Linux Mint 64bit, then Windows 10 32bit. Should I even worry about this? I think it is a little more stable, whatever is going on in there.</p>

            32 bit can only address 3.5 gb RAM so unless your hardware is using it the rest is wasted (check in Resource Monitor on Memory tab).  
<br />
<br />So you might want to do a test install to a partition you shrink on this drive or another drive of 64 bit to check it's performance by comparison.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you use a separate drive I'd unplug the other one during install and boot preferred set first in BIOS setup, use BIOS Boot menu to boot other.  This keeps them independently bootable, whereas a Windows Dual Boot will require surgery I can help you perform to remove the old Install if desired. 
<br />
<br />I wondered why after I gave you so much to consider - probably more than anyone would ever give in all the forums online put together - you rated my first post badly?

<h2>            People can&#39;t message me</h2>
                    people say they are messaging me but nothing goes though.. some say I am offline to them but I am not offline and no one is blocked.&nbsp; They can chat with me only in group chats. I have tried a reboot, I have tried signing out and back in, I have tried uninstalling
 and reinstalling skype.... nothing is working and I do not know what to do.

            <p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes both of them are sculpt ergonomic keyboard. The old receiver was still there but I still want to use the sculpt ergonomic mouse from the old set since I have made protection modification on it. That is why I want the new keyboard to work with the old
 mouse with the same receiver. I don't want to have both receivers plugged in. It's taking up USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it true that it is not possible to pair a new keyboard with an old receiver? Simple question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR</p>
<p>Ryan</p>

Found a simple solution to my problem. Since the USB dongle and the keyboard are a pair and not replaceable, I simply swapped the keyboard controller from the keyboard with a dongle to the new keyboard without the dongle. It is a small board with a flex cable
 going into it from the keys.<br />
<br />
It only took 15 minutes to do the job and now I have a brand new keyboard without the failing ALT key.<br />
<br />
To open the keyboard:<br />
<br />
1. Peel off the bumper feet so you can re-stick them afterwards.<br />
<br />
2. Take out the screws under the bumper feet and one screw under the battery cover.<br />
<br />
3. Carefully remove the snap-on wrist rest. Using a with a small screwdriver pry it from the rest of the keyboard. I used a 1/8" wide screwdriver and inserted it about 1/4" between the wrist rest and the keyboard body in the front and slid the screwdriver along
 toward and around the sides. All the latches popped out.<br />
<br />
4. With the wrist rest removed, all the tiny screws under it are now accessible. Remove all of them. There are two screws in the deep holes across from the middle of the two space bar keys, don't forget to remove them too.<br />
<br />
5. Slide a small screwdriver along the side between the two clam shells of the keyboard to separate them.<br />
<br />
6. Unplug the battery connector from the control board<br />
<br />
7. Unscrew two screws holding the control board<br />
<br />
8. Release the flat flex pc cable by pulling (1/16") toward the cable the dark grey plastic strip on top of the connector.<br />
<br />
9. Do the same with the second keyboard and swap the control boards. Make sure you take the control board that is paired with your USB dongle.<br />
<br />
Reassemble:<br />
<br />
1. Insert the flat cable into the connector and press in the clamp to secure it.<br />
<br />
2. Screw in the two screws holding the control board<br />
<br />
3. Connect the battery to control board<br />
<br />
4. Snap together the two clam shells by applying light pressure around the perimeter by squeezing the two parts between your fingers. You will hear a click every time it snaps in place.<br />
<br />
5. Screw in all the tiny screws located under the wrist rest.<br />
<br />
6. Snap in the wrist rest into the keyboard. Same as the clam shells, it is done by applying light pressure by squeezing the two between your fingers.<br />
<br />
7. Screw in the five screws at the bottom of the keyboard. Three screws going into the holes toward the front of the keyboard are slightly longer than the two in the back.<br />
<br />
8. Stick on the bumper feet.<br />
<br />
You should now have the second keyboard work with your USB dongle.<br />

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Thanks vsch1 for a great manual.</p>
<p>Just to make sure - and sorry for the silly question - have you or anyone else tried to pair this keyboard with other then serial usb dongle?
</p>
<p>I have noticed that the same type of USB dongle is shipped with other MS products - mice and keyboards. Maybe in such case the keyboard works but without AES ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Explain this....</h2>
                    <p>alright I have been an xbox customer for quite sometime and I can honestly say I have had nothing but issues with them. They love to take money from people but not fix the problems that cause us to ask for help in the first place. Back in October I placed a call to the customer service center because I was bring harassed by another player and blacking them was not working. I was told by the rep that I had to change my gamer tag in hopes to fix the issue at this moment I was charged 10.71 which was nonsense since I was a victim of harassment but not the point due to their lack of filters when picking a gamer tag I picked a name that they changed today. I called the customer service as normal to see if they could alter my gamer tag because they had made me change it to protect me from&nbsp;harassment which did not work and had a rude representative give me nothing but excuses of why he couldn'couldn't help me but expected me once again to pay 10.71 to change my gamer tag for a mess up.on

<h2>            Xbox HDMI - &#38;quot&#59;Invaild Format&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Evening,</p>
<p>(Apologies in advance if this is in the wrong place and/or someone has already asked. I looked but I didn't find anything on this particular issue.)</p>
<p>So my little brother hooked me with an Xbox for Christmas and of course, the first thing I do is ready up to play some Gears 3 on oh so beautiful 1080p HDMI format...well, yeah that didn't happen.
<br />
<br />
At the moment I have only have one HDMI cable and it's plugged into my Ps3. So I unplugged it from one and threw it onto my Xbox but the HUD doesn't come up. Just a message across my screen that reads, "Invalid Format". I have an LG FullHD 1080p 52inch TV but
 nothing is coming up. I tried using the cables the Xbox came with and it booted up correctly at 480. In the Xbox menu when I tried to change the format, the HD section is greyed out.</p>
<p>So why does my Ps3 play fine with the HDMI 1080p but my Xbox won't? Has this issue happened to anyone else? Any help would be awesome, thanks!</p>

<p>When hooking up the HDMI cable to the Xbox, is the Xbox turned off? Also when this occurs, is that message a tv message or is it an Xbox message? Because your Xbox should work just fine. As for hooking it up with the RCA lines that come with the Xbox, those
 are standard def lines and you would need to purchase a HD component set to use it that way, but in all cases you should be able to use the HDMI output.

<p>The Xbox is turned off. Example, first I'll turn ON the Xbox with the Av cables...works fine, however when I go to the options to try and change the settings the HDMI function is grey and non-selectable. So, I turn OFF the Xbox, plug in the HDMI cable, then
 turn it ON again and the messges is on my TV, NOT the Xbox. </p>
<p>However, this HDMI cable I'm using was a rather expensive one that I've been using for about 2 years with my Ps3. Never had an issue before and still don't. Someone mentioned that the TV might not be HDCP compatible however I checked with LG (My TV is a
 FullHD 1080P) and it does in fact support that. </p>
<p>So...I'm still pretty much at a loss. Worst come to worst, could the HDMI Port on the Xbox itself be faulty?

<p>Hey there Vigrith! We can narrow down the issue by try a few different configurations here. First, have you tried a different HDMI cable with your current TV? Also, can you try hooking your console up to a different TV, both with HDMI and regular AV cables.
 Lastly, if you have the ability, can you connect a different console up to your TV, both with HDMI and AV. By looking at the results, we'll be able to figure out exactly what is the cause of this problem and work from there. Let us know what you find out,
 thanks! </p>

<p>Okay well, got a different cable and the stupid thing finally loaded up...for a short while. Then after about ten minites of play it "lost" the signal again and the screen went blank. We also tried both cables on different TVs, with our other systems and
 they worked fine.</p>
<p>So it's not the TV, and it's not the cables. It's the 360 which blows. I checked around other forums and it's apperently a problem with a lot of peoples Xbox counsols&nbsp;and I have yet to&nbsp;read anything about&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;mentioning or doing something about it.
 Again, I think worst comes to worst could the HDMI port just be faulty or loose? How much would it even cost to replace one of those?</p>

<p>Hey Vigrith! So you tried multiple cables and consoles with the same TV, and the only time it didn't work was when using the same console, correct? And you have tried using this console on another TV and with different cables, and it still didn't work? If
 that's the case, then a repair would be your best bet. You can get that started here (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../repair-process</a>).

<p>Yes sir, we sure did and it's still the same thing. I tried "wiggling" the HDMI cable while it was connected to the 360 Port (After we had moved it BACK to my TV from trying it elsewhere) and it actually started to work again for a much longer duration.
 Managed to get in a few excellent rounds of Horde Mode on Gears 3 but it seems any movement to the 360 itself, or the HDMI port I should say, results in those two magic words...Invalid Format.
</p>
<p>I very much appricate your feedback friend! I'll get started right away and thanks for the link! ^_^</p>

<p>Can do buddy, thanks! </p>
<p>And just for a little after thought, I'm 98% sure it is the HDMI Port on the X-box. After some wiggling, and "Don't my the 360!!!" I'm having no problems at all. When moved however, it does take a big of working to get it going again. ^_^ Still, thanks for
 the link and I'll get that survey out for you. </p>

<p>Disabling&nbsp;DEP is a bad idea.</p>
<p>It is like saying "I think my car has an oil leak and the oil pressure light keeps coming on, therefore, to solve the problem, I will unplug the oil pressure light. &nbsp;It's fixed now"!</p>
<p>Data Execution Prevention (DEP) messages mean that Windows feels threatened by some program running on&nbsp;your computer, so it shuts it down. &nbsp;This is actually a good thing since Windows recognizes the threat&nbsp;and is trying to prevent further damage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You could tell Windows that the program is okay by making an exception for the program, but this is&nbsp;generally not a good idea. &nbsp;You have not fixed the underlying problem and have made your computer&nbsp;vulnerable to attack by choosing to ignore the threat.</p>
<p>A Google search finds nothing for gotomeetup.com - what is that? &nbsp;If it is a third party program, you might want to check with their support page and see if you have to do something special to let Windows know the program is okay.</p>
<p>You shuold not just&nbsp;disable&nbsp;DEP and tell Windows that every program in the world is okay.</p>
<p>Sometimes a DEP error will occur with Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>It is often seen with Internet Explorer, so it could be that malicious software has compromised IE&nbsp;itself or has compromised an IE Add-on program.</p>
<p>You should first run some good scans for malicious software and see if that will correct the problem&nbsp;and then troubleshoot any remaining issues:</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>After running the scans, be sure to reboot and then test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still see the problem, launch IE with no Add-ons and see how that goes. &nbsp;If it is okay, then we&nbsp;can figure out which Add-on is causing the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, Windows has a built in option to run IE with no Add-ons (imagine that).</p>
<p>To launch IE with no Add-ons, click Start, Programs, System Tools and choose:</p>
<p>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</p>
<p>If you can't find that, click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" &nbsp;-extoff</p>
<p>Click OK to launch IE with no Add-ons.</p>
<p>IE will launch with a message reminding you it is running with no Add-ons and ask you to click the Home button&nbsp;(do it) and then you can try some other pages. &nbsp;The pages may look different, but you want to see if you&nbsp;still get the DEP error message or not.</p>
<p>If you have added any IE add-ons lately, suspect them first of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One popular "solution" is to just disable DEP, but I would rather figure out what it is and fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is Windows Explorer that is reporting the Data Execution Protection error, suspect a non Microsoft&nbsp;Explorer Shell Extension. Shell Extensions help make up the Right Click menu for files you see in Explorer.</p>
<p>You can download ShellExView from here to see which ones you have loaded:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a></p>
<p>ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.</p>
<p>When you launch it, the non MS extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a&nbsp;hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer to the&nbsp;top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left
 and right.</p>
<p>Sort the display by clicking the Microsoft column so all the "No"s are at the top and easy to see.</p>
<p>The "No"s would be things you have added (non MS).</p>
<p>I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...</p>
<p>Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time keeping a list so you can enable&nbsp;them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required. &nbsp;Test your&nbsp;failure condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those. The&nbsp;Extensions are not uninstalled, just disabled.</p>
<p>You can also disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you&nbsp;find the one that generates the condition.</p>
<p>The hope is that you will find the one Extension that causes the error and then you can figure out&nbsp;what to do about it - usually get an update from the maker of the extension from their WWW page.</p>
<p>I don't have your issue but I can see that the Extension is immediately disabled, so disabling one&nbsp;does not require a reboot but if you find the culprit, I would reboot anyway to really be sure.</p>
<p>If you find the extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MAds121212,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Read-only and System attributes is only used by File Explorer to determine whether the folder is a special folder, such as a system folder that has its view customized by Windows (example: My Documents, Favorites, Fonts, Downloaded Program Files), or
 a folder that you customized by using the <strong>Customize </strong>tab of the folder's
<strong>Properties </strong>dialog box. The File Explorer will not allow <span>Read-only or System attributes of folder to view or change.</span></p>
<p><span>In that case, you will need to use </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Attrib</span><span> command at a command prompt to v</span>iew or to remove the Read-only or the System attributes of folders. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hold the <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type <em><strong>cmd.exe</strong></em> then press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>To remove the Read-only attribute and to set the System attribute, use the following command:</strong>
</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><em><strong>attrib -r +s drive:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;foldername&gt;</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><span>For example, to remove the Read-only attribute and to set the System attribute for the C:\Test folder, use the following command:</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><em><strong>attrib -r +s c:\test</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><span>Be aware that some programs may not operate correctly with folders for which the System attribute and the Read-only attribute are set. Therefore, use the following command to remove these attributes:
</span><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em><strong>attrib -r -s c:\test</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>

<h2>            Will MediaCreationTool allow me to downgrade 10 Pro to 10 Home&#63;</h2>
                    <p>By mistake I did a clean install of WIn10 Pro on a new boot drive before I upgraded my old Win7 Home system to Win10. &nbsp;So now my Win10 system say its activation will expire on Jan 20, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that I should have done the Win10 upgrade to Win7 first, but I did not. &nbsp;So now I'd like to use the MediaCreationTool to get the WIn10 Home install files and install it on top of my Win10 Pro system, but tell it to keep all my apps and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is - will this work? &nbsp;I am trying to avoid having to do a totally clean install of WIn10 Home and the subsequent installation of all my apps and settings.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the thought, but I don't think I can do that since my Win7 Home disk is an upgrade I used to upgrade from Vista. &nbsp;I doubt it would recognize Win10 as an upgrade candidate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the MediaCrationToolkit to download and install the Win10 Home Upgrade on my Win7 system and that worked OK. &nbsp;But my Win10 system was a clean install on a new disk; I just happened to install Pro instead of Home, and I did it beire doing the Win 10
 Home upgrade, so my hardware configuration never got loaded into Microsoft's database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm looking for the best way to get back to Win10 Home (best = not requiring reinstalling all my software.) My hope was that the MediaCreationTool would allow that, and not require a new clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did allow me to select "Keep all files and apps" when I did the 7 ==&gt; 10 upgrade; I'd like it to do the same thing with 10 Pro ==&gt; 10 Home.</p>

            <p>Painful, but you could install Vista, upgrade to 7 (SP1)&nbsp;then do the upgrade to 10, of course you would also have to reinstall programs and restore data.</p>

            <p>Well I don't think any rational person would consider doing that. &nbsp;Who even has a Vista install disk? &nbsp;It would be easier to just to a clean install of Win10 Home and reinstall all my software - which is precisely what I am trying to avoid. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there is very little info about the actual capabilities of the MediaCreationTool that downloads and installs the different versions of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to know is: Will it install Win10 Home on top of Win10 Pro so I end up with a properly activated Win10 Home installation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that your only two options are either to reinstall your previous system, then do the upgrade, or&nbsp;purchase a Windows 10 licence, unless you can convince the phone activation staff to activate it - I wish you luck there.</p>

            <p>So are you saying that the MediaCrationTool will NOT install Win10 Home on top of Win10 Pro, and in fact will only install Win10 Home on top of &nbsp;pre-Win10 OS such as WIn8 or Win7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand I can do a clean install of Win10 Home and it will activate OK - because I have done a normal Win10 Home upgrade using my Win7 boot disk. Note that this is a separate disk from the one where my Win10 Pro is installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I did a clean install of WIn10 Home on my current Win10 Pro disk I would have to reinstall all my software and re-customize everything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF - and I understand it is a big IF - I can use MediaCreationTool to install WIn10 Home on top of my existing Win10 Pro system and tell it to "Keep all apps and settings" I won't have to do the lengthy and laborious re-install of all my apps etc.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The media creation tool will do anything you want it to do.&nbsp; The issue here is activation.&nbsp;&nbsp;To get activation of the free upgrade you first have to upgrade your Windows 7 to a like version of Window 10 (Home &gt; Home, Pro &gt; Pro, 32 bit &gt; 32 bit, 64 bit &gt; 64
 bit.&nbsp; So the upgrade must be performed from within Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Thanks for those references - they are interesting for sure. But there seems to be some disagreement about what the media creation tool will do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your statement that "it will do anything you want it to do" suggests that it will in fact install Win10 Home over my existing Win10 Pro installation. This is what I would prefer because it will not require re-installing and re-customizing all my software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A MS tech rep told me today that it would not do this, and the only way I can get to a fully activated version of Win10 Home is to do a clean install of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have already done an upgrade of Win7 Home to Win10 Home using a separate Win7 boot disk, my hardware configuration has been registered with MS and any subsequent installation of Win10 Home will automatically be fully activated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation is not my problem; my problem is how to get to a fully functional Win10 Home system with minimum effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 ways to do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Downgrade my current Win10 Pro system to Win 10 Home, preserving all apps, settings, files, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do a clean install of Win10 Home and then reinstall all my software and re-do all my customizations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously (1) is preferable, but I am prepared to do (2) if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll find out which one works/doesn't work tomorrow morning. &nbsp;I've got a Win10 Home disk prepared from the proper ISO file, and I have verified that I can boot from it. &nbsp;So I will first try an Upgrade (to my Win10 Pro system); if that fails I'll do a clean
 install of of Win10 Home.</p>

            <p>The answer is no. The Home version of the Win10 installer that MediaCreationTool downloads will only
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) install a Win10 Home upgrade on a Win7 or 8 Home system, or</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) do a clean install of Win10 Home on a new or just formatted boot disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the latter case, if the system being install on has not already been registered with Microsoft as the result of doing a Win 7/8 ==&gt; Win 10 upgrade you will have to enter a valid/purchased Win10 activation key to get a fully activated Win10 Home system.</p>

<p>Hello Zyxian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If Shared Experience was turned off and still the message keeps coming up without you signing in to your Microsoft account, we recommend that you sign in to your account; turn it off, then check if the issue persists. If the issue persists, kindly roll back
 to the previous build. It will be best if you check the OS build by following the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Settings.</li><li>Click Update &amp; History, under Update status, select Update history.</li><li>Check the OS Build; then look for the parallel OS Build to install <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018124/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </li><li>Reinstall Creators Update.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Observe if the same scenario persists.</p>

</p><p>Let us know if the solution works. </p>

            I've already replied in a similar thread to this one. I have the same issue with receiving the shared message pop-up and repeated calls for me to reclaim an older Windows Live mail account even though I follow all the steps to 'reclaim' the account successfully.
 Somewhere, a 0 is not being switched to a 1.&nbsp; LOL

<p>Hello Zyxian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If Shared Experience was turned off and still the message keeps coming up without you signing in to your Microsoft account, we recommend that you sign in to your account; turn it off, then check if the issue persists. If the issue persists, kindly roll back
 to the previous build. It will be best if you check the OS build by following the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Settings.</li><li>Click Update &amp; History, under Update status, select Update history.</li><li>Check the OS Build; then look for the parallel OS Build to install <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018124/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </li><li>Reinstall Creators Update.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Observe if the same scenario persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if the solution works. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sign in.&nbsp; That is the point.&nbsp; I use a local account on my computer.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to log in to tell it not to use Shared Experience.&nbsp; Shared Experience is not looking at the setting that it is off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just been ignoring it.&nbsp; Looking at it as another update fail.</p>

<h2>            Can you scan multiple pages in Windows 7 with flatbed scanner&#63;</h2>
                    I just discovered the fax and scan function in Windows 7.&nbsp; Is there a way to scan multiple pages to the same image if you are using a flatbed scanner.
