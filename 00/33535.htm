<h2>            Installed Windows 8, pc does not want to start up or fails everytime, Please Help&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>Morning,</span></p>
<p><span>After installing windows 8 last night, and working on the new OS for about 10 minutes, my pc decided to take a break!!!</span></p>
<p><span>I have&nbsp;tried refreshing the system, and still no luck. There seems to be a problem with start-up, whereby the OS&nbsp;is just not stable enough and the pc can’t handle the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>(Might it be a hardware fault,&nbsp;i</span><span>s it time&nbsp;to get a new PC or do I play with
 the System settings to get it operational).</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p><span>Could someone please assist.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank You,</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi RyanVorster,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using Windows 8 Community!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your issue description I understand that after installing Windows 8 Operating System, your computer doesn’t
 start properly. Do not worry; I am here to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also recommend that you run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. It scans your current PC to see if it is ready for Windows 8 and
 then provides a compatibility report and optional steps for you to buy, download, and install Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link,</span></p>

            <p>You might want to reinstall your original operating system prior to upgrading to Windows 8 and install the latest BIOS updates if any are available.
</p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>

<p>First, are you in the US or ?</p>
<br />
<p>Second, you state Media Player. Do you mean Media Center?</p>
<br />
<p>Third, if you are in the US, go into Media Center, Tasks,<br />
Settings, General, <br />
Automatic Download Options. Select DOWNLOAD NOW. This should get the<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player an internal error has occured</h2>
                    <p>I'm posting on behalf of a customer who's experiencing some issues with Windows Media Player in Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She says she's receiving the error message "an internal application error has occured" all the time. It won't play CDs and won't even start.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She's wondering if she needs to unintall/reinstall it. However, she received another message saying something like her other programs may not work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to confirm further for her, she wouldn't lose any other programs in case she unisntalls Windows Media Player, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Skype Meeting Broadcast - Managing Multiple Feeds</h2>
                    <p>We have regular meetings in our main office that we want to begin broadcasting to our field offices in order to reduce the amount of time spent on transportation. These meetings typically have one main speaker with a PPT deck. We want to show both the talking
 head (using a DSLR camera and a capture device) and the PPT (splitting the video feed from a podium computer and also using a capture device).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I set this up using Skype Meeting Broadcast? Can I manage these two feeds from my computer, the same one managing the meeting? Do I need to connect each one of these video sources to separate computers, each logged into the meeting? Can Skype even
 handle external video feeds using capture devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi KevinRussell_GLY,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, you want to convert regular skype for business meeting to skype meeting broadcast, it’s not feasible to do it, you can schedule a skype meeting broadcast as below link:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-a-Skype-Meeting-Broadcast-c472c76b-21f1-4e4b-ab58-329a6c33757d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-a-Skype-Meeting-Broadcast-c472c76b-21f1-4e4b-ab58-329a6c33757d</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Schedule-a-Skype-Meeting-Broadcast-c3995bc9-4d32-4f75-a004-3bc5c477e553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Schedule-a-Skype-Meeting-Broadcast-c3995bc9-4d32-4f75-a004-3bc5c477e553</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For sharing desktop in broadcast, I found one feedback which is the feature you want:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299910--recently-released/suggestions/8661052-provide-support-for-desktop-sharing-while-in-a-mee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299910--recently-released/suggestions/8661052-provide-support-for-desktop-sharing-while-in-a-mee</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the regular meeting, you can also share desktop as following: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-your-screen-in-Skype-for-Business-2d436dc9-d092-4ef1-83f1-dd9f7a7cd3fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to share both PPT and camera, I suggest to get two monitors for a computer because of device supporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that embedded video in a PowerPoint presentation is currently not supported.</p>

            Hi VIHAANDAYAMA
<br />
<br />Windows does not have the ability to flip your display, you would need a 3rd party utility to flip your screen, like UltraMon. I don't know if they do a free version, but I am sure there is some utility available on the Internet that can do that for you . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />If you would like to make this suggestion to Microsoft, please open the Feedback hub on your PC (Windows Key + F) and make the suggestion there, the Microsoft Developers monitor that for ideas for future features to add to Windows . ..

            Hi VIHAANDAYAMA, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear your suffering. 
<br />
<br />It is possible to mirror-flip your screen. A software named "UltraMon" can do this for you. You have an evaluation version for 30 days. And you may need at least 2 monitors.
<br />
<br />Ultramon can really flip the monitor like if you are looking at it in a mirror if you want to read something on your monitor you need a mirror because it is reverse.
<br />
<br />1. Right click on the icon in the taskbar,
<br />2. Click mirror in -----&gt;&gt;&gt; setting -----&gt;&gt;&gt; one or two monitor
<br />3. Select the monitor on which you want to see flipped.
<br />4. Click flip horizontally (or vertically) then you have a flipped screen.
<br />
<br />Here is Ultramon's official website:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved. 
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help. Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SPOILER WARNING</span>: ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS</strong></span></p>
<p>Hi,<br />
I think I'm switching it up this year and going Halo instead of CoD.<br />
I've played CoD since MW1. &nbsp;when W@W came out i played it for a couple months, didnt like it, went back to MW1, played it for a while longer then decided to change it up altogether and get a copy of Halo 3. &nbsp;I loved H3 but only played multiplayer (I rarely
 play any stories, including CoD stories). &nbsp;I bought Reach when it came out but was disappointed. &nbsp;Love MW3 but i never like the Treyarch games as much as the MW and Halo 4 looks amazing so i think I'm switching over.</p>
<p>I was just reading all i could about the background behind the halo series and trying to place everything in relation to eachother and have got alot of it figured out. &nbsp;i was just kind of wondering about the prometheans and covenant and forerunners and how
 they all tie together.</p>
<p>From what i understand the Forerunners are the ancient aliens, fired off the halo rings to save the galaxy from the Flood. &nbsp;The Covenant worship the Forerunners. &nbsp;The Prometheans were high ranking "warrior servants" in the Forerunner empire, but didn't want
 to build the Halos to start with so they were kicked out.</p>
<p>My questions are<br />
1. It seems like the Forerunners were somewhat nobel in sacrificing themselves in an attempt to save the galaxy from The Flood, is this correct?</p>
<p>2. The covenant worships the Forerunners, but are the "bad guys" of Halo. &nbsp;This would make sense if the answer to question 1 is that my understanding of the Forerunners is incorrect. &nbsp;If not, why are the covenant bad guys?</p>
<p>3. How do the Prometheans tie into this? From what I've read the Prometheans are bad guys as well. &nbsp;Are they on the same side as the Covenant? &nbsp;Are there other Forerunners left, besides the Prometheans? Up until this part in the story was it assumed that
 all the Forerunners were long gone?</p>
<p>Thanks for the info.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;Noble I guess, but I think the rings were activated and created as a last resort as the Flood were overwhelming the Forerunners. &nbsp;The rings also wipe out all sentient life.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The Covenant think the Forerunners as Gods, but they believe humans are heretics, which is why they declare war with humanity. &nbsp;The Covenant also do not understand the purpose of the Halo rings, they believe that activating the rings will fulfill the
 "prophecy", whereas there real purpose is to kill all sentient life in the galaxy which is why humanity fight them to stop the activation of the rings.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Halo CE, the Covenant accidently release the Flood on Installation 04 (the ring), then the AI constuct 343 Guilty Spark asks Master Chief to help him retrieve the index to activate the ring to stop the Flood from spreading. &nbsp;Cortana stops the activation
 and warns Master Chief that activating Halo will destroy them. &nbsp;The Arbiter discovers the real purpose of the rings in Halo 2, which is why the Elites ally with humans in Halo 3 and Brutes become the top chain of command in Halo 3.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;In Halo 4 we see the return of the Covenant. &nbsp;Are they on the side of Prometheans? &nbsp;I don't think so, from campaaign gameplay I've seen the Covenant have been fighting the Prometheans. &nbsp;But also note that the Elites have become allies with humans in
 Halo 3, so why are they now enemies again? &nbsp;Well Frank O'Connor said at the Eurogamer Expo that this faction of the Covenant in Halo 4 have enthusiastic beliefs about the Forerunners, (possibly different to the Covenant fought in previous Halo games, possibly
 they aren't aware of the allegiance with humans because they have been searching for this Forerunner planet for many many year). &nbsp;Frank O'Connor has said it will be explained in the game though.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there other Forerunners left? &nbsp;I assume so, you may have seen on some trailers where it says "An ancient evil awakens", I believe that is referring to the Didact, a Forerunner Promethean who was commander of the Forerunner military. &nbsp;Yes the Forerunners
 have assumed to be long gone, but now with the discovery of this new Forerunner planet, Requiem, we will learn more about what happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To your answer about who are the Prometheans, they are actually warriors created by the Forerunners to fight their wars, then re-purposed to fight the Flood. They arent creatures and not robots, some cross between them. Now Master Chief and Cortana have
 crashed onto the Forerunner shield world Requiem. Where the remainder of the Prometheans protect it from any invader and protect the Didact. SO basically the Prometheans work for the Forerunners, but dont have a free will or concept of thought, they are designed
 and programmed to do their job. Are all the Forerunner dead? well the Didact survived, but if there are other shield worlds like Requiem, then its possible more Forerunners survived.</p>

<p>dont forget, according to canon, the forerunners did not wipe out all sentient life. if you watch halo legends, some of that life was preserved in specially shielded worlds and then released after the halo rings fired...</p>

<h2>            Win10 isn&#39;t recognising my USB sticks, freezes File Explorer and now entire laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Latitude E7440, only about 2 years old. I upgraded to Windows 10 around 3-4 months ago. In the past 2 months or so, my system has had trouble recognising various USB sticks. Originally, they just wouldn't show up in FIle Explorer. After previous
 efforts, we got through that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've just wasted another afternoon trying to restore functionality, but without any success. A brand new SanDisk can't be read, what's more File Explorer goes into meltdown trying to do so. It shows up as (D:) but the disk name won't come up, never mind
 the contents. Explorer freezes and then my laptop does, so I have to remove the battery to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trawled the forum and tried the 3 steps recommended on other threads, to no avail. That includes uninstalling the controllers in Device Manager. The current Windows updates DO NOT fix this. I have a feeling that last time I clicked on a link and downloaded
 a fix, but that may just be my warped memory, playing tricks after another afternoon of no work (self employed, therefore lost income as well as time).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Use System Restore back to before you installed iTunes when the drive was working.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />

</a><br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Windows 10 does not remember &#34;How do you want to open this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gf1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 does not remember &#34;How do you want to open this file&#34; choices</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have setup IE 11 to be my default browser because I use the LastPass plugin which the Edge browser does not appear to support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When ever I click on a link in an e-mail I get prompted with the "<strong>How do you want to open this file</strong>" dialog box.&nbsp; I have selected IE 11 and checked the "<strong>Always use this App</strong>" checkbox and the bottom of the dialog box.&nbsp; However,
 every time I click on another link in an e-mail the "How do you want to open this file" dialog box appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I always have to keep checking the "<strong>Always use this App</strong>" checkbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same error occurs for other apps that I prefer to use rather that the Windows 10 default apps.&nbsp; It appears that Windows 10 only wants you to use their default apps and will keep displaying the "How do you want to open this file" dialog window when you
 try to use anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is VERY annoying.</p>

<h2>            Touch Keyboard doesn&#39;t work on Windows 10 Tablets</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>My company recently bought some Windows 10 tablets. They are working alright except that
 we are having serious issues with the touch keyboard. We are developing a fullscreen application that will not have access to the taskbar, so pressing the keyboard button on the taskbar is NOT a solution.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>When the keyboard is open the bottom half of the screen is inaccessible. I expect something like Android or
 iOS where the screen is basically split when the keyboard is open, so that the whole screen is accessible.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>When you touch in a password field the keyboard will not open, and if the keyboard was already open it goes
 away.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>The keyboard opens up on almost every touch, even if there is no input box the keyboard will open</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>The tablets are all updated to the latest release. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<h2>            Saints Row IV Re-Elected &#38;amp&#59; Gat Out of Hell - Installation Issues</h2>
                    
<p><span>I just bought the bundle (Re elected and Gat Outta Hell) for Xbox One, and I cannot play the Re Elected portion of the game (GOH works and installs fine). I can install the game completely offline, as soon as I go to play Re-Elected connected to the
 internet, it says a "2.0 kb" download is required. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, after I clicked yes, it goes to the dashboard and begins downloading a 2.6 Gb file. But, then it gets stuck at 99% and keeps flipping between queued and instlalling. I've done this about four times, tried the power off on trick, everything in
 the book. Help, please?</span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message when you shrink the volume? </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note 1:</strong> You cannot format a disk or partition that is currently in use, including the partition that contains Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note 2:</strong> Formatting a volume will destroy any data on the partition. Be sure to back up any data you want to save before you begin.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 app Notifications Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amber486  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 app Notifications Problem</h2>
                    I'm sorry ahead of time because I am not very techy and new to windows 8.<br />
<br />
So here's what happens: I get a notification from one of my apps which randomly does not disappear. It stays as the blue box on the right upper corner of the screen and I can't get rid of it. If I hover over it with my mouse then I get the blue circle which
 twirls (looks like the computer is thinking). I am able to switch through apps but none of them really function except for the desktop.
<br />
<br />
For example, a family member called me on skype and when I went to the skype app, I could not click on anything to answer the phone call. I could type messages, but not able to answer the phone and the blue box would be stuck there.
<br />
This morning, a notification said I had an email, but the message got stuck and I ended up not being able to answer the email (bc the reply button is underneath the blue box) as well as being unable to play any videos on youtube. I tried to play a song and
 it would let me press play but did not actually do anything. <br />
<br />
I have always had to restart my computer to end the glitch and have never received an error message. Any help would be great. I have resorted to turning off all notifications to prevent this from happening, but I would really rather just know how to fix it!
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Uninstalling the latest Windows update resolved this for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with the described issue, Remote Desktop and Skype had also stopped working. I believe the update was "Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3061904)". Unfortunately I did not record the update
 before I uninstalled. When I check for updates this is the update which is available.</p>

<blockquote>Have you tried uninstalling the Windows update "Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3061904)"?

<p>Yes. It seemed to work for one restart, however the issue returned. Auto update is turned off.</p>
<p>I guess it is related, perhaps there is another update that i also need to remove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Update - I have a strong suspicion it was "Windows menu Reviver" causing this. Fortunately I hated the program so removed it. Kinda got used to my Metro screen and now prefer it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was installed, but not in use so i missed it for a while. Even not running I believe it was related to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The KB3061904 issue must be affected by the menu revever. Removing both fixed it.. so far.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to later repair.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<h2>            Teredo Tunneling not working</h2>
                    I am trying to join an xbox live party through the xbox app on windows 10. It said it could not get my teredo address in the xbox app network settings and gave me a link to fix on xbox.com (&nbsp;http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/social/troubleshoot-party-chat
 ) .I followed every step that pertained to me and it will not work. I have uninstalled windows teredo tunneling and reinstalled. I have uninstalled it and restarted my pc and it would not show up under device manager after showing hidden devices in the network
 category so it doesnt seem to automatically re install like stated. I also dont have the pseudo tunneling teredo adapter. This is stupid just give me a fix please.&nbsp;

This isn't an xbox problem. I recently got a new new laptop and I was transferred back and forth between xbox and Microsoft. Finally after yelling at a MICROSOFT person to stop transferring me and fix it he did. He took control of my laptop and did it. Had
 to get a new laptop cuz first had a motherboard issue and went through that for a second time. Total time on the phone with Microsoft/xbox was over 10 hours because of transfers and no one knew what they were doing. Now after this update teredo is broken again.
 I fear another 6 HOUR PHONE CALL IN MY FUTURE unless I can find that website that I had to find so that I could fix it myself the second time around. So Frank, if you do call, make sure you tell them that this isn't a XBOX problem otherwise you will be on
 the phone for a very long time. And if you do the live chat thing, make sure you have them call you when they take over your cpu. I was disconnected about 6 times when they did a reboot an had to explain myself over and over again.
