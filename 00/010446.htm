<h2>            Excel 2003 periodically crashes in Windows 7 and stops functioning</h2>
                    I am running Office Pro&nbsp;2003 on a new Windows 7 Pro computer.&nbsp; When copying data, even from a single cell, it takes a minute or more before it allows me to paste the data.&nbsp; The same thing occurs when I highlight cells and drag the&nbsp;information to other&nbsp;cells
 or sheets.&nbsp; A couple of&nbsp;times, the computer has&nbsp;locked up with a "not responding" message and I have had&nbsp;to end the program with a reboot of the PC.&nbsp;This has happened on multiple computers&nbsp;in our network but only periodically. I've run the Office repair program
 and it is still happening. This is starting to cause concern among our "heavy" Excel users as they have lost data and work time because of it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Actually, I found that the problem was being caused by Widcomm Bluetooth driver suite. There is a dll in the suite that causes periodic crashes in Win 7 when using Office 2003. Don't ask me what the corralation between a communication device and&nbsp;Office&nbsp;is
 as nobody seemed to know exactly what, but removing the driver suite worked. We are now crash free on our Win 7 laptops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>~Chris</p>

    <title>Transfer groove music to andriod over usb - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sweep14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer groove music to andriod over usb</h2>
                    <p>So I recently purchased an android phone and would like to transfer all the music I've added to my groove library using my music pass to the phone over usb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to listen offline so just streaming it isn't an option.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I accomplish this? Can't seem to find a way to transfer everything using a usb cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jake</p>

            So what does that answer mean? You're going to do it for us or is there some other "forum" I should be in? I didn't find this answer helpful at all! How about just putting some instructions with all of these programs and apps instead of us having to spend
 hours searching the web for "helpful hints"! I've always been a&nbsp; Microsoft user and NOW suddenly it is no longer about the customer, user or whatever you choose to call us but ONLY the shareholders! I tried to contact tech service the other day and first off,
 I could barely understand him, and second, he wouldn't connect me to tech support unless I signed a $150 per year contract. While I appreciate the philanthropic nature of Bill and Melinda, how about making things a little more affordable of us shleps that
 are just scraping by. How about a minimal charge each time unless it's something REALLY technical? Fortunately, I figured it out myself and it probably would've taken a techie, 2 seconds. Ridiculous.

            Simply put, you can not move or copy Groove subscribed music that has been downloaded to a computer to another device via usb cable. You need to download the music directly to any device you want to use to listen to the music off line.

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can set the default folder on a hyperlink field so that when you go to edit hyperlink it takes you to this specific folder on the network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried searching for it but cannot see it anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an option called "Hyperlink Target" in the properties of the field but I have tried putting a location in there and it doesn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I rarely use the Hyperlink datatype. Its kinda of flaky. If what you want is to select a file and store the location of that file. then check out the FileDialog Property. You will find sample code that will allow you to open the Windows File Dialog and select
 on or more files in a folder. You can set the default folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be able to open those files, use Application.FollowHyperlink.</p>

            <p>Hi joneskr and mikeslate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting here in Microsoft Community and we apologize for not being able to answer your concern in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@&nbsp;joneskr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try to assist you with your concern. If you are not&nbsp;able to view the&nbsp;Outlook.com interface like the screenshot provided by ZigZag3143, MS-MVP, it is possible that you are currently signed in with an old browser and&nbsp;experiencing the&nbsp;Outlook basic interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps provided by&nbsp;ZigZag3143, MS-MVP, so we could determine if this is a browser related issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@ mikeslate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that you want to switch back to the old Hotmail interface. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<font>If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Please be informed that e<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ventually all Hotmail users will be upgraded to Outlook.com. The launch of Outlook.com preview</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> gave everyone an opportunity to learn

    <title>How to Use Scheduling Assistant with Two Personal Calendars - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Use Scheduling Assistant with Two Personal Calendars</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to have the scheduling assistant reference two personal calendars when other people are looking for an opening in my schedule?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primary calendar has a list of entries when I'm busy.</p>
<p>Shared calendar has a list of events. &nbsp;I usually attend about 90% of those events and consider them part of my busy schedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have the two calendars overlaid so that I can visually see when I'm busy. &nbsp;However, when someone uses the scheduling assistant with me, it only shows the entries in my primary calendar. &nbsp;I know I can copy the entries from the shared calendar
 to my primary calendar and then hide the shared calendar, but that would mean maintaining two calendars. &nbsp;Ideally, I'd like to avoid having to do that.</p>

            Hello Nikhita,<br /><br />I'm Sam. I'll be your Expert help today. Unfortunately Outlook 2016 is no longer available for download via the Microsoft Store, as you can see from the following link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/outlook-2016/cfq7ttc0k5cf?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/outlook-2016/...</a><br /><br />However, you can certainly purchase the new version of Outlook here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/outlook/cfq7ttc0k7c4?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/outlook/cfq7t...</a><br /><br />You might want to consider the cost effective solution of an Office 365 subscription starting at $6.99 a month, or try the 30 day free trial: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/office-365-personal/cfq7ttc0k5bf/007r?icid=PDP-Apps-Outlook-buybox-upsell_O365Personal-en&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferr

                    I, like many people here seem to have 'lost' the calculator function on my 5200. I have searched but I can't seem to find why this happened or what to do about it.<br />

I have also just noticed that the...I can't recall it's name...but it was to do with bluetooth and the icon was of two 'people' standing side by side has also gone.<br />

Does anyone know why these things are randomly vanishing from my phone?<br />

            have you tried going to the settings menu and doing the 'restore factory settings' function? Make sure to copy your contacts if they are on the phone memory as they will be lost.<br />
<br />
Apart from that you may need to go to your nearest nokia repair centre and get them to do a software upgrade.

    <title>Send from alias via outlook android app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annoying carrot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send from alias via outlook android app</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an outlook.com email address which I use as my main address. I also have a personal (friends/family) address and a business address set up as "send only" accounts via the browser (these addresses also forward to my outlook.com address). Note that
 the 2 aliases are NOT outlook.com/hotmail.com/live.com etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log in via webmail and write a new email, it gives me a drop down list letting me select which account I want to send from. When I reply to an email sent to one of my "send only" accounts it automatically selects that alias as the "from address".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use windows live mail, it gives me the same functionality as the webmail. It lets me select an alias via a drop down window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the outlook android app, if I go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; [tap on outlook.com account for more options] &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; it shows me a list containing the 3 email addresses. However when I start writing an email only the outlook.com address
 is available in the drop down list in the "from field". I can make the other addresses show up by adding them as a separate accounts in the app, but that defeats the purpose of using them as aliases in Microsoft's other services where I am trying to have a
 single unified account handling all my email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary: Sending via aliases works in outlook.com webmail, and via windows live mail, but doesn't work via outlook android app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get this functionality working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no way to currently do this, when does Microsoft intend to add this feature? I've checked and my old email provider allows their app to do this (Gmail).</p>

            <p>Windows Live Mail (the mail client in Windows Essentials) will let you select an address from any of the accounts setup in the program.&nbsp; Your aliases are existing email accounts.&nbsp; This is not the same functionality as selecting an address in outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It seems that the Microsoft people promoting the use of aliases do not communicate with the Microsoft people who design the apps.</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. It's been a while since I've used Windows Live Mail so I thought I had it set up using aliases since I never got duplicate mail from the secondary accounts which were forwarding to my main account, but it appears I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my question was actually regarding the <strong>Outlook Android app</strong>, the mention of outlook.com and Windows Live Mail were just examples of functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, OtterNZ</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the version and edition of Office suite you have purchased and trying to install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Office is never designed to run on Android based Phone’s such as Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Even with Windows 7 phones, Office
 for Mobile devices is pre-installed but cannot be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Office suite can be installed on Windows based Operating Systems and on MAC Computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There a few troubleshoots you can try. Firstly using Nokia suite make sure your phone software is up to date. If you need any help on doing this please refer to the following link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/product/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/global/support/product/nokia-suite/</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are certain your device is up to date and still no improvements then try doing a soft reset. This can be done by dialing *#7780# and if prompted the default code is 12345 unless you have changed this then please enter that one. This will reset your
 device but not erase any data. If this does not fix your issue then try a hard reset *#7370# and once again enter the default code. Before you do this reset please make sure you back up your device using Nokia suite and this reset will erase everything on
 your device and reset it to factory default. If after this you still get the same error then I would call your network provider as there maybe a fault on the sim card itself.</p>
<p>If after all this you still have the same error then you will need to visit a Nokia care point. You can find your nearest one on the following link:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mobile Outlook Attachments Slow Download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattr_oak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile Outlook Attachments Slow Download</h2>
                    Why are attachment downloads so slow in Windows 10 Outlook on mobile? I find it dreadfully slow on Windows 10 (950XL) compared to an iPhone and my Windows 8.1 Phone (640XL) using the same Wi-Fi, same carrier and same servers. I have seen this mentioned
 on several websites. Is there a fix?

<p>Abbi99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the best details I can give you. Honestly I am not sure which Windows Central thread it was, that was just one of the places I remember seeing this. We need to direct people here so we work together. Here is what I can tell you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Have not tested Gmail or Ymail. I think others have complained. It affects Linux based IMAP servers. Mine is hosted by keyweb. I am NOT using SSL. I can confirm that&nbsp;HOTMAIL BASED&nbsp;email addresses seem UNAFFECTED by this bug.</p>
<p>2) The source of the e-mail attachment is not relevant to the speed. Images are especially slow but that relates to file size I think.</p>
<p>3) I am not using a microSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting background to note that was not mentioned&nbsp;is that I&nbsp;remember this issue with my 920 when I got on the wp8 bandwagon. It was fixed on my 930 out of the box and never returned. This is now a work phone and I am literally losing business because
 of it. I gave up a perfectly working windows 8.1 phone for what? I am running the latest insider build. (I had to reset my phone from scratch to get it) and have this problem still plus other serious problems. It does not seem to offer me the latest Firmware
 even though I am in the Fast Ring.</p>

<p>Yes, we need more information. I am using several different IMAP servers and none is an issue for me. However, I do not know who made them, right now. If you are interested and you are in control of your server, I’ll double-check for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I gave up a perfectly working windows 8.1 phone for what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel with you, for sure! My (non-XL) Lumia 950 is completely unusable for my day work – and I have no hope that this will ever change. Nevertheless, a software bug is a bug, is a bug. Things can break with every new update. Or get fixed. That happens with
 software, when no test case exists for your particular scenario. Therefore, as many information is needed as possible. Otherwise Microsoft might never ever be aware of this because—obviously—they do not have a test case for this case here, right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not seem to offer me the latest Firmware even though I am in the Fast Ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The firmware update depends on your firmware variant. The firmware variant is identified through the Product Code (059…) which is written underneath the battery cover of your Lumia 950 XL. In that code, region, country, color, and (for some) the operator
 is codified. There are rumors, you do not get the firmware update if your are an Insider. However, you are able to keep your OS and setting if you leave Insider.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an Windows Insider. I am just a guy who leaves his iPhone (I was using different iphones since 2008).
</p>
<p>So, I was so impressed from this new Lumia 950XL and went to it with absolutly no bad thoughts. I am using it now for three days, spend hours and hours with it and with the for me new OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guys, I am totaly angry about the ignoring position of the microsoft guys. Use your browser, go to a search engine, type "attachement slow windows phone" in and press ENTER. There a million of posts. SINCE 2012 !!! (****?)</p>
<p>Do somebody really believe that this attachement issue is a BUG who has only a hand full of users? I totally dont think so.
</p>
<p>This just to let u know, that I have spend so many hours tried to fix this problem for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with my self hostet Zimbra Imap Server (ZCS 8.6 Patch 5 - Centos 6.7) and with the outlook.com account. Finaly with my GMX account also. In every szenario its the same result.
</p>
<p>I am not sure what system is behind the outlook.com imap. I can just hope that it is a MS imap engine. GMX is using linux I think. My server is linux also, centos ... .
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I have a Lumia 950XL:</span></p>
<p>SW build: 10.0.10.586.29</p>
<p>FW 01078.00027.15506.02029</p>
<p>Hardware: 4.0.1.1</p>
<p>Version 1511</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be sure that you understand what the problem ist. :-) </p>
<p>I receive an email with one or more attachements. It does absolutly dont matter what kind of attachement or how big it is. I open the mail, see the attachment and try to open it. The download circle runs. The best try was a 10.5 KB File, It took about 45
 sec. to open. If you open a 5 MB image for example it takes nearby the same time.
</p>
<p>I am using a 50Mbit internet connection. In other words, I can download 5.3 MB/s. And, yes I can reach this speed with my windows lumia 950xl too, but not in the mail app. I have set the option in accounts to receive complete mail and images.
</p>
<p>I think you understand now, that this is absolutly no problem what you can fix with a stupid reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, sure I tried everything :-) </p>
<p>- Factory default and complete new start with the phone, without restore backup or so.
</p>
<p>- reboots? - Oh man, I finished counting near 100 :-) </p>
<p>- waiting - yes I tried this. I waited hours with no touch on the phone. I though, maybe it downloads in background and I have just to wait for the first time the mails will sync. (I set 7 days back sync)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I am so sad, I really want to use this windows phone. I did know that the OS is not finished and all days it will get another update.
</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>- Error unfixed since 2012 in the mailapp</p>
<p>- NO CalDAV with other systems as of this stupid outlook.com account. (welcome in the year 1995)
</p>
<p>- Netflix and some other apps maybe start, but never will work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to go back to my iPhone world. Hard to say, but there is nothing what reach the apple stuff. I am affraid of this.
</p>
<p>Thanks guys, wish you a lot of fun and happiness with your windows playphone. I have to use it for bussiness, so this is not my device.

<p>Thanks for your detailed information. Two notes: (1) Microsoft does neither leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel nor for bug-reporting. Why ever. Therefore here, any further feedback about Windows 10 Mobile drowns within the Internet swarm. However,
 that is definitely not an excuse for the above answer by an ‘Microsoft employee’ – he/she should have asked for more details to start an investigation. (2) That Windows Phone 8 issue was never analyzed into depth. It is the same symptom for sure. However,
 I do not know, if it has the same cause – and/or if the same source code is still used. However, you face a software bug which renders your Lumia 950 useless for your daily work. And that is an issue for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, back to your report: Because I have a GMX account, I was able to double-check this and faced no issues. Attachments downloaded and showed instantly here. Therefore, an additional factor/cause must exist: In which country do you use GMX?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NO CalDAV with other systems […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you setup an ‘iCloud’ account, you do not have to use an Apple iCloud account, because you are able to specify any server address. However, the Internet community saw a lot of negative results with other CardDAV/CalDAV implementations than those from
 Google or Apple. Or stated differently: I am not aware of any open-source implementation which catches all the issues of Microsoft’s CalDAV client.</p>

<p>
</p><p>thx for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was testing it with a german GMX account in Germany. I just tested it one time. I would only be sure that my problem is not a Zimbra or outlook.com problem. Well, maybe that test with GMX was another issue in. However...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a factory reset with my phone and put it back to the box :-) .. but the "icloud" szenario you told sound interesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean with the icloud settings? - Is there a workaround to implement caldav for calender syncs? I dont want to restore my phone just for this test.
</p>
<p>As I understand is it possible to set an other server address as the apple one. So on this way it should be possible to use CalDAV from my server?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx for the point for bugreporting to Microsoft. For sure I did. </p>

<p>I am using the same account type. Mhm. I cannot test Outlook.com because I use my own E-mail address as username. Hopefully, someone else is able to double-check and confirm or deny. Setting-up an own Zimbra just for that, would be too much work for me right
 now. Anyway, this should be the work of Microsoft actually.</p>

            <p>By "charts", I assume that you mean a range of cells and not a chart as that term is actually used in Excel - Insert tab&gt;Charts</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a54e880-43b6-426d-ac01-5b5b474de707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a54e880-43b6-426d-ac01-5b5b474de707" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that assumption is correct, how do the cells appear in Excel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be2b3b0d-0713-4487-9079-ec653db24bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be2b3b0d-0713-4487-9079-ec653db24bad" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>where the cells do not have borders applied to them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0e3f00f-37c7-43ac-bd3b-481c8f7d0f09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0e3f00f-37c7-43ac-bd3b-481c8f7d0f09" /></a></p>
<p>where the cells have borders applied to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the former is copied and pasted into Word, you would see something like the upper part of the following screen shot and when the latter is copied and pasted, the result would be like the lower part:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3f3f6b5-4534-46ef-91ec-2a25fecc0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3f3f6b5-4534-46ef-91ec-2a25fecc0712" /></a></p>

            <p>Doug-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have illustrated is correct. Except, for as long as I can remember, when I have pasted a "range of cells"(that have data in them) into Word it has pasted with black borders-not just blue gridlines. I've never had to actually create any "chart" or
 anything of the sort-the information just pasted with borders(black lines around the data) making it very easy to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago, something similar happened. I backed up all my documents onto a thumb drive. After I put the thumb drive into my desktop, it prompted me saying that "some of the files are corrupt" and asked whether I would like to "repair" them or not.
 I can't remember whether I did or didn't. In any case, ALL the lines in ALL my Word docs were gone-only text appeared. So, I tinkered around until eventually I selected "view gridlines" and everything reappeared-with black lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time however, the blue gridlines appear but no black lines and I can't figure out why and/or how to get that to change back globally(in all my docs) without having to do each one individually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other possibility is that I am imagining things and the data has always pasted with blue lines only. I highly doubt that. What is odd though, is that on the thumb drive there are NO lines whatsover-blue, black or any other color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to seeing of you can help me sort this out or not. Thanks again for your help. Its not an emergency obviously, just really odd.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using 2007. This has nothing to do with printing and I haven't "used" anything. That is, I never "created" anything-I just pasted what existed from one program to another. The lines used to be black and solid. (The same way they would be as if they
 were a table created in Word in the first place) Now, they are simply the standard blue gridlines. The solid black lines that used to appear when I pasted from Excel to Word are now gone. Very simple. I'm not sure how a screen shot helps. Gary already posted
 an example.</p>

            <p>Unless you have added borders to the Excel range before copying it, there is no reason to believe that a pasted range would include borders in Word. Of course, you can apply a table style (in Word) which does include borders.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So what you're basically saying is that I am imagining things? Quite possible at my age. lol But I could swear that the lines were solid black. So, just to be sure...</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of the docs say that they are using "source formatting". This means they are using the format of what was pasted from Excel, I assume. Is it possible that all of my Excel docs had borders as a standard setting and that was retroactively wiped out when
 I inserted the thumb drive? That is, do I have to create borders in Excel (which I have never done) or does it come that way and you have to erase them yourself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose if I am annoyed that there are no borders I can add them after I paste anyway. Its not really a big deal-just annoying that this either happened or I am fantasizing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What I see is what Doug's screen shots illustrate: either Excel gridlines (which do not print in Word but display as Word gridlines) or Excel borders (which do print in Word, converted to "true" Word borders).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel, there is an option to print the gridlines (without adding "true" borders). As far as I can tell, even if you keep that option selected, there is no way to get the gridlines to convert into (printable) borders after pasting the range into Word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure that you haven't had text boundaries displayed in Word before? In the Word Options dialog box, click Advanced; you'll find the option under "Show document content."</p>

    <title>Mail Merge from SharePoint 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drobinsonwlt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge from SharePoint 2013</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
A user is trying to do a mail merge with the data source as an Excel document, hosted on our SharePoint 2013 site. I came across http://support.microsoft.com/kb/826838, which mentions that performing a mail merge from an HTTP:// location is not supported in
 Office 2010 and below.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering whether that is still the case in Office 2013 running SharePoint 2013. This doesn't seem to be a possibility, but I want to check to make sure.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input!<br />
<br />

<h2>            After Update to Build 10061 Screen Doesnt blink out anymore&#58;</h2>
                    <p>After I updated to Build 10061 the screen wont shut off anymore. &nbsp;Even when I convert the power button to Turn screen off (Not to shut Down)..</p>
<p>it goes off then seconds later back on.. so something is keeping the screen from blinking out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant even get the screen savers to work either......... same problem..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a AIO Desktop. I need the screen to go off. There is no button to turn it off from power.........</p>
<p>and my system stays on 24/7..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that I can do that will fix this problem..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying, I did what you asked, Didnt work.. I even tried the Hardware TroubleShooter while I was there.... Still No good................</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing the power trouble shooter did was detect screen saver which I only turned on to protect my screen from burn in images.</p>
<p>and it said my timeout screen is set too high. which my normal is 5 mins when its working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anything else I can try??</p>

 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to open your games and check if the issue still persists.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 won&#39;t recognize my Zune HD device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thirstyglen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 won&#39;t recognize my Zune HD device</h2>
                    <p>This issue appeared when I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. Everything was fine before that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, the Zune software is still working on my PC, but when I plug in my Zune device, the software does not recognize it. I'm able to recharge my Zune but not sync it. Again, the Zune software continues to function properly otherwise. I tried connecting to
 another USB port with same results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another issue that's cropped up that may or may not be related - when I open up the Windows 8.1 Music app, it says "We didn't find any music on this PC." For some reason, it's not able to find my Music library. Again, this issue is new with Windows 8.1.
 When I click "If you're not seeing your music, tap to change where we look.", the Music app crashes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My PC is running Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

            So..
<div>I'm actually an Xbox Ambassador and came across someone who asked me questions on how to fix this, but at the same time they got support from an official Zune Support person so here we go with a quote of their response to them:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Okay, if you right click the Zune HD in the device manager, do you see an option to uninstall the driver? &nbsp;If it's not displayed in that menu, open Properties and go to the Driver tab and it should be there. Okay, let's uninstall it. (Person I was in
 support with had their uninstall reinstall not work). Hit Update Driver. Go with the browse option and we're going to Program Files/Zune/Drivers.&nbsp;Pointing it at the driver folder should be as far as you have to go. &nbsp;You don't need to find the exact driver,
 and then just click ok and it installed it."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And this fixed their issue. This is how they copy and pasted to me, supposedly. It's worth a shot right?</div>

<h2>            Network unlock code does not work... Nokia 206</h2>
                    
<p>I have Nokia 206 purchased from Tesco in may. I asked them to give me network unlock code due to I moved abroad and now live in Lithuania. I got this code month after first e-mail. Now I see that this code do not work. With tesco mobile SIM or with other
 operators SIM I get same message CODE ERROR. As in their e-mail is written that I can ask for help in Nokia care - I am asking You for help. I have only 1 attempt left. I double checked IMEI and provided code. That NUC just do not work... HElp...</p>

<p>I wish you luck with this one although the counters for available <strong>three</strong> attemps at keypad and FBUS entry of NUC can be reset by Nokia Care facility. Unfortunately even with the correct code some Nokia devices require it to be input via software
 and not device keypad and I had to send my last Tesco SIM locked device in for cable unlock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was the code given to you of format&nbsp;<strong>#pw+CODE+1# </strong>as occasionally it requires&nbsp;<strong>#pw+CODE+7#,&nbsp;</strong>although I would
<em><strong>NOT</strong></em> use up your last attempt upon this pretext?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the (UK) there are usually "<em><strong>market traders</strong></em>" dealing in mobile phones whom could probably input the network unlock code without resort to keypad and not use up last attempt, but don't know what applies in your country.</p>

<p>As Tesco is a MVNO = Mobile Virtual Network Operator for O2, I know that I had to use&nbsp;<span>#pw+CODE+7# upon a recent device locked to O2 although was given&nbsp;<span>#pw+CODE+1#. If you find someone to try cable unlock where number of attempts not so relevant
 suggest you also try this one also, but pre-supposes that Tesco have given you correct code against IMEI which is not always the case.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>That said I know some firms won't quote for unlocking Asha 206, so there maybe a problem with this device in this respect.</span></span></p>
