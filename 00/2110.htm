            It's not fake but it may not be the final release version. The screenshot that is doing the rounds is real but that version is still considered a beta and is not available to the public.<br />
<br />
It's new features are unknown, although it's believed to include ASR.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be too long now before v30.x.xxx is available to the public.

            it is not released yet<br />
<br />
if it will become avalible to the public then it will be avalible after further beta testing<br />
<br />
v21 is very very good anyway the only real things they could add are geo tagging for the camera and built in auto rotate<br />
<br />
iam quite happy with v21 so wont be in a hurry to update ill wait for a few reports 1st , if it aint broke dont fix it is what i say ;-)

            Aye bux77. Couldn't agree more. "if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I did precisely that. My N95-1 RW159 was slow and at the behest of Vodafone my network provider, I updated my phone to v21 but it my case, what resulted was that several menu options within
 Gallery &gt; Images &amp; Videos are no longer there.<br />
<br />
I can no longer select Create muvee for example as that and other options are missing. So it seems that many users even with the same handset get different, and mostly negative results from updating. I wish I hadn't.<br />
<br />
Still waiting to see if anyone posts a solution to my issue before I send the phone to Nokia to have the fireware reinstalled since updating it again hasn't solved the problem.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Office diagnostic option</h2>
                    Unlike office 2007 , diagnostic tool/option is not available in office 2010/2013. Microsoft is suggesting to use repair option from program &amp; features&gt;office&gt;change option. But that is not helping in case of mail merge in publisher 2013. So whats the solution
 here?

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workflow Solution</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I am looking for a solution that will help automate my life at work. While I have spent the last few days researching solutions online, I am afraid that I may be wording something incorrectly or the solution may not even exist. What I am looking
 to do is create a check list, to do list, or a task list to organize setting up meetings. As every meeting has different attendees What I need the products to do is be able to send out calendar invites, Have a timer in place to send out subsequent template
 email with next step and requirement emails 3 months out, 2 months out, etc. This would also check the task off the list once completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking at trying to integrate Microsoft Planner with Flow in office 365 but it appears that is is not supported at this time. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if there is more that I need to explain as that is one area
 I am not good at.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            E71&#58; Pressing Voice key to launch Recorder... doesn&#39;t - another bug &#42;sigh&#42;</h2>
                    According to the E71 manual, if you press the Voice key (between the volume buttons on the side) once from the Home screen, it will launch Sound Recorder. This worked once, and never worked again. Even after a hard reset it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            Sound Recorder? I thought that key was for PTT.<br />
<br />
For me, a short press does not do anything and a long press launches the Voice Command, i.e., it says "Speak Now"

            If you read the user guide you will see that a short press should launch Sound Recorder if PPT is disabled. As I said, it has worked before, but not since then.

            I get the same result as vansharma. I tried to find something in the User Guide about it to see if there were any settings to play with but can't find it (I could only find reference to PTT and Voice Commands) - can you give me a pointer? And I'll see
 if I can get it to work.

            Sorry about the delayed reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reference. Interestingly that User Guide is some 50 pages longer than mine. Mine (which appears to have an earlier number) makes no reference to the button activating the recorder. In fact it has hardly anything about the recorder at all.<br />
<br />
Anyway I tried the button and it does not work on mine either. I wonder whether users were finding it getting accidentally activated in pockets, etc and Nokia disabled it?

            Hello,<br />
I find that if I press either the button between the volume controls, or the rhs blue button (for the camera)for about 3 seconds, I get the same, no chance of record though the camera works fine.<br />
<br />
I also find that sometimes after ptt pressed, the phone will hang, then reset after about 10 secs.<br />
<br />
Kind of keen to see the next firmware version as this is a nice phone, best I have found for business but the ptt reset, combined with blue tooth headset connectivity probs make this a pain if not dangerous for use while driving.

You could enter the data in the Listfill range as text. Then, if you need to do math calculations with the selected item it will get coerced into the numeric equivalent.</p>
<p>For example A11 = the TEXT entry 10%.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;combo box displays the text entry 10%.</p>
<p>A1 = the combo box linked cell containing the text entry 10%.</p>
<p>If you need to use that in a math operation, like, find 10% of 100...</p>
<p>=100*A1</p>
<p>The text entry, 10%, gets coerced into the numeric equivalent 0.1. So:</p>
<p>=100*A1 = 10</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>So this is an Active X ComBoBox on a worksheet. In which case if you implemented it correctly then Luke's suggestion should have worked.</p>
<p>To implement Luke's suggestion, put the combobox into design mode and right click it. view code and paste the code in on the right. Don't forget you will need to the bold bit to the name of your combobox.</p>
<p>Private Sub <strong>ComboBox1</strong>_Change()<br />
ComboBox1.Text = Format(ComboBox1.Value, "0 %")<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>If you use a FORMS combobox&nbsp; (from the first set of controls you can pick from), then you won't have this problem.</p>
<p>If you want to stick with the ActiveX combobox, then remove your data, format the cells as text (A11:A20) &nbsp;and reenter&nbsp; the data.</p>
<p>both suggestions worked for me.</p>

            Thanks I will try again.&nbsp; I tried using the FORMS combobox, but i could not change the font size, and it was appearing very small so that is why i changed it to a Active X combobox, thanks to all, i will keep plugging away.&nbsp;&nbsp; TRIED ALL THE SUGGESTIONS,
 recreated the list, put in the code, did a test where my first item changed to text and the second i changed to percentage, typed 0.1, 20%, clicked on the drop down and the 20% appeared like 20% on the drop down, but when i selected it and it put it in the
 cell, it displayed as 0.2.&nbsp; I am going to try to look for a template now that has a combo box with a percentage.&nbsp; Thanks, not sure what i am missing, and this is the first time i have not been able to resolve a problem using this forum, it is excellent.&nbsp; thanks
 again.&nbsp;

            So the rules actually do <em>work</em>. They are just very slow. Sometimes 3 or 4 messages piles up before the custodian gets around to sweeping them up.<br />

<p>How long does it take?&nbsp; I've been doing the same ones over and over for weeks and they keep showing up. I've been blocking, sweeping, made rules, manually entered the domains to block and the same ones keep showing up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, what is the good in this?&nbsp; "If the rules aren't working, generate a report"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get an email with a report with pages of mumbo jumbo.&nbsp; Does this go to anyone working with the email or is it for me to figure out? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I check the sweep it says I have no rules.&nbsp; Why would it say that if I have established rules? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            E7 Memory &#40;not extendable&#41; &#43; RAM</h2>
                    
<p>I am wondering why Nokia did this bad move when then make the E7, I was about to buy it, but now I changed my mind, because they offer it with 16 gb, without a card slot. since you knew that there will not be a card slot in this phone, then why not making
 it 32 gb. amazing mistake ... no comments, such a great phone with a great design with 16 gb ONLY. Shame on you guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish if you can upgreade the internal memory to be 32 gb, thats will be great for the professionals and managers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as well as the RAM I was expecting it to be 512 not 256.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guys think about it, and try to fix it ASAP.</p>
<p>believe me if you do, I gurantee that, this device will be the number 1 device.</p>

            It does have 256 mb of ram like you say, but that has not been an issue for me at all. I think I managed to run at least 15 apps at the same time with no problem. Symbian is quite efficient when it comes to RAM, and as long as you don't have any über-buggy
 3rd party apps, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
For the 16 gb I aknowledge that it can be a bummer for those who plans to have tons ov videos and music, but for me it is not a problem. I never managed to fill half of the 32 gbs on my previous phone, the n97.<br />
<br />
So, as its always seems better to have more, I think 256 gb of ram is not an issue.<br />
<br />
So teh questions should be, can you live with 16 gb of mass memory? It has the OTG feature and comes with a cable. It does also have between 300 and 400 mb free of phone memory for apps and whatever which is really nice.<br />
<br />
I love the E7 and so far it has been an amazing expereience. The screen is by far the best screen I've ever seen on a mobile device as it works so well outdoor too. The keyboard is perfect for writing long emails, typing texts, notes etc.<br />

<p>Fender77, you might be better than me when it comes to RAM in symbian OS. Because my experience is with iPhone3GS, and I wanted to move back to the new communicator but I really shocked when they said it is only 16 gb, you knew better than me that new apps
 and third party software will be there, and day by day these 16 gb will be nothing for such people like me, I am a professional as a manager but still I like to keep some of the family photos and videos. I like to keep in touch with friends in Social life
 networks Facebook and Twitter. and I like to be notified as well when they reply me back. furthermore I like to have more than email account, so you think 16 gb is enough??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still in love with this device, but Nokia has to make optional 16 or 32 gb memory atleast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>otherwise I will think to have somthing else like HTC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>again and again</p>
<p>Thanks for your great reply</p>

<p>It's your call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you want to keep *so* many pictures and videos and stuff that 16Gb is not enough, then I suggest you get another phone, one that is perhaps not oriented to professional managers :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, if you do manage to fill your 16Gb with e-mails then you're doing something wrong.</p>

            I agree with reinob here.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many apps you need, but usually apps are only a few megs. Your phone memory has enough space to handle that and more.<br />
<br />
Don't mix the phone memory and mass storage together! :)<br />
<br />
I have set up my 3 email accounts so they only download the heads on the mail. It gives me the info I need to decide wheter its important or not. If it is, I open it and the mail downloads. But having your accounts set to download the whole mail shouldn't really
 be an issue unless you get 1000 mails a day with heavy content. I keep the important ones and delete spam and unecassaries.<br />
<br />
Vids will take up some space I guess depending on quality and length, but I think you will be able to have a few vids and a ton of pictures without problems, but if you know that 16 gb is too little, you will have to look for another device.<br />
<br />
I don't know if Nokia plans to go for a 16/32gb deal, but it does not looks like it.<br />
<br />
Memory card slot was thrown as it would have made the phone a bit thicker.<br />
<br />
So if you can use your device with need to have stuff and nice to have and not everything else, I think you should be fine.<br />
<br />
RAM isn't a issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nokia will probably (as they have told), release some symbian devices with 1ghz cpu. That would probably be a device with a bit more ram (which isn't an issue) and perhaps the option for a memory card or more onboard space. No date is given though, but if you
 can wait, or have the money to use the E7 meanwhile, that might be an option. However, nothing about space is mentioned yet AFAIK.<br />
<br />
The HTC Desire Z would might be the thing for you. It does not have that expensive feel to it and does not have the same build quality. It does also not have the amoled screen. Keyboard is nice but not as good as the E7, but I guess that is a thing of taste.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you choose anyway!<br />

<p>I can only agree with Fender, the phone, so far, has been superb, it performs quickly and smoothly. I too have the N97 and the memory is almost full !!! BUT I don't really NEED 8 days 15 hrs of music and I usually delete Video once I've watched it (which
 I do most lunch times at work).</p>
<p>I've simply been more selective with the stuff I've put on the phone. I also carry a 16gig memory stick with me all the time so tend to put movies on that and use usb OTG, and it's great not to have to convert many of them as either, it's played everything
 I've thrown at it so far.</p>
<p>I only have one issue with the phone so far, and that's battery life, the phone is really struggling to last through the day, although it has been very heavily used for the last couple of weeks, and I'm sure it will improve once the novelty effect wears
 off , plus it's not an issue to anyone who is office based or has a car charger ?</p>
<p>I really am happy with the E7 and anyone who thinks the specs are not adequate for there requirements has a marketplace full of alternative products, so good luck to them&nbsp;:smileywink:</p>

            Absolutely Carman, the battery has been a bit on the downside, but it has gotten better after a week of use. And like you, I'm using it as much as possible atm.<br />
<br />
I guess the battery life will be better with a fw update or two.<br />
<br />
When programmers builds and edit new softwares/OS whatever, during the first test periods its normal that a phone with a pretty much new software only last an hour or two. Tweaking the OS/firmwares makes it last longer.<br />
<br />
During the editting and adding of e. g. android 2.1 for SE Experia, the first test devices had a battery life of what mentioned above.<br />
<br />
My E7 lasts just about a day, which is no problem as I can charge it. I have a twitter app running, facebook, 3 mail accounts auto updating, wlan on etc.<br />
<br />
I don't think we will see the battery lasting more than two days with a bit of power use even after some updates, but 1,5 perhaps? That should be good enough.<br />
<br />
The standby time on this one is excellent btw.<br />

<p>I think yes it is working with USB and the cable is there, comes with the phone itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I would love staying with Symian and keep update it, rather than go with Android or Microsoft, becuase Nokia should keep their unique OS and work on it to beat the others like IOS and Android as well as Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guys believe me Symbian is the best and we will miss it if they do so (go with microsoft), I disagree with using another OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regarding the E7, after reading your replies, I really like them and agree with most of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might buy one besides the HTC Incrideble&nbsp;S and then I will keep only one :) and sell the other.</p>

<p>Both my wife and I have Windows Mobile phones (Touch Pro and Touch Diamond).&nbsp; After already sync'ing my phone, I set hers up last night (I needed to do a hard reset and didn't want to lose everything).&nbsp; Unfortunately, now all the information is shared on
 both phones (my wife doesn't need my business contacts).&nbsp; If I delete them off her phone, that get's synch'd and they disappear off my phone!&nbsp; Need a way to tie the information to the phone it came from and allow the option to only push information sourced
 from that phone.&nbsp; If you can have multiple phones in the account, why wouldn't you want to keep that information filtered by phone?</p>

            One option would be to setup each phone with different Live accounts. For easier managing that mix-data you could do the following on one of the phones (your wife's for instance):<br />
<br />
1 - go to Menu &gt; Account &gt; Windows Live ID<br />
2 - change the account to a new Live account<br />
3 - follow the wizard to configure the phone and sync the data<br />
4 - Go to the Microsoft My Phone Web Portal and delete the extra/not needed contents (they will go to the trash and you can recover them at any time)<br />
5 - Perform again a sync on the phone<br />
<br />
At this time you should have the data cleaned from the phone, according to what you have done on the Web Portal<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any questions<br />

<h3> bailey_wm_f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Chart Legend Edits Don&#39;t Stick</h2>
                    I am having a problem getting changes to a chart legend to stick. I created a simple stacked bar chart with two data series in Excel 2016 (Version 1708, Build 8431.2079) and moved the chart to a separate chart sheet. I added a legend and edited the series
 names from the default "Series 1" and "Series 2". I saved the file, closed it and reopened it. The edited series names are gone and the chart has reverted back to the series names "Series 1" and "Series 2". I have tried this on several different computers
 running the same version of the Excel and the problem is always repeated. Can someone help me understand why this is happening? Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-booting my PC the problem seems to have gone away. (*holding thumbs*)</p>
<p>
</p><p>SECOND UPDATE Although it appeared the problem had gone away, it&nbsp;has re-appeared, and Word crashes when running Find and Replace while Spell Check is open.</p>

<h2>            Emails disappearing in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi, we have a user that has an Office 365 E3 licence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They access their emails by; Outlook for MAC, Built in mail client on iPhone 6, and the Office 365 portal on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since returning from holiday they have an issue where emails viewed on their iPhone and in the Office 365 portal 'disappear' after being received. It could take anything up to an hour between the email arriving and disappearing. I found the missing emails
 in recover deleted items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails are still there on the MAC. They also mentioned that when they send an email from the MAC it sends but the sent email goes in to their inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the Outlook portal and there are no rules set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it is the MAC that is causing the problem but does anyone have any ideas of how that might be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

</p><p>After a bit of investigation it was the MAC. Every email to the inbox had generated a note in 'sync issues'. Deleted the local email profile on the MAC and recreated it and now seems to be fine.</p>

            Make sure you setup up a serial port in the bluetooth software so that it matches the port that activesync is listening on.

    <title>Gamertag iN8k &#40;Complaint&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag iN8k &#40;Complaint&#41;</h2>
                    <div>So I`ve had troubles with Xbox Customer Support since 2016 when I was still on my Xbox 360, I now own the Xbox One S. Below is a recent major issue that they continue to ignore. Not only do they ignore me but I contact them over the Phone &amp; through chat
 &amp; even at times email &amp; they are unprofessional &amp; rude to me. (Also Xbox Enforcement always monitors my account &amp; suspends me) Okay so they have been a burden to me since early 2016. I came to Xbox Support through chat &amp; phone &amp; asked them to fix my "profile
 visibility" issue, basically the Name, Location, Motto, &amp; Bio weren`t showing publicly... So in response they expected me to eventually make a secondary profile to "check" the profile to see if it was visible from another perspective &amp; they said they couldn`t
 check on their end... &amp; they also expected me to message people on my friends list/recent players list to get them to check for me.. So those were my only 2 options, eventually I said I don`t want to make a secondary profile &amp; I shouldn`t have to... &amp; that
 was my argument... &amp; so I gave up on the issue &amp; moved forward. Around this same time I was PERMANENTLY banned from the "Ambassador program" for simply not understanding the Ambassador`s chatroom rules, I was simply self promoting &amp; promoting an artist I like,
 but I wasn`t spamming &amp; I wasn`t being rude, the other Ambassadors in the chatroom were being very unwelcoming &amp; rude &amp; CONTROLLING. I enjoyed the Ambassador program because it is community service in the form of helping customers (for Xbox/Microsoft). But
 sadly I was permanently banned. (For no reason in my opinion.) But on top of that they never sent me an email notifying me WHY I was banned &amp; how I can appeal it. (I attached a screenshot of what I see when I try to go to the Ambassador program page.) I`m
 also blocked from being able to talk to the Ambassadors for help.</div>
<div>Now since then, I`ve recently been banned from the Xbox forums, the Microsoft forums, &amp; I`ve had to contact Xbox for quite a few things being forced to talk to multiple employees over the phone &amp; through chat without success.</div>
<div>The Xbox Enforcement team has been constantly banning me since 2016 too &amp; I feel like that is because I`m standing up for myself. Some of the enforcement action on me is necessary while most of it is excessive &amp; abusive on their end towards me.</div>
<div>On February 23 2017 I purchased my Xbox One S Halo Wars 2 edition. With the Xbox One you`re allowed to record gameplay &amp; upload it to OneDrive or Xbox Live or Twitter &amp; you can publish it to other websites or store it.</div>
<div>My game clips &amp; my recording has always worked properly... Until January 2018...</div>
<div>In January 2018 I contacted Xbox, after already addressing this same issue in the past but it never got resolved: Basically every time I delete my profile from my Xbox &amp; redownload the profile my inbox gets filled with all of the old messages going all
 the way back to 2016 when I had my Xbox360 active. So it`s a hassle considering you can only delete the messages one by one... So in January I contacted them &amp; a chat representative told me to do a "Restore To Factory Default" to fix the messages reappearing
 issue... When I did this I lost all of my gameclips that I had internally stored. (He didn`t inform me that this would happen) Luckily I only had about 1-2 weeks worth of footage that I recorded (in January). After this I got pissed at them.</div>
<div>Moving forward I began making more footage from about Mid-January &amp; so on... Now below you will see a HUGE issue that I discovered on 4/5/2018. Bear with me, it`s all capital letters:</div>
<div>ON 4/5/2018 I DISCOVERED THAT MY GAME CLIPS INTERNALLY STORED TO MY 1TB HARD DRIVE ONLY WENT BACK 19 DAYS... WHICH LANDED ON 3/17/2018. I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT I SHOULD HAVE CLIPS GOING BACK TO MID-JANUARY OR EARLY FEBRUARY. I KNOW I HAD AT LEAST 200 -
 400 GAME CLIPS. THE "RESTORE TO FACTORY DEFAULT" ON MY XBOX WHICH I DID IN JANUARY SOMETIME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE CLIPS THAT WERE STORED AFTER THE "RESTORE".</div>
<div>AN AGENT CLAIMED THAT THERE IS A NEW "EXPIRATION" RULE ON GAMECLIPS SINCE THE NEWEST XBOX UPD8. IF THAT`S THE CASE: NOBODY WAS INFORMED, &amp; THERE WERE NO "LABELED" DAYS OF "WHEN" THE CLIPS WERE TO "EXPIRE" &amp; "AUTO DELETE" SO THAT IS UNTRUE. ALSO: I DIDN`T
 MAKE ALL OF THOSE CLIPS FROM MID JANUARY TO MARCH 17TH IN ONE DAY.. OBVIOUSLY.. SO THERE IS NO WAY "ALL" 2 MONTHS OF MY CLIPS "EXPIRED" ON THE SAME DAY.</div>
<div>ANOTHER AGENT CLAIMED THAT IT MIGHT`VE BEEN TO DO WITH MY RESTORE TO FACTORY DEFAULT. THAT IS ALSO UNTRUE, THE RESTORE HAPPENED EARLY/MID JANUARY &amp; I BEGAN TO RECORD NEW CLIPS BECAUSE THE CLIPS THAT I DID HAVE WERE REMOVED DUE TO THE RESTORE; THANKFULLY
 I ONLY HAD A WEEK OR 2 WORTH OF CLIPS... BUT I WAS STILL ADVISED TO DO A RESTORE WHICH DIDN`T RESOLVE THE ISSUE I WAS HAVING TO BEGIN WITH. (MESSAGES KEPT REAPPEARING EVERY TIME I DELETED MY PROFILE &amp; REDOWNLOADED IT; SO YOU GUYS ASKED ME TO DO A RESTORE TO
 FACTORY DEFAULT BUT I DIDN`T KNOW IT WOULD REMOVE ALL INTERNALLY STORED GAME CLIPS.)</div>
<div>TO CONCLUDE MY ISSUE: I TALKED TO 10+ EMPLOYEES, CHAT SUPPORT AGENTS &amp; PHONE SUPPORT AGENTS. &amp; REPORTED EVERY LITTLE PART OF THIS... FROM THE DAY I DISCOVERED ALL OF THE CLIPS DISAPPEARING AT ONCE TO SEEING THAT DAYS LATER MORE "OLD" CLIPS KEPT DELETING
 AT 2 OR 3 DAY INTERVALS. I WENT OUT OF MY WAY &amp; BOUGHT AN XBOX ONE GAME DRIVE (4TB) SO I COULD TRANSFER THE CLIPS MYSELF &amp; SECURE THEM SINCE FOR SOME ODD REASON MY GAME CLIPS THAT I OWN AREN`T SAFE ON MY 1TB INTERNAL STORAGE. WHILE I WAS DOING THIS I HAD TO
 UPLOAD EACH CLIP ONE BY ONE BECAUSE&nbsp;</div>
<div>FOR SOME ODD REASON ONEDRIVE+XBOX GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO UPLOAD MULTIPLE FILES AT ONCE TO THE ONEDRIVE BUT WHEN I WAS ATTEMPTING TO TRANSFER SEVERAL FILES AT ONCE THEY WOULD ONLY PARTIALLY TRANSFER SUCCESSFULLY, BUT THERE WAS NO ERROR MESSAGE SO IT WAS
 A GLITCH IN YOUR SYSTEM: SO I WAS BOUNCED BETWEEN ONEDRIVE SUPPORT &amp; XBOX SUPPORT BOTH POINTING THE FINGER AT EACH OTHER CLAIMING IT WAS XBOX/ONEDRIVE`S FAULT. SO IT REMAINS UNRESOLVED BUT I SECURED ALL OF THE CLIPS THAT I HAD ACCESS TO. I`VE BEEN COOPERATIVE,
 ACCUR8 &amp; VERY ACTIVE ON TRYING TO COMMUNIC8 WITH YOU GUYS &amp; COME TO A RESOLUTION WITH YOU, BUT I FEEL LIKE I`M BEING MISTREATED &amp; IGNORED &amp; BULLIED BY XBOX/MICROSOFT/XBOX ENFORCEMENT.</div>
<div>That is what I have been sending to them &amp; I even vocally explained &amp; reexplained myself multiple times to many employees over the phone. As you can see in the paragraphs above I also had a OneDrive issue... That nobody wanted to take responsibility for.</div>
<div>That is basically everything that I`ve had issues with &amp; the customer service agents always "defend" &amp; argue that their company has done nothing wrong, but realistically Xbox/Microsoft + Rockstar Games allowed a lot of cheaters to help others "mod" their
 accounts &amp; give out free modded money (cash bag drops). People also got modded statistics on their account &amp; modded ranks... GTA V has 8,000 ranks so it's not good to see a bunch of characters with fake K/D ratios &amp; fake ranks, because I earned my rank...
 &amp; people think that I`m a cheater because I`m such a high level. (I just recently got to level 1,000 with 201 days of gameplay time.) I`m sure they most certainly could`ve blocked the cheaters, the worst part is, is that the cheaters were SELLING their services
 or trading their services for Paypal exchange or gift card exchange. (Stealing from the Xbox community) &amp; for some reason Xbox/Rockstar allowed that to happen from like 2014 all the way to now.. People still have "modded" accounts with fake ranks &amp; fake K/D
 ratios. (K/D = Kill / Death)</div>
<div>Anyways that covers it all, they just have horrible customer service &amp; they mistreat me all of the time.</div>

<h2>            Cortana Stopped Working on Built 10240 of Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I tried to use Cortana in Built 10240 of win 10, everything went fine (response to "hey cortana" and etc)</p>
<p>but after a few minutes&nbsp;she stops responding! I checked my internet connection, no problem there</p>
<p>when restarted pc,&nbsp;she worked again, but after a few minutes, she&nbsp;hangs or stops (no response for my voice)</p>
<p>is this because of windows RTM ?&nbsp; is it gonna be OK in official release?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

I've tried this solution and it didn't work.&nbsp; the one thing I should mention is I have two profiles one mine Cortana works fine, when my spouse clicks over to his profile the search box is greyed out and the is no search option.&nbsp; I've also verified all language,
 time and home settings, rebooted and what not.&nbsp; note is profile is also an admin.&nbsp; this is very frustrating to say the least.

<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the problem further I deleted the second user profile that was having a problem (after I deleted the third re-created the account) reattached it to my PC and still have the same problem on the second profile and the problem from the first
 reported problem.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting, I thought it was just me. &nbsp;I reported it via the insider app so I'm sure somebody will eventually look at it. &nbsp; But that really needs to be fixed with an update.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel Home vs Business version capabilities - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigfloss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Home vs Business version capabilities</h2>
                    <p>I am considering a subscription for Office 365 Home for family with 4 users. &nbsp;In this group I am the most advanced Excel user and time to time work with VBA macros and Business Modeling Templates. &nbsp;I have heard from some colleagues that certain business
 analytic tools and/or development tools are not present in Home version, which I just take for granted in my Excel version at work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before making a subscription I would really like to know if the Excel capability in Home package is scaled down from Business. If there are differences is there a web link that explains the differences?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Skim 956,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood correctly&nbsp;you lost your emails and you're unable to access your account after renaming your primary alias. Let me help you with that.
<font>There could be many reasons why emails/folders could be lost/</font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">missing in your account:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. <strong><span>Due to inactivity in account:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in your account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before renamed, you can try to recover some of the deleted
 messages yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder). You can refer to this article for more information:
<font color="#000000"><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com</a></strong>
</font></span></li><li><span>If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. <strong><span>You got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account:</span></strong> If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked
 you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name
 of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. <strong><span>Your account was hacked even before you renamed your account:</span></strong> A hacker had already deleted emails in their account before you renamed the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, I've created a private message area where you can provide some information that&nbsp;we can&nbsp;use determine the cause of this issue. Just click on the "You have a private reply to this message" link above your post to view the message.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My account was active every day and I was also assured that no data or emails would be lost when renaming to @outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I renamed ALL of my previous email data is gone. </p>

            <p>ok, this is what I did to get my old email address back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This WILL NOT recover any lost emails but WILL get back your existing email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: after renaming my primary address, I was not asked where to place existing&nbsp;emails from @live.com.au/@hotmail.com etc. Instead my @live.com.au address ended up becoming an ALIAS BUT any mail directed to it would not be delivered. The email address
 was effectively GONE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what you have to do is go into settings and find your ALIAS'</p>
<p>DELETE the alias (which is your existing @live.com/@hotmail.com etc.) from your ALIAS list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;go and rename your PRIMARY ALIAS and name it back to what your existing @live.com/@hotmail.com etc. address was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, this WILL NOT recover any old/lost emails but instead get back your old email address that all of your contacts have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Also, I would not recommend following up on moderators private messages as they have no idea on how to recover lost emils.</p>
<p>They basically make you jump through hoops and respond with yet another question requesting more information or give an answer that "maybe you haven't signed in to your account for over 365 days" or "maybe a hacker hacked your account before you changed
 the primary alias"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just not good enough, but that's what you get from a free email client I guess.</p>

            This also happened to me. &nbsp;My son was using my account on his xbox and as he his older we decided to change his information to his. &nbsp;I even called xbox for their advice as my son wasn't sure if he would loose his gaming alias! Irony....I loose my emails
 instead. Very annoyed especially as this is my main email and I have had it for years. &nbsp;I hope someone has the answer to recovering my email, very soon!
<div>Once we replaced my primary email with my sons I left my email in there as I thought it wouldn't hurt! Well I go to my Iphone 30mins later to check my email and it tells me I have wrong the pass. &nbsp;I figure out that I have changed the information on the
 Microsoft account to my sons, including the password, therefore the wires have been crossed so I use my sons password to access my hotmail and it tells me do I want to store it in a folder?? So I say yes, as I don't want to loose it! &nbsp;Then I start getting
 my sons email. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I call Microsoft back, the representative has never heard of this problem and is being advised by someone over her shoulder and tells me that I should remove my email from my sons account and give it 24hours for the servers to align. &nbsp;If this doesn't work,
 for me to call back and they can do an account recovery, which they do all the time. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I removed my email from his account, my folder that had appeared on my IPhone has now disappeared!!!!<br />
&nbsp;
<div>DOESN'T WORK! &nbsp;Have called back and will have to wait and see :((((((</div>
