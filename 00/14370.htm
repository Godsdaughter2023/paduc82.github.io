<h2>            Can&#39;t Skype between Skype for Windows user and Skype for Business user</h2>
                    <p>A long time Skype user, I relied on it for years for chat with my developers and clients. Lately, I mostly hate Skype. I don't reliably get notifications when I have a new message, my online status is unreliable, and the worst of all -- I can't chat or call
 with my clients that are on Skype for Business. Is there any way to make this work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish Microsoft would remove all of the features that are killing Skype and put it back the way it was. Why do we even need a Skype and a Skype for Business client in the first place. Skype was amazing when it was simple and ubiquitous. Now, it pretty much
 sucks.</p>

    <title>Merged label spacing is improper for some labels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> honest abe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merged label spacing is improper for some labels</h2>
                    <p>We are performing a merge to create folder labels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each label has four lines and&nbsp;some intermediary&nbsp;lines can be blank on some labels, but not others.&nbsp; Where there are blanks, we want to preserve the blank lines so that the same information always falls
 on the same line of the label.&nbsp; The last line, however, is never blank and should always appear in the same place on the label (must match a score line).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>:&nbsp; We have noticed that the last line of the label varies its position depending on if some of the above lines are blank or not.&nbsp; When none of the label lines are blank, the last line is raised up higher than on other labels with
 blank lines.&nbsp; Each line is in a specific font.&nbsp; As we cursor through both resulting&nbsp;labels (with or without blank lines), the fonts and&nbsp;line breaks for&nbsp;each line appear to be fine.&nbsp; We have even programmed the merge to insert a space on a blank line, in the
 event the lack of a character is triggering the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SECONDARY QUESTION</strong>:&nbsp; We would also like to know how&nbsp;to determine the exact&nbsp;baseline (or even line)&nbsp;position of&nbsp;each line of text on the label.&nbsp; This would help us verify that the information is exactly where it needs to be and would help
 troubleshoot spacing problems. Other programs list the line position in the status bar as you move line to line, but we don't see where to find this information in Word 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our labels require very specific line spacing in order to fit properly on both the interior folder and in the clear window of the companion hanging file folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have considered using an 'Advance' code, but are really curious to find out why the line
 spacing is improper on some labels, when all the formatting appears to be okay on all the resulting labels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any assistance.</p>

            If the field is empty then merge a space e.g.<br />
<br />
{ IF{ MERGEFIELD Line1 } &lt;&gt; "" "{ MERGEFIELD Line1 }" " "}<br />
{ IF{ MERGEFIELD Line2 } &lt;&gt; "" "{ MERGEFIELD Line2 }" " "}<br />

{ IF{ MERGEFIELD Line4 } &lt;&gt; "" "{ MERGEFIELD Line4 }" " "}<br />
<br />
The lines will then always match.<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply, Graham.&nbsp; As indicated in the original post, we have tried this technique, but still have the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, it appears to us that the problem&nbsp;actually occurs anytime we have a blank line (actually a space) on line 3.&nbsp; In the merge document, part of line 1, line 2 and line 3 are all in 8 point text.&nbsp; Yet it is only when line 3 is blank
 (space) that we have the problem.&nbsp; We have checked both the merge document and the data for unexpected font codes, but can't seem to see anything.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it is hard to verify this since we can't see the font codes (no reveal codes option).</p>

'Part of the line'? Can you clarify EXACTLY what you are doing here.<br />
<br />
Have you tried creating a suitable style and applying it to all the table content?<br />
<br />
If Space is the problem, and I have been unable to recreate the particular issue, then use something other than a space e.g. the word 'Blank' and format it as white colour. White coloured text will adopt the same space as black coloured text but will be invisible.<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply, Suzanne.&nbsp; We have used the feature you suggest, but unlike a reveal code feature, it does not show all codes in the document.&nbsp; We cannot see where a font begins, where it ends, where it changes for subsets of text in a range,&nbsp; or
 whether a stray pair of font codes&nbsp;encloses a non-displaying code (e.g.&nbsp;a line break).&nbsp; It would be so much easier to troubleshoot, and even learn about the application,&nbsp;if we could view all codes in the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, we did find the problem, a peculiar one, which we have posted to Graham Mayor in this same thread.&nbsp; Thank you again for your helpful suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hello Graham,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for some more good suggestions.&nbsp; We have used white text before, but hadn't thought of using that trick here - though we suspicion it would have corrected this problem.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we did eventually isolate the problem, but it was a curious
 one as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIRST</strong>, After the merge, if we typed anything on blank line three (the problem line), it would resize and redisplay each line in the proper position.&nbsp; Therefore, it appears that the space was not triggering the proper&nbsp;font for the line.&nbsp;
 Moreover, using some white text, as you suggested,&nbsp;may have triggered the proper font.</li><li><strong>SECOND</strong>, when we turned on the option to SHOW paragraph markings, we happened to note that the line break symbol, for line three (the problem line), was displayed in a larger font size than the other line breaks above.</li><li><strong>THIRD</strong>, moving through the label text, one character and line&nbsp;at a time, even with the paragraph symbols displayed, never varied the font size shown in the ribbon.&nbsp; Furthermore, selecting several lines on the label, including the problem
 line in the middle, displayed the range as if it was all&nbsp;in&nbsp;a common&nbsp;size (versus a blank text size&nbsp;box, in the ribbon,&nbsp;indicating a variety of sizes).</li><li><strong>FOURTH</strong>, selecting all the text (including line breaks), when the paragraph symbols were hidden, and setting the font size for all the lines still did not correct the problem.</li><li><strong>FIFTH</strong>, the solution to the problem was&nbsp;found when we selected&nbsp;the&nbsp;errant line break symbol (when&nbsp;paragraph marks were displayed) and changed the font size of the line break symbol to match the other line breaks.</li></ul>
<p>The inference here seems to indicate that the non-displaying line break was set at a larger size at some point in time and that it&nbsp;retained that attribute despite any attempts to assign a new font size to the entire block of lines on the label, except when
 the paragraph markers were displayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the ribbon never gave any indication that the line break was in a larger font size when moving the cursor through the text and paragraph markers.&nbsp; Interestingly, a reveal code feature would have probably
 shown the non-displaying line break code enclosed by a pair of font codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help troubleshooting this problem.&nbsp; Perhaps, this anomaly will account for other user concerns of a similar nature.</p>

<h2>            2 issues&#58; Page &#35; resets to 1 and styles keep changing themselves</h2>
                    <p>I have a large document (a family cookbook) with a Table of Contents. It's been a work in progress for a couple of years now. I spent all day yesterday working on it trying to finally finish it up so I can give a copy to my daughter. When I was done for
 the day, I saved my document twice, one as a working copy and one as a "safe" copy that I could return to if I messed anything up when I continued working on it today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I opened the working copy and most of the styles in my Table of Contents had changed, ie. TOC 2, TOC 3, TOC 4, Heading 2, Heading 3, and Heading 4 all changed themselves back to before I started working yesterday morning. TOC 1 &amp; Heading 1
 and the rest of my styles stayed the same. Changes included the font, the font size, the alignment, the indentations, the tab stops, the spacing before &amp; after paragraphs, etc. I also opened my "safe" version and that had also reverted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a large part of my morning trying to remember how I had the styles formatted and reformatting it all. I had it looking just as I wanted it again. Then I noticed that the page numbers in my footer were messed up. The Table of Contents showed as pages
 1 &amp; 2 which is fine, but then page 3 showed as another page 1.&nbsp; The document is currently numbered as: 1, 2, 1-3, 1-40 instead of 1-46.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked online for some answers and some of the suggestions to said to save, close &amp; re-open the document and it would renumber itself. So, I saved my document twice again, one to work with and a "safe" copy (I used new file names so I still had the copies
 I saved yesterday.) Not only were the page numbers still messed up, but my Table of Contents styles had reverted again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have basically wasted my entire morning since I will have to start all over again. Before I do that, can anyone give me an idea of where I am going wrong? Thanks so much!</p>

            Saving 2 copies at the end of the day is a very good technique.  Keep doing it, don't be discouraged by this problem. 
<br />
<br />How did you change the TOC styles?  Did you make the changes directly in the TOC, or in the underlying style?
<br />
<br />Check the styles that changed to see if you have this flag turned on :

<br />If you are a user of Word 2002 or above, you may have had this experience: you click in a single paragraph or select several paragraphs and apply italics, bullets, numbering, or some other type of direct formatting and the entire document (or at least more paragraphs than you had selected) becomes italic, bulleted, numbered, etc. If you press Ctrl+Z or click on the Undo button, the change is reversed for all but the originally selected text.

<p>Hi, the page numbers are now working properly. I had a feeling it might have to do with sections, but for some reason, I could not delete the section breaks. Then I couldn't figure out how to make the page number continue from the last section until you
 pointed it out. So thanks for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot get my styles to stay the way I want them though. To change the styles I have the style pane open, click on the the down arrow next to the style name and select modify. I make my changes in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the referenced article about the Normal style having not having the Automatically Update checkbox. I did as the article said for Word 2007 and Above:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Press&nbsp;<strong>Alt+F11</strong>&nbsp;to display the Visual Basic Editor. Press&nbsp;<strong>Ctrl+G</strong>&nbsp;to show the Immediate Window.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Type (or paste):<br />
ActiveDocument.Styles(wdStyleNormal).AutomaticallyUpdate = False</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>, and save the document.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>But that doesn't seem to help. A while back, I had changed the font &amp; size in Normal.docm, so now when I start a new document the default Normal Style is Arial 12 pt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Normal style in my cookbook is Calibri 11. I have changed it to Arial 12 many times, but it changes back to Calibri every time I save, close &amp; reopen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Yesterday afternoon I tried a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I went into each style used in my document and cleared the check in the Automatically Update. When I was done, I checked the down arrow stats of each style, none said automatically update.<br />
I also verified that "Add the the styles gallery" was not checked.&nbsp;</li><li>I created a new style called *Cookbook Normal based on Normal and changed all the styles to be based on that.</li><li>I verified that "<span>ActiveDocument.Styles(wdStyleNormal).AutomaticallyUpdate = False"
</span>from above is still in the document.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>After I had the formatting all set again, I saved &amp; reopened. Since there isn't really any consistency with the changes, I figured the easiest way to show you what is happening to the styles is to create a spreadsheet chart. The shaded areas are the things
 that changed in each style. The approx. 20 other styles did not change. The shaded areas are the changes. "Should Be" means the way I left the style before saving &amp;, closing the document. Reverted to" is the way the style was formatted when I reopened it.
 The 2 charts mentioned at the bottom are tables, if that makes any difference.</p>

            The chart is interesting, I don't understand why the styles would magically change the way you describe.
<br />
<br />In the chart, the first problem I'd be concerned about is the "missing" "cookbook Style".  It is almost like you didn't save the document after making the style changes.  That is one possibility. Another is you have "document corruption" that is messing with your styles. Granted, that is much less likely in the DOCX format than it was in the older DOC format, but it is still slightly possible.
<br />
<br />
<br />You already have one good habit, saving backup copies with alternate file  names, keep that up.  Another is get used to using the &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;S&gt; , save shortcut, frequently, even during your normal work process. 
<br />
<br />I'm going to suggest a trouble shooting process you can try. It is time consuming, but helps pin down problem.  It is when you have a problem, take smaller steps. Save between steps. Even close and open the document to confirm changes have saved.  
<br />
<br />So first, use the style organizer to import the style changes you want. Save, close file.
<br />Open, confirm the changes are there
<br />Create the Cookbook normal style, apply it in at least one place, save, close file. 
<br />If the initial saves work, extend interval between saves. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have "correct" styles defined in the normal.dotm you can import / copy them into the existing document using the "Organizer" dialog. 
<br />
<br />To get to the Style organizer by opening the Style pane &gt; Manage style button (at bottom of Style pane) &gt; in Manage Style dialog click on 'Import / Export' button at bottom of dialog &gt; Organizer dialog displayed.
<br />
<br />

<br />Word provides the ability to work with templates. Part of what templates allow you to do is to associate styles and macros with a particular document or a range of documents. Templates are very powerful and they provide a great deal of flexibility to Word. Sometimes, however, it can be a real pain to get a good "overall" view of what you have available in a particular template or even in a document.
<br />
<br />Using the Organizer to Manage Styles <a href="http://word.tips.net/T001351_Using_the_Organizer_to_Manage_Styles.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.tips.net/T001351_Using_the_Organize...</a> 
<br />As you work with a document or a template, the number of styles you use can grow rapidly. At some time you may want to delete styles, rename them, or copy them from a one template or document to another. The easiest way to perform these tasks is by using the Organizer.

<p>Thank you for all your help. You mentioned that maybe I had not saved my document, but I had saved it twice, just like I had been doing right along.&nbsp; Both copies were missing my Cookbook Normal style and the rest of my styles were messed up as I showed in
 the chart. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the weekend I got to thinking about your mention that there could be "document corruption." I have actually been working on this cookbook on &amp; off for over 3 years (I actually still have my 4-15-15 copy!) I figured with that much time gone past &amp; the
 number of Word versions there have been since, there was a very good possibility that there was some unseen corruption in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think I finally have it working correctly now. I stripped out all of the formatting with the Format Eraser and deleted all of my existing cookbook styles using the Style Manager. Then I copied &amp; pasted the contents of the cookbook into a new document.
 I was then able to recreate my styles one at a time. To be safe, I saved 2 copies after I defined each style, one as the working file and another as a Safe File. I saved the Safe file with a different name after I defined each style so I would be able to go
 all the way back if necessary. I then closed and re-opened the working file and hallelujah, my format remained as I defined it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, it looks exactly as I wanted it to. I'll be saving several copies of it now, lol!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, once again I thank you for your help. I sure am glad I am not losing my mind!</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you also experience this issue using other computer? <strong>- yes</strong></li><li>Does this issue also happen when resetting password of other user accounts under your custom domain?
<strong>- yes, all user accounts in our domain</strong></li><li>Suggestion to use private browsing in Chrome and Explorer <strong>- tried multiple times in both browsers with no success.&nbsp; tried again today per your prompt with no success.</strong></li></ul>
<p>No worries on&nbsp;troubleshooting further with me&nbsp;to help resolve this issue, but it would be advisable MS continues to look into the problem for others.&nbsp; Our company is making the switch from Outlook.com custom domains to Google Apps later today and we can
 resolve this problem on our end during initial setup.</p>

                    How do you see if a text message has been read or seen? I know on iPhones it has it written on the thread "seen" or "read" once the&nbsp;recipient&nbsp;has viewed the text. Does Windows phone have this capability?&nbsp;

<p>Hi AMH_790,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. The problem seems related to the server side, I would suggest you try using another browser to see if the problem still happens. And you may wait for one day to check if the
 issue is restored from the server side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As update to 7.8 has been released it is not coming to all the regions in the same time. Depending on the region and your mobile operator you will get a notification to&nbsp;your phone when the update will be avalable.</p>

<h2>            One page in document has a header that is too large</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I am nearing completion of a 200+ page document in word 2010.&nbsp; For some reason two or three non-consecutive&nbsp; pages mid-document have decided to have a header that is a much larger space than the rest of the document, despite the fact that the wording of the
 header has not been changed.&nbsp; This causes the first paragraph on the page to start much lower down than is necessary.&nbsp; I have done everything I've been advised to do and tried all the solutions I could think of, but to no avail.&nbsp; Can anyone help me with this?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Thank you!<br />

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I add to-dos to a WP8 Room calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I've been playing with the new Rooms feature on my Windows Phone 8 device. I created the perfunctory Family Room and invited my wife to it. You get group chat, a SkyDrive folder that's shared with group members, as well as a shared notebook and calendar.
 Now that I'm trying to use the calendar, I'm finding I can add regular events, but it's quite impossible to add to-dos. I also tried to log into the Family Room calendar via the web UI, and it doesn't seem to support to-do's at all. Can this be right? A shared
 calendar that doesn't support to-dos? (And please don't say that events are the same as to-dos, because they're used for quite different purposes.)</p>

            Reply from support is that this is intended behavior for Room calendars. Because they were specifically targeting Windows Phone scenarios with Rooms, the expectation is for users to rely on the Room's shared OneNote notebook for to-dos. I think that strategy
 is a more than a little shortsighted, because a simple note with a checkbox next to it can't surface any kind of reminders on its own. If you want real to-dos, stick with a traditional SkyDrive group calendar. Disappointing.

<h3> philsch  say:</h3>
<h2>            word excel powerpoint 2010 crash</h2>
                    <div>Word, Excel and PowerPoint open and I can access files but crash when I reduce and move the windows and sometimes when I open multiple windows. The error message is "MS Word has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows
 will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Word, Excel and PowerPoint all seem to function properly (no crashes) in the Admin User session.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some of the files on my pc have been edited and copied from a Mac with Office for Mac 2008. I had been able to copy files between the Mac and pc for several months until this week.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Operating system is Vista Home Premium. Application is Office Professional Plus 2010, 32 bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what I've tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Repaired Office 2010</div>
<div>- Uninstalled and&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;the software</div>
<div>- Run the Microsoft Fix It program "Troubleshoot problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007 or 2003"</div>
<div>- Deleted the Word Data registry subkey&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Deleted the Word Options registry key&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Renamed the Normal.dot or Normal.dotm global template file</div>
<div>- Disabled the Startup folder add-ins</div>
<div>- Deleted the COM add-ins registry keys.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Perhaps unrelated to this, I get a "Search failed to initialize" error when I try to use the search function in the Start Menu of my Admin User.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would you please provide your suggestions on how to fix this? Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.&nbsp;</div>

            <div>Hi Anula-</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you very much for looking into this and for your suggestions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried all three methods and Word, Excel and PowerPoint continue to crash <b>
but only in my "personal" user session and not in the Admin user session.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>For Method 3 I booted the system in clean boot mode and disabled all non-Microsoft services and startup items and still got the crashes. So, I assume none of them are causing the crashes. I did not disable the Microsoft services or startup items. It would
 be very time consuming for me to troubleshoot in this manner because I disable/enable the services and startup items in the Admin user session and test Word, etc. in my personal user session. Rebooting the pc and opening/closing the user sessions takes several
 minutes each time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is additional information about this problem:</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Several times when I have rebooted I see a purple screen for a fraction of a second once the user session closes (before the Windows is shutting down screen) with some sort of message and what appears to be a 1" computer icon in the middle. I don't recall
 the text but vaguely remember something about "ini." I've looked closely the last few times during shut down but have NOT seen it again. Could this be related to the problems I'm having?</div>
<div><br />
<div>- After crashing, recovered (Last saved by user) docs do not crash; new docs created now don't crash (only existing docs that I open).</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Word crashed while I was in Google Chrome (not in Word) copying a url.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Word 97-2003 docs I transferred from an older pre-Vista pc open as read only.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding event viewer logs, is there any risk to providing my logs in a public forum like this? Assuming not, will you please let me know the logs (with timeframe) you'd like me to provide? I saved a custom view of Windows, Apps and Services logs for
 the past week and there were 1300+ Errors and Warnings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again for your assistance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Phil</div>

            Thanks for your reply, Stefan.
<div><br />
<div>I created a new user account and Office appears to run properly in it, the Admin user session and another personal user session on my pc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Before I started the extensive trouble shooting Office was also crashing in the Admin session but that no longer occurs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This morning, I downloaded an update to the McAfee Security Center software I use and rebooted my pc. Now, when I open Office Word, Excel of PowerPoint I get a "Buffer Overflow Prevented" message from McAfee. Also, the message reads, "About This Buffer
 Overflow - File: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office 14\WINWORD.EXE. Hackers can use overflows to secretly run malicious programs, steal personal information, or hijack your PC." When I open Excel and Powerpoint I get a similar message except instead
 of WINWORD it reads EXCEL or POWERPNT, respectively.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Importantly, Word, Excel and&nbsp;PowerPoint&nbsp;no longer crash </b>(although they seem to run slower).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you have any suggestions to determine if my pc is being hacked? Also, while the current operation of Office 2010 is much improved do you have advice on addressing the buffer overflow on my personal user session?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you in advance for your time and insight.</div>
<div><br />

Sorry, I know very little about virus infected computers. Perhaps there is (online) documentation from McAfee telling you what the message means and what steps to take when it is displayed?</p>

<div><br />
<div>I removed several viruses via McAffee Stinger and the Office apps works but I still get the "Buffer Overflow Prevented" message from my McAfee antivirus software when I open one of the Office 2010 apps and move a reduced window. I only get the message
 once (not with each file I open). If I close Word (for example) and reopen it I'll get the message again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used the Microsoft Windows System File Checker tool&nbsp;<span>(SFC.exe), which didn't find any problems.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Since I'm only having this problem in my user session, is it possible my user profile is damaged? Do you have any suggestions regarding how I might fix this?</span></div>

            I don't know of a way to repair a user profile, if that's what you're asking. Recreating, and copying personal files into the new profile, is all I can suggest.<br />
<br />
By the way, did you have any luck finding any document from McAfee?

            Hi TK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will walk you through the fixes for Edge to try progressively until it's fixed: 
<br />
<br />Back up your Favorites first in Edge Settings &gt; Import from another Browser &gt; Export to a File.  If it won't open you can reach Favorites to back them up to an HTML file using the tiny app Manage Edge Favorites here:  <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset Edge in Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Feature, scroll down to Microsoft Edge, highlight it, choose Advanced Options, then Repair, or if that fails, Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try re-registering the app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can reinstall it from this link:  <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mic...</a>
<br />
<br />I would have several other browsers available to choose from on the Task Bar since Edge is a work in progress and unreliable.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  You can import Favorites from each other easily in Settings.  
<br />
<br />To reset Internet Explorer type internet Options in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, on Advanced Tab do a Reset.
<br />
<br />Other browsers have their Reset in their Advanced Settings.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Microsoft Edge. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Edge, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />To fix Internet Explorer, reset it:

Zune won't allow a restore. <br />

Any ideas how I can restore the device

            what version are you trying to restore to? Also if you are now running Windows Phone 7.5 are you using the same PC that you upgraded on? I have noticed that you may be only able to restore a previous OS on the original PC you used to upgrade from.<br />

            <p>I have the exact same problem.</p>
<p>HTC HD7</p>
<p>No operator</p>
<p>NoDo (then tried to upgrade to Mango, which failed)</p>
<p>Zune 4.8.2345.0</p>
<p>Windows 7 64bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to upgrade from NoDo to Mango, which failed. Several attempts to restore the phone failed, because the HD7 would reboot in the middle of the process (like at 40%, sometimes at 53% and so on). Only got it to 99% once (step 2 of 3) upon which I got the
 message "Your phone will restart now". Which it did, just 3 times in a row without ever booting into Windows Phone again. Removed the battery, put it back in and at one time Windows Phone came actually up, asking for which language to use. Switched to German,
 the phone rebooted and same mess all over again, HTC boot screen (logo) and then the phone just sits there. Read about the support tool and decided to give that a shot. Had to tackle with the battery (phone can't be turned off)&nbsp;and camera button but finally
 got to the connection screen on the phone. Now support tool claims that it cannot recover the phone. Great.</p>

<p>
</p><p>to check what's going on open notepad and then go to your internet web browse of choice select the content you want and use CTRL + Print Screen sysRq (button Next to scroll lock) then go back to notepad press Ctrl + V (to paste the contents if that works
 then try that in office 365 word pressor).</p>

<h2>            Office 365 User Mailbox License Level Matter for SMTP Client Submission&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. I have our MFP device set up to send email within our Office 365 environment using SMTP client submission method, (smtp.office365.com, port 587) . It works just fine using my office 365 account and a colleague's (both Office 365 E3 licenses) but
 fails when using an account i created with an Office 365 business Essentials license. Is there something missing from the Essentials license that would prevent me from using that account? It's a mailbox in Exchange that appears to be just like all of our E3
 licensed mailboxes. Thanks for any input here!

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-office-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SMTP client submission</a> method is applied to mailbox with Office 365 subscription and Exchange Online plan. Based on your description, I recommend you check the following setting first.</p>
<p>1. Make sure you enter the correct username and password.</p>
<p>2. Login to
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA(Outlook Web App)</a> to check whether the Business Essential account is active and has not been blocked from sending spam.</p>
<p>3. Check whether your device supports TLS version 1.0 or above, the best method is to upgrade the firmware on the device or updating the application you're sending email from to the latest
 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For detailed information about fixing issues with SMTP client submission, please refer to the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/fix-issues-with-printers-scanners-and-lob-applications-that-send-email-using-off?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252ffix-issues-with-printers-scanners-and-lob-applications-that-send-email-using-office-365-c75542a8-c792-42c0-a8c5-291df987512d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/fix-issues-with-printers-scanners-and-lob-applications-that-send-email-using-off?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252ffix-issues-with-printers-scanners-and-lob-applications-that-send-email-using-office-365-c75542a8-c792-42c0-a8c5-291df987512d</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, would you mind offering me more information for further analysis?</p>
<p>1. Whether you cannot login to MFP device or cannot send email in the device.</p>
<p>2. Is there any error message when you use the Business Essential account in MFP device, if so, please capture a screenshot for me.</p>
<p>3. If you change the port number to 25, whether the issue persists.</p>
<p>4. Please capture the screenshots for the licenses of E3 account and Business Essential account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Betty</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have a hotmail account, but to avoid confusion, I created a new windows live account (just for the phone info) and used this account to set up my WP7 phone.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once done, I added my other hotmail (email) and gmail accounts. I unchecked the calendar sync option in both. However, this option is not available for the primary (Windows Live) account that I created for the phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, when I add a calendar event on my phone, the details say its the windows live account calendar. I cannot see these calendar updates in any of my mail accounts (Windows Live, hotmail or gmail).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My question is... where are these calendar events stored if not in the windows live account? are these local?</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>By default the calendar items&nbsp;are synchronized with the corresponding account.&nbsp;If you have multiple accounts (Live, Outlook, Gmail) you can select&nbsp;from drop down list for what account
 you are&nbsp;crating the calendar item. For example I am creating my&nbsp;work related meetings to Outlook and my personal stuff to my Live account -&nbsp;both calendars would be displayed on my device just the color is different.</span></p>
<p><span>More about using the calendar here:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/start/use-calendar-appointments.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/start/use-calendar-appointments.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>You can't disable the synchronization of calendar and contacts for the primary Live ID and if you disabled the sync of Gmail calendar the calendar items would be created and synchronized
 with the primary Live ID. I would recommend to&nbsp;access the Live calendar from the PC at least once - to setup the time zone etc. to avoid sync issues.</span></p>
<p><span>If you create a calendar event on your phone it would be stored locally until the next successful synchronization,&nbsp;you can also manually sync with the Sync button in&nbsp;corresponding
 email account. In your case I would check the primary Live ID account calendar from the PC if there is no action for you (like setting the time zone), manually synchronize the calendar from the device and check the Live calendar again.</span></p>
<p><span>You have mentioned that you created new windows live account "just for the phone info" but this is definitely not recommended and as a result you can end with more&nbsp;confusion.&nbsp;I
 would recommend using&nbsp;you Live ID that you are already using&nbsp;-&nbsp;your contact, calendar and emails would be synchronized&nbsp;and you don't have to&nbsp;add your&nbsp;account as a secondary account. Keep in mind that&nbsp;Marketplace and&nbsp;Xbox Live are using the primary Live ID
 and you can't change it in the future unless you reset your device to factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Please read more about Live ID's here:<br />

                    I'm trying to forward mail from aol to outlook.com but the POP server smtp.aol.com port 587 is not an option on the setup screen, and neither is IMAP--does outlook.com not support mail forwarding from aol.com?

    <title>Delve page is empty - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Delve page is empty</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a test environment of Office 365 Business Premium. When I start Delve the page content is empty - no cards, no boards. I have documents in One Drive, shared and private - both won't appear. Also I think the menu is not as it should be - I have
 only "Home", "Me", "Favourites" and "People" group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office graph option is enabled, and I've tried in different up to date browsers - Chrome, Mozilla with no success.</p>
<p>I noticed however that upon starting the web app it tries to load some cards but shortly afterwards it displays that there are not documents here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any resolution to this problem?</p>

<p>Hi Yana,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you explained that you're using a test environment, I would like to confirm whether you have just created it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are, please refer to this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Store-your-documents-where-Office-Delve-can-get-to-them-49a0db49-5e6c-4dda-816e-e11dd77de49d?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Store your documents
 where Office Delve can get to them</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taken from the article itself:</p>
<p>If you see very few or no documents in Delve, you can start storing your documents in OneDrive for Business and share them with your colleagues. It may take a little while (sometimes up to an hour)
 before the new and uploaded documents appear in Delve for you and the people you shared them with. Your colleagues will not see your private documents, for example documents you've stored in private folders in OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, regarding your concern that the menu isn't as it should be, you can refer to the article below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/My-Office-Delve-looks-different-from-what-you-describe-8fe977a0-cc37-4845-a75d-96994dffca5d?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Office Delve
 looks different from what you describe</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persist, I will send you a private message to collect the files. You can access the private message

<p>Hi Yana,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the Delve menu, please tell us the menu you are finding?</p>
<p>For example, the “Myanalytics”. Refer to <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/04/06/take-back-your-time-with-delve-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Take back your time with MyAnalytics</a>, this is a part of the Office 365 E5 plan, or an add-on to Office 365 Enterprise plans. Which means it is not included in the Business Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the empty page for the “Popular documents”, as the “Popular documents” only shows the popular documents (which means the documents are frequently read or edited by others) you can access to, please follow the steps below to see the result:</p>
<ol>
<li>Share a document of the user to others.</li><li>Let others read or edit the shared document several times.</li><li>Wait for an hour to see the result.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
