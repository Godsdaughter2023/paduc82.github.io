<h2>            Desktop icons on top of one another windows 8.1</h2>
                    I recently changed the spacing of my desktop icons. Because I use a larger font to see better. Everything was fine then one day &nbsp;I turned on the computer and it appears all the icons are stacked on top of themselves.&nbsp; This pic is a screen capture.

<p>
</p><p><em><span>What happens when you drag and drop the icons?</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to some incorrect settings. I would suggest you to drag and drop the icons as desired and check. If you are not able to arrange that way, right click on any empty space in the desktop and select ‘Sort
 by’ and choose a desired option to sort the icons. This is most probably a one-time issue and wouldn’t occur again. Try these steps and let us know the results.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the the reply. Unfortunately I have tried these things and non have worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I am confident I changed nothing but thespacing I must have done something odd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand why I had to go into the regestry to do it in the first place. Was much easier in xp&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox360 Slim getting really hot after only about a hour of use.</h2>
                    
<p>As the title says my Xbox360 slim is getting really hot on the top after about playing it for a hour. The games im playing are installed on the hard drive so it shouldnt be running so hard. Thinking of going to best buy because i have a warranty through
 them and see about getting it replaced with a new one.</p>

<p>Mine is doing the same thing. Given I am playing Fallout New Vegas, which makes just about anyone's Xbox run like a mule, but it's getting out of hand. It gets hot and freezes the game every half hour or so.

            <p>Hello doug stopps, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you first start using your Surface, there are a number of Windows updates and&nbsp;app updates waiting to be downloaded and installed. You can control the app updates, but not the Windows updates - they&nbsp;can download and sit in your Surface, waiting for the
 Surface to be restarted so they can be configured. </p>
<p>I would advise you to tell the Surface to restart via the power icon, then a few hours later restart the Surface again. Let us know if this helps.

                    I have recently been experiencing a bit of a problem on the taskbar on my computer. For some reason, when I open a program that isn't in the taskbar, there is a strange spacing between it and the taskbar icons, as if there's an invisible icon in between.
 Does anyone know how to solve this issue?

            Hi LegendOP 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.       
        </p>

</p><blockquote>Hi LegendOP <br />
<br />
My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />
This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt. <br />
You can try a couple things. <br />
<br />
Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter. <br />
Restart the computer. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work then try this, <br />
<br />
Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />
In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />
Press Enter key after each command: <br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth <br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth <br />
<br />
Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />
To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
Restart your computer. </blockquote>
<p>I right clicked on the start button, but it didn't list Command Prompt (Admin) as an option.</p>

<p>Hi Miloslav,<br />
<br />
Corrupted Windows update components are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. Uninstalling the KB4056892 first may help successfully uninstalling the update since it's the most recent available. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Programs</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>View installed updates </strong>in the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate <strong>KB4056892 </strong>below <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> section.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Keep us in the loop with the result.<br />

    <title>Refund Microsoft Points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refund Microsoft Points</h2>
                    
<p>This is 3rd thread about this, but first about refund.</p>
<p>Well, Hi Microsoft, I am trying every day to download Rezurrection DLC for Black Ops but it's region blocked for me.</p>
<p>Bought Xbox 360 in Denmark, live in Bosnia and Herzegowina(xbox live online buying not supported).</p>
<p>I'm asking now, if there are any possibilities to refund me my 1200 Microsoft Points to my account which I "threw in water" 1 month ago.</p>
<p>It's not fair to pay for 1200 Microsoft Points, and after buying realize it's region locked.</p>
<p>It's same thing, you pay 25,000$ for a car, you receive keys, and keys doesn't match with your car's doors, and he doesn't want to give your money back(excatly same situation).</p>
<p>So?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want Mister Giwyther (or whatever is he called) to give me correct answer if I can get my points back, or if Microsoft will let me download that DLC.</p>
<p>THANKS.</p>
<p>ANY ANSWERS ARE APPERCIATED.</p>
<p>(Do not understand this as "attacking Microsoft" or "offensive", please, I'm just asking because I gave money for it.)</p>

<p>Typically they will refund MSP's once in a 12 month period. Found that out the hard way over NEED FOR SPEED CARBON DLC. Purchased some cars for 80 pts each. Wasn't able to use 2 of them. They refunded me. Next day bought tcar bundle for 200 MSP. Did not
 work .They said only 1 refund every 12 months.</p>

<h2>            I have empty removable disk volumes as seen in &#34;Disk Management&#34;</h2>
                    With no removable drives inserted in the USB slots, I have volumes listed as Disk 1,2,3,4 with drive letters assigned E,F,G,H, and the volumes are empty.&nbsp;If I insert any USB flash drives, the drive letter assigned starts with I,J,etc. I have found no way
 to delete them but I can remove the drive letters. However, the drive letter assigned to any USB drive inserted still starts with the letter I. What is happening here and is there any way to correct it?

<p>You really can't transfer programs from one computer to another - they have to be reinstalled in the new computer. That's because installed programs form a relationship with the registry and with files created in other parts of Windows.</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />You can't transfer desktop programs or Store apps, those have to reinstalled from disc or downloaded again from the Microsoft Store.
<br />
<br />How to find and reinstall desktop programs installed from disc or downloaded from the Internet:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/install-or-reinstall-desktop-programs-and-apps-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/install-or-rei...</a>
<br />
<br />Instructions a from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog
<br />
<br />For Store apps on the new computer...
<br />
<br />Launch the Microsoft Store app on the Taskbar
<br />	Click the ellipsis in the top right corner of the screen (...)
<br />	Click My Library
<br />	Scroll through the list then click the app if its listed there, then click the download button.
<br />
<br />	If doesn't help, let us know and we can explore more options. 
<br />
<br />As for your personal files:
<br />
<br />You can backup your files and restore them using the following steps:
<br />
<br />What you need to start this project?
<br />
<br />What you need to start this project?
<br />
<br />The first thing I recommend you do is invest in an external hard disk. I can't exhaust this enough; they are affordable and can store lots of data. You can probably get a 4TB drive for around $100.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, if you have a complex configuration, these instructions do not delve into the nuances of multiple partitions or drives with data scattered across them although the same rules can apply in regards to backup. If you do have folders for data such as documents, music, pictures and videos stored on other partitions or drives, then I would recommend you disconnect these data drives and upgrade only the system partition. You can always reattach your data drives after setup is complete.
<br />
<br />Turn on Show Hidden Files &amp; Folders
<br />
<br />You want your backup to be as thorough as possible. Within your User folder is a hidden directory called AppData. This folder stores important settings for the apps you use, such as custom directionaries for Microsoft Word, passwords for apps like Chrome, Outlook data files and mail folders for apps like Windows Mail.
<br />
<br />To turn on Hidden Files and folders, start by opening your user folder. Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Enabling Show hidden files and Folders
<br />
<br />Windows 8/8.1/10 - Click the View tab then click Options then click the View tab. Under Advanced settings &gt; Hidden files and folders select the radio box Show hidden files and folders.
<br />
<br />AppData folder is now visible.
<br />
<br />After completing the above steps, you should now see the AppData folder appear in your user folder.
<br />
<br />Next step is to simply select all the folder. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + A or
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10),
<br />
<br />Selected folders
<br />
<br />Open your External hard disk then create a new folder and call it backup or a unique name. Open it then press Ctrl + V or
<br />
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10),
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have multiple accounts
<br />
<br />If you have more than one account on your computer, log into each account and repeat the same steps. Make sure a unique folder is created for each account you backup manually.
<br />
<br />Remember other folders you might have
<br />
<br />If you store data in folders such as Public, remember to look in there too. The Public folder is located in C:\Users\Public
<br />
<br />NOTE: Some apps will keep their own data stores within their application folders, so make sure you browse and copy those over if necessary. Some users have a tendency to store files at the root of the hard disk, normally where the operating system is installed (Local Disk c:\). Also check there for any important files and move them to Documents folder.
<br />
<br />Restoration
<br />
<br />Once your backup is complete and you have your new computer setup  and is installed and running, the next step is to copy over your files and folders from the external hard disk. You can do this two ways, you can individually copy the contents of each folder into the respective folder on the new computer from the external drive. Here is what you can easily do.
<br />
<br />Connect and turn on your external hard disk.
<br />
<br />Browse the backup folder with your backed up folders.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + A or Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10)
<br />
<br />Open your User folder on the computer
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + V or Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10)
<br />
<br />You will be prompted if you want to replace the folders, click Yes.
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have other accounts, make sure the respective accounts have been created and logged into then repeat the same steps.

            Hi,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Rogelio. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />I recommend reinstalling the most common programs on your new PC, it is very easy using this third-party tool, you can select each program you want to install:
<br /><a href="https://ninite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ninite.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If in addition to these you are missing some others you can do it manually installing each one, I believe that in this way they will work better on your new PC.

<p>Regardless of the version of Windows, it's not a question of the *best* way. It's a question of whether there is *any* way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer (with a few rare exceptions) is no; there is no way to do this. That's because almost all program are not just their .exe files. They also have many associated files and&nbsp; references with \Windows, in the registry and elsewhere. Without all of
 those the program won't work, and finding and transferring of them is next to impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you have to do is a clean reinstallation of all your programs from their original media. Transferring is not possible.</p>

<h2>            How can I be sure that I&#39;m getting support from Microsoft instead of OmniTech&#63;  They ripped me off the same way they did many other MS customers.</h2>
                    <p>11 May 2013 I had an AWFUL experience with Omnitech yesterday and got ripped off something terrible.&nbsp; All I needed was to be able to create New Folders again instead of Briefcases.&nbsp; Something had happened that blocked me from creating New Folders anywhere
 in the computer - only briefcases which as I understand it is for allowing synchronizing folder contents to other computers elsewhere!.&nbsp; Frankly, I suspect some mal ware of trying to synchronize my folders out into their computers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original tech could not get the job done, but he ran their optimizer that said there were 8,000+ bad entries and on and on.&nbsp; He said they would fix all the problems and it would be $249.99.&nbsp; Then he said he could fine tune the computer for $210 more.&nbsp;
 Then I told him NO, and he suddenly said he could fine tune it for $120.&nbsp; Like an idiot, I said okay, because I was in a hurry, but then he wanted me to e-sign the contract in my e-mail - to log into my e-mail with my password while he was in remote control.&nbsp;
 I said NO.&nbsp; We disconnected - I hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went and read the "bill" - there were 14 pages of Terms and Conditions one of which was the dreaded automatic renewal clause!&nbsp; I tried to print the Ts and Cs and the document&nbsp;would not let me!&nbsp; &nbsp;I went back and told
 them absolutely NO.&nbsp; Why didn't I stop there?&nbsp; D___ good question!&nbsp; They then decided they could work without the e-sign.&nbsp; The next tech solved the "New Folder" problem in five to ten minutes maximum, and yet another tech supposedly did the "fine tune".&nbsp; IF
 YOU SEE OMNITECH - STOP, DO NOT GO - STOP.&nbsp; They are a huge RIPOFF.&nbsp; I guess the best I can hope for is that no additional damage was done to my computer.&nbsp; I spent six plus hours with them on line and they left two programs on my machine to "log me&nbsp;in remotely"
 and to "Optimize" telling me to leave my computer on and that there was no need for me to be there when they "optimized" my.&nbsp; Needlessly to say, I uninstalled those programs this morning.&nbsp;A man named Kirk, who said he was from Omnitech, called me later and
 said he wanted to make sure I had a good experience with Omnitech.&nbsp; Needless to say, I told him that value for money was NOT there with Omnitech and that I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to Omnitech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope others do not get caught up in this mess and I hope <u>Microsoft will do something to making seeking their help on problems less ambiguous</u>.</p>

            <p>It's true that Microsoft has nothing to do with Omnitechsupport, but Microsoft users need to be made aware of this threat!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; As a brand new user of Windows 8.1 with lots of issues and questions, I do a lot of searches to help find resolutions.&nbsp;I have found
 great info on this forum, but today I was also scammed by these despicable people.&nbsp; It was difficult finding info about a problem&nbsp;getting the Mail app to work with the metro share feature&nbsp;(which I finally figured out myself -&nbsp;it won't&nbsp;work if signed in as
 a local user) immediately brought me to a result for something described as "Microsoft online chat support".&nbsp; This turned out to be an automatically initiated&nbsp;chat session with an Omnitechsupport "technician", but I thought I was communicating with&nbsp;someone
 representing Microsoft and didn't realize until it was all over (4 hours later and they had&nbsp;managed to install&nbsp;programs, registry items, et al, on my computer thru the&nbsp;"remote assistance" they were providing) that they were NOT who they claimed to be.&nbsp; Although
 I was a little panicked by their schtick that my computer was severely corrupted with "polymorphic viruses" based on the extensive report they&nbsp;generated&nbsp;on/from my own desktop,&nbsp;and their convincing tech talk about why/how easily this can happen with Windows
 8, I was thinking I would rather return it than pay to have my 4 day old laptop repaired. (lucky me). Instead, I finally noticed the logo on the report still on my desktop, and&nbsp;searched them out to find&nbsp;it was a scam. But at this point I had no idea if they
 had already infected my computer (you know, the sales/scam&nbsp;practice of creating a problem to sell you the solution).

<p>It took Dell support 2 hours to go through my system, remove all the omnitech installed files and programs they found, and ensure that my system was in fact in very&nbsp;good shape after all. I don't know what would have happened from the omnitech registry items
 found in my system had I rebooted before I called Dell, but this is why I'm glad this post is here - This is not Microsoft's problem, but&nbsp;since these&nbsp;links come up in searches (google &amp; bing) as Microsoft support, users&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be informed.</p>
<p>I only wish I had read your post before today. Could have saved me a lot of grief!</p>

            <p>OK. This is how you tell one from another.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Example #1: This is the official Microsoft support site for Canada. Note the&nbsp;part before the /.
</p>
<p><font color="#009030"><strong>support</strong>.microsoft.com / ?ln=en-ca</font></p>
<p>This is MICROSOFT.COM.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Example #2: Again, note the part before the /. .</p>
<p><font color="#009030">www. omnitech<strong>support </strong>.com / <strong>windows_support</strong>.php</font></p>
<p><font color="#333333">This is OMNITECHSUPPORT.COM</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font color="#333333">The same applies to any search that you make. Look at the domain name to determine where the support is originating.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Test: I need to check that my Gigabyte motherboard has the latest drivers, so I type 'Gigabyte drivers' into a Bing or Google search. I have clipped two results out. Which one&nbsp;is more likely to&nbsp;give me specific drivers for my motherboard model?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font color="#009030">www. nodevice .com/<strong>driver </strong>/ company / <strong>

<p><font color="#333333">If you picked the second, you were right.</font></p>

<p>Everybody wants to make money these days and many don't care how they do it. In fairness, many never did, hence the expression 'Caveat emptor'.</p>

<p>If you arrive at a website which is full of claims, references,&nbsp;download buttons and Microsoft partner logos, and it all looks very confusing, you are not alone. These websites are designed to confuse, and what you should do in these cases is use your browser's
 BACK button.. </p>

<p>Nah, if you can't get the evidence you just have to go the vengeance route, which you can always choose to do (even after going the peaceful route). &nbsp;You may have to go and talk to Cass again after settling accounts with Alice, even if she is with you when
 you do it.</p>

<h2>            My Windows 7 computer just stopped working.</h2>
                    My Windows 7 home premium Stopped working correctly after I completely wiped it out of viruses an malware and Trojans. After I did that It set me to windows 7 home premium instead of the usual windows 7 home premium 64 bit, and a lot of my programs like
 for example morrowind and Mozilla Firefox will not work or uninstall. and when they run they freeze or just wont even uninstall. I also cant back it up it says error. When ever it configures itself after being shut own it takes about five hours every time,
 all the research ive done wont tell me, I got he computer used so I don't have anything about the instructions. What can I do?

    <title>Cannot change default playback&#47;recording device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yoog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot change default playback&#47;recording device</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason I can no longer change the active/default sound device in either the Playback or Recording tabs of the sound control panel.&nbsp; My current recognized sound devices are the following:</p>
<p>Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium PCIe</p>
<p>ATI HDMI Output (from a Radeon HD 5870)</p>
<p>Audio Technica AT2020 USB microphone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using a DAC/amp connected to the SPDIF output on my sound card, but now I want to switch back to the stereo/headphone port and it won't let me.&nbsp; Any idea what is causing this?&nbsp; Is it one of the device drivers or is some part of the Windows 7
 install corrupted?</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span><span>yoog</span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span>What happens when you try to select the default sound device?</span></p>
<p><span>For now, let’s uninstall the sound card drivers of Creative &amp; graphics card drivers of ATI from the device manager and reinstall
 it back. Then check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong><br />
<br />
a. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In device manager, expand the drivers listed in the device list.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click on the driver, click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Reboot the computer. The drivers will get installed automatically.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2<br />
</strong><br />
You may also download &amp; install the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check.<br />
a. For Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium PCIe, you may download it from this link.</span></p>

<p><span>b. For ATI Radeon HD 5870, you may download it from this link.<br />

<h2>            My xbox one s console powers down when I try to connect to my wifi</h2>
                    <p>I've had this xbox one s for 2 years.&nbsp; Yesterday I did a reset because of a problem I was having with a game.&nbsp; Now, I cannot get the console to stay on.&nbsp; I can power it up and it will stay on about 30 seconds before shutting down completely.&nbsp; I cannot get
 to any settings or anything.&nbsp; It will not stay up long enough.&nbsp; I've change the power cord, checked all plugs, wires, etc.&nbsp; Took it to a local fix it shop and they said kept it for 24 hours and said they had no problems with it and it was not shutting down
 in their office.&nbsp; I got home and the same thing kept happening.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suspected wifi connection so I tried a hard wired connection but the same thing happened.&nbsp; No different.&nbsp; Finally decided to turn off my wifi completely.&nbsp; Bingo!&nbsp; The console will stay on
 if my wifi is completely off.&nbsp; I looked around and whatever settings I could.&nbsp; &nbsp;I plugged my wifi back in and the console powered off.&nbsp; Seems that is powers off when connecting to my wifi.&nbsp; What can I do?</p>
