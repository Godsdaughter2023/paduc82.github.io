<h2>            Cannot delete any Skype Profile Picture whatsoever</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype does not give the option to delete a profile pic, added accidentally or purposeful. &nbsp;Where can one delete one's profile pic permanently?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you very much.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to delete a Profile photo, however it can be changed. &nbsp;You can change it into a blank picture. Just save or browse any plain/blank picture and save it as your new Profile Photo.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if there is another instance of the same program running in the background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Stop and start or restart
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Office Service</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> following below mentioned instructions and verify the result:</span></font></p>
<p>(Since you are unable to click
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">
Apply</span></font> option, you may choose manual option from the drop down instead of Automatic, click apply and then switch back to Automatic and then try to start it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Hold
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> key +<span style="font-weight: bold">R</span></font>.</p>
<p>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>services.msc</font></span></p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>2. In the <font>
Microsoft Office Service</span></font>.</p>
<p>3. In the <font>
Startup</span></font> type list.</p>
<p>4. Click <font>
Apply</span>, and then click <span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span></font>.</p>
<p>5. Start the software installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not help, then the only option now is to completely remove all traces of Office 365/ Office 2013 from the computer and then re-install it. You may remove all traces of Office 2013 installation
 by running the fixit from the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now download and install Office 2013/Office 365 by logging into
<a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>www.office.com/myaccount</font></a> with the registered email address and click Install Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion provided is helpful.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, you can install 2 versions of Microsoft Office on the same computer and at the same time. You may go ahead and install Excel 2016 with Office Home and Student 2013.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The file extension for Word 2016, Excel 2016 and PowerPoint 2016 are the same as in older versions of Office.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the following Microsoft Office link for more information on Office 2016 and Frequently Asked Questions:</span></p>

<h2>            Groove Music Pass - cancelled on region change&#63;&#33; - need refund, at minimum</h2>
                    <p>Hi there - today after I made a change to the region info of my XBox account,&nbsp;(switching from US to Canadian) I discovered that my annual Groove Music Pass (which I just renewed in February) had suddenly been cancelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this can happen when the account region changes -- but it's obviously an unacceptable outcome and I would like my Groove pass reinstated to the same (Canadian)&nbsp;region, or, at minimum, get a refund for the remaining 9 months that I have
 paid for with this annual pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what you can do to make this happen -&nbsp; thank you!</p>

<p>Hello David,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Home and Student Office 2016</strong> normally comes with Word 2016, Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and OneNote 2016. This is the main reason why you've been prompted to purchase the Outlook program since this is not included with the Office bundle
 that was acquired on your computer. See this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://products.office.com/en/home-and-student" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Office Home &amp; Student 2016</strong></a> for more information regarding this.</p>

<h3> randybw57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing a spreadsheet with two PC&#39;s using the same Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently posted a question in the OneDrive area about a problem I had with Excel.</p>
<p>Thinking about this, I'm wondering if the question is more appropriate to Office.</p>
<p>So here is what I would like to do and I'm wondering if this is ok:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 10 with latest anniversary updates</p>
<p>2. One Desktop. One Laptop.</p>
<p>3. Both pc's use OneDrive.</p>
<p>4. Both pc's use the same Microsoft account for Windows and OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. All folders are synced.</p>
<p>6. Both OneDrive/Settings/Office/Use Office 2016 to sync files that I open are checked 'on'.</p>
<p>7. Office 365. Which I believe translates to Office 2016.</p>
<p>8. Start Excel on laptop.</p>
<p>9. Open spreadsheet 'ABC'.</p>
<p>10. Start Excel on desktop.</p>
<p>11. Attempt to open spreadsheet 'ABC'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is step 11 supposed to work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I be able to have the same spreadsheet open and being updated from two pc's using the same Microsoft account for</p>
<p>Windows and OneDrive? Actually, the question is a bit broader. I'd actually would like to have it open on one or more of the pc's</p>
<p>and my iPhone as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help or advice!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, that could work. When you save a document to OneDrive, the document is stored in a central location that you can access from almost anywhere. Saving a document to OneDrive also makes it easy to share the document with other people and save time by simultaneously
 editing the document.</p>
<p>

            <p>Michael ~ Welcome to the Community. Before doing anything else, I suggest you make sure you're running Time Machine or other backup app in case you want to later recover the cached (local) copies of your notebooks on Mac &nbsp;— see this post:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_onenote-onenote_mac/onenote-back-up-and-restore-using-apple-mac/a4a585b3-2982-4563-a1bb-e3383423c7ac?msgId=789252f4-9327-47b1-8589-67da6025fb75">Onenote back
 up and restore using apple mac</a></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"I deleted my onenote folder from my one drive."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify, OneNote notebooks are stored in the Documents folder of OneDrive — did you delete the Documents folder from OneDrive? ...And there's this Microsoft support article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delete-or-restore-files-and-folders-949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete or restore files and folders</a></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply alancitoXV. &nbsp;I was actually storing my OneNote files in a folder labelled "Work Documents". &nbsp;Sadly, it appears I must have deleted the folder from there quite a long time ago (almost a year ago) so it doesn't appear in the recycle
 bin anymore. &nbsp;To complicate matters, I don't have time machine turned on so I can't go back to a time when that folder was still around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, I do still have all the files open on my Mac in OneNote, I just can't seem to sync them anymore (which makes sense, given that I must have deleted the original folder at some point). &nbsp;That's why I'm trying to think of how I can export them,
 restore them and then try to resync across my devices. &nbsp;However, it seems like the Mac version of OneNote is the only one that doesn't allow you to export the files in a one note package which seems like a strange omission. &nbsp;To further complicate things, the
 Mac version is the only one where I have the files open. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

            <p>Hi again. &nbsp;Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I'll try to be a bit more specific.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"I was actually storing my OneNote files in a folder labelled "Work Documents"."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? ...Were they OneNote for Windows files that you were trying to put on your Mac?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Initially the files were created with OneNote for Windows. &nbsp;My workplace moved over to Mac at the beginning of this year. I can't remember the specific reason for them ending up in OneDrive in a folder called Work Documents but that is where
 the OneNote url link points to when I try to share a workbook through the share function menu built into OneNote for Mac. &nbsp;I do remember there being a Work Documents folder in my OneDrive and so I'm assuming that either through an errant sync or my own clumsiness
 it seems to have been deleted. &nbsp; &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But rather than me asking random questions, I suggest you state step-by-step the sequence of events that led to this complicated situation. And be explicit about what format the "files" were, e.g. .onepkg or .one files etc., how they were created and where
 they were stored, e.g. on your Mac or OneDrive, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Unfortunately, as the files have been deleted, I can't comment on what format they were in initially. My assumption is that they would have been .one files, initially created using OneNote for Windows. &nbsp;I have discovered that I do still have
 the files on my Windows Phone also, however the same sync error occurs. &nbsp;The problems seem to have started when I got my Mac, so I'm not sure if that is when I may have created this situation. &nbsp;Basically, the OneNote error screen says it's looking for a&nbsp;file
 that doesn't exist when it&nbsp;tries to sync.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>So, really my question is can I recreate this file to OneDrive from either of the local files that exist on both my Mac and my Windows Phone. &nbsp;It seems strange that I can't just export them in some way and restore the file</em></strong>. &nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Also, do you see a Documents folder in OneDrive and if so, do you see your notebooks there?</p>

<p>You should have mentioned that in your first post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've edited this reply several times and perhaps it's because I don't understand what you mean by "local files" — Notebooks you see in OneNote? ...Or files you see in a viewer such as Mac's Finder? So the following may not be much use to you:</p>
<p>Windows PC .onepkg or .one files can't be "exported" as such — but they can be "Shared" to OneDrive:

<p>If you still have them (it seems you don't), move the Windows OneNote .onepkg or .one file onto a Windows PC (or your Mac running Windows via

            Thanks again for your reply. &nbsp;I believe I have now solved my own issue. &nbsp;I simply created a new notebook and copied each section from the old notebook to that new one. &nbsp;The sync now occurs and my problem is solved. &nbsp;Thank you for trying AlancitoXV.

<h2>            Zune car pack v2 won&#39;t work</h2>
                    The car pack will still charge zune devices, and it appears to be transmitting a signal because the static on a station turns to a silent signal when I tune t I he car pack to that frequency. The problem is happening on a 16gB HD and an 8gb older model
 Zune. I have the volume on the Zunes turned up to the max. Does anyone know what the problem might be?

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Say you have the mg/L figure in A1 you simply multiply that by 1000 to get micrograms/L</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so the formula is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=A1*1000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or to do it the other way around if you have the ug/L figure in a1 you divide</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=A1/1000</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A formula can't change any cell other than the one it's in so you can't do that with a formula. You can do it with a macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select all the cell with micrograms in and run this code and it will convert them to milligrams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Milli_To_Micro()<br />
Dim c As Range<br />
For Each c In Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.Value = c.Value / 1000<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>Try this</p>

<p>1. Type 1000 in any cell (say cell A1)</p>
<p>2. Copy cell A1 and select the cells which you want to convert</p>

 use the hyperlinks in emails with normal expected results.&nbsp; I did have browser Edge as my defaults browser.&nbsp; I now have Internet Explorer from my Windows 10 and I made that as my default browser.&nbsp; All is well that ends well.&nbsp; I am happy that the hyperlinks

<p>u can disable the auto keypad lock @ Settings-General-Phone and Sim Card, here set the keypad autolock period to NONE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if u wanna disable keypad lock while sliding u can do it @Settings-General-Slide Handling-Key Guard activation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi GauthamShanmugam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A common reason for this concern are third party app connected services. If they are added to your Outlook mail account usually the profile picture used is the available profile picture used on the third party app service, If there is no available profile
 picture on your Outlook account. We want to know more about the issue your having with your profile picture showing even though it was already removed. Please answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version of Outlook are you using, is it the Outlook web app or the Outlook desktop app?</li><li>We just want to verify if you have a connected third party account services to your email account?</li><li>Can you please tell us where did the picture on your sent emails came from? Is it from another Microsoft app or a third party app profile picture?</li></ul>

</p><p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the Outlook web app. How can I find the third party apps that are connected to my account, as I dont remember of one? The picture was the one I kept few years ago for my hotmail account and I removed it around May 2018, but the picture is still
 visible to all the receipients to whom I send email.</p>

<p>Apologies for the late response. When we say connected accounts, it might be a social media account or might be Skype or any Microsoft account that has a profile picture.. The best thing to do is to check your accounts, go through them one by one and try
 to remove the profile picture and check which account is affecting your email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Keep both Office 365 Business email along with Network solutions email for non-365 workers</h2>
                    <p>Adding Office 365 Business to a small construction company of around 10 employees. Main purpose is so that a few of the workers can access email on multiple devices, along with the 1TB of storage. However, half the workers do not need any of the features
 and have no desire to set them up with Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would like to use the advanced features of Office 365 Business as well as continue to use Network Solutions email for those workers that do not have Office 365. Is this possible, or will switching email domain hosting remove the ability for non-365 workers
 to continue as they always did? Do all employees need Office 365 Business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p><span>Hi Rob,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned above, I think your email providers are different for Office 365 users and field workers. However, based on your last reply, you also move field workers to Office 365. Am I right? For my understanding,
 I summarize the situations here and please feel free to correct me:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have 40% Office 365 users and 60% field workers. They use the same domain name (such as contoso.com). You want all users (Office 365 users and field workers) to use Office 365 and each user has their own
 email accounts (these accounts can be set up in Outlook client or mobile). But field workers don’t want to subscribe Office 365 licenses. It this is your situation, it is not feasible to do it. Since any users want to use Office 365 Exchange features, they
 must have related licenses.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think your fielder workers also have another email accounts by Network solutions (old email provider). If all users in your company used Network solutions before, you can do the Simple Domain sharing. It
 means that you only need to move a few users to Office 365 and forward emails from Network Solutions to Office 365. Here is a reference:</span></p>

<h3> mccormdt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail e-mails deleted from Inbox</h2>
                    <p>All e-mails in my Hotmail inbox are occasionally getting deleted. &nbsp;It was happening every day overnight a couple of weeks ago. &nbsp;i have set up a new Mail profile &nbsp;and picked it for Outlook always to use in the Mail Setup as suggested by a community expert
 already -- and that made no difference. I reinstalled the account in Outlook 2016 as Exchange active sync per one community expert. &nbsp;I tried only checking via webmail for 24 hours (not from phone or outlook) and there still was a deletion. &nbsp;For the last week
 or so it wasn't happening (maybe after the exchange active sync though i think i was exchange already), then it happened again last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also check it on an IPhone. &nbsp; I don't know if my hotmail account is POP, IMAP or something else. &nbsp;I thought i'd see that in the IPhone Mail/Advanced Settings but it just says it uses SSL with no other indicator that i could find.<br />
But in my web Outlook.com settings i see that is says POP is disabled and there are setting listed for IMAP and SMTP if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have checked on the web and in Outlook and there are no Rules set up at all. &nbsp;I can find them in Deleted Items and bring them back but that is not a sustainable method.<br />

<p>1. &nbsp;Issue started in late Nov. &nbsp;This is right around the time that Microsoft was going to make some sort of change that might impact Hotmail accounts they had warned. &nbsp;I would assume that is the cause, unless it was my upgrade to Windows 10 and Office 2016
 that also occurred around that time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;i did not make any changes to the e-mail account itself, just the upgrade to Outlook 2016 to access it. &nbsp;No changes on the IPhone that i also use to access it</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;When i check on web i use Outlook.live.com and it shows Outlook Mail (Preview) at top of screen. &nbsp;I rarely use the web interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you. &nbsp;In the recent past when i posted on this issue i heard back quickly to my initial question but then never again when i replied. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

            <p>I have this problem. It seems that my inbox has started only keeping one month's worth of emails now. It deletes older emails automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Thunderbird mail client on my computer, but it is set to leave msgs. on server until I delete them. Still... already downloaded mail disappears from my TB inbox after 30 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use the "Mail " app that came with my phone: HTC DNA on Verizon. It is set to download 30 days of past mail, which is the maximum option available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls. help. I am losing messages that I need to keep.</p>

<h3> slam5  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010 will not show new imap email automatically</h2>
                    Hi, I have OL 2010.&nbsp; I have numerous imap accounts.&nbsp; My problem is that new email will not appear until I click and open the inbox of that particular account..&nbsp; My OL is set for checking mail every 3 minutes.&nbsp; If I send myself email to a particular account
 that I'm not look at, I will not see email unless I had open that mail box.&nbsp; I do get that email right the way on my Blackberry as I can hear the new mail sound.&nbsp; I waited&nbsp; 3 minutes just in case OL checks imap for new email like POP.&nbsp; Any solution?&nbsp; BTW,
 I did go to the Send/Rec tab and make sure all accounts has been checked.&nbsp; Many thanks in advance!

            i've 9 imap acct.&nbsp; ol is working fine except for this annoying problem.&nbsp; maybe i can describe my problem a little better.&nbsp; i've about 6 imap acct and 4 pop3 acct.&nbsp; all my imap accts belong to favorite folder list.&nbsp; i've two problems.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>all of my imap accts' inbox are in the fav list.&nbsp; if i'm not in my first imap act when ol exits; ol will not open with 1st imap acct. maybe i can illustrate this way:</li></ol>
<p>fav acct</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>imap acct a inbox<br />
</p>
<p>imap acct b inbox</p>
<p>c inbox</p>

<p>e inbox</p>
<p>f inbox</p>
<p>pop3 inbox 1</p>
<p>pop3 inbox 2</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>when i exit ol, if i'm in imap acct a inbox, imap acct a inbox will not appear in my fav acct list.&nbsp; this problem is not consistent.&nbsp; i tried this morning and it was not happening..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; imap acct is not automatically checking automatically unless I have touch that acct.&nbsp; that is, if I have't look at the contents of imap acct inbox as least once, i won't see any new email on that acct unless i look at once.<br />

            This is not the way Outlook should behave AFAIK.<br />
<br />
I think Deepa Raj has understood your issue and she wants you to check if any add-in is causing any kind of conflict.<br />
<br />
Try those steps and let us know the result...<br />
