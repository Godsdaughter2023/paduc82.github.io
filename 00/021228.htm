<h2>            windows phone photos</h2>
                    <p>I have a lumia950xl and win 10 laptop. When attempting to view photos from laptop via usb cable I am unable to see any photo taken after 5.6.17.( I can see them&nbsp; on the phone). I can see an icon with a blue design in it with all details of photo but no photo.
 If I&nbsp; transfer a copy of the photo on my phone to the document file on my phone using file explorer on phone I can then see the photo from my laptop. I am unable to transfer any of the photos to my laptop. Both devices are updated with all updates available.</p>

            2016 is written in the latest Apple code and therefore components are Compartmentalized. (Sandboxed) a Security method Apple uses now. &nbsp;If &nbsp;you got an error message that you have to&nbsp;approve or verify location, such as&nbsp;a specific Directory. (desktop&nbsp;is
 actually a directory.) Follow&nbsp;the path &nbsp;the error message requires, and click okay to approve. You will only be asked once. Then you should be able to save to the&nbsp;desired location now.&nbsp;

<h2>            Access MSysComplexColumns error</h2>
                    <p>Hi when compacting the tables (backend) of my db I get the MSysComplexColums is not a local object error.&nbsp; The tables are 207 mb in size so well within the limits.&nbsp; The tables sit on our server if you move the tables to a local machine you still get the
 same error.&nbsp; The front end which is larger than the back end compacts fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I take the tables home they compact fine on my PC and I have tried it on other PC's away from work and they compact fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried old backups from 2013 which used to compact with no problems they now come up with the same error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi Tom</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried importing the tables into a new database same problem. &nbsp;I don't believe this a table related problem as the old backups from 2 years ago which we have &nbsp;never had any problems with compacting now when opened have the same problem. &nbsp;Yet
 try on a PC not related to our network and they compact fine without any errors.</p>

<h2>            Windows Insider Preview 16215 fails to activate.</h2>
                    <p>Having had a catalogue of errors surrounding this, and having spent a man/day on it, I now have a PC that can't/won't activate, how do you get support in resolving this, other than having to pay for Assure, as I have been told that purchasing Assure or a
 new Product Key are the only options here, why would I purchase a new Product Key to run Windows Insider?</p>
<p>What do I have to do to resolve this.</p>

<p>Did you upgrade from a previous Insider version. Did the device have Windows 10 installed and activated previously or is this the first time you have installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>Even an Insider Preview requires a licence to activate. You can continue without activation but certain features won't wok and it may get disabled at a point in the future.</p>

            If you computer was activated download the Media Creation tool and install by opening in File Explorer and clicking on Setup.&nbsp; Them make sure you are still in the fast ring and update to 19215.<br />
You may have to use the 16193 ISO before getting 19215 to show up in Windows update.

<p>I have been running insider preview since day one.&nbsp; All was fine until update to 16215 failed, then unable to find Boot Device, hard drive was corrupted. PC was activated and still getting insider previews up to 16193, didn't get 16199.</p>
<p>Replaced boot drive and installed 16193 again, still not activated, but this time it did upgrade to 16215 but not activated.&nbsp; Tried help and was told to either buy a licence from Store or take out an Assure subscription. &nbsp; Back at the start the PC ran Windows
 7, I upgraded to Windows 10 and made this PC Insider preview with a separate Microsoft Account purely for use with that PC, at official launch of Windows 10, evaluation licence became a full licence, I could have reverted to vanilla at that stage but stayed
 with Insider Preview, not sure that was the best plan, as insider preview is starting to use up a lot of time recently.</p>
<p>Only hardware change was boot drive, but with an identical 240GB SSD, Microsoft Account was the same as before.</p>

<p>Already done that, now running 16215, but still not activated. Have logged it as a problem and a discussion in the hope someone has an answer other than buy a new copy of Windows10 or a subscription to Assure, both of which cost nearly £100, not worth it
 for a test environment and an issue caused by failing software and outwith my control.</p>

<p>A clean install should activate automatically. Do you still have your Windows 7 key.? Or what happens if you use the Activation Troubleshooter.? (if you are still signed in using the MS account that was used previously and activated)</p>
<p>By any chance has it somehow changed edition, Home to Pro or visa versa.</p>

            Unless you have a Enterprise edition it should activate instantly. I just deleted all windows partitions, reinstalled win 8.1pro and installed a 16193pro iso from USB. Win 8.1 asked to verify, so do make sure there isn't a red message on your account page
 in settings asking you to verify your machine which will send you a number to enter via txt to your phone or in a email. This can happen on a clean drive which you have.

Just as a side note you shouldn't need to install Windows 8.1 Pro but just clean install Windows 10.

<p>Hi SI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common cause for activation issues is mixing up the exact edition you are using, i.e. Home/Pro/Ent but also Single/Multi language. So make sure you got that right. I am also interested in how you go about the Install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q) Are you booting from USB/Media to do the Clean Install?</p>
<p>Q) Do you format the partition to are installing to?</p>
<p>Q) When asked, do you enter the W7/W8 product key or select skip and let WIN figure it out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, disconnect all drives (internal and external) but the one you are installing to, and if at all possible remove all partition on that disk and let the Install create new 'Recovery' and 'System' partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neilpzz is completely correct when he says that you should not have to install W8.1 first. In fact I advice against going that route. It only complicates the upgrade path and I have done many CI's of W10 directly and never had any issues with activation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely agree with you that the suggestion that you simply buy a new license is disgusting.</p>

<p>Having had a catalogue of errors surrounding this, and having spent a man/day on it, I now have a PC that can't/won't activate, how do you get support in resolving this, other than having to pay for Assure, as I have been told that purchasing Assure or a
 new Product Key are the only options here, why would I purchase a new Product Key to run Windows Insider?</p>
<p>What do I have to do to resolve this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for all of&nbsp; your input and suggestions, I have had quite a day of it.</p>
<p>Call back under get help does nothing, arrange a call under get help does nothing, in both cases they say a time when they will call but nothing happens.</p>
<p>I had tried installing from vanilla Windows 10, failed to activate, but would accept updates, weird.</p>
<p>Installed Insider Preview 16193, again failed to activate or update to 16215.</p>
<p>Eventually a chat with a technician today got me fixed, but we did have to do a clean install of 8.1 using the relevant product key, fortunately I knew where it was, and that went fine at the fourth attempt and was successfully activated as a physical key
 was used.</p>
<p>That was then upgraded to Windows 10 15063.332 and is now running and activated, I have done a full disc backup using Acronis, but cannot decide if I will go back to Insider Preview again in case I lose everything again, I will reinstall all of my software,
 take another full disc clone and at that point I will decide whether or not to jump back in to Windows Insider Preview.</p>
<p>Once again thanks for all your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>I have 40 years of experience working in IT, mostly on user/desktop support after a few years on mainframes, and have resolved all sorts of weird and wonderful issues myself in the past, but this one had me flummoxed.</p>

<p>At least your issue is solved without having to buy anything (which always was a BAD thing to even suggest).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because you might not be aware of it, quite a few have reported not being able to install 16215, due to having Acronis (and the like), so if you do decide to return to the WIP, best wait until the next build. (I think it likely that this was the cause
 in the first place)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for being flummoxed, LOL, best get used to it |--). It <em>will </em>happen again, no matter how much experience you have.</p>

<p><span>Since I “Upgraded” to Windows 7 64 bit in early November I have experienced a number of problems that primarily manifested themselves in the form of Links not reliably working
 under Internet Explorer 8. These would be links primarily internal to email on sites such as Gmail, Yahoo mail and MyWay mail. I also had problems with some links not working under PayPal and some sporadic problems on other web sites but the problems all occurred
 only when I accessed the Internet using IE8 as my browser. The problems did not occur when I used Foxfire.</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried a number of suggested “Fixes”, done numerous searches of Microsoft “Support” sites and across the Internet at various blogs and tech support sites.</span></p>
<p><span>In the past I have found the only action that temporarily solved the broken link problems was to do a clean boot and re-install Windows 7. Under Win 7, there is no option to go
 back to IE7 as IE8 is part of Win7 platform. This complete reinstall of Win7 and all my other programs worked for a few weeks then some other program would exploit vulnerability in IE8.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been able to confirm at least three items that cause IE8 to fail to function.</span></p>
<p><span>One appears to be upgrading Windows without completely removing Norton Anti Virus programs. Simply using Windows Uninstall does not remove the entire Norton related OS changes.
 The good news is that Norton has developed a program that will facilitate the complete removal of Norton related software.
</span></p>
<p><span>Another is the install and incomplete removal of Google Chrome browser. Using the Windows Uninstall on Chrome does not completely remove Chrome and there are some changes made
 to the OS by Chrome that make IE8 no longer function properly. To resolve this you will need to modify your registry and maybe do some additional OS modifications. Google knows about this problem but they have shown no interest in providing a tool for complete
 removal of Chrome and restoration of your system to pre-Chrome condition as shown by Norton. Warning. Chrome can be installed on your system if you fail to de-select the option when you load a number of other software packages. Google Earth is just one such
 package. You need to pay close attention when downloading programs to be sure they do not include Chrome as an added “benefit”.</span></p>
<p><span>There is a third program that appears (not 100% sure)
<span>&nbsp;</span>to cause problems and this is an older piece of software called Folio Viewer. This was used to view various CDs that contained reference information and data. My experience was with Family Tree Maker and Broderbund genealogical data CDs
 but I believe there are probably other programs that used this viewer. Folio is no longer supported by the vendors and they do not provide even a warning about incompatibility.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Bottom line. It has taken me some time to confirm the fix was complete as the Link not opening showed up in a number of places.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>GOOD NEWS<span>&nbsp; </span>It appears the Links Not opening problems are now all fixed. I followed the instructions posted here</span></span></strong></p>

            <p>Thanks for response. Both solutions did not solve&nbsp;my problem. I fail to understand while all programs run smoothly after installing build 15002,&nbsp; the task bar including Windows Start button become unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I have full disk backup of c drive monthly and I have been able to Disk recovery to Build 14971 where I have no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try by disconnecting all UBB /blue tooth connections including WiFi and connect internet thro cable and see the results again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT MUST come out a solution as this problem is not mine alone.</p>

            <p>The Good News I have final success in installing Build 15002 following procedure</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I recovered the Drive C to Build 14971,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I have disconnected the Blue tooth, the Second Monitor, all&nbsp;USB Connections, Wi-Fi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next the Internet Modem connected with Ethernet bypassing the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reboot the system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;allow the MS to download and install&nbsp;Build 15002&nbsp; and start the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;the system is back to normal with task bar fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RUN few apps&nbsp;to make sure the system stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reconnect Internet thro Router-Wi-Fi, connect the Blue tooth, connect all USB and the second monitor and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am back to same problem</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Updating the video driver might help resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try the driver roll back option in the device manager. To roll back to a previous version of a driver<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the device for which you want to roll back to the previous version of the driver, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Drivers </strong>tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>.</li><li>In the Driver Package rollback dialog box, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>

<h2>            Picture files won&#39;t upload to email &#40;Yahoo and Gmail&#41;, file sizes are small, never a problem before in IE 10, now there&#39;s this problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use two email services: Yahoo Mail and Gmail. Never had a problem uploading pictures from my hard drive. Same problem exists when trying to upload a photo to Facebook from my hard drive. In both mail services, the&nbsp;attachment process runs continuously (loading...
 along with a box supposedly outlining the photo), but the picture never uploads. Same with Facebook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never had this problem before with any version of IE, including IE 10. I ran the 'Fix It' utility from support.microsoft.com, but it didn't fix the problem.&nbsp; The same 'loading' message appears, but the process never completes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing there's some IE 10 setting involved, but I have no idea where to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're using new Skype on your Windows 7 computer which should be working properly since&nbsp;your device is&nbsp;supported to run this version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, please uninstall the app, then reinstall it from the Downloads center:

<h2>            Windows 10 Update fails on mSATA in secondary slot Dell E7440</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 runs great on 256GB mSATA in WWAN/mSATA slot in dell e7440.</p>
<p>All windows 10 upgrades (last 3 versions) freeze in my Dell Latitude E7440.</p>
<p>Tried upgrade via and Slow and Fast ring updates.</p>
<p>Laptop has SATA 7mm drive bay and mSATA/WWAN bootable WAN slot.</p>
<p>SATA primary can be UEFI/GPT. &nbsp;mSTATA secondary has to be MBR with legacy bios to be bootable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fails</p>
<p>Boot drive is mSATA mbr Crucial 256GB in WWAN/mSata slot with E7440 in legacy bios mode.</p>
<p>2nd drive is SATA Seagate Seagate Hybrid in drive bay configured as GPT/UEFI that was the primary drive prior to the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fails</p>
<p>Boot drive is mSATA mbr Crucial 256GB with E7440 in legacy bios mode.</p>
<p>Remove primary drive bay SATA Seagate Hybrid&nbsp;</p>
<p>freezes at 32% with drivers at 6% some time after video update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Succeeds</p>
<p>Move mSATA Crucial 256GB to E7240 mSATA (primary) and do upgrade. &nbsp;Upgrade succeeds and can move the mSata back to the E7440 and boot and operate. E7240 has no full size SATA bay. Primary is mSATA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Future attempt&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get mSTAT/STATA drive bay adapter. &nbsp;Move mSTATA into primary drive bay. &nbsp;Would still have to be legacy bios/mbr since that is how mSATA "disk" is currently configured.</p>

            <p>I suppose it should first be noted the last couple of builds have had some problems with installs.&nbsp; Some folks say .Net 3.5 is involved but I have not experience.&nbsp; You may want to wait for the next build to see if that one exhibits the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first think I do when I upgrade and OS is remove any drives which might conflict.&nbsp; And it looks like you have moved things around.&nbsp; Having both Legacy and UEFI installs may be causing some confusion.&nbsp; You must be running your system without Secure Boot
 being enabled, but this really should not be a factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PNY SD is formatted as exFAT but you don't seem to mention it.&nbsp; Any comments about why it is formatted that way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no experience with what you call WWAN so can't really comment about how it fits in drive priorities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did you decide to install the SSD in Legacy mode...?</p>

            <p>The E7440 can only boot from the mSATA slot in legacy bios mode. &nbsp;It can boot from the SATA 2.5" bay device in UEFI mode. I've tried pulling the 2.5" drive per one of the results in the first post. &nbsp;That didn't seem to have an effect.<br />
</p>
<p>I didn't pull out the PNY SD card but sort of doubt it is the issue.<br />
<br />
I'll wait for the RC and try again.</p>

</p><p>Yes. There are cases when devices are acting up and needs to be refreshed, in order to proceed with a desired function. In this case, we advise that you perform a reset on your device, to see if it would work afterwards. At the same time, this narrows down
 the potential cause of the issue.</p>

<h2>            systemew&#47;msvcp140.dll contain error. Reinstall. Error status 0xc000012F in excel</h2>
                    <p>I've looked at the online assistant and don't understand how to get started. One bit of advice is to uninstall excel. The only program I see under Programs is all of Office. It sounds dangerous to do that. From reading the other errors, this seems to be
 a common problem since the last Windows update. Is there an easier procedure I can find someplace else?</p>

<p>Hi Thuse,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the error code, I suggest you try repairing the Office referring to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?CorrelationId=1b0030f4-8cc5-4485-b495-810e2a7d1284&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair an Office application</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no help to run Repair, try uninstalling the Office by easy fix tool referring to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall Office from a PC</a>. (It’s normal if you only see Office under Program in control panel and it’s all right to uninstall the Office). Then reinstall the Office to see whether it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.Detailed description about the issue? Like when and how the issue happens.</p>
<p>2.As you have mentioned about the Windows update, does the issue occur after you update the Windows?</p>
<p>3.A screenshot of the error message for our better understanding.</p>
<p>4.A screenshot of the Excel version as below. Check it via <strong>File&gt;My Account</strong>.</p>

<p>FIX EXCEL ERROR AFTER WINDOWS UPDATE:</p>
<p>The MS help page said it might be fixable by using a tool call Repair File, or something like that. I was never able to get that tool working. It then suggested re-installing the program. I was hesitant because the offending program, Excel, is in the large
 office suite. If I screwed up the re-install perhaps I was risking losing all the programs and all my data. I got my nerve up and finally did the re-install. That worked in fixing Excel. It might help if in your instructions you tell us why it isn’t dangerous
 to do a reinstall.</p>

<p>Hi Thuse,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update and glad to hear that Excel fixed by reinstallation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we uninstall and reinstall the Office programs, the Office programs just go back to the factory default settings and you won’t lose any data as the changes only occur on the settings to your Office programs. All of the settings you have made to your
 programs such as enabling an add-in will be restored to their default settings, so there is no dangerous to reinstall Office. While a repair attempts to repair your Office programs without altering the settings that you may have configured since installing
 them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, a repair is a good first step to solve the problem as it doesn’t change the settings. If it doesn’t work, then the reinstall will be the next solution but you’ll lose all of your settings to programs. So, i suggest you try the repair tool first
 in my first reply although it doesn’t work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kimi</p>

<p>Hi MarjorieStreet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the order details you've posted the charged you've been receiving is for the
<span>Unlimited US &amp; Canada 3 months calling subscription. The only reason why you were unable to cancel the subscription is because you are signed in to a different account, most probably, the account signed in on Skype website is using your email address
 thus it created a new account that is different from the Skype name that has your calling subscription. I highly suggest to sign out and
<strong>manually sign back</strong> in using the Skype user name indicated on the order details you've received for you to cancel the subscription.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a heads up, cancellation of subscription will only cancel the recurring payment and will not incur any refund. If in any case you want it to be refunded, kindly contact our chat support team for it to be process. You may open this link for further steps

<p>Hi Jitka,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the screenshot, you are using Visio Online. We cannot insert links in a diagram in the Online version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have Visio Online Plan 2, you can download and install the Visio desktop application. Then you will have more edit options than the Online version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Office 2013 instability problems &#40;Excel, Word, Outlook&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyk5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 instability problems &#40;Excel, Word, Outlook&#41; frequent crashing on start</h2>
                    <p>I have been a long time user of Office products, since before Windows 95. &nbsp;Office 2007 was a very good version. I found it quite reliable. &nbsp;Rarely did I suffer any crashes or corruption. &nbsp;Office 365 (Office 2013) is a different story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 7, I didn't have any trouble with Office 2013. &nbsp;But then I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8.1 and our company licensing policy had me install Office 2013 on it. &nbsp;While the operating system has been performing very well, Office 2013 does
 NOT run well on this version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem? I am frequently running into crashes when attempting to start Office 2013 products, namely Word, Excel, and Outlook. Usually I get Exception code 0xc0000005 with either ntdll.dll (version: 6.3.9600.17936) or&nbsp;AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll (version:
 5.151.53.0). &nbsp;This will happen regardless of starting in "safe mode" or normal mode. &nbsp;There's tons of advice about plug-ins, but I haven't explicitly installed any. &nbsp;And doesn't safe mode disable them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I perform an on-line repair, everything will be fine. &nbsp;But then after the next Windows Update cycle, I'll run into these problems again. &nbsp;I have to launch an application 3, 4, or 5 times before it actually runs. &nbsp;And forget about double-clicking on a
 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This level of instability is extremely disturbing to my work productivity. &nbsp;I would greatly appreciate it if Microsoft would take this problem seriously, as I see plenty of other people complaining about these problems. &nbsp;The help offered is usually a "dart
 throwing" approach. &nbsp;Edit or Delete a registry entry. &nbsp;Uninstall 3rd party software. &nbsp;Completely uninstall Office and reinstall. &nbsp;Try repair. &nbsp;Plus other odds and ends advice. &nbsp;At this stage of Office 2013 and Windows 8.x maturity, there should be a reliable
 way to resolve this problem (preferably with a Windows Update, rather than requiring a customer to jump through many hoops).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can an experienced professional from Microsoft please help? &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            Well at least 2 other people marked off as having this same problem. &nbsp;I suspect we're not the only ones. &nbsp;Either there's too few people running into this problem that have solved it, or, there really is no solution right now. &nbsp;Our Office 365 is licensed
 through GoDaddy, so I'll have to try contacting them for support on this.

            <p>Thank you for posting! &nbsp;It certainly looks like some kind of upgrade glitch somewhere with Microsoft Office. &nbsp;"ntdll.dll" is a Windows system file. &nbsp;It exists there regardless of Microsoft Office. &nbsp;So, there must be some version incompatibility going on,
 in a variety of circumstances based on various testimonies I have read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had the time yet to try stripping out Office completely (I am trying to learn about what remnants are left behind so I can EFFECTIVELY purge Office completely, then start again). &nbsp;But I fear I will have to do this... as I have yet to get any useful
 help on this. &nbsp;I posted about this on another Microsoft forum and nobody has been able to help there either.</p>

            <p>OK, I finally... FINALLY figured out what was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***MICROSOFT*** &nbsp;if you are reading this, pay attention!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft offers 2 platform versions of its products: &nbsp;32bit or 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, just because you have a 64bit operating system does not mean you must install the 64bit version of software. In fact, despite Microsoft Office being offered in 32bit and 64bit versions, the 32bit version is recommended... BUT NOT REQUIRED. &nbsp;It is NOT
 explained prominently as to why you would want 32bit vs. 64bit (you have to dig to find it). &nbsp;I have learned that the 64bit version is available for users who have very large working file requirements. &nbsp;I'm not clear on what "very large" exactly is, but it
 seems to be when files are multi-hundred megabytes in size. &nbsp;This probably also comes into play when you are using the collaborative features of Office on very large document authoring projects with multiple authors involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>WHEN I FIRST INSTALLED OFFICE 365, I allowed the default settings to be used, which meant 32bit would be installed. &nbsp;Everything was fine at first. &nbsp;Where the problems arose was when I found myself MISSING PICTURE MANAGER, and wanted to install it. &nbsp;I found
 that some people were enterprising enough to figure out that the PICTURE MANGER is available as a free option with Microsoft Sharepoint 2010 viewer. &nbsp;So, I installed it. &nbsp;I didn't realize that I had downloaded the 64bit version. &nbsp;But Microsoft allowed me to
 install it. &nbsp;And it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THIS IS WHERE THINGS WENT WRONG</strong>. &nbsp;Because the intelligent Windows Updater found a conflict and decided to solve it for me without my knowledge. &nbsp;WINDOWS UPDATE or "Repair on-line" AUTOMATICALLY UPGRADED OFFICE 365 to 64bit! &nbsp;Yes... I went
 to the "About" page for each Office 365 program and found "64bit" in the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally... "MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 64bit has ISSUES". &nbsp;It apparently is an "undocumented" trade-off for being able to handle very large files. &nbsp;And well... that's when I ran into these program start problems. &nbsp;It was not a complete blockage of use, but
 the experience would be variable. &nbsp;Sometimes a double-click would launch an Office program successfully, other times even 5 double-clicks in succession wouldn't get it to launch and I'd have to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So... the upshot? &nbsp;<em><strong>Use Office 365 32bit, ALWAYS</strong></em>... unless you run into file size management issues.</p>

            <p>After a week now, I can confirm that rolling back to <strong>32bit Office 365</strong> was the cure. &nbsp;I have not had any issues with attempting to start any office products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still do not know how my system was upgraded from 32bit to 64bit Office 365. &nbsp;I can only fathom that upon doing an on-line repair that the software got confused and replaced it. &nbsp;It is the only process that was invasive enough to be accountable.</p>

            <p>MS recommends defaulting to 32 bit Office because many addon makers have not bothered to make 64 bit versions of their tools. This explicitly includes MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main criteria for switching to 64 bit Office is working with files approaching 2gb in file size or requiring aproaching 2GB of RAM when open.&nbsp; The most common case for this is large excel files that typically contain downloaded datasets and / or have
 many formulas requiring much RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how your installation switched from 32 to 64 bit.&nbsp; That does not make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry to say, but your Office installation would have been 64 bit
<strong>BEFORE</strong> you installed Picture Manager.&nbsp; All Office installers start off by checking for the presence of other office products and verify that everything is the same "bitness". If there is a conflict, the install process abends with a warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do a "purge" or "full" uninstall, download the Fix It from this link.&nbsp; It will clean out all of the miscellaneous "bits and pieces" that are lingering.</p>

<h2>            Connecting on video takes at least 3 times</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>When I am receiving a video call it doesn't connect for at least 3 times if at all.</p>
<p>So I phone them to connect and it takes at least 3 attempts but it does connect then.</p>
<p>When I press the connection symbol it doesn't look like it's connecting.</p>

            This is soo funny. The whole idea behind HTML and Standards is that it should work cross-browser. Therefore its a Microsoft product issue with Hotmail. In this is in-fact the wrong forum, but not the wrong company;-))

<h2>            Help Skype Stops Detecting my Mic after every 5 mins</h2>
                    My Skype Client (Windows 10 Desktop) has recently stopped detecting my microphone on an intermittent basis during calls. I remedy the issue by switching microphones over from the headset to the laptop's own microphone which works for a few minutes before
 my having to switch back - the only way I can conduct a call is by constantly switching microphones - has anybody else experienced this - is there anybody who can help?&nbsp;

            Have you considered using <span style="font-weight: bold">View&gt; Sidebar&gt; Document Map Pane</span> ? I believe that's what Daniel was referring to in his second bullet point.<br />
<br />
You might also consider the use of Outline View instead of Draft. You can collapse/expand the document based on Heading Levels &amp; Body Text.<br />
<br />

            <div>I hadn't noticed the switch when clicking on the TOC. I don't know why Word would switch to Print Layout View, even though it has to repaginate to take you to your destination. But there are some alternatives:</div>

<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you are using the Heading styles, there's a feature I just discovered: Press
<i>Command Option G </i>(or click on the page number at the bottom of your document's window, or select
<i>Edit &gt; Find &gt; Go To…</i>),&nbsp;select Heading on the list and then press Return. Every time you press Return, you move to the next Heading title. You can leave the
<i>Go To </i>window open to use the <i>Previous</i>&nbsp;option.</li><li>Click on the Ribbon's <i>Review</i>&nbsp;tab, then on the <i>Review</i>&nbsp;pane. Now click on the first icon (the one that looks like a page). This shows a navigation bar.</li><li>And the one I hate the most: the round button next to the bottom right corner of your document's Window.</li></ul>

<p>Hello Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are very welcome. Being a software junkie myself, the program&nbsp;<span>RollBack Rx Pro is the exact same program as
</span>Drive Vaccine PC Restore Plus. They both work exactly the same. Most likely same program, just different titles. As both of these programs exist prior to booting to windows, they will not keep up with every Insider build. As per there worth, I tested
 them in virtual machines and they both were failures in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest using something like Macrium Reflect which I believe also offers a free version, I personally use
</p>
<p>Acronis True Image Home 2018 (not pricey) to make my image backups of my system drive. Back up and running in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know Bruce if this corrects all your issues. Have a great day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Can&#39;t access &#34;Print What&#34; dialog in Powerpoint &#47; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sydney13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t access &#34;Print What&#34; dialog in Powerpoint  &#47; can&#39;t print speaker notes</h2>
                    I'm trying to print a presentation including speaker notes...the help says there should be a 'print what' dialog visible when I choose Print, and there I can select whether I want to print slides, handouts, whatever. I don't see this dialog. I can choose
 File &gt; Print...then all I see is the bare-minimum Mac print dialog, where I can choose Presets, Copies, Pages, PDF...and that's it. I don't see the page preview, there's no twist-down next to the printer name.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is driving me crazy, I've only found a couple of hints relating to Office for Mac 2004 - including force-changing permissions on the Applications / Microsoft Office folder, which didn't fix it. I've re-installed Office (from an Admin account), I've
 fixed permissions, to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other apps (e.g. Preview) are printing fine, and I also see the page preview.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not seeing the page preview makes me suspicious, it's like Powerpoint can't call up the full-blown print dialog, only the basic Mac one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on OS X 10.8.2 with all updates, I'm running Powerpoint for Mac 2011 version 14.0.0.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help appreciated!</div>
<div>cheers.</div>

            I've had this problem for over a year and it's been driving me nuts. Very frustrating, but I think I finally figured it out today: Are you running on a
<b>case-senstitive</b>&nbsp;file system?
<div><br />
<div>I have several Macs. On the ones where I initialized the boot drive as a case-sensitive file system, the print dialog does not work properly in Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. On the ones that use the default
<b>case-insensitive</b>&nbsp;file system, the print options show up as expected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For comparison:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Case Insensitive <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8755757/PowerPoint-CaseInsensitive.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I'm not using OS X 10.8, but it's obvious that something is amiss. The Print dialog is supplied by the OS in conjunction with the printer driver. The fact that you do not have the default listing for Copies &amp; Pages is a definite symptom... but it's correct
 that there is no PowerPoint listing such as is there for certain other programs -- PPT has no Print Preferences to be accessed.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first visit the mfr's web site to see if there is a more current driver for your printer. If not, use OS X System Preferences to remove then reinstall your printer. Restart the Mac before launching any apps.<br />
<br />
I believe it is possible that a corrupt preferences file may cause this sort of thing, but I find it difficult to believe that the separate preferences files for
<i>all</i> of the Office apps could go bad at the same time. That suggests that the issue is external of PPT or Office. If the above suggestion doesn't correct the problem try each of these 2 tests &amp; reply with your results:<br />
<ul>
<li>Hold Shift while you launch PPT -- Any difference in the Print dialog?</li><li>Create a new User Account then run PPT there to see if the Print dialog is correct.</li></ul>
Just for the record, reinstalling Office is rarely a fix &amp; should never be used as a 'troubleshooting' step... It's also likely to cause more trouble. The files that cause misbehavior are not a part of the installation process. If a full &amp; proper Removal is
 done first it may correct the problem, but that's like razing &amp; rebuilding a house to repair a squeaky floorboard :-)<br />
