<h2>            Poor sound &#34;quality&#34; after installation of Realtek High Definition Audio 6.0.1.7746 driver via Windows update&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When Windows 10 update automaticaly install Realtek (Realtek Semiconductor Corp 6.0.1.7746 from 18/02/2016) by publisher Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher sound is so very poor. So I uninstalled that **** driver, but again Windows automatic
 update installed it, so I searched in **** Windows 10 update to stop it, but without success, new Windows 10 update don't have a option to ignore one update so I uninstalled completely audio driver, and now I am stuck with that **** driver, and I accidentely
 deleted prevoius which was OK? So now I wish to delete not just that **** Windows update driver from Realtek, but Windows 10 too, and will like to replace Microsoft too, not just on laptop, but also on phone, because Windows Phone 10 is also peace of ****
 even bigger than Windows 10 laptop.</p>

<p>You are joking, right? When I see your "replay", it is not strange that Microsoft
<span>dying</span>. Did you read at all what I wrote? It is like robot wrote a bunch of the stupid sentences, just to wrote something, I mean, I hope you are robot which Microsoft don't pay, but when I see what (Linkedin)&nbsp;Microsoft purchased for $26 bn it is
 not strange MS Windows Phone division is dead, and Microsoft dying. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So you are sending me to update latest driver which is updated by Windows automatic update and it is clear that problem is in failed driver and it is clear that replacement for that driver still don't exist? Please leave!</p>

<h2>            win10 stuck in a loop after complete reset, no dvd or usb - everything locked behind defaultuser0</h2>
                    <p>So my son got a new computer, it has windows 10, and after the last update some days ago, no windows features worked, we tried everything we could think of, repair and check for errors. The computer said there were no errors or problems, yet no programs
 that were windows were working, like any apps or edge. Chrome worked but it couldn't download, and no games that launched via windows like minecraft would work. We did of course try a restore point, but they were all corrupted, and so I did a factory reset,
 thinking that we could go back to square 1, like i've done with so many other computers. Problem is now that its stuck on the start up after the reset, it asks for your country and language, and then asks 'why was my computer rebooted?" hinting at a network
 problem. I have tried with a LAN connection, thinking the wifi might be wonky, but it says the exact same thing - and before you ask, then I stuck the LAN cable into my computer which i am using now, and the internet is just fine, so is the cable.</p>
<p>So we did a hard reboot 3 times to enter into the menu where you can run chckdsk and repair - but everything is locked behind 'defaultuser0' and is non accessible, I have scoured the net for a solution and the defaultuser0 seems to be a bug that some suffers
 with, so this is not a password issue, cause there IS no password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no dvd (the computer doesn't have a dvd port to begin with) and there is no dongle that i know of, I was not with him when he bought the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am leaning towards a hardware issue, but I don't know since I can't run any type of diagnostics tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But is the only solution really to find a different win10 ISO file on a dongle, because that is going to be difficult - Or should I just give up and hand it over to a repair shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if I am repeating something others said before me, but I seem to have two problems in one, both the reboot sequence and the defaultuser0 bug.&nbsp;</p>

            Edit: As a last ditch effort we tried to circumvent the internet, and while the bootup changed a little and asked us which internet we wanted to use, and we got the option to skip this - But ultimately it did exactly the same loop.&nbsp;

            <p><span><span>Hi S</span></span>hahadat<span><span>,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I can understand, how frustrating it can be, when things don’t work as expected.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I'd be glad to help you.</span></span><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur, if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen,
 when your PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your computer crashes with a Blue Screen Of Death (or BSOD) the events leading up to the crash are held in memory, until you restart your computer, when they are written to a file (called a DMP file).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For more information, refer to the link, mentioned below, to fix your issue with blue screen errors:</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
So we&nbsp;progress in the right direction;<br />
<br />
When you say "getting messages saying hd memory too low on drive C"<br />
<br />
Do you mean you get the message <strong>Your system is low on virtual memory. </strong>
or<strong> You are running out of disk space on C:</strong> ?<br />
<br />
You also state the original drive was 10gb, has that been replaced? If so with what?<br />
<br />
<br />
Applications you have installed will also use disk space, Clean up what you dont need in Control Panel-&gt; Add/Remove Programs<br />
<br />
<br />
Run a disk cleanup: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310312</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Please try to give information specific&nbsp;to the problem where you can.<br />
<br />
Thanks,

    <title>Xbox one game streaming lag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randelrandel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one game streaming lag</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I test the game streaming function on the Xbox App I get a 'very high' result, but when I start streaming and play the Xbox games on my laptop I get a lot of lag. Sometimes the App even tells me I have 'network quality problems' even when I set the
 quality on 'low'.&nbsp;Tried to play COD AW multiplayer and that's just not possible because it feels like I'm always 1 second behind. Yesterday I had some fun playing 'Defence Grid' streaming to my laptop but it stutters both in&nbsp;video and audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the lag normal or is there anything I can do to make it stream smooth ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Been to the trouble shooting page and nothing on there that's helpful to me. I used to have a wireless network&nbsp;and the streaming then&nbsp;was even worse, it was unplayable. Then I bought an ASUS AC&nbsp;router but that didn't help. Then I was told that I needed a
 wired connection what made me feel really disappointed. </p>

            This feature has been broke for about a year now and Microsoft don't care to fix it. I run on a 5ghz network and even went out of the way for a local connection and still get this error. They just want you to come to the site and post what's wrong to make
 you feel like your getting somewhere. That's why this will be the last xbox I own! I should have stayed with ps4 atleast their remote play works.

            After some time I think I have found a fix for this issue. Just a fyi don't listen to what Microsoft says. I found by resetting the xbox to factory default like it came out of the box should fix the issue. You shouldn't have to delete your saved files
 and your games will still be their, they would just have to resync. I could get it to play with a wired connection and running almost everything at high and mp games online depending on the game would run at medium. I can say Overwatch runs at high with no
 issues at all but Gears of War 4 needs to be at medium. Sorry for the wall of text but hope this helps!&nbsp;

<p>There is nothing you can do unless you established that name somewhere else before them, it's highly possible they now own the copyright to it.</p>
<p>On a side note, what does it matter that a company is making a profit using that name, perhaps they have no idea who you are at all.</p>
<p>Also, 6 years? I thought spaces in tags where added like 3-4 years ago? But I could be very wrong on that one</p>

<p>Pretty much nothing. You'd have to have copyrighted the phrase before anyone else used it. You'd probably want to discuss trademark infringement before copyrights. So unless you copyrighted and trademarked yourself. Since you've had it so long the company
 couldn't force you to change it is about the only 'right' you'd have.</p>

<h2>            purchasing a season pass for a TV show on Xbox video question.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just a quick question? If I were to buy for example a season pass for game of thrones season 3, what &nbsp;does that get me? Do I own the season for good after the season? Or do I only have limited time to watch it? I can't seem to find an answer. Orginally I
 wanted to buy the season on my Xbox one but it only allows me to buy the season pass for 39 dollars. I am not spending that money if I do not permanently own it after all episodes are finished. I want to make sure I'm not paying that price for a limited time
 of viewing. Thanks.</p>

<p>Just so you're aware ... I jumped in and bought it quick and you don't get anything in return but a trailer. Hold off for now otherwise you'll end up out $40 and only have about 1:30 to show for it.

<h3> kornfeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forced to restart computer to reestablish Internet connection</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, at least once or twice a day, my Internet connection will drop, and I'll have to restart my computer to get online again.&nbsp; Invariably, when I restart, I'm able to reconnect.&nbsp; But if instead I try to "Diagnose and repair" my connection, or try to disable
 and then re-enable it, my computer will hang up, and I'll have to manually power down and power back on.</p>
<p>I don't think the issue is with my **** cable modem from Comcast, because I am invariably able to reconnect, so long as I restart when the connection drops and the little yellow triangle symbol with the exclamation point shows up.</p>
<p>This is a fairly new problem; it didn't start happening 'til a couple of months ago, and I've had the computer for almost three years.</p>
<p>I'm running Vista Ultimate Service Pack 2 32-bit on a Dell Latitude D630.&nbsp; My network-card driver is up-to-date.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this problem would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Many thanks.</p>

 error message you get when you are unable to connect to internet?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are

<p><span>Make sure that the option’’ Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power” is unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span>1.Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In device manager, expand the network drivers listed in the device list.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Power management , uncheck the option “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If it doesn’t help, reset the modem by unplugging it, waiting at least 10 seconds, and then plugging it back in.
</span></p>
<p><span>1. Switch off the router.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Unplug the cables.</span></p>

<h2>            Driver issue in Windows 10 in HP ab522tx</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I purchased a HP ab522tx pavilion laptop in February. I was regularly getting an Intel driver error. This comes up all of a sudden, the lappy hangs, sometimes there's a black screen for a few seconds too. In the first few days it used to say driver for windows
 8 but after the update the errors are still there but no windows 8 is written. I have contacted the HP customer support multiple times, they even took the lappy in control via remote but nothing happened. They gave me a ftp link to download the drivers, which
 I did but when I was to install them the drivers from the link , the installer file had outdated versions than the versions in the lappy. Kindly check the screenshots.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HP said that there's some issue with the motherboard and they replaced it but still the issue was there. I contacted Intel, first they told me this-</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I understand that you have the 6th generation of the Intel HD 520 graphics and Windows 10, and there is an error message that appears several times stating that the Intel graphics driver has stopped working and recovered. First I want to let you know
 that this is a known issue that appeared with the last Microsoft Update in November for Windows 10, as you can see at:
</em>http://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-november-update-issues-bugs<em> Also we have a link with the information about this same general problem error message:
</em>http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/graphics-drivers/000005482.html&nbsp;
<em>But Microsoft has release a new Intel graphics driver package that has been working very well fixing this “stopped and recovery” error message. So as troubleshooting steps, the first thing I will suggest to try is uninstalling the current driver you have,
 but from device manager as follows: on the keyboard let’s press WinLogo key + r, then type in devmgmt.msc, double click on Display Adapters&gt;&gt;Intel HD Graphics&gt;&gt;Driver tab&gt;&gt;Uninstall&gt;&gt;Select the check box Delete the driver software for this device&gt;&gt;OK, restart
 the computer. Once the computer has been restarted, Windows 10 will try to apply a new Intel graphics driver which is their new package, if it does not do it automatically run the Microsoft Windows 10 update tool =&gt; select the Start button , then select Settings
 &gt; Update &amp; security &gt;Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. If the Windows 10 latest update does not fix the problem, you can use the latest Intel graphics driver for your configuration (you might need to uninstall the driver again if an error message appears
 when attempting to install the generic Intel graphics driver we have): <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25818/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-7-8-1-10-15-40-?product=88345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download Intel Graphics Driver for Windows 7/8.1/10* [15.40</a></em><br />
<br />
So, I uninstalled Intel's driver and tried installing the one's downloaded from Intel's website. When I restarted the pc the light was so bright even at the lowest brightness settings. Then I got these errors-<br />
<br />
<a href="http://oi67.tinypic.com/23sf394.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi67.tinypic.com/23sf394.jpg</a><br />

<br />
<a href="http://oi66.tinypic.com/judf8h.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi66.tinypic.com/judf8h.jpg</a><br />
<br />
After this, the lappy said that the drivers are not installed, install from the dump installer file or something. I clicked yes so it has installed the drivers from the setup that came with the lappy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Intel have told me that HP customizes their drivers for HP laptops that is why I was getting a non-compatible error when I was trying to install the generic Intel driver for the Graphic card.</p>
<p>
My unit was replaced with a new one after 4 months today. Can you believe 4 months of harassment by HP? I didn't install anything except Firefox. The Win 10 auto update was running and then I got the same error as I used to get in the old unit. Please note
 that no error was there before the update i.e. before connecting it to the internet after the unboxing. I got two errors, was able to take the screenshot of the second one
<a href="http://oi67.tinypic.com/vdmiu.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi67.tinypic.com/vdmiu.jpg</a> the first one said these same lines
<a href="http://oi68.tinypic.com/34gt3s9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi68.tinypic.com/34gt3s9.jpg</a><br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
Another error, just check the time. It's a brand new unit <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.digit.in%2fimages%2fsmilies%2ficon_sad.gif" /><br />
<br />
<a href="http://oi63.tinypic.com/2iuynmv.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi63.tinypic.com/2iuynmv.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Some other errors-<br />
<br />
<a href="http://oi66.tinypic.com/311mb1y.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi66.tinypic.com/311mb1y.jpg</a><br />

<a href="http://oi66.tinypic.com/311mb1y.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi66.tinypic.com/311mb1y.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<br />
This one is by MS-<br />
<br />
<a href="http://oi66.tinypic.com/htb9fr.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi66.tinypic.com/htb9fr.jpg</a><br />
<br />
The laptop didn't start after the above error, waited on the black screen for 2 minutes, then manually turned it off and then turned on. The booting time has increased now considerably.<br />
<br />
This laptop and the one before were from the same batch, even the serial number of this one has the last two digits changed as compared to the older one.<br />
<br />
I might be wrong, but it looks like MS updated the drivers of Intel from Intel's website which is causing the problems. Since HP uses customized drivers for its systems so that might be causing those errors.
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You need to use a dvd authoring programme to burn to the dvd.&nbsp; Windows does not natively see dvds in burners with XP.<br />
With your burner you should have had some software, something like nero or roxio. Follow the wizard to burn a video-dvd.<br />
If you just bought a bare drive then you either need to buy a programme, there are lots, or serach on line for freeware, but make sure it is dvd authoring - which makes a dvd that will play in a dvd player, than straight dvd burning which will make a data dvd
 and won't play in a dvd player.<br />

The burner came with Nero. The wizard continues to&nbsp;ask for a writeable DVD.&nbsp;I have used the MS Fix-it, to no avail. Is the problem with Windows Movie Maker? Since I took so much time to create the video, I am trying to burn it to a DVD. Should I just give up
 and&nbsp;recreate the video with Nero? This is very frustrating because I&nbsp;have no clue... thanks for your help!&nbsp;

            It has nothing to do with movie maker.<br />
<br />
IS your new drive an internal one?<br />
Just double check it is connected properly with the power cable and data cable firmly pushed into place.<br />
<br />
Does the drive show up in my computer?<br />
Does the drive play a music cd ok?<br />
This would tell us it is connected properly.<br />
<br />
Check this as well, it's been an age since I've refered to it and can't remember if it affects dvd recording as well.<br />
http://www.myvideoproblems.com/Tutorials/EnableCdRecording.htm<br />
<br />
What make of disc are you using?<br />
Have you got any other makes to try?<br />

<p>Hi Armyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various factors why sound may disconnect while using wireless headphone. It can be due to outdated sound drivers or corruptions. To better isolate your concern, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes before this issue occur?</li><li>Have you tried updating you sound drivers?</li><li>Have you tried using another headphone and check if the issue still persist?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run the troubleshooter for Hardware and Devices. This will identify and diagnose technical issues. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> on your keyboard and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>On the upper right part of the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, type <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> and follow the prompt to proceed with the troubleshooter.</li><li>Restart your PC and check if the issue still persist.</li></ol>

            Hi  satvirsingh1
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Did you check to make sure the Hindi language is installed?
<br />
<br />Add a TTS voice to your PC
<br />
<br />To use one of these voices, add it to your PC:
<br />
<br />    Select the Start  button, then select Settings  &gt; Time &amp; Language &gt; Language.
<br />    Select  Add a language and search for the language you want to add. Languages that have a TTS voice available have a Narrator (Text-to-speech) icon  next to them. Choose a language that has a TTS voice available, and select Next. 
<br />    Select the check boxes to indicate if you want to read Windows in that language (Windows display language), let Windows recognize speech or handwriting in that language, and more. Then, select Install.
<br />    Select the new language, then select Options. If needed, select the Download buttons under Language pack and Speech.
<br />
<br />Once the language is downloaded, go to Settings  &gt; Ease of Access  &gt; Narrator. Under Choose a voice, select the voice you want to use.

    <title>Windows Server 2008 Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bkingb2605  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Server 2008 Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows Server 2008.&nbsp; Recently, the machine booted to a black screen before I could ever log in.&nbsp; All I see is a black screen and a mouse pointer.&nbsp; Anyhow, I tried to run sfc/scannow&nbsp; from the command prompt&nbsp;and I keep getting a message that says
 "Ther is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete.&nbsp; Restart windows and run sfc again"&nbsp; Problem is, it will not reboot, and it will not allow me to run sfc period.&nbsp; Is there a way to kill this supposed scan already running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am wondering if there are any other ideas on how I might procede to fix the black screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loaded software that was supposed to be an OPC Server package.&nbsp; When I was done, others were no longer able to RDP into the server.&nbsp; They were getting the black screen.&nbsp; HAving never seen one before, I decided to try to reboot to fix the issue.&nbsp; It now
 boots directly ot the black screen, does not load windows and will do nothing beyond that.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciate.</p>

<h2>            I need help what I should do with a Windows 8 hiberfil.sys file that is taking up 51.1Gb on my 120Gb SSD</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I need help with what I should do with a 51.1Gb hiberfil.sys file - shown when running a sniffer program.&nbsp; Currently my C drive is showing in the red as it has less than 10Gb free.&nbsp; Without knowing much, a little research leads me to believe there is a connection
 between the size of this file and the amount of installed RAM I have.&nbsp; I have 64GB of installed RAM on a Windows 8 system.&nbsp; I have this because I use Adobe After Effects which is memory hungry.&nbsp; I would really appreciate some prompt help as I started the day
 with less than 2Gb free.&nbsp; My system is an i7 3820 running the 64Gb RAM - main drive is the 120Gb SSD, I have a 60Gb SSD for caching my Adobe programs and then large drives, both internal and external for storage.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your consideration of my problem.<br />
<br />
Mandy<br />

            <p>You are right the hibernate file is set to 75% the size of your RAM. Have a look at this web page :-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to reduce the&nbsp; % size and as lots of Windows 8 machines are running on way less ram you should have a fair amount of lee way.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps on downloading something</h2>
                    <p>My OS is Windows 10 Home single language Version 1703 Build 15063.0</p>
<p>This &nbsp;is downloading something always.</p>
<p>I checked taskman explorer.exe and svchost.exe is the one thats downloading something.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Is my data is being stealing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used windows firewall to block all connection with these both explorer.exe and svchost.exe.</p>
<p>Is this good?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before blocking this connection. when &nbsp;i go to windows updates to download some cummulative security updates, there is no progress in the download ,it remains in 1 percentage (i check whole night). But something was going on downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above mentioned OS i updates just yesterday. After this i have this problem.</p>

<h3> stuart.rankin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lifecam HD-3000 Software installation doesn&#39;t seem correct</h2>
                    I just bought a Lifecam HD-3000 for my Win8 64 system. (My system has 32GB ram and &gt;2.5TB disk space available and has an i7 Core Extreme.) No software came with the hardware. I downloaded the software (version 4.25) from Microsoft and installed it. There
 were no errors shown from installation. (When I look at the Device Manager, under "Imaging devices", I see "Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 and there are no yellow bangs on the icon.) My question is: is there any software from Microsoft that will let me see the
 live view from the camera? Nothing was installed in the start menu (or the Win8 start page). In \program files (x86)\microsoft lifecam, I see two executables: LifeEnC2.exe and LifeTray.exe. Double-clicking LifeTray.exe produces no results (when I look at the
 task manager, there are no tasks that appear to be related to LifeTray.exe). If I double-click LifeEnC2, a task starts (and is visible in task manager) but nothing appears on my screen, so I suspect whatever LifeEnC2 is, it's not what I'm looking for. Do I
 need to download other software from Microsoft? Third party software? (I have no intention of using the camera for chat, so such a program really isn't a resolution for me.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suspect I'm missing something obvious but for the life of me can't figure out what. (I've looked through Microsoft's support sites but they talk more about installations with failure messages. No where does it say how to use the LifeCam, unfortunately.
 The one link that talks about installing the software merely goes to a generic Microsoft "buy our hardware" page.)</div>

Hello Stuart...</p>

<p>I have the very same issue.. The LifeCam worked fine under Windows XP, but after moving it to my Windows 8 machine, I'm seeing the same symptoms as you.. Hopefully someone will have some input..</p>

Hi Stuart..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I figured it out... The install put a tile on the "start" page. It was all of the way to the right off of the screen, so I had to scroll to it.. It's called LifeCam... Swipe from the upper right corner and you'll see the "start" page..</p>

            My lifecam 3000 installed fine on a usb3.0 port on my win 7 64bit PC and appeared in devices &amp; printers and device manager and worked with other software. &nbsp;... for a day or so... then disappeared. &nbsp;Everything I tried and all the research on the internet
 gives no solution. &nbsp;Is it the Microsoft Lifecam or Microsoft windows 7 64 bit OS that is junk? &nbsp;You would think that as both are Microsoft logo'sd products that they would play well together! &nbsp; I hope a Microsoft salaried employee can find it in his/her heart
 to tackle this task that appears to have been a PITA since march 2013!!!!! &nbsp;BTW: I tried same of USB 2.0 port too w/same inexplicable eventuality....

            I eventually gave up on using Lifecams on Windows systems. I connected a Kinnect successfully, though - they're more expensive unfortunately. The funny thing is I took the Lifecam that started this entire discussion and plugged it into my Mac Mini (OS
 10.9). It just worked. Irony abounds...
