<p>hi patrickmolstad,</p>
<p>to narrow down the issue you encountered, i’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1. about “when i try to add user or make resource like a meeting room i get the error 500 internal server error”, may i know if the created user is able to send emails and if the meeting with the room mailbox can be set up properly?<br />
2. try removing the license of the new user and then re-assigning it to the user to see if the issue persists.<br />
3. did other admin accounts encounter the same issue?<br />
4. try another network environment(like home) to see if the issue persists.<br />
5. have you tried other browsers to see if it helps? if no, try it and share the result with us.<br />
6. please provide the screenshot about the error message when setting meeting with room mailboxes. to upload a picture, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click <strong>insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>

<h3> wkcook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old Office Files</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong></p>
<p>A security scan indicates&nbsp;the vulnerability "Microsoft Windows GDI+ Multiple Vulnerabilities (954593) - Office XP" based on the presence of the following file:</p>
<p><u><em>C:\Program Files\Common Files\MicrosoftShared\Office10\mso.dll</em></u></p>
<p>The tested value was v10.0.6844.0 but it found v10.0.2625.0.&nbsp; Per SCCM the system is patched.</p>
<p>Windows 7, SP1, with the following Office products:</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Visio 2010<br />
Microsoft Office Project Professional 2007 12.0.6425.1000<br />
Microsoft Office Project 2007 Service Pack 2 (SP2)<br />
Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2007 12.0.6425.1000<br />
2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)</p>
<p>I checked the MicrosoftShared folder and found three (3) versions of MSO.DLL in Office10, Office11, &amp; Office14 folders.</p>
<p><strong><u>Question:</u></strong></p>
<p>How can I clean up these systems?&nbsp; Is this version of the MSO.DLL required?&nbsp; How can I tell?&nbsp; I could always uninstall Office 2007, Project, Visio 2010,&nbsp;and Communicator, remove the folders, and re-install everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of overkill and VERY time consuming.&nbsp;
 Is there a tool to cleanup unused Office files/folders?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that is more than one question but I have to mitigate this vulnerability to the satisfaction of my superiors.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

            It appears that at sometime this PC had installed Office 10 (Office XP). When that application was removed the Office 10 folder in Microsoft Shared was left behind (perhaps because the DLL file was in use when the application was uninstalled).<br />
<br />
This file is not used by any of the installed Office systems that you have listed, each of which will have its own. You can either ignore it - which is probably the wisest policy, or delete the complete folder.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling Office 2007 will not affect it at all.<br />
<br />
You do however state that you have folders for Office 11 (Office 2003) and Office 14 (Office 2010) but no mention of Office 12 (Office 2007)? Was this a typo?<br />

    <title>STill no help from receiving emails from charter.net - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angel61222  say:</h3>
<h2>            STill no help from receiving emails from charter.net</h2>
                    <p>I have had a couple responses from the MODS but no help yet!</p>
<p>Here is the run down again! Please MODS read my whole post before you reply&nbsp; to this</p>
<p>I get mail from all carriers EXCEPT for Charter.net I can send an email to Charter.net but Can NOT recieve them, further more, this is an ongoing problem with everyone I have talked to that has hotmail and a friend/friends with Charter.net so this has nothing
 to do with my hotmail settings at all. I have not changed any settings or done anything different than I have in well can't remember when I last changed settings. but still has nothing to do with me, this is a global problem it is like hotmail VS charter.net
 and no one can give me any answers, is hotmail even looking in to this or are we all being pacified by a few responses because it has got out of hand?</p>
<p>Here is what happened in the beginning:</p>
<p>My friend who has charter.net was and always has been on my contact list and safe senders list- But her emails started going into my junk folder for some reason then I would click NOT JUNK and put it in hotmail, it still continued that way then about 2 weeks
 ago noticed I was not getting any responses back from her and called and asked her if she had recieved my emails she said yes and that she had been sending me emails every day, which I was not getting. She then checked with her other friends ( 3) of them and
 found out they also were not getting any of her emails. At first she said she was not getting any error messages showing nothing had been received but this week, about 2 days ago she started getting "UNDELIVERABLE" MESSAGES.
</p>
<p>I opened up a Gmail acc so I could get her mail with no problmes she continued to send me email to both my gmail and hotmail to see if I would ever get it in my hotmail. Still not happening!</p>
<p>I also got on my FB page and asked if any one had hotmail or charter and been having problems getting mail from charter if they had hotmail or if they had charter and been told that there e-mails were not being received.&nbsp; I got about 10 responses all saying
 yes same problem some didn't know they had that problem until I pointed it out then after some investagating found out that yes they too had the same problem.</p>
<p>Also when I went to go to my earlier post on this I couldn't find it except in my private mail, the previous post on this was not set to private just some sensitve information to the mods was.</p>
<p>Question" When will this be fixed and what steps are being taking to fix this?????????</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have read your entire post and who ever is the cause this cannot be resolved at this level. My suspicion is this is local to your area and some server on Chaarter has been put on a black list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again no matter what the issue is it not systemic and I have only seen a handful of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you give us the headers of a bounce message we can identify the IP and find whether that server is being blacklisted.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div><span>In order for us to further investigate this issue, we would like you to verify how are you accessing your email account? is it via we browser or mail client? Also, please provide us the affected email account
 and the complete bounce message (or error message) you've received so we can determine the root cause of this issue. To do so, please follow the steps below:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p>1. Right-click the bounce message on your Inbox.</p>
<p>2. Choose the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>View message source</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>option on the dropdown menu. You will be seeing a new window containing the e-mail message headers and its content.</p>
<p>After doing so, kindly post the message source with all the components of the bounce message such as:</p>
<p>&gt; Final-Recipient</p>
<p>&gt; Action</p>
<p>&gt; Status</p>
<p>&gt; Diagnostic-Code</p>
<p />

            <p>Zig zag, I am not trying to be argumentative here but if you HAD read all of my message you would see that it is not me getting the emails back with a bounce or error so I wouldn't be able to give you the headers of the bounced message, She (my friend) recieves
 mine just fine, I do not get anything from her bounced or otherwise, what she gets is when she sends me a email it comes back to her saying underliverable. so how do you propose I get you a copy of my friends bounced messaged???</p>
<p>Further more it is more than my area and more than a handful as I stated this too, many friends and friends with friends.</p>
<p>And... not just this area, here in Oregon, california and Kentucky.</p>
<p>so now what? I can give you my friends email acc which again is charter.net and they also told her it is not anything to do with them it is a hotmail problem but if you would like to contact her then I can send you her email in a private message if you would
 like other wise I have no messages that are bounced to give you as I stated several times because she gets mine just fine. Nothing comes back when I send her one that is why I think it is a hotmail problem because charter allows her to receive mine, I just
 can't receive hers almost like hotmail is blocking all charter.net mail. We have been emailing each other for 4 years using the same method and emails but just 2 weeks ago it all changed.</p>
<p>I do have charter as my internet/tv/phone service,&nbsp; but do not use charter mail. My other friends with hotmail do not use charter for anything and still do not recieve emails from friends with charter.net</p>
<p>I use client based emails I believe. </p>
<p>BEFORE I GOT SENT THIS OFF I HAD PUT IN A ANOTHER CALL TO CHARTER TO SEE WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY AND SEE IF ANY THING CHANGED,. THEY SAID THEY HAVE HAD SOME CALLS AND HAVE CHECKED INTO TO IT AND IT IS NOT A PROBLEM ON THERE END. I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE BLACKLIST
 PROBLEM YOU MENTIONED AND HE SAID WHY WOULD THEY BLACKLIST THEM SELVES, THAT, THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO BLACKLIST THEMSELVES.&nbsp; HOTMAIL IS BLOCKING ALL MAIL FROM CHARTER, CHARTER IS NOT BLOCKING MAIL FROM HOTMAIL SO DOESN'T IS MAKE SENSE THAT IT IS A HOTMAIL
 PROBLEM? IF HOTMAIL THINKS THAT CHARTER IS SENDING OUT SPAM AND BLOCKING THEM WHY DON'T THEY BLOCK YAHOO. AND GMAIL AS WELL BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE BULK OF MY SPAM COMES FROM NEVER HAD I HAD SPAM FROM A CHARTER.NET E-MAIL BEFORE.
</p>
<p>So that being said, how do I contact hotmail directly? I know you are here to help but you are only guessing at stuff and don't really know what the problem is so can you please give me the information I need to contact them directly.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understood that completely the first time.&nbsp; Perhaps I was unclear.&nbsp; I am fairly sure you have contact by other means with those whose charter mail is not getting to you.&nbsp; I was asking if they could forward you a message so we can get the headers, determine
 the IP of the rejecting server and perhaps proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or we can continue to discuss this here where no results are possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as to Charter.&nbsp; The person you spoke to either misunderstood or doesnt understand the problem.&nbsp; Charter is not blocking themselves but perhaps they are being blocked by Spamcop, spamhaus, or some other list and MS would then block Charters ability to
 drop email at an MS server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said it isnt wide spread, though I suspect quite annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you some background.&nbsp; This is a peer to peer site staffed mostly by volunteers (like me) who have little or no contact with Microsoft and zero influence with them.&nbsp; We dont have access to your account, and cannot check the MS servers to see if
 they are blocking Charter BUT since I do this for a living elsewhere (and have for decades) I do know how to check to see if charter is being blacklisted.&nbsp; I just need the IP</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying, I had no Idea what you wanted. As you can understand this is all pretty frustrating on my part, between coming here for the last 2 weeks talking to different people and MODS trying to figure this out and talking to charter im about
 ready to pull my hair out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I def want to get this taken care of so we dont' have to keep going back and forth that is my main goal, may not be wide spread but it isnt just locally as I said ky, Ca and Portland, so that part is confusing I would guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after getting your last post I called Charter yet again and got a different person and told asked them about spam cop ect,... They say no not them and that hotmail is the one doing the blocking. UGH!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok so now how do I forward you my friends email that she sends to me in my G-Mail account? I can't forward it to my Hotmail because hotmail won't let me.&nbsp; Please explain to me because I haven't got a clue how to go around that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you and others know that the problems has been fixed.&nbsp; My friend who finally was able to get in touch with some one at hotmail figured out the problem just as I suspected it was hotmail not charter. so I want to thank you and every one
 for taking the time to try to fix this. Just wish It would of been sooner but at least it is fixed now.</p>

<p><strong><span>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</span></strong><span>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install
 the updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero, Suitcase, 3<sup>rd</sup> party font management tools or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes and unwanted misbehavior unless you also update your add-ins to the latest
 update. <strong>Install updates for these programs if you have them. </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is possible that because your install is so far behind in updates that AutoUpdate itself is too old to work. If you can't update using the above instructions, download a fresh copy of the current version of AutoUpdate from
 this link and then let it do its thing when it launches.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 install stops after 24&#37; completion - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 install stops after 24&#37; completion</h2>
                    I have tried several versions of 10 available through the insider program, and now finally the public release. I received the link from MS last night. Same problem. The install stops after 24% completion, and the only message I get is "something happened"
 "installation Failed". Ridiculous. I have all the updates I need. I have run utilities. I have more than enough space. 8gb RAM. dual core Intel. I never did get the icon in the notification area. I ran utility to fix that several times, reboot, etc. etc.,
 and it did not work. No matter what I do, same problem. I tried installing from USB, CD-ROM, and hard drive, same results. The download and install tool I got from MS last night ---same result.&nbsp;

            <p>I have done the same, except on multiple devices and they all have 'something happened' - 'Windows 10 installation has failed' after I downloaded the ISO and tried installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the media creation tool on the devices with the upgrade now option, 'Something happened'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the language packs, doesn't work.</p>
<p>Unplugging devices? Nope.</p>
<p>Updates? All the latest</p>
<p>Turning off some services? Doesn't work.</p>
<p>Antivirus? Nope</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a company that writes software to manage my computer, I am very skeptical about staying with Windows. Linux distros are perfectly good and non-invasive.</p>

Thank you for posting here in the Microsoft Account forums and we apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p><br />
I understand that; [A] you want to know why you are re-directed to <strong>https://blu175.mail.live.com/default.aspx?id=64855&nbsp;</strong> and; [B] you are unable to check your mails.</p>
<p><br />
[A] This <strong>https://blu175.mail.live.com</strong> is the server where your account profile/account mailbox reside. All Outlook.com accounts gets redirected to the corresponding server after signing in to the
<a href="http://Outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Outlook.com</strong></a> sign in page.</p>
<p><br />
[B] When you say you are unable to check your mails, did you have issues viewing/reading your mails or are you unable to receive them? Could you give more details on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Roland</p>

    <title>Problem opening .docx in Office 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian nathan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem opening .docx in Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I attempt to open a Word file with the .docx extension I get the following alert, yet the file still opens. This does not happen with .doc or .odt files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The was a problem sending the command to the program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted both the local and on-line repair options to no avail. I have even reinstalled Office 2013 but the problem persists. I attempted one of the fixes from the link below but there wasn't a Compatibility tab under the properties for winword.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/word-2013-there-was-a-problem-sending-the-command/353d686c-43d6-478d-a2d8-0ce016641a12">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/word-2013-there-was-a-problem-sending-the-command/353d686c-43d6-478d-a2d8-0ce016641a12</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I get the error even though the file does open. It's more irritating than anything else but it only happens for Word and not Excel, Powerpoint, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happened to me after upgrading from 9860 to 9879 via Software Update, and I had to do a clean install... Now works... AOK...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In you case, a quick test: press the Windows key, go to System, right-click on Cmd and choose "Open as administrator". If you get an error message, you're in for a reinstall.

<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8.1 on a PC, Windows 7 on another in a virtual machine, and in both cases, trying to move or delete, say, system files, will result in the same message you get. It's just a warning that you are about to do something that could endanger your

<p>This has been working fine for a long time, nothing has changed recently on either the Office accounts or the exchange host.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two of my coworkers now have problems with their local installs of Outlook.&nbsp; Nothing is wrong with the exchange host (and everything works fine on their phones and on a test setup on a different computer).</p>
<p><strong>Instead of connecting to our exchange server, Outlook now connects to their Office 365 accounts.</strong></p>
<p>For example, one of them sent me two emails on Monday, which did not deliver to my exchange inbox, instead I can see them if I log in to Office.com and go to the web version of Outlook.&nbsp; They're the only things in that webpage, it's not a clone of my non-microsoft
 exchange inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the File menu on Outlook on those two machines the "Access this account on the web" link is pointing to Outlook.Office365.com.&nbsp; On my own computer it properly points to our exchange host.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting and re-adding the email accounts in Outlook, using autodiscover to find the info for the exchange host.&nbsp; They just revert back to trying to use Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of those users recently stated using Skype for Business through their Office 365 accounts, but that was a few weeks ago and the email issues started only two days ago, and people who also recently stated up Skype have no similar outlook problems, so
 it seems particular to these two installs.&nbsp; I just mention it if it's relevant, maybe some feature like right-clicking on Skype and initiating an email from there broke this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What told Outlook to start using the office365 servers instead of the non-microsoft exchange account?&nbsp; and how do I undo this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

            Hi CB(42),<br />
<br />
May I know which kind of environment do you have set up, is it Hybrid deployment or simple domain sharing for SMTP email addresses? Could you please provide us with the detailed information about this.<br />
<br />
Where the users mailbox located in On-premise Exchange server or in the Exchange Online cloud?<br />
<br />
Are those two Office 365 users able to send/receive email via using Outlook desktop client and Outlook Web App without any issue?<br />
<br />
When you say “<em>Outlook on those two machines the "Access this account on the web" link is pointing to Outlook.Office365.com</em>”, make sure that whether the users mailbox are migrated to Office 365 Exchange Online.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<p>Hello Shymal, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure how to answer some of those questions, let me try my best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our email is on an Exchange server hosted remotely by a cloud provider.&nbsp; They also handle our webpage and some cloud databases.&nbsp; So it's not SMTP.&nbsp; I don't know how Exchange is configured on their end, but everything they host is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone can use the outlook web app hosted by our email provider.&nbsp; This is an address of connect.em###.com/owa (at the provider's domain).&nbsp; That should be the address on the Outlook file menu where it says "access this account on the web".</p>
<p>On the two trouble computers, the outlook file menu instead says to go to outlook.office365.com/owa<em>/</em>fr###.com (the last being our own domain).</p>
<p>When I go to that office365 web app, it accepts my office account login, and it has the emails those users have sent me in the past few days and nothing else.&nbsp; That's what I expect to see there - everything else of mine is at our email provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble is Outlook using the office365 domain for these two users.&nbsp; I think that's how the emails from them went to my own office365 account, because outlook was connected to that domain when the users sent me mail.</p>
<p>So if it's the answer to your question, the users are able to send and receive through outlook desktop, but they go to the wrong email host.&nbsp; Outlook is "working" to the extent it sends/receives OK, it's just got the wrong exchange settings and I can't get
 it to use the right ones.</p>
<p>I tested if it was the user's email accounts themselves.&nbsp; I set up outlook on a new machine and was able to take one of these two accounts and it autodiscovered all settings at our email provider, not at office365.&nbsp; So this looks to be something outlook
 or windows is doing on their machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To your last question, no user mailboxes are migrated to office365, nor do we intend for them to be.</p>
<p>Outlook is insisting on using an office365 domain that we never set up - no changes made on these two machines, no changes made to our office accounts.</p>
<p>I need to stop outlook from replacing our email provider info with office365 accounts.&nbsp; (I'd also like to know what triggered this issue a few days ago - nothing in our office accounts has changed for weeks.)</p>
<p>I hope I'm explaining this well.&nbsp; It's pretty convoluted from where I'm sitting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            Hi CB(42),<br />
<br />
Thank you for your sharing. And in view of that it is a little confused for us to identify the environment of your accounts, I’d like to ask you to contact the Exchange server side and consult the information above. In addition, I want to collect your tenant
 information for the further investigation. Please send me the information via <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
PM</a> if it’s convenience.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Marvin.&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to be clear that our Exchange server seems to be working just fine.&nbsp; Dozens of users have no problem with their email.&nbsp; The two affected users are still using the Exchange server just fine over webmail and on their phones.&nbsp; I took an old laptop
 running Office 2010 - so no connection to a 365 account - and was able to have Outlook connect to the account just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, this is entirely a Windows/Office problem where Outlook is talking to the wrong server.&nbsp; Those two Outlook installs are ignoring our usual email host and instead direct to office365 accounts - accounts that I didn't even know had the
 ability to receive email until this issue started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete and rebuild the Outlook profiles on those laptops the problem persists, so it's something in windows that probably needs to be cleaned up, not just something that broke Outlook once.&nbsp; But of course it'd be nice to figure out what tripped it,
 in addition to cleaning it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>Chris</p>

Thank you for the updates. As I understand it, the two affected accounts in the same domain are connected to the wrong Exchange server as you mentioned. And I need the information about the two affected accounts to check whether the sign-in process went wrong.
 Please send me the information I listed in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

<p>
</p><p>"And I need the information about the two affected accounts to check whether the sign-in process went wrong. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't give you our company's email info.&nbsp; But I shouldn't need to.&nbsp; You're still not seeing where the issue happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sign-in process <em>did not go wrong</em>.&nbsp; The accounts <em>successfully</em> connect to the Office autodiscover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the accounts go <em>looking for that autodiscover in the first place</em>, instead of going to our email host's autodiscover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Once Outlook is connected to the office inbox, then the emails sent by outlook go internally to other similar office inboxes and not external to our actual email provider, but that's sort of a secondary question at this point, so I'll table that unless
 there's some way we missed to disable <em>all</em> this emailing through the office accounts themselves until such time as we actually migrate our emails.)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is particular to the installation of Outlook.&nbsp; I have put the two account's email credentials into Outlook on other installs on other machines and they connect to our own email server just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further indicating it's Outlook, I asked the user to run the debugger, on the affected computer, and that pointed to our proper email provider.&nbsp; The results matched the autodiscover that I get from a working email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any email addresses not functioning would probably appear quite correct to your tests, since it's Outlook that appears broken here (or some aspect of Windows that Outlook is leveraging, or so on, but it doesn't look to me to be anything about either our
 server or the office server.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've cleared the DNS and reset the network info.&nbsp; I've cleared everything from the windows credential manager and let it prompt for passwords anew.&nbsp; I've run the Office repair features.&nbsp; Is there anything I can try in order to check how Outlook resolves
 an autodiscover (different from the tracing website) before I resort to re-imaging these machines?&nbsp; Cause that might clear up whatever changed earlier this week, but I'd rather not have to restore all the backed up documents if there's an Outlook setting that's
 overriding to office.com.</p>

<p>Hi CB(42),</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, I want to make a summary for this issue. If there is any mistake, please tell me.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;The two affected accounts are in an Office 365 domain and you never set it up. So I wonder whether this domain is verified in Office 365 or managed by Office 365.<br />
2.&nbsp;This situation only happened in Outlook client which are installed in the two specific laptops. And when the users login to OWA (Outlook Web App) in those laptops, the accounts connect to your own Exchange server.<br />
3.&nbsp;You have cleared DNS and the DNS records are properly pointed to your Exchange server.<br />
4.&nbsp;You have tried reset the network information, cleared credentials in windows credential manager, repair the Office, create a new profile, and the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to check the domain configuration, could you please send me the test report of ExRCA to me via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
PM</a>? </p>

<p>
</p><p>1, yes, there is a verified domain on office365.</p>
<p>We've had a Business plan for quite some time (using the onmicrosoft domain), and on April 25 we upgraded to Business Premium and verified the domain.&nbsp; The issues didn't begin until a few weeks after that change.&nbsp; We haven't added any new office365 accounts,
 this is all affecting accounts that existed under the old plan.</p>
<p>We never migrated any emails to the office exchange server.&nbsp; Our email, and our website, is still hosted by our usual provider.</p>
<p>We double checked the provider setup, and the temporary files that verified our domain for the office365 setup did indeed delete after they expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2, Yes, it's specific to the outlook client on those laptops.&nbsp; Web interface on those laptops works fine.&nbsp; In fact, the outlook client on those laptops also behaves improperly when adding another email account, so definitely not the exchange account itself.</p>
<p>Further, those email accounts work OK in Outlook on another machine, so it seems nothing configured at the exchange level is causing this.&nbsp; (Though that other test of Outlook was a fully licensed 2013, not using an office365 account.&nbsp; Is this broken only
 in outlook 2016?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3, Yes, I have cleared DNS.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to force DNS to our exchange server, and haven't needed to do so until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4, I'm not sure what network information to reset - I do know this is happening on remote networks, too, so it's not something on one office's ISP.</p>
<p>Yes, credentials cleared, Office repaired (and in one attempt fully uninstalled and reinstalled), tested under new user profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the real oddities is that the Office Admin center likes to mix and match accounts.&nbsp; I did a password reset for an office365 user and it emailed the new password to my actual exchange server.&nbsp; Then I did a group invite (while configuring Sharepoint)
 and that was sent to my office365 inbox.&nbsp; Is there simply a way to completely turn off our office365 inboxes until such time as we do migrate our email accounts?</p>

<p>Eureka!&nbsp; It's indeed related to the Office365 account itself.<br />
A third user had the problem on a brand new computer (old email account, old office365, just a new computer) where all she did was install Office (so didn't use Skype yet, didn't use OneDrive yet, etc).&nbsp; I stumbled on a solution....<br />
1.&nbsp; Delete the affected email from Outlook.&nbsp; (This involved creating a new data file.)<br />
2.&nbsp; Close Outlook and delete the remaining data files for that account.&nbsp; (Just to be sure.)<br />
3.&nbsp; Opened Outlook.&nbsp; Under the File menu \ Office Accounts, on the left it has User Information and on the right it has Product Information.&nbsp; Signed Out the user from the link on the left list.<br />
4.&nbsp; Add the email account.&nbsp; This found the right server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something about being logged in that account is overriding Outlook finding our actual email server.&nbsp; That's the bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left the new account running for a while to be sure, it's still OK.&nbsp; After a while I thought "we should sign you back in to office and see if the email is still OK" and she was
<em>already </em>signed back in somehow.&nbsp; I have no idea what app did that.&nbsp; But, it's still working, that's what matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the attempt at uninstalling and reinstalling failed to fix this because the office install itself signs the user in.&nbsp; It was repeating the bug on reinstall.</p>
<p><br />
Now the follow-up question is this:&nbsp; Why did these other users only have this break last week?&nbsp; What could they have done that made Outlook lose their regular inboxes (including the locally stored version of their contents) and start using the office365 exchange
 instead?</p>
<p>In other words, how do I stop this from happening again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus I still have my general question of can I turn off the office365 boxes entirely so this can
<em>never </em>happen, even with emails sent from office.com itself?&nbsp; Is there a setting for that?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi CB(42),<br />
<br />
Based on your description, the third user account connected to the right server when signed out. As my understanding, the account can connect to the right server when it is on premise, while the account connect to Office 365 Exchange server when it’s online.
 So I wonder,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>1. Is the third account on-premise or online?<br />
2.&nbsp;Is that all the items of these accounts are changed, such as <strong>Sent</strong><strong>Items</strong>,
<strong>Deleted</strong><strong>Items</strong>?<br />
<br />
And you can try to update folders by navigating to <strong>Send/Receive</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Folders</strong> to check whether there are error messages at the bottom of the Outlook.<br />

<h2>            avoiding updates</h2>
                    <p>so, windows 7 and Skype v 7.40.0.104, which I just had to reinstall AGAIN because I clicked by mistake on one of the update windows that keep popping up, something I constantly have to be on guard against. At least I got to go turn off automatic updates
 before it got going. Yes I'm one of those who do not like the newer, adolescent versions. I'm a grownup.</p>
<p>I want to avoid updates, that is my primary goal with this question. And occasionally, inconveniently, suddenly, &nbsp;I have to spend a half hour dealing with this update/reinstall BS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question: I see in the settings/notifications a box, "Enable Skype for Windows desktop notifications" - it is checked. If I uncheck it will the update notifications stop? Will it have any other consequences? Any other notifications that I maybe WOULD
 want?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second question: Which is the latest version of Skype&nbsp;I could use with an interface&nbsp;made for adults?

    <title>Rename MS Planner Plan&#47;Group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rename MS Planner Plan&#47;Group</h2>
                    In MS Planner, I have created a Plan and named it "Plan A". I now changed my mind and want to rename it to "Plan B". I found I can do this by editing the Plan, so it's now called "Plan B".<br />
However, the associated Group is still called "Plan A" and the email address is also still "PlanA at domain dot com" instead of PlanB...<br />
<br />
Is it possible to really rename the whole lot, without actually deleting the Plan/Group and creating a new one?<br />
<br />
And if deleting/recreating is the only solution, is there an option to copy the content of Plan A to a newly created Plan (incl. email, calendar, files, etc)?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
(sorry if I posted in the wrong category but Planner doesn't seem to be in the list yet!)

            <p>Hi Stefan,<br />
<br />
Yes, it is possible to change the email address of a plan without recreating a new one.</p>
<p>When we add a new plan in Office 365 Planner, a corresponding public group will be created. We can change the plan's email address (actually the PrimarySmtpAddress of the corresponding public group) via PowerShell commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1</strong>. Launch Windows PowerShell and run the following commands one by one to connect to Exchange Online:<br />
<br />
<strong>$UserCredential = Get-Credential</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Import-PSSession $Session</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2</strong>. Run <br />
<strong>Get-UnifiedGroup | select primarysmtpaddress,displayname,identity</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>3</strong>. Copy the <strong>Identity</strong> of the specific plan (group) (select and right click) and paste it to a notebook.<br />
<br />
<strong>4</strong>. Run<br />
Set-UnifiedGroup -Identity testplan002_a5eb70f93e -PrimarySmtpAddress testplan005@<em><strong>domain</strong></em>.onmicrosoft.com&nbsp;
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - mesaages with shared attachments hag up in outbox</h2>
                    When selecting share as an email attachment from within a windows app (word/excel) the app opens an outlook message, I address it to a recipient and push send ... then the email just hangs up in the outbox and never moves..... any other message that I
 originate from Outlook Outlook 2016 and then attach a saved document seems to work just fine.. Why do they hang up in the outbox?

<h2>            Serious security concern &#47; bug in lists of tables and figures when converting MS word 2016 doc to PDF&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Uh oh. So I was proofing a long report (150+ pages, lots of cross references, TOC, table of figures / table of tables / footnotes, etc.) and noticed a strange bug in both the list of figures and list of tables, once the Word was converted to PDF. I tried
 all PDF exporters known to me (ex. Adobe DC pro, Nitro Pro, Foxit) and I still get the same bug, with is a nasty one and here are the results in the PDF file:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c8f53eb-8ab9-41b3-b08e-d6c6f0ac53bc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c8f53eb-8ab9-41b3-b08e-d6c6f0ac53bc?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>The crazy thing - besides revealing all that sensitive info in the PDF - is about
<strong>half of the links in these lists work </strong>just fine! &nbsp;I tried regenerating new captions and even regenerated new lists. Everything remains the same. Inside the word doc all the links work as expected. I'm at a loss what do, but I don't want to
 let this doc out with this kind of bug right in the tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx,&nbsp;</p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I discovered the solution on a discussion thread, which I linked to in my post above&nbsp;(click the word "thread").
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is more detail from what I learned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you create a caption, Word detects the type of layout on the selected image.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If the image is "inline" with text, Word just creates a caption that is also inline with text.</li><li>If the image is laid out any other way--in other words, if the image is floating--Word creates the caption inside a text box so that it, too, will float.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to delete and recreate the captions. You can just cut/copy the caption and paste it outside of the text box. Then, delete the text box.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If the image is centered on the page (or left justified with no text wrapping), you can probably set it to be "inline" and then keep the caption text&nbsp;inline directly below the image.</li><li>If the image is right justified or has text wrapped around it,&nbsp;you need to create a table&nbsp;and put the image and the caption inside the table. Then position the table as you would have positioned the image (best to keep the image property&nbsp;"inline" relative
 to the table). &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize, when captions are in text boxes, the external&nbsp;link that Word creates in the ToC field, besides creating problems upon conversion to PDF, is also a security flaw because it reveals the path to the file on the computer where the document was
 last modified (or where the ToC was updated). These are supposed to be internal/relative links. And as I said, I am flabbergasted that this has not been fixed since at least 2014 when the aforementioned discussion thread was created.</p>

 styles. I modified the numbering of my custom style so it has a multilevel list, and the bullets remain when I change to my custom style, but in that case the indentations are lost. Why does this happen? Ideally I would like my custom style not to be a multilevel
 list, as I use it also for paragraphs with no lists (it only changes the font), and I would like the indentations and bullets to remain as they were originally when I apply the new style.

            Hi, <br />
<br />
<strong>Please don't shoot the messenger. Bullets and numbering in Word have been problems as long as I can remember.</strong> It can be tamed, but will not a pleasant experience this time. Step by step instructions for setting up your numbering can be found
 here: <br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>This method may seem a bit of work but not using it for important work is asking for trouble.
</strong>Once you have it set, you can save a template with it and use that template for new documents where you need good numbering that can survive editing.

The length of my feedback should not matter.&nbsp; If I leave long feedback messages, this means I have got (to me) a quite serious problem,

<h2>            Just updated Excel 2016 for Mac and its slow as heck</h2>
                    Just updated excel 2016 for mac. There are some UI changes, but its running super slow again. Super laggy when moving between cells, flickers when pressing enter. Anyone else seeing this issue? Seems like Excel for mac went backwards in the latest update.&nbsp;

            Windows Mobile 6.x is a great multi-tasking platform. Unfortunately, it does not really close an application. Instead it just sends it to the background and unless you have a third party task manager, the only way to stop it is to restart your phone to
 clean up memory.
