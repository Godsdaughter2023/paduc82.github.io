            Yes I would also try a hard reset, and if that still doesn't work, then I would uninistall the entire game of RDR2, do a hard reset, and then reinstall it. The update should install automatically along with the game when you reinstall. I've had this problem
 with games before and this fixed it for me. Good luck!

            I also had this problem with my first install of windows on an older PC. &nbsp;My first suggestion is to update the computers BIOS, &nbsp;for me this was caused because my computers BIOS was incapable of allowing windows to page more than 4GB of memory.

            Hi,
<p>
<br />
Heat or hardware can be the cause&nbsp;of this issue though there are other possibilities.<br />
<br />
Be sure the vents are clean and that the fans are working and not blocked.<br />
<br />
Check with the laptop maker's support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Definitely update<br />
the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major&nbsp;device drivers.<br />
<br />
As needed use ALL the other methods in the&nbsp;troubleshooters below.<br />

</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before
<br />
these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers <br />
were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video <br />
driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products <br />
could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Apple and quicktime lets you do this easily, I want to do this on my Win7 machine.&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; I have searched but it doesnt seem that Windows has this feature, and all that you are left with are cheesy choices that appear on internet searches for
 programs that seem dodgy.&nbsp; Help would be appreciated.&nbsp; If there is a program I have to purchse to do this, I will gladly do so.&nbsp; I do not want to have to first convert the whole file, I just want to select a portion of the DVD, perhaps 10 seconds of an hour
 long dvd and use it in a slide show.</p>
<p>All help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>====================================================<br />
Try renaming the .VOB file to .MPG and see if you can import it into Movie Maker.<br />
If that does not work...you'll have to convert the .VOB file to the .WMV format before<br />
importing into Movie Maker.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Today I noticed that on 12/12/2014 there has been a payment going from my creditcard to XBOX LIVE, I have no idea what it can be. Is it possible that someone can check this and e-mail me what I paid (I really didn't buy anything ;s).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>PS: Isn't it possible that I can e-mail to XBOX instead of posting this on a public forum?</p>

<p>Regards</p>

<p>If your external drive is FAT-32 (which I agree with Bindu may be the reason for the problem as certain properties like file security are not copied when going from NTFS to FAT-32), I strongly suggest you use the convert command&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb456984.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb456984.aspx</a>&nbsp;rather
 than the format command to change the drive to NTFS - that way you won't lose any of the data on the drive or need to move it to accomplish the task.&nbsp; Of course, everything already on the drive will be missing certain properties unless you copy the information
 again and replace what is already there (if that is possible).&nbsp; But new files will now copy properly.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

Are you using Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8?</p>
<p>WSR, Windows Speech Recognition is built into and highly integrated with the operating system. You cannot entirely remove WSR. However, you can choose to not have WSR start with the computer and thus should be inactive until you start it. Do this in Windows
 Vista and Windows 7:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Control Panel</li><li>Open Speech Recognition</li><li>In the upper left part of the window, click Advanced speech options</li><li>In the Speech Properties dialog box, remove the checkmark next to Run Speech Recognition at startup.</li></ol>

            Hi Varemia
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This is a problem where we are seeing scammers setup fake support websites that look like Microsoft's official branding and web pages. 
<br />
<br />When you see this, you should close your browser, restart your computer and report the issue. 
<br />
<br />2018 has turned out to be a year when fake scare sites have appeared all over the Internet with fake ads pretending to Microsoft support and insisting you call them. You need to watch out for these sites. They look like a genuine Microsoft website but they are not. 
<br />
<br />Warning: There are "Tech Support Scams" pretending to be Windows 10 Support and Activation Technologies. Please be vigilant. Microsoft never calls or emails users to inform them their license is expiring, accounts will be closed or they need access to sensitive information such as passwords or banking information. Neither should you get an email. Learn more in the following article:

            Hi Varemia.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is no such System ad popup from a MS game.  You may be infected with adware. 
<br />
<br />Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>.  In the Scan Settings first set it to include scanning for Rootkits.  
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Check for any remainders in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, and also in each of your browser's Extensions, Home Page settings, Search service or Add-On's as shown here:  <a href="https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Account/How-To-Disable-Plugins-Add-Ons-Extensions-In-Multiple-Browsers/ta-p/19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can turn off its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Account Details tab.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You misunderstand. It's not an actual system popup, it just looks like one on the website it loads up. It opens the browser and uses a fake popup. It doesn't engage any official system stuff, and I can just close the browser tab. It just pops up every
 time the ad loads in the game, and in the game the ad itself is just a white blank box. It's just the same website every time, and I figure it's probably whoever bought the ad-spot. Please de-list them or give me the ability to report them.

            This should still not happen if you don't click on the ad, and it is  the exact behavior of adware.   Are you not willing to check if you have adware which is a common problem?  I gave you the steps to do this thoroughly.  The browser should have it's extensions checked at the minimum.

            Malwarebytes came back clean. I agree it's weird that the ad is opening a webpage without being clicked. At this point since nothing else is doing anything like this, my solution will be to stop playing microsoft games with ads.

            You might try one other thing:  Reset the game at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Jigsaw &gt; Advanced Setting &gt; Reset.  This sometimes shakes out bugs like that.  
<br />
<br />It's annoying to think they're harassing customers like that.   If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.

<p>I know what you're talking about Varemia.&nbsp; I have the same issue.&nbsp; It used to happen a lot but now it is just occasionally but is still disconcerting.&nbsp; I think one difference is that I can close the new browser window that opens and do so quickly before
 it has time to load.&nbsp; The URL is always suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Malwarebytes and also Malwarebytes ADWCleaner but they never find anything.&nbsp; I think Microsoft just needs to police their ad placements better.</p>

<h2>            Fable 3 Framerate Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Im having a lot of issues concerning the framerate, before i installed all the DLC i have had little to no lag/frame issue at all it had been running pretty smooth, now after i installed all the DLC at once including the quest packs and dye's, dog breeds
 everything.. all at once, it has been so laggy and full of slowdowns especially doing jobs, or just running across the map, i first thought it might have been all of the multiplayer orbs roaming around so i went and turned them off and that did help but only
 a little but its still pretty bad and unplayable at times, my xbox itself is fine its sitting upright and getting plenty of circulation in a 77 degree room so it is not overheating. Any suggestions? &nbsp; &nbsp; oh and i got it off the marketplace so theres no physical
 disc its purely downloaded from live.</p>

<p>Im guessing that you downloaded from the marketplace, if so there have been reports of problems left and right, yes microsoft needs to fix these, but its a free game now.
</p>
<p>Now for the fix, try clearing your system cache.</p>
<p>If that doesnt work completely delete the game, not the dlc, and re download it.</p>
<p>Now if these dont work it is because when microsoft placed it in the marketplace they didnt upload it right.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start menu does not show link to an executable named - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davejohna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start menu does not show link to an executable named uninstall.exe</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have an application that installs a link to uninstall.exe in the Start Menu that worked fine pre Windows 10. In Windows 10 the shortcut link does not show up, checking the Start Menu folders shows it is there. I've tried uninstalling a reinstalling with
 reboots a few times to see if I could repeat it which I could. Creating a copy of uninstall.exe as uninstaller.exe and creating a short cut to that and placing it in the Start Menu\Programs\app folder resulted in the new link appearing indicating Windows 10
 is not listing uninstall.exe. Changing the link name didn't make a difference.</p>
<p>However, after further playing around Windows 10 now recognizes the original uninstall.exe link so I have seem have have done something where Windows now appears to always recognise that link. However, this code needs to be installed in multiple places around
 the world so this isn't a solution. </p>
<p>So before I scrub my Windows 10 install and start again, is there any special behavior around uninstall.exe and Window 10 Start Menu or it is a bug ?</p>

<h2>            Keyboard shortcut for switching between multiple windows in the same program in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that you can you Alt + f6 to cycle between multiple windows of the same program from the link given below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/126449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/126449</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Althogh it says, that the supported OS includes windows 7, i cannot switch between the multiple windows in the same program</p>
<p>I'm taking the same example from the support site--&gt;when the Notepad <strong>Find</strong> dialog box is displayed, ALT+F6 switches between the
<strong>Find</strong> dialog box and the main Notepad window</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Should we enable any particular settings in windows for this shortcutto be activated?</li><li>If no to the previous answer iss there a alternate shortcut for this functionality?</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Should we enable any particular settings in windows for this shortcutto be activated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally, Alt + Tab keys let you shuffle between different pages opened on the screen and within Internet Explorer if you have opened different tabs, you can use Ctrl + Tab keys to shuffle between different tabs in Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create keyboard shortcuts of your own to open programs as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-keyboard-shortcuts-open-programs#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Create keyboard shortcuts to open programs</span></a></strong></p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to switch between <strong><em>different applications(</em></strong>alt + tab) or
<strong><em>same tab in same application</em></strong>(ctrl + tab) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see my initial question and the question post, i want to cycle between <em>
<strong>different windows in the same application</strong></em> , see the example of the notepad that is given above.&nbsp; Its written in your support pages(with the same example) that we can use alt + f6 to do that, but its not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be technically more specific about the scenario, switching between the main window and a modeless dialog generated by the same window(or application) using only keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            cannot connect to router &#40;wired&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so im trying to connect my 360 to my router ( netgear wgr614 v6 ) and when i go into network settings on the dashboard and select wired ( which im using ) it just tells me to plug in a ethernet cable. This router is working fine, this computer is hooked
 up and running on the net with no problem along with a tablet using the wifi. Now the xbox works just fine when i connect it directly to the modem, it just goes weird when i add the router into the picture. whats wrong? (the ethernet cable im using is working
 just fine) im not privy when it comes to networking, so please simple terms :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks,</p>

<p>Since its failing to work when you add the router you can try this page - <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/nat-type-strict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../nat-type-strict</a></p>
<p>Ignoring the Test Connection steps since its not recognizing the cable, try the Solution steps and see if any of those help the Xbox Recognize the router like resetting the router and the Xbox. Simplifying the set-up etc. Don't worry too much about the tech
 stuff just yet but read over the page see if any of it seems relevant to your issue. Some routers require "network management" software to be on 1 or more computers that are in the network., administrative type stuff. Mine in particular requires that I allow
 or add every connection attempt, either wired or wireless. Also have you checked the particular port on the router for damage and ensured that it works. Maybe try connecting your computer to that slot or the Xbox to the port your computers plugged into? Just
 to make sure the issue isn't with the actual hardware of the router. Also this page -
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/cant-connect-to-xbox-live-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../cant-connect-to-xbox-live-solution</a></p>
<p>Click Wired and follow the steps for resetting the network to factory default, it could be a configuration type error. Hope this helps. &nbsp;

            <p>Hey there Trixstr!</p>
<p>Sound like the Ethernet port on the Xbox might have become defect. Is it possible for you to try connect with a different Ethernet cable (just in case) or try connect to a different Ethernet port on your router. Is it possible for you to connect directly to your modem to see if the problem persists. Do you have the Xbox 360 slim or an external wireless network adapter? If so, try connect to your wireless network?</p>

<p>Hey taidara I thought this at first to but Trixstr wrote in his post "Now the xbox works just fine when i connect it directly to the modem, it just goes weird when i add the router" but thinking about USB ports sometimes power supply is an issue. For example
 if your using a USB Hub and try to say update your BlackBerry smartphone the BlackBerry will refuse to update because using the Hub divides the initial power supply equally between all the ports and the BlackBerry isn't receiving enough power to sustain itself
 while the update is taking place. You can still sometimes connect to your computer with them but you cannot always charge or use certain types of hardware. I don't know much about how the Ethernet cables transfer Internet through the cables but logically thinking
 it would need energy to move through right? So is there such a thing as a router that breaks up the energy supply like the USB Hub and figuring the length of the cable it might function like Redstone in Minecraft. The charge can only travel so far from its
 original source. So OP can also try not only a different cable but a shorter cable...if it works it would prove this hypothesis. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi  Aris
<br />
<br />It sounds like your File Associations are not set correctly . . .
<br />
<br />Right click on of those downloaded files, choose 'Open With' - Choose Another App
<br />
<br />Important - Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open xxx . . .'
<br />
<br />If Excel is not in the list, scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps'
<br />
<br />Again if Excel is not in the list, at the bottom, click 'Look for another app on this PC', then navigate to find Excel in Program files . . .

<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen
<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other
<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or <br />
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />  What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />if problems persist with the new version then you can roll it back and hide it with the Hide Updates tool to wait for it to mature more:   <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>

<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />Well 1709 the Fall Creators Update is now the latest version.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load or use the "Even better methods" or "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have update the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hello, Many users are having the same/similar problems &amp; if you can log in via safe mode the solution is to turn off use sign-in info to auto finish setting up device after update or restart in Windows 10.
<br />For Windows 10 (Version 1709), select the Start  button, select Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options, then make sure Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart is turned off.
<br />For previous versions of Windows 10, select the Start  button, select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Window Update  &gt; Advanced options, then select the check box next to Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update.
<br />Another potential solution is to remove any USB devices (wireless mouse, keyboard, external hard drive/s) &amp; wait to see if boot continues, if not then to restart with devices still disconnected (if possible).

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Ok so I wanna buy the Kinect since they are lot of new and awesome features coming out for it so I was wondering does the Kinect only work on the newer Xbox or does it work for both??
 I have the Xbox Arcade and I'm pretty sure it won't work for it but I still need to know.</span></em></p>
