                    my screen gose black right after my desktop comes up, or will not come on at all even though I may be on line, or simply goes black while I am connected to the internet.

<p><span>Hi golaboy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What’s
 the recent change that you made to your computer between the timings when things were working fine and now?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get any error message or error code while the screen goes blank?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Video adapter problems are the most common cause of this issue (black screen). First, try to find out if there's a problem with the cables you're using or the way they're connected. If you have
 an alternate way of connecting your monitor to your PC, try it. For example, if your monitor is connected using an HDMI connector, try disconnecting it and then connecting with a DVI or VGA connector instead.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Update your Video adapter drivers to the latest by visiting the manufacturer’s site to fix this
 issue. Refer the link below for more information about driver update.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to manage devices in Windows XP</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Once you update the Video adapter driver, install the latest version of Flash Player for your
 browser.</span></p>
<p><span>You may download and install the latest version of Flash Player by visiting the following link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</span></a></span></p>

    <title>Wrong characters on Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Ergonomic Wireless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doni43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong characters on Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Ergonomic Wireless Desktop</h2>
                    <p>In November 2013 I purchased the&nbsp;Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Ergonomic Wireless Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday 9th October 2015 I was about to start writing in a word document and noticed that a number of characters on screen were no corresponding to the keys which I had pressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backspace now turns into "tT"</li><li>Backspace does not delete</li><li>6 turns into ".r6"</li><li>A no long appears</li><li>Z turns in ".Z"</li></ul>
<p>Along with additional errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed a number of suggestion such as changing the Language settings - that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the Keyboard with Add/Remove programmes and reinstalled it - that did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Keyboard on a difference PC - that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to see if there were any damaged keyboards i.e. if any were jammed hence causing the error - that wasnt it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to resort to using a new keyboard altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please say if they have experienced this problem and if there is a way to correct this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Mouse moving on its own in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>This problem seemed to start happening recently.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While using my desktop, suddenly, the mouse cursor starts to move up on its own to the top of the screen.. I've tried using different mice, but the problem persists. I even tried using the same mice and mouse pad with Windows 7, and they worked just fine.
 What kind of software problem could likely be causing this issue?</p>

<p><span>Hi Anders,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using multiple pointing devices on this computer, then this could be a conflicting issue among these devices. I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue. Please answer these questions for
 a better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of your computer and the mouse device?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have multiple pointing devices connected to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using a Touch Screen monitor with this desktop computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you update the mouse drivers to its latest Windows 8.1 compatible version from its manufacturer’s website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When exactly, did this issue started happening? If it has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using multiple pointing devices (Mouse or Touchpad) on this computer, then I would suggest you to connect just one of them at a time and then check if that issue persists. If you are using the Touch
 Screen monitor, then I would suggest you to disconnect it and check if this issue persists with a normal monitor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t work, then check if the issue persists in clean boot. To perform a clean boot, you may please follow these instructions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer
 to the section “<b><i>How to perform a clean boot</i></b>” and follow the instructions for “<b><i>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</i></b>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></i></b></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the
 issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This
 can be done by following the instructions for “<b><i>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</i></b>” given in the section “<b><i>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</i></b>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean
 boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to find the root cause of this issue by performing a clean boot, then this could be an issue with the mouse driver installed on the computer. You may try updating the mouse driver from its manufacturer’s
 website and let’s know the details. If you need any further assistance with this, please feel free to get back to us and we’ll be glad to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the results.</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have the same problem. I have recently bought a sony vaio with windows 8.0 and I upgraded to 8.1 and suddenly my mouse has a life of its own - when the mouse points to a certain area it automatically does a click as well .... as a result I cannot move
 the cursor around without opening or closing certain screens by accident. Before 8.1 no issues ... it started after the upgrade</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a brand new pc with a clean install !! To me it looks clearly like a 8.1 bug and as a consequence I cannot use my pc anymore, at least not with a mouse</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>kind regards</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Eric</p>

            Guys, try to uninstall the mouse driver and restart the system. It will 99% resolve the issue. (Note : Your mouse driver will get installed automatically when system restarts). &nbsp;

<h2>            Reverting back to Windows7.1 ultimate</h2>
                    WOuld like to know how to get back to windows 7.1 as I downloaded windows 10 got the balck screen and fixed that issue and then lost my keyboard as Windows 10 installed lenovo keypad into my laptop and its Asus laptop!!! Fixed that issue and then things
 worked good till I logged on tonight and it out of blue did system repair to C:/ and I lost the option to search or even use the window icon!!! Now its acting real glitchy and I cant even get into settings like before so I have no option of recovering my windows
 7.1 . Before anyone ask I had to repalce my hard drive once already as it was rebooted a few times and had bad sectors in it and when I gave to Computer repair person at college they couldnt get my orignal windows 7 disk to work so they used a college version
 ultimate and now I dont have a disk. Please help as I use this laptop to pay bills with and I really cant afford to take thi to reapir place again!&nbsp;

            While I appreciate the info I cant access &nbsp;the start menu nor am I able to get to settings. Win10 did a system repair to c drive and now i no longer have those functions so how can I even get to what you want me to get to? And i did to back up to external
 hard drive tried the restore route but windows 10 is still there! Im so frustrated with this platform/ update I realize there are so many different variables with each pc platform but this is rediculous and now Im without a functioning laptop.

            <p>Thanks for the response but what most of Microsoft and its employees cant appreciate is that all these things you are suggestion are really for an IT level person. Your average user wouldnt even know how to do some of these tops you are suggesting. Its frustrating
 to me as i was able to run the sfc after watching some google vids due to not able to go your route as options keep changing with windows 10 ( **** shoot) every time i turn my laptop on windows has lost another function for no apparent reason !!!! Microsoft
 made it sound like its an easy revert back situation should we not be happy with. 10 and guess what its NOT!! I did the back up restore option as i have lost my cloud abilities as well as window drop down and search and my laptop did the back up and restore
 did nothing. I dont have option to revert to windows 7.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>why dont you at Microsoft allow a desktop icon that would automatically restore the pc back instead of having it hidden in layers? As some people loose the option to restore their pc like me.... Without doing a total wipe of hard drive!!! Which by the way
 i am paying a pc person to do as you guys at Microsoft windows 10 update has totally messed my laptop up. Ive been doing fix after fix as windows 10 installed Lenovo keypad on my laptop changed display usage also did critical update and lost search functions
 as well as drop down menu and now i can use internet options or wireless is buggy !!! &nbsp;All working fine before the install. So thanks for messing up my good laptop which i use to pay bills and communicate via email. Now I am without for a few weeks as the
 pc repair guy attempts to restore windows 7. Lesson learned dont fix whats not broke. Who needs viruses when all you have to do is install the &nbsp;latest version of windows to totally mess you laptop up!</p>
<p>sincerely frustrated</p>

<p>Hi Sheila,<br />
<br />
It is possible that you're trying to login the child account using the parent device or computer. To properly isolate this issue, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to log into the child account using the child's device or computer?</li><li>Have you tried removing the child account from the family account and add it again?</li><li>Have you tried logging in the child account to other computer to check if the credentials are correct?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>No I only have one computer.&nbsp; It does have different logins.&nbsp; One for the child email and one for my email.&nbsp; My email works fine the child email does not.&nbsp; In communications I have had with Microsoft which have been over all useless I am supposed to be able
 to create multiple logins such as having one for a guest and they should all login.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes I have created different emails and deleted and readded them none of them work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only other computer I have access to is my work computer which I wouldn't even begin to know how to login into a personal account on that computer as we have our own server that automatically comes up with my work login.&nbsp;

<p>I kept getting the run around from them for a week.&nbsp; Finally they sent me an opinion survey and I gave them very bad marks.&nbsp; Next day I had an update sent to my computer that took over an hour to load but then everything worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sad but I recommend every time they ask you to do something make sarcastic comments that their service is bad and why can't someone help me on the phone.&nbsp; If they send you a survey answer it with honest comments that their customer service sucks.&nbsp;
 Can't swear this is what got them to help but it would be a big coincidence if not. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 is the final version in the Windows NT series, then what will we do when its mainstream and extended support ends? Are we going to have to abandon Windows forever, and move to new operating systems? Or just deal with it and have a higher chance
 of getting your computer hacked?</p>

            Hi User123456789876543210 
<br />
<br />When support for Windows 8 ends, Microsoft will re-brand Windows 10 to just Windows 
<br />
<br />The model Microsoft are using going forward is, twice yearly a new version of Windows (called a Feature Update) will be released. That feature update will include any new Functionality and features available for Windows and will deprecate older features 
<br />
<br />That way, once your PC is up to date, you will always have the latest version of Windows. This is something like the Office 365 model, with the one exception, Windows 10 feature updates are free and there is no subscription
<br />
<br />Support for Windows versions last approx. 2 years, but since new versions are constantly being released and if you keep your system up to date, support will not end . . .

<p>Microsoft's marketing department got itself into a real jam when they described Windows 10 as 'the last version of Windows.' What they really meant was: Windows 10 is the last version of Windows
<em>that you will download and install on your computer</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft's plans work out as they anticipate, Windows will move to the cloud - just like ChromeOS is today. There will almost nothing of Windows that's installed on a computer. That will make everyone's life much easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows is in the cloud it will be supported indefinitely, just as ChromeOS is today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, there is a new version of Windows 10 roughly every six months, but Microsoft can't call it a new version because they painted themselves into a corner by calling Windows 10 'the last version.' So instead of calling it a new version, somebody came
 up with the name 'feature upgrade.' That lasted for a while until the name was changed again, so now it's called a 'feature update.'</p>

                    <p>I have a dell inspirion 11 3000 series (2-in-1) laptop (running windows 10) that's completely given up on any touch screen functionality. I used to just be able to restart the laptop to get it working if I had issues, but that's stopped working. I've only
 had the laptop just under a year and it's really frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking into it and there's no option for the touch screen in the device manager and the one unlabeled USB input device doesn't change anything when I disable/enable it.</p>

<p>I am currently running Windows 7 Pro on my 27" iMac's Boot Camp partition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Randomly over the last couple weeks, my iMac has decided to shut down while I was asleep (I have yet to have this happen to me while using the machine). Occasionally, it has ended up in a repair session, but I've also had it hang and do nothing but display
 a gray screen.&nbsp; I was finally able to catch the act in progress and took pictures of the BSOD. Since the repair sessions haven't been able to solve the problem, what can I do to prevent this issue from continuing to happen? There seems to be no ill effects
 since I can usually run the Windows side of my iMac just fine after each "session."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excerpt from the BSOD:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Technical information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***STOP: 0X0000007A (0X000000000000020, 0xFFFFFFFFC000009D, 0xFFFFFA8008CD17C8, 0x0000000000000000)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need any system specs or logs to further diagnose this.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>The devices that I am trying to add are both computers. One is my wife's Dell laptop on WiFi and the other is my tower. Both are running Windows 10, hers Home and mine Pro. The network was working till we had to reload her system due to a persistent redirect
 in Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just now getting around to setting the network back up and am having all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am setting up a home group. Both computers are set to private, discover-able, windows controlled and not password protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both have the same folders shared also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Add A Device. It searched, on the Laptop, for devices that could be added and it found two devices. One was my tower (JOHNSTOWER) and the other was an unknown printer?, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected JOHNSTOWER and clicked on Next which caused the Wizard to try to connect. (Scr</p>
<p>After a bit it came back and asked me if the PASSCODE matched the one on JOHNSTOWER. A replay of No would kill the Wizard immediately. A reply of yes caused it to try to match the code with an unknown something and it would fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where I left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get screen shots but could not seem to paste them in here.</p>

            Make sure you go to through all the instructions as described in the following article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-join-homegroup-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-join-ho...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try setting up a basic P2P network between both first:

<br />
<br />Please keep in mind, HomeGroups seems to be in a buggy state. Just like many legacy parts of Windows 10, it is not being actively developed and maintained. Microsoft seems to pushing users to use OneDrive and syncing as a means of connecting devices.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a while since you posted this thread. Are you still having trouble when trying to add devices to your network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Yes I am BUT I think I am miss understanding the process. Both the systems are Windows 10, one Pro and the other Home. I can see one computer on the network of each system but not the other. When I search for devices to add it finds the "Missing" computer
 from the other system but when I try to add it it asks for verification of a Passcode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the problem MAY be that I am trying to add a device (Computer) from another system to my systems list of devices???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite confused at this point.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have about given up on the PASSCODE issue.... No one or nothing seems to know what it is or where to find it... My little network is still down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this morning, shutting everything in the network off and bringing them back up starting with the modem/router, laptop, tower and finally printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a note both computers are up to date as far as MS updates are concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the firewall (Avast) on both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop (Win 10 Home) found both computers, router and printer BUT when I attempted to access the tower (Win 10 Pro) I was told Insufficient Permissions. The folder that I tried to access is shared on the tower to all with complete permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Home group wise I killed everything on both computers. I set up a new connection on the tower and recorded the password. I then went to the laptop and was told that there was an existing home group, did I want to join? This I did and entered the password
 I had copied from the tower. After a VERY long pause the laptop came back and told me that it could not establish the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this three times and abandoned my efforts, turned the firewall back on and said enough for the day.</p>

<p>Just for clarification, when you said you killed everything on both computers, did you mean you deleted the current
<strong>Homegroup </strong>and tried to create a new one? If yes, and was told that there was an existing
<strong>Homegroup</strong>, we suggest that you delete the contents of the <strong>
PeerNetworking</strong> folder. Navigate to <strong>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking,
</strong>click the <strong>View </strong>tab and make sure to check the <strong>Hidden items</strong><strong>.
</strong>Delete all the files in the <strong>PeerNetworking </strong>folder, restart your PC and try to leave/create the
<strong>Homegroup </strong>again.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, I deleted the current Homegroup on both computers BEFORE going through the power cycle routine. I did not though delete the contents of the folder that you directed me to.</p>

<p>I killed everything in that folder on both systems. Shut down the entire network and brought it back up starting with the router, laptop and finally my tower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to setup the work group, which seemed to be successful, I ended up with both computers showing as computers AND media devices on the laptop. The router WiFi for the laptop also showed and the printer. That was on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tower showed NO computers but both laptop and tower as media devices. The router and printer we also showing on the tower's network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop media device worked, I was able to stream music from it to the tower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop showed all of the networked drives on the tower but when I attempted to access the folders I was told I did not have sufficient permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Permissions for all users set to everything allowed. Just my wife and I using this network 99% of the time.</p>

            To find the network password go to open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet and then select Network and Sharing Center in the Related Settings list.
<br />
<br />Alternately, you can right-click the Wi-Fi icon on the system tray in the lower right corner and select Open Network and Sharing Center.
<br />
<br />Then when the sharing center opens, select the network your PC is connected.

<h2>            Using Windows 7 Home Premium OA Key</h2>
                    My old hard drive crashed when it had my Windows 7 OA Key attached to it. Obviously I've no access to the hard drive so I can't deactivate it. If I were to make/get a Windows 7 install disk, would I be able to use the OA key on my computer's case to re-active

<p>
</p><p><strong>You can use the same product key and reactivate by telephone or Internet if necessary:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have installed it, all you need to do is change the product key located on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Lets take a look at how to do that.
</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" height="145" width="461" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" height="398" width="455" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" height="156" width="438" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" height="403" width="460" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" height="402" width="459" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" height="98" width="468" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>

    <title>Botched my Windows 10 upgrade from 7 - did I kill my PC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r buckgray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Botched my Windows 10 upgrade from 7 - did I kill my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On my desktop the upgrade went fairly well.</p>
<p>On my laptop it initially looked good but things went south from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first hurdle was that the software wanted to upgrade my drivers with software I did not want to use. &nbsp;I liked DriverHound.</p>
<p>So I just bypassed the softwares trying to sell me DriverUpdater or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I subscribed to DriverHound and applied it to the desktop. I then applied it to the laptop. &nbsp;It updated the 22 drivers it found and installed the updates . . &nbsp;but when it went to save the setup it glitched. &nbsp;So I advised DriverHound of the suituation and
 am awaiting the recommendation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meantime I figgured it was a good time to cleanup the laptop's drive so I used CCleaner and DeFrager. &nbsp;Defrsgger got down to two files still fragmented, so I rebooted and rand Defragger again. &nbsp;I took some two hours to 100 percent defrage those last two
 files. &nbsp;Even then they still appeared to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the laptop would not reboot. &nbsp;So I decided to reinstall the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;It appeared to be going well up to about 50% complete, then it glitched. &nbsp;So I did it again, and it glitched again. &nbsp;I was not doing a "clean" update as the updater allowed
 personal files to be kept. &nbsp;On the laptop it appears that it kep my internet access points but erased my Program files. &nbsp;Anywat the reinstall kept glitching when I used the option that kept the personal files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I figured, I can reinstall what ever I need, run the update and erase the personal files. &nbsp;That glitched. &nbsp;Now I'm left without an access to an operating system. &nbsp;OK, reboot the Windows 7 crash disks. &nbsp;PC doesn't recognize the disks. &nbsp;OK, try to redirect
 the BIOS. &nbsp;Can' get to the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, use the desktop to created a bootable flash drive. &nbsp;The seemed to work although the desktop wouldn't disconnect from the media and I had to just pull it out. &nbsp;But plugging it into the laptop resulting in it not being recognized. &nbsp;I was also warned to
 have the software key ready . . . software key? from an original Vista on board laptop in 2010? &nbsp;Well I figured if I got that far I would try to deal with it at that point. &nbsp;But since the laptop can't find anything, I may have pushed it to its grave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other recommendations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By grace,</p>
<p>Buck</p>

            <p>Lets start with the desktop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Carry out the following instructions before attempting to reinstall Windows 10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable General USB Devices (example - Smart Card Reader).&nbsp;</li><li>If you are using a SCSI hard disk, make sure you have drivers available for your storage device on a thumb drive and it is connected. During Windows 10 setup, click the Custom Advanced Option and use the Load Driver command to load the appropriate driver
 for the SCSI drive. If this does not work and setup still fails, consider switching to a IDE based hard disk.</li><li>If you have any external devices attached to the machine, disconnect them (example, gaming controllers, USB keys, external hard disk, printers, non-essential devices).</li></ul>

</p><p>As for licensing, the free upgrade is only for computers that have a qualifying license attached, such as Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1. Windows XP or Vista do not qualify. If you don't have a qualifying Windows 7 or Windows 8x license, then you will need to
 purchase a full version Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Question&#58; Can the Surface Pro run SQL server&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to buy a Surface pro 3's for our sales reps to demo our software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the surface pro 3 run SQL server &amp; how does it run?<br />
install a standard&nbsp;USB barcode scanner?<br />
install a standard USB a4 laser printer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming the answer is yes as reading around the surface pro 3's have a&nbsp;full version of windows 8.1?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any advise you can give me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

Ask the makers of the software you are installing first.

<h2>            &#34;These Files Might Be Harmful To Your Computer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Since a recent update, I get this annoying prompt every time I attempt to move a file or folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled Windows Defender, Windows Firewall, I have turned off all security that I can in Internet Options, and I have checked the Include All Network Paths option already. It still continues to happen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is pointless and annoying and serves zero purpose whatsoever except to force me to turn off literally every protection on Windows in search of why this started happening out of nowhere. Not that I even USE Internet Explorer, since I use a decent internet
 browser, so I'm not even sure why the IE options should matter, but whatever. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I have no other security programs that could be the cause. </p>

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand how you feel about the situation and we are sorry for the trouble. I can see here that you have already tried a lot of steps to resolve the issue that is an appreciable effort. There seems to be some infection with your computer. I will assist
 you in troubleshooting the issue. </p>
<p>I suggest you to perform the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Download and run the <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>.<br />
Refer to the following Microsoft article:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Perform <strong>SFC scan</strong> and check.</p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Perform<strong> System Restore.</strong></p>
<p>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos.</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time”</strong> mentioned in the following Microsoft Article:

 your personal files are deleted while system restoring. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is
 failed, it may lead to loss of important files as well.</span></p>

</p><p>I have performed the SFC scan. I have attempted to use the safety scanner, however, the link you provided when downloaded says this version is incompatible with my version.

</p><p>It depends how confident you are using your machine, but if you know what you're doing most of the time and you keep security software up te date, I'd suggest disabling User Account Controls in Control Panel | User Accounts which is what I've done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way, you won't see any warnings at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a subscription to Malwarebytes Premium which includes online protection and it's one of the best security programs on the market. You can test it for 14 days by downloading the free version (link underneath the green Premium button) and enabling the
 free trial to the Premium version: <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will work with Windows Defender so you can continue using that as well if you wish.

            <p>The thought just occurred to me that maybe you added the wrong IP to the local Intranet. If for example, you added http://192.168.1.1 when it should be http://192.168.1.254 then that would be the reason it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine what your local IP should be, run Tracert from a command prompt. The first IP which appears at the top is the one you need to add.&nbsp; So for example, run:
<strong>tracert www.microsoft.com </strong></p>
