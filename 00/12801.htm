Thanks for posting your question to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, what type of diagnostics are ran when you come up with Winsock Error 10049?<br />

<p>Does anyone know if Microsoft has come up with any solution to having a single tenant globally, but users mailboxes stored in their regional datacenter? &nbsp;For example, you have signed up your tenant in the US...but you have offices in Germany, Australia,
 Japan...and you would like mailboxes to be stored in the closeset datacenter</p>

<p>@Vasil is right. All users’ data is saved in the tenant datacenter. And the datacenter will still be decided upon the initial selection upon tenant creation.</p>

    <title>MSE icon taking longer than usual to turn green&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> candystand  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSE icon taking longer than usual to turn green&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been using MSE on my new computer (windows 7 64-bit) for about 8 months now, and my system would usually take about 20-25 seconds to boot to desktop, with the MSE icon turning green at around 30 secs. However, starting last saturday,AFTER a
 routine disk defrag ("defrag and optimise" option that I do every week with Auslogics Disk Defrag to maintain system speed), I experienced a power outage. After the power outage, I booted up the system ("start windows normally), but then I realized that it
 was taking MSE longer (40-50 seconds) to turn green. Now, I'm pretty sure that the disk defrag ended before the power outage occurred (disk defrag usually takes 15 minutes, and I stepped away from the computer for at least 2 hours before experiencing a house-wide
 blackout that inturrupted my movie watching in the living room), meaning that it is impossible for the power outage to have corrupted files during defrag. I assumed that it was just the result of the power outage (I had experienced this before), and that boot
 speeds would return (and MSE loading times) back to normal after a few boots, allow time for superfetch to rebuild, etc) However, my concern starts to register when&nbsp;MSE&nbsp;continues to take&nbsp; 45 seconds or more to turn green, about 15-20 seconds later than usual,
 even after a few boots. I then began to suspect file corruption, so I did system restore to time before power outage...oddly, boot time for MSE is still at 45 seconds (compared to, as I mentioned above, the 30 seconds I typically experienced for the past 8
 months), although the time it takes to boot to desktop is normal (20 seconds). It just seems that all other startup programs are loaded before MSE. I then checked MSCONFIG and confirmed that the three startup programs I had (hpsysdrv, MSE, and AMD Catalyst
 Control Center) were unchanged. Still, after numerous reboots over two days, the load time for MSE is still 45 seconds, which is frightening seeing that the system seems to load everything else, run at 0% for 10 seconds, then turn MSE icon to green. I checked
 the number of processes, which was unchanged (40 processes from purchase to now), and performed serveral full system scans with MSE and Malwarebytes (realtime protection disabled), which ruled out infection (which was unlikely, as this happened after power
 failure). I have made no system/hardware changes (slow MSE icon change from red to green started right after the power failure). I then checked the service status for Microsoft Antimalware service and NIS service, which seems to have started right away (which
 is nromal), even though the MSE icon remains red for 20 seconds after desktop screen loads, indicating that there seems to be no fault in the MSE program or files itself, it just that the icon stays red even though the antimalware services have started. I've
 tried double-clicking the red tray icon while MSE was still loading, and the interface was red, prompting me to click the start protection button. I did so, although I got the windows loading cursor for the same amount of time (until system boot was at 40
 seconds), before it'd turn green. Concerned, I reinstalled MSE, however, and for the first two boots, times seemed back to normal (green after 25-30 seconds from boot) although starting on the third boot, it went back to 40 seconds again. I checked event viewer,
 and it shows that the Microsoft Antimalware Service starts right after desktop, (which is normal), but NIS service starts right before icon turns green (in this case, 40 seconds after boot---which I assumed, was because NIS is "Automatic-Delayed Start"). I
 also notice some errors...</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Microsoft Antimalware Real-Time Protection feature has encountered an error and failed.</p>
<p>Feature: Behavior Monitoring</p>
<p>Error Code: 0x80004005</p>
<p>Error description: Unspecified error </p>
<p>Reason: The filter driver requires an up-to-date engine in order to function. You must install the latest definition updates in order to enable real-time protection.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but these errors have been in the Event Viewer for almost every boot even BEFORE MSE boot suddenly slowed down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, after trying almost everything (short of reinstalling, sfc /scannow, and a disk check---which i assume Windows would notify me if it found any errors in files anyway due to self-healing NTFS), I am forced to conclude that MSE does load and function
 properly (EICAR tested), but the MSE user interface is delayed in showing the green "protective checkmark castle"---both in the notification tray and the MSE user interface itself, for some reason? Should I be concerned? Is there any other way to fix this
 short of a OS reinstall? Thanks!</p>

<p>Personally, assuming no conflicts, I would not be concerned about that 15 second change in startup time for MSE.</p>
<p>The Event Log entry is normal, so ignore it.</p>
<p>Have you considered uninstalling and reinstalling MSE?</p>

<h3> ubasti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Header Record Delimiters </h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to create a data file (from my client list that is in word 2003). When I try to merge my document and boxe appears that says&nbsp;Data fields must be separated from each other by a character called a field delimiter, then it says the same for a record
 delimiter, use the list below to select appropriate delimiter. I don't know which delimiter to use for the data field and the data record. Can anyone help??</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you can open your data document in Word, you should see something like</p>
<p>columnname1,columnname2,columnname3</p>
<p>value11,value12,value13</p>
<p>value21,value22,value23</p>
<p>Where of course your file will have different column names, probably a different number of columns, different values and a different number of rows.</p>
<p>In this example, the comma "," is the field delimiter and the the record delimiter is Enter. But you could have</p>
<p>columnname1;columnname2;columnname3,<span>value11;value12;value13,</span><span>value21;value22;value23</span></p>
<p>In that case, the field delimiter would be ";" and the record delimter would be ",". But that probably would not be a very good idea.</p>
<p>If you are asking which delimiters to choose, I would say "use tab characters for the field delimiters, and Enter (carriage return/line feed) for the record delimiters. If there are any tab characters in your data, you have to wrap the field in "text delimiters",
 which are normally double-quote characters "". If you have double-quote characters in your data, double them up.</p>
<p>Word has two methods for opening delimited data sources. One method is the one you have described. It lets you choose which delimiter characters you want to use. The other opens the file using an OLE DB provider, and only allows the field delimiter to be
 a carriage return/line feed.&nbsp;</p>

                    When I start Outlook I've had it set up to start at he Outlook Today Page showing tasks, Calendar Appointments and folders for three (3) email accounts.&nbsp; Last week for some reason the Outlook Today Page went blank, I have tried reinstalling but this did
 not help, and after several days searching threads on the internet I am no closer to a solution.&nbsp; Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Onenote for Android not opening embedded PDF files</h2>
                    I have been using Onenote for android on my Galaxy S7 for a while and embedding PDF files in the notes.&nbsp; In the last few days I have not been able to open the PDF files...I get a corrupted file error.&nbsp; The Windows desktop version of the file opens the
 PDF file without incident.&nbsp; It seems as though the Android version is trying to use the wrong file format.&nbsp; How can I set the proper default file type for opening the PDF from within Onenote?

<h2>            How to create a Burn-down Chart in Microsoft Project 2013&#47;16 using Story Points Instead of Work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to create a typical "burn-down" chart in Microsoft Project 2013 or 2016 using the new Reporting (no Visual Reports) capability utilizing Story Points instead of resource assigned work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of custom fields that define Sprints, Stories, Story Points and Velocity (among other things), but I can't seem to figure out how to do a really simple burn-down (or even burn-up) report using the new Reporting Dashboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have "Googled" all over the place trying to find a simple example of this with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone either show me how to do this or point me to a simple example of how to use Story Points instead of Work for a burn-down chart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

 (depending on the date). When a create a table and synchronized it with the add-in "SynchronizeWSSand Excel", it convert the field in a simple data and it is not updated with the calculation when I changed the date.</p>

            <p>Hi Chatrine80,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, there are few limitations for the Excel Add-in:</p>
<p>1. File has to be saved as 97-2003 file </p>
<p>2. Columns cannot be created in excel once the excel is published as list (new columns cannot be published to list)
</p>
<p>3. Formulas columns in excel become single line of text in the list </p>
<p>4. Doesn't work for excel with macros</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's an expected behavior that the field doesn't work as it should. Given this situation, you are highly recommended to provide feedback via
<a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice</a> so that our related team can hear your voice on this feature directly.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t turn on after last Windows 10 update</h2>
                    Windows Defender had been working perfectly until the last major Windows 10 update that I installed around 11/16/15.&nbsp; Since that upgrade, whenever I turn on Defender it only stays on for a few seconds and then turns itself off.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is a clean install and no third-party security is installed on the computer, I suspect the below points can be one of the reason why this issue is occurring:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure that you keep your Windows up to date using Windows Update, since this can cause some&nbsp;issues with Windows Defender. We suggest that you perform full Windows Update, then open Windows Defender and run an update from there as well.</li><li><span><span>If you have installed Java, Adobe Reader, or any other “free” product, you may have been presented with the option to install a “free virus checker”, which is selected by default.&nbsp; If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidently installed
 this “free virus checker”, uninstall it and use the cleanup tool(s) in the list above.&nbsp; Note that these “free” downloads can also occur in products purchased by you.&nbsp; Your ISP may also provide an anti-malware product (and perhaps a firewall).&nbsp; Install these
 products ONLY if you do not intend to use WD and/or the Windows Firewall.(By: </span>
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/protect_defender-protect_start/windows-defender-on-windows-8-introduction-and/f1e00106-6687-4efe-9ec0-ed9f72fabb92">Stephen Boots July 21, 2013</a>)</li><li>Another cause for Windows Defender to not work properly is incorrect time and date on Windows. In order to fix this, you need to check your time and date, and set it to correct value before trying to turn Windows Defender back on.</li><li>Also, incorrect Zone settings in Internet Explorer can cause problems, but you can fix this by resetting
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Internet Explorer</a> to factory settings. <span><strong><span>Reset IE disclaimer:</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear
 browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords</span></span></li><li>Lastly, your computer could be infected with malware that stops Windows Defender from working properly. To fix this you can download and use Windows Defender Offline Tool.</li></ul>
<p>If the above is not the case, they please perform a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reset PC</a>.</p>

<h2>            KB2416400 fails to install with error code 80092004 after applying hotfix KB2422556.</h2>
                    
<p>There are some reports that the latest cumulative security update for Internet Explorer 8 (KB2416400) fails to install on some Windows 7 x64 systems with error code 80092004.</p>
<p>While the exact reasons for the failing aren't known yet, <strong>it seems to be likely "caused" by a previous installation of hotfix KB2422556.</strong></p>
<p>I've encountered this problem while installing KB2416400 on my Inspiron 1545.</p>
<p>Perhaps this failure will not occur if KB2422556 is applied <strong>after</strong> installing KB2416400, though I suspect if the fix can be applicable on my computer or not.</p>

<p>So you haven't installed KB2422556 yet, is the correct?</p>

<p><br />
After worked around this issue, I've noticed that KB2422556 caused a conflict with KB2416400 and vice versa.</p>
<p>While KB2416400 was installed succesfully, KB2422556 failed to install.</p>
<p>My personal verdict is that KB2416400&nbsp;contains already all&nbsp;the Outlook 2003 fixes mentioned on the KB article 2422556. Therefore this security update supersedes the 2422556 hotfix, making it obsolete.</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7 or is it a new computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />

<p>2. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Had you installed Hotfix KB2422556 and does KB2416400 install after&nbsp;uninstalling it &amp; rebooting?<br />
<br />
7. Is it the same computer as in &nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/thread/856fe4cd-499a-4959-a4c7-f0c89d3af814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this earlier thread</a> of yours?</p>

I use the genuine retail version of Win 7 Home Premium. My Dell Inspiron 1545 runs the 64-bit version.</p>
<p>None of the Norton &amp; McAffee products are installed on my computer. I use the latest version of the all-free MS Security Essentials. The Firewall is partially disabled to prevent compatibility issues with third-party software.</p>
<p>I haven't tried to install KB2416400 before installing KB2422556 yet. I'll try to working around the issue.</p>
<p>As for your last question, yes, it's the same computer. Don't worry about the WSUS hanging problem, it was already solved.</p>

</p><p>Reset a retail mode phone </p>
<p>
</p><p>A phone in retail mode can be made sellable by resetting it. Resetting a demo phone deactivates retail mode, erases demo content, uninstalls apps, and restores factory settings. To reset a phone that is in retail mode, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Open <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> and scroll to the bottom of the screen, then tap
<strong>Update demo phone</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, tilt the phone in the following directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tilt the phone to the left. Give the phone a second or two to redraw in landscape.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tilt the phone upright. Give the phone a second or two to redraw in portrait.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tilt the phone to the right. Give the phone a second or two to redraw in landscape.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tilt the phone upright.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Notice the text in the dialog changes from confirming an update to confirming a reset. Resetting a demo phone removes all of the demo content and apps and restores factory settings. To continue, tap
<strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you’ll see the goodbye screen. The phone should restart and display rotating gears as it removes the demo content and apps. After the phone restarts, it returns to the setup Welcome screen. At this point reset is complete, and the phone is no longer
 in retail mode.</p>

<p>Has anyone been succesful at setting these two up? I have SIP setting from RingCentral, installed the advanced voip settings for my phone, read suggestions from other threads (not necessarily for N8) and still nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also read that some have gotten it to work using Fring. That doesn't work for me either. Don't know if maybe I'm putting in the SIP info incorrectly.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone can lend a hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh good to know - I believe that the functionality for replying as HTML all the time is only available as an add-in for the desktop client, so I've added a

feature request to the Office 365 User Voice forum</a> requesting this functionality for the web client as well. I did some testing and I would guess that it's the plain text message replies that are causing your formatting to change, so I'm not sure that's
 something you can fix on the web client just yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Soft Reset:</strong><br />
Press and hold the <em>power</em>- and <em>volume-down</em> buttons pressed simultaneously for ten seconds. The phone should then vibrate and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hard Reset:</strong><br />
If a soft reset does not solve your problem, a hard reset (back to factory settings) might be your only option. To perform a hard reset press and hold the
<em>power</em>-, <em>volume-down</em>- and <em>camera</em> buttons until the phone vibrates. Then release the
<em>power</em>-button and keep the other two buttons pressed for another five seconds. The phone should reset to factory settings.</p>

<p>If none of these help; contact your local Nokia Care center for assistance.</p>

<h2>            Email addresses will not delete from Outlook and keep reappearing in Groups--Zombie contacts</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Office 2016 for Mac from Office 2011.&nbsp; I have one very frustrating issue that continues in the latest version.&nbsp; I maintain several group email lists of 100 or more members.&nbsp; I work hard to keep the lists up to date and to ensure that nobody
 gets email that they do not wish to receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But email addresses that I have removed (some more than a year ago) keep reappearing.&nbsp; They have been deleted from my Contact list.&nbsp; They have been X'd from individual email, but then reappear in the group email list.&nbsp; If I open the group list, there they
 are.&nbsp; Even if I have just X'd the address from an individual email (letting it make autocomplete suggestions so I can delete them by pressing the X), they still pop up in the group list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is exceedingly frustrating.&nbsp; I presume there is a cache somewhere, but I can find no instructions about accessing or deleting such.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise?&nbsp; How do I get delivered from these zombie email addresses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>B - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I struggled with this issue a year or two ago on a larger scale while attempting to consolidate, sync and link a number of disparate sets of contacts.&nbsp; What I ended up doing was fairly involved, and without checking my notes from the time I can't give a
 comprehensive solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, your issue is much less elaborate.&nbsp; If memory serves, the zombie contacts are coming from the actual Apple application "Contacts".&nbsp; I never used it, which is why it wasn't on my radar.&nbsp; But, because it is integrated into the OS, whether you use
 it or not it populates with contact information via the Internet Accounts Pane in your System Preferences.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First suggestion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In System Preferences&gt;Internet Accounts select the profile which you're using with Outlook.&nbsp; Make sure that the checkbox for "Contacts" is not checked.&nbsp; Delete the zombies from outlook and reboot the program to see if they reappear.&nbsp; Even if that relationship
 was the cause, I also suggest the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Applications&gt;Contacts.app and delete the zombies from your contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the deleted contacts continue to repopulate, more than likely your iCloud account is also involved, defaulted within the Contacts app to be the primary contact list and selected in the Internet Accounts Preference Pane for contact syncing.&nbsp; Uncheck contacts
 in the iCloud Internet Account Prefs Pane options, and/or set the Contacts app preference to indicate the local contact db is the primary source, which should then update the online copy to match.&nbsp; Of course, this won't be relevant if you've disabled the linking
 between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you won't need to even take that many steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my situation, I wanted to keep the System Pref link active because the Internet Account I was using was a Gmail account, and I wanted my Google Contacts to continue to sync with my iCloud account so that they would be&nbsp; backed up and updated on my iPhone.&nbsp;
 This setup utilizes the Contacts application on my laptop for that, and is useful for merging duplicates between the lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such, I was still experiencing a few strange anomalies even after solving most of the issues.&nbsp; If you are still having random unexplained zombie contacts, the following is likely the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original apple account was a .mac email address from the mid 90's.&nbsp; At some point, that account was migrated to the iLife service, which was then shifted to the iCloud setup currently being used.&nbsp; However, when I initially signed up to use iTunes many
 years ago, I used a different email address.&nbsp; At some later date Apple decided that they were going to integrate these logons and your iTunes user id was going to become an all things apple id.&nbsp; All good, except that there is no way to combine different apple
 id accounts.&nbsp; I was, however, able to find a way to link them and finally get rid of the last digital glitches causing Outlook to act so weird . . .
</p>
<p>If you decide multiple apple ids might be causing you problems, you'll have to make on an alias for the other on your mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, open System Preferences&gt;Users and Groups.&nbsp; Click the lock, bottom left, to make changes.&nbsp; Right click on yourself (current user) and select Advanced Options.&nbsp; Almost at the bottom, you should see your apple id (likely what you're using with icloud,
 itunes, or both.&nbsp; Under that, you should see the same id listed as an alias, as well as some other Hex and numberish stuff you don't wanna mess with.&nbsp; But, you do have the option of adding aliases, and that's what you'll want to do, using the email address
 which is the logon for your other apple id.&nbsp; Save all of that and restart everything and you should be good to go.&nbsp; Now, depending on whether your iCloud or Contacts is the master, you should be able to eliminate duplicates, link and consolidate everything,
 which in the end will mean that your Oulook won't be adding contact information via these various linked databases after you've deleted the contaccts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.&nbsp; I hope you'll be able to easily solve what I know from dealing with it is an extremely frustrating and baffling phenomenon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<h2>            IE Website Issue</h2>
                    <p>In Internet Explorer, I am trying to access a website that I have been using for a long while. Last week it began to show the following error:
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 20px">There was a temporary DNS error. Try refreshing the page.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">Error Code: INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 20px">At first, I thought it was an internet network issue, but I have since returned home and am having the same problem.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 20px">If it matters, I am running a Parallels partition on my Mac.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 20px">Thanks for any help.

<p>Thank you for the information. There is a possibility that the site's server is down that's why you cannot access it on any other browsers. We'd like to know what is the site that you are trying to access so we can try and replicate the issue and see if
 it will work here in our end.&nbsp; You can also contact the site support team directly for further assistance as to why you cannot access their website.

</p><p>Looks like a problem with the DNS lookup of that host name, an alias of it, or something that it redirects to. &nbsp; You could try using tracert to get more details about it.&nbsp; However, be aware that that would only be testing connectivity with the ICMP protocol,
 not the one that you wanted to use and therefore not necessarily even with the problem host.</p>

<h2>            Onenote web clipper notebook selection not functioning properly</h2>
                    <p>Onenote web clipper no longer displays my notebooks when I use my "work or school" account, however it works fine if I use my "microsoft account". &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71a92603-7438-4151-b9ea-4e41562a9dbc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71a92603-7438-4151-b9ea-4e41562a9dbc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_onenote-onenote_clipper/onenote-clipper/08940789-7ec3-4c39-9c6d-91df93105c39">
this</a> and similar posts, I suppose it can be blamed on the size of my Office 365/"work or school" account's onedrive folder size, but I'm not entirely sure if this is a problem I need to fix, or a problem that Microsoft is working on. &nbsp;I have ~65k items
 stored in my business OneDrive folder, but I seem to be obeying the limits set by microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SharePoint-Online-software-boundaries-and-limits-8f34ff47-b749-408b-abc0-b605e1f6d498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.
 &nbsp; Also, I'm not really sure where onedrive ends and sharepoint begins, and trying to view my current usage doesn't really help show my the "problem":</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e2c29e7-e0f0-4fa5-b343-f6e4e38049f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e2c29e7-e0f0-4fa5-b343-f6e4e38049f2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, the only (major) thing wrong with my Microsoft services is the inability to view OneNote notebooks in the Chrome OneNote Web Clipper, and if that is the only problem I'm having, then I suppose I can work around it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like a more definitive explanation of WHY using onedrive for too many files is a problem, HOW I should be doing things instead, and WHEN these confusing onedrive/sharepoint &amp; webclipper issues will be fixed, if ever. &nbsp;Thanks in advance and let me
 know if you have any questions.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience with this problem. &nbsp;I know that this is somewhat painful and doesn't make a lot of sense. &nbsp;To this end, there has been a lot of work behind the scenes here on the OneNote team to try to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday we published <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/onenotedev/2016/09/11/onenote-api-calls-fail-with-a-large-number-of-items-in-a-sharepoint-document-library/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a blog post</a> which talks a little bit about why this is happening and has a link to a tool that you can run which will analyze your SharePoint library and has recommendations on how to work around the problem. &nbsp;Hopefully this is a good step to getting a
 handle on how to best manage these large libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any feedback or are still running into problems after following the recommendations then let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>
<p>-Chad</p>
