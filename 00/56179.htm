<h2>            Adjusted time keeps reverting back to the incorrect time</h2>
                    We have Windows 2008 server edition. When I correct the time, in a little bit it goes back to the incorrect time. Any ideas?

    <title>windows 7&#58; Can&#39;t get HDMI audio - the hdmi device does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spedlifeslow  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7&#58; Can&#39;t get HDMI audio - the hdmi device does not appear under the playback devices</h2>
                    so yeah you've probably gathered my problem from my title.<br />
<br />
i have an integrated intel graphics chip (interestingly enough the intel control pane,l through which i used to control the majority of the devices functions, did not survive the upgrade... it is nowhere to be found)<br />
<br />
so i've updated the drivers, and checked the playback devices, and my hdmi cables are plugged in<br />
i get video but no audio, and am not sure i am just missing something simple.<br />
<br />
eitherway i've done a lot of searching and have yet to find an answer any help would be much appreciated!

            <p>Hello spedlifeshow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue here can be one of several issues, the following may apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The HDMI graphics card may support HDMI Video, but may not support HDMI Audio</li><li>You may need to set the HDMI audio device as the default sound device</li><li>You may need to update your HDMI video card drivers for your version of Windows</li><li>If your HDMI video card does not support audio, you may need to connect additional audio cables between the PC and TV</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the steps for some of these issues see the following No sound tutorial (look on the Check your Hardware tab under HDMI cables).</p>
<p><u><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/no-sound-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/no-sound-in-windows</span></a></span></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you connected any external devices other than Mouse and keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue with the disk drivers. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Perform startup repair and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Startup Repair: frequently asked questions:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Access System Recovery option and then perform system restore to a point when the computer was working fine and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>What are the system recovery options in Windows Vista?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard, then disconnect the external device and then restart the computer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Something that might be related is that the Product Key is for Windows 8.0 upgrade......but in fact, it was installed to a clean drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there is some inconsistency with the authentication that does not match somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the updates file and I see it also had one update run during January 2017 that was successful so it must be a setting somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response but this machine is only one of about ten that I have operational and as long as the machine is not a high priority, I will ignore it until it gets fixed....</p>

</p><p><strong>I bought 4 Product Keys directly through the Microsoft store....due to the "antiquated" previous operating systems that I had legitimate keys for, the extremely modern hardware would not load Windows XP for me to install the O/S as an upgrade.&nbsp; The

<p>
</p><p><strong>The MS Store told me that the "only solution" was to resell the upgrades to someone else and repurchase all new versions of the Windows OEM 8.1.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply....<br />
I did some extensive research even though I do work about 80+ hours a week....do to the fact the the system was just "revitalized" momentarily, I have come up with some optional choices.<br />
1. Norton....i keep a rolling subscription.....my Norton never expires as when it is time to update it, I simply use the new Product Key.&nbsp; I do have the option to uninstall the old one and update everything as needed but I ensure that every device is set with
 high security.&nbsp;&nbsp; No...I don't have anything personal on that machine at all...it is just a "toy" for the time being with a big 32 - inch RCA HD TV as the monitor. &nbsp;<br />
Due to the fact that I do extensive support work for many of the senior citizens here as free gratis, I often get my subscription extended very often by 30 days as a result of working with Norton support....<br />
The current subscription expires in September 2017 but I already have two additional future Product Keys for the Norton Security Premium that can keep Norton alive and well for up to 10 devices on each key.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Created: 01/02/2017<br />
<br />
3. Maybe.....Norton Family 01/19/2017<br />
<br />
4a. Maybe there was a misunderstanding or something to do with the number of works I work every week 80+ .....but whatever I posted or intended to post was the fact that my "old" PC's had Windows XP....(Both of them were OEM Product Keys...ones that I used
 to build the old systems many years ago....so my ORIGINAL intention was to try and load XP on the new systems then transfer the data then dismantle the old ones and use the parts for other tasks as needed.&nbsp; The fact that the motherboards were advertised by
 Gigabyte to accept the earlier XP O/S on initial install and the fact that they never succeeded, was the downfall of ordering the Windows 8.0 Upgrade Keys and the installation media.<br />
That was my original intention ...I even went to all of the research sites downloading the "white papers" on the motherboard, the AMD A10 processor because all I really intended to do was to build a "more modern PC"....not a Gamer PC.....just something "reliable"....To
 me, I simply want something dependable...so going to all the manufacturers sites...even the QVL for the tested memory and the entire process of trying to ensure that every angle was covered....but when the system failed to load XP....I even ordered some special
 SATA hard drives that were the same "small" drives initially just like they were in 2002.&nbsp; At the time, I was a Beta Tester for Microsoft running 10 machines in a school lab so I was very buried into digging up all the resources as possible hoping to make
 it work.&nbsp; I figured that I would load the old XP on to a primary physical drive (a 120 GB drive since that was what the drive sizes were in the days of the XP BIOS limitations)..... then when I was going to do the upgrade, I would use my big 2.5 TB drives
 to install the Win 8.0 upgrade and then be off &amp; running.....but it took many months of trying to experiment ...but in reality, I became very consumed with a job reassignment that now consumed an additional 40 hours a week that I had no ability to refuse or
 turn down without losing my chance for retirement later.....(being "salaried" for the State of Texas....they tell you in a very certain way that since one is salaried, they get paid to work 24 hours a day if needed....That is the main reason the project fell
 down because I no longer had a daily ability to keep my mind fresh with where I was on a daily basis.&nbsp; It sat on the work bench for 18 months and it finally became very depressing to keep having to work this new assignment.....with no compensation.....just
 more &amp; more work piled onto my daily plate which caused an extreme overload to have to take work home every day and work until the wee hours of the morning rewriting the curriculum and updating digital images of everything required.....I mean a REAL sour taste
 in one's mouth to have to keep the fire burning of the candles at both ends.&nbsp; What really upset the apple cart&nbsp; is that the agency went through numerous budget cuts and all of the people who have numerous certifications and years of technical experience were
 transferred to some other positions that have nothing to do with their background.....we just became gloried teachers to do the jobs that no one else ever wanted.....so it was take the job or just be laid off permanently....."Go Figure).....To tell you truly,
 there was never a clean "8.1" install.....it was a clean "8.0" install, using the only workaround that enabled me to either throw everything in the trash due to the numerous failures that I had due to some Hardware Tester who claimed that the entire system
 would load XP....but after looking at all my financial losses and time lost and all of my frustrations....I did a clean install using the 8.0 upgrade installation media and it passed the authentication checks (to my surprise) and once I had the ver. 8.0 successfully
 loaded and all of the updates completed, I thought all of my problems had ended....BUT....being forced to work these LONG grueling works ever since....the ONLY time I was able to work on the system in July 2015 was when I had a few days off on vacation time.&nbsp;
 I don't remember the exact details now but MAYBE that was when I finally was able to get a clean install with the ver. 8.0 O/s..????&nbsp; I'm sure you can imagine my extreme frustration and disappointment after having tried so many things, even going very "old
 school" and trying to load XP on the hard drive somehow just so it could be recognized as a qualifier to do the upgrade to 8.0....then to make the 8.1 conversion as well.&nbsp; I used to have run the roads all over the State of Texas doing tech support in the field
 on SCO UNIX and doing systems administrator duties having as many as eight PCs in my office running support and that was a "worthy" 80 hours a week making everyone happy that all their problems were fixed quickly.....but now...all of my former talents have
 went to waste &nbsp;<br />
I should interject that all of my tech support was from 1994 to 2000, working within the corporate structure.&nbsp; Many jobs in the state get cut by the budget every few years;&nbsp; Either you pick up from all the broken pieces and try to move on or you simply go stand
 in the unemployment line forever....Due to the budget, I was reassigned in 2000 to teach a vocational computer maintenance technician program because I was the only applicant with the credentials....<br />
Laid off again in 2003 because the state legislators didn’t give the agency enough funding....I had to physically move 5 hours away as I was lucky enough to pick up one of only two jobs leftover after all the dust settled from the layoffs.&nbsp; Previously, I help
 a corporate position as I could easily work from a remote office and work online as well into the corporate location.&nbsp; The new job I was awarded required me to use all of my PC tech experience and rebuild a complete industrial print shop that covered two floors
 and had about 75 workers there...I had to replace every piece of hardware and buy hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment to bring their technology from the old antiquated Windows 3.1 (ha-ha-ha) to modern computers and printers, presses, literally dozens
 of specialty equipment, especially when I was given the task of directing their Video Operations team....creating 450 video titles in five years that were brought out of the dungeon as 16mm Video tapes and brought into modern conversions of DVD videos.&nbsp; These
 were all state owned so you can imagine the work and the time invested in such a job....Fast forward to 2008 when the house I was still buying back in my home town 250 miles away was always needing maintenance.&nbsp; The renters didn’t take good care of things
 and after installing two new A/C systems in five years, I was desperate for a transfer HOME....I was put on a transfer list which meant that the first job that came open was mine; like it or not.&nbsp; It was a job teaching at-risk populations such simple things
 as how to make better choices in life.... That was the end of my road for utilizing any of my former high tech experience....I was so used to working in high tech environments all the way back to the 70’s when I worked as an Aircraft Electrician in the U.S.
 Navy.&nbsp; That is what got me started into the computer world as the Navy jets used on-board computer equipment for their Automatic Flight control and navigation information.&nbsp; Anyway, ever since 2008, my brain was been re-programmed and my tech abilities wasted
 forever unless I do all my tech support for friends and associates routinely.<br />
I bought the keys directly through the Microsoft site in April 2014, and the next job reassignment wasn't until August 2015 so all the time that I had working on the initial prototype took nearly 10 months....For whatever reason, there was no one to turn to
 and rely on answers because of the "upgrade" only category of the Keys that were purchased.&nbsp; I still have two keys that have never been used to this day so I consider the whole project a big failure.&nbsp; The dates look strange because I did Start in Nov. 2014....but
 I didn't get the system moving again until July 2015.&nbsp; It wasn’t until recently that I was finally TIRED of seeing this project being nothing but a “dust collector”.&nbsp; I have always had extreme energy all my life and working 20 hours a day is very typical sometimes....I
 just grab a cat nap when it becomes over bearing...but just getting the system OFF the bench was a big relief.....I bought the RCA TV in Nov. 2015 and it sat in the box until just recently......so I guess you can imagine how much I look to retire as soon as
 possible but my retirement salary won’t even pay the bills...so I have to find ANOTHER JOB just to supplement my retirement.&nbsp; I wished I could have went to Intel, AMD, or even Microsoft with all of my potential 30 or 40 years ago and made a much better career
 somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Already cleared up I hope!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4c. Hopefully, I have given you enough to straighten out this mess...</p>

<p>
</p><p>6a. Ah.....yes.....exactly the version you suggested here..the same (v18.0.0.232) but it shows to be "out of date"&nbsp; and "Update Now"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:.....I don't have any personal information on this PC but I thought long &amp; hard about my OTHER options that I have...maybe only because of doing so much free gratis tech support work here I have bought numerous good deals here &amp; there when the opportunity
 exists...\\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what inspires you to spend so much time just working on my issue but I want you to know that the reason my answer is so long - winded is mostly because we both have something in common....</p>
<p>We Care About People)....</p>
<p>Just getting your responses has reignited within my brain a POTENTIAL OPTION that MIGHT FIX this problem for GOOD.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that among all my recent collections of software I have some Windows 7 OEM&nbsp; 32/64 bit installation media with their original Product Keys (ones that I didn't have previously).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that I can simply take some new Hard drives that I just received and install those and load Windows 7 Professional on them as a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN...I can use my Windows 8.0 to upgrade all of those.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do the upgrade to Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN do all the updates ......</p>
<p>Then reload all the Applications ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why didn't I think of this option LONG AGO????</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brain might be a bit rusty.....but sometimes it does come up with a solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please accept my extreme appreciation for rekindling my old technical approach to things....I THINK that will be a confirmed kill on this issue and it can be done completely LEGAL 100%</p>

<p>Hi there QuastenKevin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I understand there is an issue with launching Forza 4. I recommend to try the following article:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/errors/error-code-0x803F8001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Error 0x803F8001 occurs when you launch an Xbox One game</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this out and let us know the results. </p>

<p>did you purchase the game or are you playing it through game pass?</p>
<p>check that your game pass hasn't expired as that would give that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you bought the game or your game pass is paid up, before you try a full uninstall/reinstall, try deleting your account from your xbox, hold the power button for 10 seconds until it powers down, leave it for a minute or 2 then switch it back on and add
 your account to the xbox again.</p>
<p>let FH4 sync your save from the cloud when you start the game or you will lose your progress<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>just make sure you know your email and password before you remove the account<br />

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Essentials will not sent email</h2>
                    <p>My home Comcast emails just quit two days ago. &nbsp;I was using POP. &nbsp;The new Comcast settings are for IMAP. &nbsp;So I reloaded the Windows Live Mail 2012/ Essentials program and rebooted. &nbsp;Then removed the accounts and put in new accounts with IMAP. &nbsp;Now I can
 receive but no sent emails. &nbsp;I followed Comcast Sheet of instructions dated May 15, 2015. &nbsp;IMAP account Incoming IMAP on 993 &nbsp; with outgoing smpt on 587 with SSL checked on both. &nbsp;Then I have changed port numbers around etc to no avail. &nbsp;Every time I send
 a email it, small box, &nbsp;says to retry there is a problem &nbsp; and the last error message was different:</p>
<p>Your IMAP command could not be sent to the server, due to non-network errors. This could, for example, indicate a lack of memory on your system.<br />

<p>
</p><p>You will need to contact Pentax for any driver updates. Microsoft cannot create drivers for 3rd party hardware products.</p>

    <title>Uninstalled headphones from Windows 10&#58; How do I use them - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gm_3826  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalled headphones from Windows 10&#58; How do I use them again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK, I just want to make it clear that this is a problem with me, not Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10 my headphones worked perfectly fine... But after accidentally plugging them into the wrong port, I thought that they must have stopped working. So, I followed the instructions of an online website to delete the drivers from Windows
 10. It was stated that they would be reinstalled, but even after buying a new headset and seeing if plugging it in worked, uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers for Realtek HD Audio Manager, and checking to see if the websites for the manufacturer of the
 first headset had the drivers (they did not), I have found that I cannot use a headset of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although my microphone, speakers, and literally everything else audio-related works, Windows 10 does not recognize my headphones. None of the fixes I have been able to find work, and all of them seem to be related to an entirely separate problem.</p>
<p><br />
How do you fix this problem?</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e7a6a70f-ded4-4e6c-88ad-11326553adb4" title="AO1981">AO1981</a><span>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know about this issue. If the keys are stuck then the only way is to push it in (no too much, just to get the keys in the middle) and push it out. If it is still the same then we highly suggest you turn this in to a<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Microsoft Store</a> since that is a hardware issue and take advantage of your warranty status. Just bring with you any proof of purchase if your purchased it outside Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answer helped you decide quickly,</p>
<p>

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have already tried to do as you suggested but am unable to re install Incredimail due to the VBScript error.&nbsp; I have tried re registering the VBScript, I have also done a clean boot and as a paid memeber of incredimail I am
 in contact with them but they say that the VBScript error is not due to Incredimail.&nbsp; I am able to use my e-mail through my ISP but am reluctant to uninstall Incredimail as this VBScript will not allow me to download a new version or indeed an old version
 and I have a lot of files saved that I would ultimately lose.&nbsp; I agree with you that there must be some corrupt files as in addition to this problem if I attempt to send an e-mail anything that I type into the dialogue box I can see as I type it but when it
 gets to it's destination it is blank although if I add an attachement, that is readable at the destination.

<h2>            My Intel Graphics Card crashes&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm a WIndows user who recently upgraded to Windows 10. Ever since I upgraded, my Intel Graphics Card randomly crashes(what happens is in the pictures), and I don't know why. It says "Display driver Intel HD Graphics Drivers for WIndows 8(R) stopped
 responding and has successfully recovered." This never happened when it was a Windows 8, and whenever I'm playing a game, the Graphics card crash has a chance of freezing the game window, and it really annoys me. I have updated the driver, and even resetted
 my PC(Keep my files) &nbsp;and this still happens. Does anyone have a solution to this?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Compatible Monitor NOT Compatible</h2>
                    <p>I bought a New ELEMENT HDTV to use as my main monitor. The box says it is compatible with Windows 10. The box says the screen resolution should be set at 1366x768, but that doesn't exist on Windows 10. The images show, but they are a tad squatty and I look
 chubby. I don't like looking chubby. I'm a vain Movie Star (Back Ground, but don't tell my ego that). A screen popped up saying that I had the resolution set too high and I should set it at 1366x768. So Windows detected it, but it wouldn't allow me to change
 it to that.</p>

<p>You know it hears you, just lacks the ability to comprehend.</p>

            Don't be absurd. I have speech recognition on my Mac and it worked better without training than the speech recognition works in Windows with several sessions of training.&nbsp; We have speech recognition on our phones, too, and we all know it works much better
 there than in Windows 10.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So now please tell us the truth.&nbsp; Why does speech recognition suck so bad in Windows 10?

            The others are right. Google's speech recognition requires no training, Siri requires no training, Cortana also doesn't require any training. They recognize speech just fine. WSR does not. It appears to be the same bad old technology used in previous versions
 of Windows. Even with training, it is awful. It needs to be updated. I can't believe that in 2016, years after I've been using it on Android, Windows still doesn't have a decent speech recognition that would allow me to dictate an email or an IM with my friends
 without having to actually type. And I can't seem to find a decent 3rd party app either.

            I have a dyslexic friend&nbsp;and they bought a windows 10 PC to help with writing. The speech recognition does not work effectively. It cannot even understand "start listening". Is there a better version coming? What software third party&nbsp;&nbsp;works well?

            It is just inadequate and outdated piece of software which did not really improve at all compared to old versions of Windows.&nbsp; Shame on Microsoft - they would have been better off removing it altogether....

            <p>Hi Solene, </p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, we don't have any update with regards to a newer version of Speech Recognition. The success of getting the Speech Recognition to work properly depends on a few requirements and setups. Check these links:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/bdfc3c3f-6804-44a9-9d80-57a21bc9146f/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-10#v1h=tab02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use voice recognition in Windows 10</a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14198/windows-7-dictate-text-using-speech-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dictate text using Speech Recognition</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few apps available in the Store that works like the native Windows Speech Recognition feature. Please understand that these are third party apps, we don't have direct control over the functionality of those apps. Here are some of those apps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Text-To-Speech by Morphsoft</li><li>Text to Speech TTS by POONFAMILY<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I have the same concerns using a Surface Pro 4 w/ Win 10. All settings checked, training done, but the results are less than hit or miss, and the little text window that pops up on Surface resolution is even less helpful.</p>

More like they all suck less than Windows 10 :-)<br />
<br />
Basically they are all bad. If they did work correctly we would have a massive amount of software tools and apps being used on the market right now because we are currently in urgent need to talk to our phones to finally free up our hands and eyes.<br />
<br />
Speech recognition must be the least used feature on smartphones.<br />
<br />
Yet the unlocked potential that remains will révolutionnize our lives.<br />
<br />
Know when you need gps to get somewhere so you:<br />
<br />
1) find phone<br />
2) grab phone<br />
3) open display<br />
4) swipe screen<br />
app is not in home page<br />
5) swipe 3 more times<br />
6)open google map<br />
7)locate and tap the "from"adress input field to put it in focis<br />
8) type in the address, sometimes having to stall on a vowel letter to print &nbsp;an 'é' or swaping to the "Sym" keyboard then subwiping to 2/2 to print an '¿'or '°' or.. (geez I actually have to do this to explain it and i'm frustratd by it already.)<br />
<br />
<br />
It goes on, and in we havent even started the navigation yet.<br />
<br />
Using instead a voice command on a very smart phone would go like this<br />
<br />
1) Go Go Gadget Google Map send me to "destination_place_holder"<br />
<br />
(Nonthing else to do, the option to automatically enable GPS is easy to code, google is just slow)<br />
<br />
If we really had mastered speech reckognition it would as easy as asking your friend to do it for you cuz your driving.<br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't be sending this reply using my phone's keyboard like I am now and i'd be lightyears ahead of this point in my text because I would be talk-xting instead of texting.<br />
<br />
Texting and driving is apparently killing more people on the roads than alcohol.<br />
<br />
I feek like the industry has abandonned the field of speech recognition. Researcher's block?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Google Apple qualcomm and samsung certainly haven't achieved anything else than disapoint me in this matter and i'm thinking of the dead people...is google thinkong about them? Ok harsh sorry

    <title>Is it true that &#34;signature edition&#34; laptops are actually - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francisjin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it true that &#34;signature edition&#34; laptops are actually second-hand ones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I came to St. Louis Galleria Microsoft Store for a Dell XPS 13 2015 edition i7 512G version because your online store shows "out of stock" (I also purchased my SP3 there). After paying for the laptop and the 2-year warranty stuff, I went home and opened
 the box, only to find the plastic package had obviously been opened before. Then I went back to the store for a swap, amazingly the people in the store told me all "signature edition" laptops are opened by technicians to remove bloatware and there's no un-opened
 ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kind of believe them because at first I was there for a swap not a return and there was no reason for them not to swap it for me. I will start school tomorrow so I can't wait for online purchase and I settled for an MacBook. I do some financial modeling
 stuff and really need Windows version Excel, although I can do it on my other PC, I really prefer a PC than a Mac, and it was a little disappointing that I didn't purchase the Dell XPS 13 successfully.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, today I begin to wonder whether they were telling me the truth. I am a little angry now because maybe the thing was they were trying to sell me a refurbished one instead of a new one and that made me unable to purchase a brand new PC laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is: were they telling me the truth or were they lying (not one, but four people in that store told me the same stuff) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Francis</p>

            <p>First of all, the most important thing is that; does the machine work and you have no problems with it?&nbsp; Also, you have a 2 year warranty which is in place as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may sound odd, but Microsoft does have a policy for the "online" store that the machines sold by them do not have 'bloatware' and is possible that they did open up the boxes and removed it from those machines.&nbsp; They can still be sold as new if that is
 what they are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it is odd!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend to contact customer support via phone and ask them if that is the policy for the 'brick and mortar' stores as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the most important thing is that the machine is "NEW" and works!&nbsp; A dead machine does you no good in class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the web link to support's main page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact them by phone if you can and talk to them about it.&nbsp; Other brand computers are loaded with 'bloatware' but Microsoft sells (online, that is) machines that only have Office 365 trial on them.&nbsp; In fact, a lot of people like that the best and they sell
 all brands, not just the Surface tablets.</p>

            <p>I think you can attempt to contact customer support (https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us) but it will probably do not much good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worth a try, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, Microsoft's "signature edition" is a machine shipped to them for sale that only has the operating system and the 60 day trial of Office 365 (no bloatware). &nbsp;What happened in your case was a standard shipment of machines was delivered and the
 employees went through each one to "correct" them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Legally, those can be sold as new and in fact, it would probably be better than a fresh machine "out of the box". &nbsp;It has been powered up and tested in order to reset the software suite on them.</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the info, I will try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I can't agree with you that an opened "signature edition" is better than a fresh machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I don't think local Microsoft Stores have any professional place or human resource for this "signature edition" process.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Where are they doing it? at the back of the office? </li><li>How is the environment compared with a Dell or Lenovo factory? </li><li>Do they wash hands or wear gloves and can I see oil on my "brand new" laptop?
</li><li>What tools are they using and are they certified by Dell or Microsoft? </li><li>Are the stuff trained and follow a certain procedure like a worker at the assembly line or they do it randomly?
</li><li>Are there any standard or evaluation to the removal of bloatware for different brands and types?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>No, they are no better than a "laptop doctor" shop in any street just because they carry a Microsoft name. They are causing harm instead of adding value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When buying a laptop, physical cleanness and nice packaging are part of the price you pay.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If MS Stores can't offer both fresh and bloatware-free at the same time, at least give us both choices.
</li><li>In my case they simply don't have "fresh" ones. Consider how many stock they have and it just raise that question again: who is doing this?</li><li>And a better way would be providing customers guides on how to do it themselves or offering onsite service after they purchase a fresh laptop.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Special thanks to the word "fresh", learning English everyday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may try to delete the file from safe mode and check.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on the computer.<br />
a. Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Disk Cleanup, and then, in the list of results, click Disk Cleanup.
<br />
b. In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK.<br />
c. In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, on the Disk Cleanup tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click OK.<br />
d. In the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
For more information refer the link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a><br />
<strong>Data loss Warning:</strong> Converting a hard disk partition or volume from NTFS to FAT32 requires that you reformat the partition, which deletes any data on it. Be sure to back up any data you want to keep before you begin.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong><span>You may also run a
<span>Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />
</span></span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span><span><br />
<b>Disclaimer:</b><br />
If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So yo</span><span>u have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with
 virus then they might even get deleted</span><br />
<div>You may also refer the suggestions provided on a similar thread and check if it helps:<br />
