<h2>            Windows 10 - hidden drive - System Volume Information - Low Disk Space</h2>
                    <p>I think the windows 10 install created a partition on my computer - Drive E that shows up in File explorer without any files in it.&nbsp; I just recently started getting a popup error Low disk space on that drive multiple times a day.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is not a drive I can see/maintain, what do I need to do to either increase this drive space, clean/remove some of the contents or something else to keep this error from displaying multiple times a day?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The properties of the drive has 403MB/ 46.2 mb free.&nbsp; I have already emptied the recycle bin and did a disk cleanup</p>

            This is a known issue with 1803. It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered and you start getting low space notifications. You can do following to hide it and there will be no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and Run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume e
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=e

            Hi Sandie, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the second Command window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume E
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=E
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />That's It!

            The enforcement team does not use the forums and there is no way to contact them other than a case review. If you haven't tried already, try a hard reset (hold the power button down on the console until it turns off, unplug it, plug it back in, then restart)
 and see if it lets you get back online.&nbsp;

 says i completed the suspension though . &nbsp;Gonna try what another person recommended and see if that works&nbsp;

<p>just gonna tow a spanner into the works here.... could it be possible that the ban was extended due to the long Easter weekend. meaning nobody is in the office to raise the ban? I work for a telephone and broadband company and if somebody doesn't pay their
 bills we suspend their services. if a customer then pays the office is closed by using our automated services, the customer will not have services resumed until the office reopens.</p>

<p>@Bailout Baino - First I wanted to mention for future reference that an enforcement action will never be extended simply because it's a holiday weekend.&nbsp; That's not how enforcements work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@adamcalvert - Any enforcement action should be listed at the enforcement website.&nbsp; If your enforcement was extended for an extra day it's likely that the PET discovered something else with your account and decided that an extra day was appropriate for your
 account.&nbsp; Please wait it out and then continue playing safely and following the rules when your tag is released.</p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
Hey! What's up?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
So, I bought my Lenovo AIO 310 back in June 2018 and it's awesome, I love it!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I use it to record my music, Netflix, FBook and whatnot. The youzh.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I don't have much software on it, just Cubase, SampleTank 3, etc.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I updated Windows 10 and that's when it started to freeze.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
It doesn't matter what I'm doing, it just freezes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I turn it off and on and that's it.&nbsp;I've tried to give it time to "come back" but no, 2 hours pass by and nothing happens.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I saw on a YouTube video that I should troubleshoot to see what could be wrong with it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I gave it a try but it's frozen! I can't do anything! The mouse is off, the Keyboard has one green button but after pressing some keys, it doesn't do anything! And now, it turned off after 8 minutes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
Also, I don't know how to do the Alt+Tab and Ctrl+Tab+Delt thing.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
I can sometimes use the computer for a few hours, between crashes and nothing I'm working on seems to specifically trigger them.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
Sometimes it is just while I'm Reading a website and I try to scroll down to the next part and find that it is frozen, or if I'm watching YouTube, Netflix, listening to music, recording on Cubase, it freezes and makes a noise because of what I was watching
 or doing.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
It comes and goes like in periods of 20 or so days without crashes, but it is really annoying when they comes back.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
As I said, I only use it for work.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
So, what can I do? I don't want to take it to some "tech", because I've had a bad experience with that.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
If they can't find a solution they just say "I'm gonna have to erease everything..." and I don't want that, my work is in here!&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
Anyway, I hope you guys can help me out. Thanks for reading. Happy Holidays!</p>

            Hi  EV539 
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing you.
<br />
<br />It is likely a recently installed cumulative update is causing this.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings
<br />Click Restart
<br />Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
<br />Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability is restore. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Hi EV.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try to repair it then Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Its not possible to buy and activate the same subscription before the current subscription has expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution you have now is either to buy another subscription or to purchase some credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know that 300 minutes/month is not enough for you, then you should buy a subscription with more minutes.</p>

<h2>            When an international call is received, a 1 is added to the front of the country code</h2>
                    <p>Problem:</p>
<p>When an international call is received, a 1 is added to the front of the country code when number appears in recent calls, so when you try to call back call will fail. For some reason (my be accidentally) contact detail of that number get corrupted also.
 In my case:</p>
<p>Call from UK&nbsp; should appear as +44xxxxxx, but when it appears in recent numbers is +144xxxxxxx ( extra 1 in front of it) and if you try to call it back you can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue start showing since change over to new app on phones and androids, however, it seems lap top is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems for an unknown reason number US country code is added to front of caller country code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why can't we contact Skype support? Even a paying customer like me.</p>

<p>Hi Marites,</p>
<p>Thanks for your notes, I receive calls and make calls (from and to) 3 different countries, I have seen this issue with all three locations, I have reinstall the apps few times, in all cases problem persist.
<br />
<br />
Some more details:<br />
I have a Microsoft Lumia 600 phone, two androids and one IPhone, my favorite phone for Skype was Lumia 600 (I also had a Lumia 5xx) perfect sound clear voice best ever for Skype. When new software was forced and new app came about I was required to upgrade,
 since the upgrade nothing works as good and this problem and some other issues started.
<br />
<br />
From my own experience as a retired telephony software support engineer, I am guessing this problem is a simple issue, when a call is received USA country code is added (country code 1) to front of actual country code. I wonder if phone default country code
 is a different from calling country the default code will be added to front of caller country code.</p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Massood</span><br />

<br />
Ron531, in the event you elect to follow the tutorials linked by etc123, please consider the following.<br />
<br />
First, before any registry edit, be sure to do a complete registry backup.&nbsp; For the most effective backup, ERUNT is recommended:<br />
<br />
<ul>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<li>Download <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Registry-Tweak/Erunt-g.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ERUNT</a> to your desktop&nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li>Double-click the downloaded file to install ERUNT&nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Un</strong> -check the NTREGOPT desktop shortcut option&nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li>Click <strong>No</strong> when presented the option to run ERUNT at Windows startup.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</li><li>During the installation, tick Launch ERUNT&nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Accept the default option for running a backup&nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>ERUNT will then backup your registry </li></ul>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> In the event you need to restore your registry, go to the folder and start ERDNT.exe<br />
<br />
Next, note that the image in the linked tutorial for disabling startup items in Windows 7 includes disabling the antivirus software.&nbsp; This is
<strong>NOT</strong> recommended.&nbsp; In the event you have a lot of programs conflicting with each other at startup, I suggest using a safe program for managing startup.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.winpatrol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WinPatrol</a> was developed by Microsoft MVP Bill Pytlovany and works with Windows 95 through and including Windows 7.&nbsp; &gt;<br />
<br />
WinPatrol includes Delayed Start which allows you to specify the time to wait before launching programs which may typically try to load while other system initialization are happening. This feature of WinPatrol will greatly accelerate your system startup time.&nbsp;
 You can also use WinPatrol to disable the startup of unnecessary programs at the Windows launch function .&nbsp; See additional information on WinPatrol Features at
http://www.winpatrol.com/features.html . <br />

            Hi, Ron531.<br />
<br />
You may want to run <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> to reclaim some space taken up by the install program.
<br />
<ol>
<li>To launch Disk Cleanup, click the Start Orb and begin typing <em>disk cleanup</em> .&nbsp; Windows 7 Search will quickly locate the application.
</li><li>In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive where Windows 7 is installed and click OK.
</li><li>In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, click "Clean up System Files" and click OK.&nbsp; (<strong>Note</strong> :&nbsp; Files identified as "Files discarded by Windows upgrade" include the Windows.old folder.&nbsp;
 Be completely certain you do not need these files or copy the Windows.old folder to another partition or an external drive first.)
</li><li>You will be presented with a screen showing the amount of disk space that Disk Cleanup will free.&nbsp;
</li><li>If you have installed a lot of new programs, you may want to include "More Options" to remove all but the most recent restore point.&nbsp;
</li><li>When you are satisfied that you have selected all the files for removal, click OK.
</li><li>When Disk Cleanup has completed collecting the files to be removed, click Delete files.&nbsp;
</li></ol>

    <title>Xbox one power button blinking whilst console is turned ON&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unlovedspade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one power button blinking whilst console is turned ON&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is anybody else having this problem?</p>
<p>4 days ago I noticed my power button on the console was blinking whilst I was playing a game -
<em><u>That is key, the console is always turned on for this</u></em>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I contacted support and they suggested the following;</p>
<p>- Hard reset (Didn't work)</p>
<p>- Change the mode from 'Power' to 'Energy saving' (Didn't work)</p>
<p>- Factory reset console (Didn't work)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As of today, 2nd November 2016, it's still happening and I haven't a clue why as to why it's happening.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Although, I was advised to change the location of where my console is plugged in, as apparently a cause of this could be the fact there's not enough power being generated, which I find odd&nbsp;as my console runs perfectly and it's been in the same place for a year without any issues. Also it's plugged directly into the wall, doesn't overheat and my power brick always shows the white light.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please, can anybody offer any help on this?</p>

<p>- It only does it now and then, sometimes more often then not. For example, yesterday I was playing Rainbow 6 siege and it happened 3 times within two rounds, it's real confusing as nothing is effected, my system still runs perfectly during this.</p>

            <p>So im not alone!!</p><p>Ive been having this problem with my console too. Ill be playing a game (Gears 4 if it matters) and at random intervals my power button on the front of the console will flash repeatedly like it does when its trying to sync a pad!! Sometimes there is a clicking noise coming from within the xbox. It is very worrying to me as no one else has had this problem...until i found this post that is.</p><p>It seems that pressing the sync button on the pad gets it to stop, but only for a moment as it soon starts again. Other than the flashing light, the power button does not respond when it is pressed. There are no other issues, no technical problems. the games run smoothly, etc. But this is very worrying.</p><p>There are no other instances of this happening anywhere online that i can find. **** is going on!</p><p>Also...as of last night, my xbox has decided to turn itself off whilst loading an online game...that may sound strange, but this also happened to 4 other firends at the ex

<p>Nah this not an auto update thing...im a heavy player and my xbox is right under the tv so i can see when it starts flashing and it has only started doing this recently within the last couple of weeks. The pulse of light is different to that of an update pulse. The update pulse seems slow and slowly constant...this is a very quick pulsing and it strangely seems to stop when the sync button is pressed on the top of the pad. But as soon as it stops...it does it again minutes after, sometimes accompanied with a clicking noise from within the xbox itself.</p><p>Deffo not an update light...i know what that looks like.<br /></p><p /></blockquote><p />

<h2>            Wifi Disconnect and Reconnect Help</h2>
                    im using lenovo laptop, win 7 x64, ultimate, my ISP is PLDT , plan 1299 dsl + landline with wifi 1mbps.. my internet connection is almost a year old , but my problem started just recently, i dont know if the problem is in my laptop or internet connection
 but ill just describe it...<br />
<br />
PROBLEM:<br />
whenever i surf internet using my laptop thats connected to my home wifi, i works alright for 5-10mins and suddenly it goes wrong. whenever i click something , like links button on webpage or reload ,suddenly the problem appears it disconnects and reconnects
 my wifi thats why i cant use the internet effectively. the problem appear randomly and its such a pain. can't download,upload, and it even stops pages from loading. the disconnect and reconnect only happen 2secs. but randomly like 10-20 sec interval. my desktop
 is connected to the same router of the wifi using a cable and it is unaffected by the disconnect of connection that leads to me that the problem is on my laptop. but it works perfectly all these days, i even play online games and work perfect but now that
 problem happens.<br />
i dont change any settings here in my laptop it just suddenly happens, it started when my desktop has been reformatted, but i think its irrelevant.<br />
other devices and laptops that connects on my wifi dont have ds problem.<br />
can some please help. <br />
i already checked the network devices if its driveers are outdated but it says its up to date. here are other info.

Method 2:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
This issue may occur if the Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication for this network check box is selected. If this check box is selected, but there is no server to authenticate against, the connection is disconnected. If you reestablish the wireless network connection,
 it disconnects again after a short time.<br />
<br />
To disable IEEE 802.1X authentication, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Click Start, type ncpa.cpl, and then hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Right-click your wireless network connection, and then clicks Properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Click the Wireless Networks tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d. Under Preferred networks, click your wireless network, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e. Click the Authentication tab, click to clear the Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication for this network check box, and then click OK two times.</span></p>

    <title>SOLVED - Pitch black on my screen looks mid-to-dark grey - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SOLVED - Pitch black on my screen looks mid-to-dark grey</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my computer today, and for some reason all the colors are bright.&nbsp; I don't remember doing anything to cause this, although I suppose it's possible.&nbsp; Pitch black on my screen right now looks like what a mid grey should look like.<br />
<br />
At first I thought it might have been an issue with my monitor, so I tweaked the settings to no avail.&nbsp; I also did a factory reset on my monitor, but the problem persists.&nbsp; Also, I noticed that the black on my monitor's menu (which is independent of the OS)
 is perfectly black, but pitch black on windows still has the problem.&nbsp; The image featured illustrates this.&nbsp; It will probably look different on your monitor than mine, because of the problem, but it should still get the point across nonetheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no brightness setting in the display menu on Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked the drivers for my display adapter and monitor, but Windows says that both are up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the computer, and noticed that the screen blackness is fine when it's booting up, and does not start until Windows has loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10.&nbsp; The computer is a custom built desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here are the bullet points:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>It's not a problem with my monitor or monitor settings; I've ruled that possibility out.<br />
</li><li>Drivers for the display adapter and monitor are up to date.</li><li>The problem just started today, and I don't remember doing anything that would cause this.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a picture I made to show the problem:</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/1d2myVb</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see here, there is no brightness setting:</p>

<h3> donmowen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t creat new folders in Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium. For some time now I've been unable to create new folders. The only option under New is Briefcase, among other things I never use. I was using Dell DataSafe Online and after several months of back-ups without a hitch,
 it started making the files and folders disappear every time it did a backup, although I was able to find them with a search. When I tried creating a new folder with the same name as the old one It would find the old one, ask if I wanted to merge them, and
 the new one would disappear as well. Over time, the create folder option disappeared also.<br />
<br />
I tried the suggestions here:
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/unable-to-create-a-new-folder-in-windows-7/3c5951c8-e3b0-4e5b-99a5-744f842fe558</p>

No fix yet.<br />

Can anyone help!?<br />

<h2>            Deus Ex&#58; Human Revolution - Director&#8217;s Cut from LIVE store</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp; NO idea if this is the right place...</p>

<p>On XBOX LIVE store, the game "Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director’s Cut" says "Get it on smart glass."&nbsp; SWEET!&nbsp; I can't wait!</p>

<p>But I have smart glass.&nbsp; I cannot get it on smart glass.&nbsp; There is no Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director’s Cut available on smart glass.</p>

<p>Please help in any way you can.&nbsp; (Like not putting stuff on your site that needs YET ANOTHER app to use, only to have said app in beta stage or not support said app.)</p>

<p>Again, all help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hi folks</p>
<p>Are you all on XBOX 360? If so, you should be able to acquire Deus Ex through Smartglass (A Game with Gold for 360 this month).</p>
<p>However if you are on Xbox One you will need to go to xbox.com and acquire Deus Ex (which I did myself yesterday). That is the only way at this time to get BC games for Xbox One, through the browser and xbox store online.</p>
<p>Best thing to do is go to <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2016/01/21/the-complete-list-of-backward-compatibility-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
news.xbox.com/.../the-complete-list-of-backward-compatibility-titles</a> and you will be able to grab the game from there.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Hey Tropolite,</p>
<p>Personally I was talking about the Director's Cut, which is supposed to be the entire game, all DLC and all that. &nbsp;Link here...</p>
<p><a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Deus-Ex-Human-Revolution-Directors-Cut/3738d4af-4b61-4cde-9d5c-1bc5de2b6ff1?cid=SLink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">marketplace.xbox.com/.../3738d4af-4b61-4cde-9d5c-1bc5de2b6ff1</a></p>
<p>It states "get it on smart glass" but on smart glass there's NO place I can find it. &nbsp;That was the question.</p>
<p>In independent research, it appears the Director's Cut is NOT backward compatible, as it contains 2 discs and B/C does not yet allow more than 1 disc for some reason I'm sure is way over my head programming wise.</p>
<p>But I appreciate that link, it will be helpful in the future for sure. &nbsp;Thanks for adding to this topic, and while I'll still hope the Director's Cut will be available in the future for XBOX ONE it doesn't appear to be ready quite yet.</p>

<p>It's non-obvious, but here's how:</p>
<p>1. Place Media Player in Library view. There's a control that looks like 3 squares with an arrow that toggles between Library view and cover art view.</p>
<p>2. At the top, by the forward and back buttons, there will be a bread-crumb trail. It will display &gt;Library&gt;Music&gt;....</p>
<p>3. Click Music in the bread-crumb trail and you should then see a large selection of buttons. Double-click the Folder icon. This will show you a total count of albums and songs. Each album is a sub-folder in the Library, and each song is an individual file.</p>
<p>4. You can do the same for the other media types (videos, pictures, etc.).</p>

Never underestimate your own stupidity.

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I had the same reaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you have to sign in to your email account online and create the new folder there. The next time you sign in to the Mail app, the new folder will be there. It seems that the Mail app is pretty much just an interface to your online account(s).</p>

    <title>Games are too dark &#58;&#40; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thrawns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games are too dark &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use HDMI to connect my Xbox 360 with my TV (Samsung SyncMaster TA550). I've checked my Xbox settings, game settings and TV settings, but still: the games are definitively too dark. It's okay (not perfect), if the scene is well illuminated. But in spaceships
 (ME3 e.g.) or caves (Tomb Raider e.g.) it's very hard to play, barely possible. And there are a lot of such scenes.</p>
<p>Thought it's standard. But a few hours ago I walked with Lara Croft through one tomb, dark as always; suddenly everything looks great and I am very sure, that's the standard, not the brightness/contrast I thought it was.</p>
<p>As I walked a minute (or 30 seconds) around (and the lighting conditions changed) the effect was over and everything was too dark again.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea, what's the problem? I'll try to change HDMI-port, HDMI-cable and so on, but I did before with no effect.</p>

<p>You can try to change the reference levels of HDMI</p>
<p>Go to the Settings hub, and then select System.</p>
<p>Select Console Settings.</p>
<p>Select Display.</p>
<p>Select Reference Levels.</p>
<p>You can choose from Standard, Intermediate and Expanded.</p>
<p>If you're on expanded, you should try to select standard.</p>

<p>Try these settings for your HDMI connection on your console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Reference levels&gt; Expanded</p>
<p>HDMI Color space&gt;Auto</p>
<p>Display Discovery&gt;Enabled</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If those make no difference try resetting your display settings, power the console on using the guide button on your controller, as the console starts up press and hold Y and the right trigger, the console should restart and the display settings will be
 reset. I would also check your display output settings aren't set to something your tv doesn't fully support.</p>

<p>The reset of the display settings has worked. After that I just had to adjust the brightness a little bit and now it's fine. I'll test it with ME3 in the next days, but it seems to work. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Skype crashes in the middle of calls</h2>
                    All day today I'd be in the middle of a call with someone and it would crash unexpectedly. I'dlook at the window and the screen would be completely white. It wouldn't be "not responding" and it wouldn't work again unless I closed it with task manager and
 reopened it. I watched it on the second monitor and that's all it does. Out of nowhere it crashes and the screen turns white on skype.

            <p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also:</p>
<p>Try to rename or delete the <b>WebSetup </b>folder and try again.<br />
<br />
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\<b>WebSetup</b><br />
<br />
Please let us know if you're able to continue after trying the above</p>
