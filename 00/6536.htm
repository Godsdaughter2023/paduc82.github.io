<h2>            How to restore contacts after phone reset&#63;</h2>
                    Recently I had to reset my phone after which it asked me to log in using my windows live ID. After logging all my contacts were not synchronized to my phone which were there earlier to the reset. I opened the windowsphone.com page and checked in using
 my same windows live ID and could see all my latest contacts there, but now I don't know how can I get all of them synchronized back to my phone. Need assistance please.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Eugene Skaria,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; By default, simply adding the Microsoft Account to your Windows Phone will pull down the contacts you see online.&nbsp; However, there is an option to toggle whether or not the contacts are synced to your phone if the account is not the primary Microsoft Account
 on your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; You can check this setting by tapping Settings, Email and Accounts, your Microsoft Account, then checking off the option to sync contacts.&nbsp; This option is only available for secondary email accounts on your phone, your primary account will always be set
 to sync the contacts you see online.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you're only using the single Microsoft Account as the primary account on your phone, I would suggest re-entering the email information one more time which would require a factory reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
&nbsp;Greg</p>

            <p>The most recent version that runs in G4 is Office 2008. The product was never available as a download. You need to purchase the physical disc to install Office 2008.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Office 2008 has been discontinued for quite some time. You might check stores
 that sell used computer or office equipment for a copy. If there is a computer user group near you, members of the group may have a copy to give away or sell cheaply. Note that even at the Amazon store prices on 2008 can be very reasonable.</p>

<p>I am not sure why they disappeared Friesenburg.&nbsp; If they are not on the MyPhone site then you had sync'd after the changes was made so that makes sense why there is a change there.</p>

    <title>Problems with syncing email addresses in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with syncing email addresses in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community Friends</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a installing a recent Microsoft update I am having problems with syncing email addresses. I keep getting emails asking me to "update your credentials for the account ……….. " . When I go to settings&gt;view all Outlook settings&gt;sync emails&gt;manage your
 connected accounts I find that below "Last Update" - "Update Failed". I go into edit more within "Manage your connected accounts" and fill in the required information within "Edit connected account" and then press save. After a few minutes I receive an email
 from Microsoft asking me to "Update my credentials for the account ……….@........ as it looks like we don't have permission to get email for …………@............ " &amp; so it goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got so frustrated with one email address that I kept keying in all the information for, that I deleted the email address from connected accounts but I have not been able to add this email address again via "Other email accounts".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have 4 different email addresses for individual business functions it is really nice to have them all coming into my Outlook account. At the moment I am having to go to Gmail, Yahoo &amp; BT Internet to pick up my emails rather than having them all in the
 one Inbox as I used to get before the upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says under "Sync Email&gt;Connected Accounts within email settings that you can "Connect your other accounts to import your email and manage it all&nbsp; in one place and you can connect up to 20 other email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding it incredible difficult to connect 4 and would really like to know if anyone has an answer to my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards PM1</p>

<p>Hello PeterManson1, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with Outlook as you are unable to add your external email account as Connected Account in Outlook.com again after you have removed it as a result of Microsoft incessant prompt telling you to update its credentials.
 I know how important for you to get this up and running, rest assured, I am here to help you to resolve this issue with you.
<br />
<br />
I find that this article may be relevant to you: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-connected-accounts-in-outlook-com-a99a1f0b-700d-4b3b-8f9a-28d463ff07f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubl...</a><br />
<br />
You mentioned that you have not been add "this email" via Connected Account, could you please elaborate more on that? Such as
<br />
<br />
1. What is the error message? Would be very helpful if you could share with us a screenshot.
<br />
2. What is that email service provider? <br />
3. Do you have two-factor authentication (2-FA) enabled with that email service provider?
<br />
<br />
If you have <strong>2-FA enabled</strong> with that external email service, you have to use an app password instead, see:
<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1858...</a> (this is not just Gmail, it is a universal concept across all sites)
<br />
<br />
Generally, please ensure that you have the <strong>correct email configuration</strong> entered like IMAP/SMTP/POP3 servers/ports. Hotmail.com/Live.com mailboxes will face this problem, because the IMAP/SMTP/POP3 configuration details are now outdated. Ensure
 that you are using the most up-to-date information of your email provider service.
<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

            Dear Peter,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You mentioned:
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />As I have 4 different email addresses for individual business functions it is really nice to have them all coming into my Outlook account
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />If you have Office 365 account, than you might experience problems with connected accounts. Microsoft decided to remove option to use connected accounts in OWA (Outlook on the web) All existing connected accounts stopped syncing on October 30, 2018. More detailed information can be found here <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connected-accounts-is-no-longer-supported-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-for-business-accounts-5cc526bf-e928-4a99-8b9f-5e089df7d887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connec...</a> and here <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-email-accounts-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connec...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with this decision and you think that this feature was useful, please submit your feedback in UserVoice <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--outlook-on-the-web-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--ou...</a>
<br />Hope this information will be useful.
<br />
<br />I do understand that this is upsetting news, however I am just "delivering" the information.

<p>Dear LordAlukard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that I am using Office 365 just Outlook Mail but wonder if Microsoft have also decided to remove the option to use connected accounts in this as well? I have been using Outlook Mail for some time now &amp; it used to be very easy to add and remove
 connected accounts, but I am having great difficulty in doing so now &amp; wonder if a change has been made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you also for making me aware that I can submit feedback to UserVoice if I am unhappy with Microsoft's decision to remove the feature.</p>

<p>Dear Sutharsan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my request for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the first article you felt might be relevant, but having looked through all the questions &amp; answers there is nothing there that is relevant. I have gone into all the email account with the service providers I mentioned &amp; keyed in the user
 names and passwords and I have gained access to all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to further explanation to add accounts I will further elaborate: In Outlook Mail there is a settings option&nbsp; at the top right hand side of the page. I clicked on settings&gt;view all outlook settings&gt;sync mail. On the Sync Mail page there is an option
 to add a connected account &amp; I clicked on other email accounts. You then get a screen "connect your account". I completed all the details on this page &amp; opted for "Import into existing folders...……………." &amp; then press OK. This then takes me to another screen
 "Advanced Settings" I inserted all the required information into this area &amp; then pressed OK.&nbsp; After a while processing the information, I am then returned to the "Sync Email" screen and the account hasn't been added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There is no error code shown.</p>
<p>2. The service provider in Microsoft Outlook</p>
<p>3. I don't believe Outlook has 2-FA enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I am using the updated POP configuration details as these appear on the screen when trying to add the new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hello PeterManson1,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your detailed response. It is very helpful towards resolving this issue.
<br />
<br />If that is the case, I am afraid we cannot help you with this. Although I am a Directly.com expert for Outlook.com, I regret to inform you that most of us here do not have access to user account information. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft Community brings together consumers and expert users in product-focused online communities, so they can post questions, share answers, and solve technical problems. However, inquiries that involve privacy, user data or otherwise require a technical action has to be reached with Microsoft Support directly.

<br />You can contact Outlook.com Support here: <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=853938</a> (their response time quite fast :P ) 
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, to remedy your needs, may I suggest you to block the annoying Microsoft alerts of the failed sync?

<p>Thank you once again Sutharsan for your prompt response and advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already contacted Microsoft support on 2 occasions and got a very quick response from both of their engineers. I explained my problem to both of them &amp; had a response, but I haven't had any follow up or recommendations from them since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will contact them again and hopefully this time I will get a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just had a response from another member of the Microsoft community who is also having the same problem, so it isn't just me which I am pleased about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards PM1</p>

<p>Hey vonfurstenburg,</p>
<p>What error message do you get when trying to download the file?</p>
<p>Have a look if your antivirus software or another security software is preventing you from downloading it. Start of by disabling all the security software installed on the computer. Once they are completely disabled, try downloading the file. Make sure that
 you don't visit any unreliable websites with the security software disabled. See if downloading goes successful.</p>

    <title>Nokia X2 Dual sim, SIM card problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia X2 Dual sim, SIM card problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having problems lately with my X2DS as it recognizes the SIM, accepts the PIN but can't register on my provider's network. It was working fine up until some days ago when I reinstalled the ROM. (It was working with the stock rom, then when I updated
 it to 2.1.0.13, then (okay, I use a custom rom now) cm11 but it was working fine. Then I reinstalled it, the exact same rom and then poof, it suddenly doesn't want to register on the mobile network. It says something went wrong. I reverted it back to a stock
 based rom and it says the same. I tried it with a different SIM, doesn't work either. I Called the provider, they said they don't have the IMEI locked in their system. The SIM is working in my other devices. This is a very annoying problem since I suspect
 I'm the only one in my country owning this phone and ad the local Nokia Care they haven't seen or heard a phone like this before so I wouldn't put it in their hands as it is extremely difficult to acquire another one. I'd appreciate any kind of help on what
 can cause this so I can repair it somehow.</p>
<p>Physical damage can be ruled out as well as it hasn't received any shock or damage prior to the software reinstall, not after that.</p>
<p>I'm really desperate right now, it seems I get closer to having a perfect phone but every step towards it seems to put me back to square one first :\</p>

            <p>no, they are listed correctly.</p>
<p>I &nbsp;think the problem should be searched for deeper into how android systems work... :\ I have no idea what I could have screwed up that can persist after formatting all partitions and installing a different ROM. I tried 3 so far. None of them works but all
 of them worked before.</p>

ÁrpádKocsis</a>. Bear in mind that installing a third party software may damage your phone and&nbsp;may void its warranty. It's also not advisable to have it&nbsp;repaired&nbsp;aside from our authorized technicians. Were you able to use the Nokia Software Recovery Tool that
 may resolve this? Check this link for the instructions: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/support/recovery-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Nokia Care Suite to flash the stock rom to the phone (product code&nbsp;059W002 and&nbsp;059W003), issue still persists.</p>
<p>Prior to flashing the stock rom, on the previous rom (cm11 based on android 4.4.4) in terminal emulator I tried restarting the ril daemon, but still the issue stood. &nbsp;<br />
So the IMEI is ok, phone won't work with other providers' SIMs, I would think that maybe there is something physically wrong with it. I wonder who should I send it to to check it or if even people do this stuff instead of just changing the motherboard or better
 yet replacing the whole device...<br />
I'm so desperate that I'm considering buying a different phone. This is the only one so far having issues when tempered with.</p>

            I've purchased it in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Apr 02, 2015&nbsp;</span>on e-bay from a seller from Thailand. The phone worked perfectly and then I put up
 the custom rom and then it was still working. Then I had to reinstall it and then it went bad. I brought it to Nokia Care but they haven't seen a phone like this before and they said that Nokia Care Suite was unable to identify the phone. I told them that
 their software needs to be updated or something because at home it recognizes the device. This is a problem in Hungary, you can have local solutions only for mainstream stuff and things that everyone else has, and for a pretty penny too. Rare stuff is unknown
 for even "professionals" who work in a Nokia-specific repair shop...

            Ok, it's not Microsoft's responsibility, I already knew that, and that the warranty is gone. In light of these facts I came here for answers but did not get any... Well, it was worth a try :)

<h2>            OneDrive &#38; Data Protection</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased Office 2013 Pro to use as part of my business (I am a self-employed sole trader working in the UK legal sector). I have been starting to make extensive use of OneNote and finding it a very powerful tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, OneNote syncs to my OneDrive that comes with my Microsoft account. Because some of my work involves personal data (in terms of the UK Data Protection Act), I have to register with the Information Commissioner. I am also restricted from sending
 data outwith the EU unless certain standards are met. I am aware that Microsoft now meets some of these standards for many of its products, as the EU has recognised its 'Standard Contractual Clauses'. But, whenever I've seen a list of these products, they
 seem to be restricted to Entreprise-level products and Office 365, I've never seen OneNote explicitly listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me whether the Standard Contractual Clauses cover my use of OneDrive and OneNote 2013? Or do I need to have an enterprise-level service agreement or licencing arrangement in place with Microsoft for this to apply? If so, is there a document
 somewhere that confirms this that I could rely on were I ever to be audited by the data protection authorities?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            You have a couple of options.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Since you've bought a "retail" Home and Student license that allows you to install on 3 computers, the cleanest fix is to FIRST confirm that you don't have a factory installed free trial. I believe that is what happened on the desktop.&nbsp; When you install your
 purchased copy on an computer that has the free trial and try to activate the 2 installations cause the activation system to get confused.<br />
<br />
To fix the problem on the desktop check to confirm you have the free trial, <br />

<p>The factory installed trial is typically called something<span>&nbsp;
</span>like “Microsoft Office 2010 Single Image” because it allows the factory to install all 3 trials (Home and Student, Home and Business, and Pro) at the same time. (For this problem you can ignore Office Starter, and an entry that is just "Microsoft Office
 2010") <span>&nbsp;</span>If you are uninstalling the factory trial to clear up conflicts with another installed copy, you MUST do an Office Repair of that other installed copy, boot the computer and you will probably have to also do an activation of the
 installed copy.</p>

Before we can help you with the Laptop you have to provide us with the Exact error message text.<br />

<b>When you get an error, we Need the FULL and EXACT Error message text and error code (if there is one) as Diagnostic Clues</b>
<p>Describe the exact steps you take to to create the error (so we can try to recreate it) and the resulting error. In theory that is obvious, but apparently you didn't give us enough information to provide a good answer ... &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>We search various sources for the error message you give us to find possible solutions. So we need the exact error message text, we can't find paraphrased error messages.</p>

<span>Please use the Problem Steps Recorder to capture what you are doing so we have more details to work with. Either copy and paste the recorded steps into the forum or upload the zip file to Skydrive and give us a link to the zip file</span></p>
<p>Solving problems unique to a machine can be an arduous task for both the end-user and the help desk. That’s why Win7 introduces the Problem Steps Recorder, a screen-capture tool that allows the end-user to record the problems they’re
 having step-by-step. If the problem is repeatable, the recorder will capture what you do in text form.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as hitting “record” then adding in comments as needed. A HTML-based file is converted to a .ZIP folder, which is easily passed on to the help desk.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The program is accessible from the Control Panel under “Record steps to reproduce a problem” or run psr.exe from Explorer.</p>
<p>Upload result to a file share site and post the link back here.<br />

Office Starter is a "free" crippleware version of Office. It is installed in a "Click to Run" "Virtual Computer" environment. I have found it to be annoyingly persistent about grabbing the Windows Default File Associations, in spite of my efforts to reset them
 to my installed copy.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can have multiple versions of Office installed. I have one machine with Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 ALL installed at the same time.<br />

<p>mscorsvw.exe first&nbsp;stopped working&nbsp;13/01/13</p>
<p>Office 2010 attempted to be installed approx 7/1/13, previously had Office 2003 and Office Trial version.&nbsp; Apparently Office 2010 installed a siongle image, have now tried to rectify this by repairing, think have sucessfully deleted Office Trial and Office
 2003.</p>
<p>Please find listed below as requested diagnostic answers.</p>
<p>1a.&nbsp; HP G72 B02SA Laptop purchased circa Jan 2011.</p>
<p>1b.&nbsp; Win 7 64 bit was pre-installed, I therefore did no clean install myself.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I use Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp; I did try using Defender, but believe it is uninstalled now.&nbsp; I do not believe there is a third party firewall.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The computer came with Norton, I might have tried installing McAfee at some time, but I no longer use it</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; It came with a Norton free trial, I did not activate it, but do not know how to erase it although I have tried, my HP Security status notes undervAnti Virus I am at risk, although Security Essentials acknowledges I am protected.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I will check these and come back to you asap, although I auto update so they should be installed, is there an easier way to check for these other than going through the whole list of installed updates?</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Chrome was installed two days ago as Internet Explorer kept dropping out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Will test for and get back to you asap</p>
<p>8. Not in the habit of using these, although tried CCleaner Registry Cleaner yesterday, hoping this would help, but it has n0o.</p>
<p>(Pages when try to select keep&nbsp;keep going away and will not stay on top, have tried&nbsp;flashing BIOS but this has not helped.)</p>

<font color="#0072c6">Microsoft Security Essentials</font></a> (MSE) originally offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you intentionally
<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em></p>

<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting

<p>1c. What ANTIMALWARE CLIENT version is currently installed? To find out, open MSE &amp; click on the downward-pointing arrow to the right of HELP then select ABOUT SECURITY ESSENTIALS.</p>

<p>Restore ALL of you "registry cleaner" backups then reboot &amp; test.&nbsp; If no joy, your next recourse would be doing&nbsp;a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) of

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 and use Outlook for my e-mail;, how can I block messages from any&nbsp;foreign URLS&nbsp;before they show up in my junk mail or inbox?&nbsp; I used to have an option that allowed me to do that in Hotmail but I don't know what happened to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure hope someone out there has the answer, as for now I select all of them and use Sweep to block them but new ones just keep coming.</p>

<p>I can see that you're not able to. I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me help you with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can do is to check the blocked senders list if the urls are there. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
You can do this by the steps below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Select <font><b>More mail setting</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. Under <font><b>Preventing junk email</b>, click
<b>Safe and blocked senders</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. Click <font><b>Blocked Senders</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">6. Enter the email address or domain that you want to add in your blocked senders list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it's not there, probably that causes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it's there,&nbsp;we'll&nbsp;do an investigation of your account. To do so, you need to provide us with the affected email address of yours in a private message area I created for you. In order fo you to view the private message, you have
 to sign in here and click on <b>"</b>You have a private reply to this message.</span></p>

 various microsoft fix it programs. I even tried using the certificates on my computer and redoing that, it didn't work. I really need help please.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have a Windows Phone 8 device, the Zune software will not work with your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that your computer is fully updated: <a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.update.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What OS version do you have on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try downloading the Windows Phone Desktop app from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/windows-phone-app-for-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/windows-phone-app-for-desktop</a></p>

<p>If it doesn't install, please let us know the exact error message and error code you receive.</p>

<h2>            Quitters dont get anywhere</h2>
                    The topic is simple: Mobile. You have a half added attempt, then quit. Why didn't you stress the security of apps on windows store versus the hackability if your competitors? Focus your marketing on the security aspect you'll fare well.&nbsp; I have yet to
 trade my Lumia 920 or 950 whatever, I refuse to get the crappy Apple or whacky android. If you don't release a new mobile well then, I'll be forced to renounce my Microsoft certification, sell my xboxes, and withdraw from society completely,. Forever.&nbsp;

            Yes I am having the same issue and it is beyond frustrating! &nbsp;When I'm done working on a project I have to airdrop it to my old laptop and save it as a PDF from there using Excel 2011. &nbsp;In my case I am preparing accounting reports and instead of having

            It appears as though this is still not fixed. Really curious if there is something specific to my computer setup. Hard to believe that all users are just putting up with this. I have to do same thing. I create PDFs from Excel 2011.

    <title>How do I keep two lists separate in the same Word 2010 Doc&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deedeecee  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I keep two lists separate in the same Word 2010 Doc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a document that has two sections (I mean in the formal, Word-formatting "section break" manner). In the first section, I have a list that I want to have with the Formatting A.&nbsp;,&nbsp; B.,&nbsp; C.,&nbsp; etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some non-list text and then a section break, in the next part of the document I want to begin a separate list with the format 1.,&nbsp; 2.,&nbsp; 3.,&nbsp; etc. It's important for the organization of the document and clarity to the reader to have the two lists keep
 a separate formatting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, no power on earth seems to keep the 2nd list from adopting whatever style is in the first list. I've created separate styles for each list; I've made each style based on "No Style" rather than the other style or "Normal". I've reformatted the first
 list, and then the second. When that didn't work, I've reformatted the second list, and then the first. Absolutely nothing stops the two lists from mating like magnets, and using the same format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way to make my document look the way I want it to?</p>

            How are you applying the list formatting? There should be no problem if you apply the styles directly, for example via the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S). Note that you can't use the Numbering button on the Home tab.

<p>Further to my last, it seems that it is a browser issue. The problem that I have been seeing was in Firefox, but having switched to Chrome it seems to work okay. That's an acceptable workaround for me, so feel free to consider the matter resolved (although
 it would be nice if ongoing bug fixing eventually resolves the Firefox issue).</p>

<p>That's not correct, Nokia Software Updater will always install the latest software for your phone's product code, which will include the same set of languages that the phone came with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia doesn't provide a way to add extra UI languages to the phone, but you can sometimes have thios done by a Nokia service point.</p>

            As far as I know, the default language set on any Nokia phone is product code dependent, regardless of which website you use when updating.

<p>You cannot put the Access accDB file on SharePoint since then this would not allow multi-users of the document (SharePoint would view this database as a single document like word).</p>
<p>However you can upsize the table data from the back end part to what are called SharePoint "lists". You then link to these lists from your Access front end (this works very much like linking the front end part to an access back end file).</p>
<p>However for good performance and support of relational things like cascade deletes on SharePoint, then you quite much need Access 2010. Furthermore, with Access 2010 + SharePoint 2010 you have MUCH better performance with linked tables than that of Access
 2007. So you would still install the Access application on each computer with tables linked to the SharePoint site.
</p>
<p>You can test/try some of this with 2007, but you not have the relational delete (cascade) delete ability and you have to test performance. Take some of your test data and use the external data option in Access to try sending some data up to SharePoint. After
 you link, your performance might be ok, but performance is far better in a2010 for this setup (so there is greater possibility that performance will be good enough for your application).</p>
<p>Access 2010 + SharePoint also have web creating ability now (so, no Access is required, just a web browser + the SharePoint site). However, web based might not be required solution here. I share some thoughts on converting Access applications to web based
 here:</p>

            <p>I cannot replicate that problem.&nbsp; However, I would probably be creating a template with a userform that contained controls into which the data would be entered (or in which the default data would appear to allow editing) and then that data would be used
 to set the values of variables in the document so that the data would appear in Docvariable fields.</p>

<p>Are you serious or why your messaging app is _so_frustrating_ancient_ because you cant take a part in Facebook group chats which are made in FB and you cant even send pictures in instant messages at Facebook? Even iOS and Android has this option....</p>

<h2>            Compliance Search Action  - Export Search items to PST</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I am trying to export an ComplianceSearch to a PST through the PowerShell cmdlets for Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a Compliance Search with the&nbsp;New-ComplianceSearch and started it with&nbsp;Start-ComplianceSearch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to export these results to a PST (preferably all through PowerShell).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the&nbsp;New-ComplianceSearchAction, but this is as for as I got.</p>
<p>In the official documentation I found the following:</p>
<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt210913(v=exchg.160).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the parameter 'Export' there, but I have found that this article is outdated. And the commands I import through 'https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ ' don't have this parameter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone who can help me?</p>
<p>I am at a loss and I would really like to download a PST through PowerShell</p>

<p>From time to time, I get the following MS Office Outlook error message with that dreaded warning sign "Cannot connect to the server".</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 (64-bit) and MS Outlook 2007. I have been using Outlook with AOL for over eight months without too much issue. HOWEVER, since Tuesday (8/10) I cannot get any AOL emails to come through my Outlook. I continuously get the above message
 after rebooting the computer, closing &amp; restarting Outlook, and adjusting the incoming server value between 110 and 143. My outgoing server setting is set to 587.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Thank you</p>
