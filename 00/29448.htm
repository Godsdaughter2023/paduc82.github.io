            <p>UPDATE: Instead of going through the motions of getting the refund, I contacted Cateia Games regarding the issue. They researched it and they will be releasing updates for their games to accommodate the Windows 10 environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time I've had an issue with third party software purchased from the Windows Store. Microsoft needs a compatibility liaison&nbsp;for third party vendors if you are going to continue selling their products.</p>

                    <div>My WiFi on my computer has been acting up today, when I try to download something or play some games, my WiFi turns off and turns back on. I have no clue whats going on because it never happened yesterday until today when I woke
 up at 3:55pm (BST). Is there anything I can do to solve it? I'm starting to get stressed out. When I restarted my PC, it came up with a BSOD saying "Page Fault in Nonpaged Area" so I shut down my PC and turned it back on it and it was fine but my WiFi still
 is doing the same thing.&nbsp;</div>

            You are giving a problem with the network adapter
<br />
<br />In the search box on the taskbar, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the list of results.
<br />In Device Manager, select Network adapters &gt; the network adapter name.
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) the network adapter, and then select Update driver &gt; Search automatically for updated driver software. Follow the steps, then select Close.
<br />After installing the updated driver, select the Start  button &gt; Power  &gt; Restart if you're asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.
<br />If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save it to a USB flash drive, so you can manually install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.
<br />
<br />To manually install the network adapter driver
<br />
<br />Do one of the following, depending on what kind of file you downloaded from the PC manufacturer’s website:
<br />
<br />If you downloaded an executable (.exe) file, just double-click the file to run it and install the drivers. That should be all you need to do.
<br />If you downloaded individual files, and at least one file has an .inf file name extension and another has a .sys extension, do the following:
<br /> 
<br />In the search box on the taskbar, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the list of results.
<br />In Device Manager, select Network adapters &gt; the network adapter name. (If it’s not listed there, check in Other devices.)
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) the network adapter, and then select Update driver &gt; Browse my computer for driver software.
<br />Select Browse &gt; select the location where the driver files are stored &gt; OK.
<br />Select Next &gt; follow the steps to install the driver &gt; Close.
<br />After you've updated the driver, select the Start  button &gt; Power  &gt; Restart if you're asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.

<h2>            split screen in outlook calendar event</h2>
                    this is a 2 part ?:<br />
1) I was&nbsp;trying to copy and paste an email into an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
2007 outlook calendar event</span> however the email graphic pasted up underneath the top horizontal ruler bar,
<em>what adjustment do i need to make to view&nbsp;whole graphic?</em><br />
2) So i clicked around trying to drag it down and&nbsp;clicked the 'split bar' in the top right corner and&nbsp;now i have two viewing areas with the graphic stuck up underneath the top ruler,
<em>how do i undo this split screen, have right clicked the 'view ruler' icon, but there is no undo option?<br />
</em><br />
i looked in the big book of 2007 Microsoft Office System Inside/Out and did not find an answer to this for a calendar event.

            <p>That didn't seem to fix the problem. &nbsp;I got rid of two of them by removing one of my hard drives but it comes back when i plug it back in. &nbsp;It seems to be a ghost HD because it mirrors the real one but i am unable to access any of the videos on it. &nbsp;I'm
 guessing that it is some weird setting i changed accidentally just don't know where it happened.</p>

                    How do I change my display name on outgoing emails through the mail app. on Windows 10? I have changed it through the email carrier web base, through the settings using both on my computer and microsoft acount. Nothing seems to be able to change the name.After
 al those attempts, I have uninstalled my email on the app, shut down my computer, then reinstalled my email and my name still appears. I do not know how to get back to the page where I need o change it. Any help would be much appreciated.

<h2>            Skype on multiple computers</h2>
                    I am sure this is a stupid question, but here goes: My wife has a Skype account which she uses on her PC running Windows 10. She also wants to be able to use Skype on our new laptop, also running Windows 10. Can she do that? How?

            She certainly can. She just needs to sign into  Skype with the same account on each device.

            <p>Hi John<br />
Thanks for your reply. Have been away, so sorry for the delay in replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see, this article that you sent is merely a repeat of the menu items given by a right click on 'screen resolution' on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Have been through all that. Can't find any thing there that solves the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem may lie with the PQ labs infra red touch screen software. I am in touch with them also, but no joy so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically the problem is that the PQ labs touch screen software and infra red frame only work together on the main desk top monitor No 1 display. If you move the IF frame to the extended area part of the desktop, displayed on monitor No 2, it does&nbsp; not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My temporary&nbsp; solution to this, is to make the remotely sited monitor with its infra red frame the main monitor which allows the system to work. the problem is that all the apps and task bar are now on the positionally wrong monitor.<br />
<br />
OK so drag all the apps icons and task bar to what is now the second monitor to use it as the main workstation. Messy but it works. EXCEPT when you now click an app its opening window appears is on the other monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so drag it across to the second monitor YES it works but when you use this same app to bring up its&nbsp; sub menu, that sub menu opens on the other monitor, and again with the sub sub menu and so on. Disastrously messy!! particularly if the monitors are
 not side by side.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that what I am trying to do is perfectly possible because I have a&nbsp; several year old 19 inch Home Touch System using 'Touch kit'. software working on windows XP. There was no sign of this problem, it worked correctly from day 1. Home Touch Systems no
 longer exists.<br />
<br />
Consider, for example, you could be running four monitors in extended desktop mode,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitor No 1 will be the main monitor, and you need, say, Monitor No 3 to be a touch screen, which is looking at a different area of the extended desk top.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Where is the menu item that allows you to choose monitor no 3 to be your touch screen?</em><br />
<br />
In my current set up you can't do this, the IF touch screen only works with the main monitor. You can't move the&nbsp; IR frame to one of the other monitors, and use that monitor as a touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a solution to this, or am I missing something obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards </p>
<p>
</p><p>John </p>

</p><p>For better assistance, I would suggest you contact your manufacturer and ask them if they have a patch or update in order for you to choose your desired monitor to be your touch screen or main monitor.</p>

    <title>Skype blocking contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahd23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype blocking contacts</h2>
                    <p>I need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago when signing into Skype I noticed several of my contacts were blocked.&nbsp; I unblocked my contacts, changed my password as I thought I may have been hacked and continued on with my day.&nbsp; This now happens every other day now that it blocks the
 same contacts.&nbsp; I have to continually unblock these contacts.</p>
<p>The problem that I seem to be running into now is that I can not get messages from these same contacts when they are unblocked. I've looked into my blocked list to see if they are blocked there too, but they're not.&nbsp; If I initiate contact they can respond,
 but if it's idle for 5 - 10 minutes with no communication between either parties and&nbsp; then they try to respond after that, I won't get their message.&nbsp; These are my work contacts and one of these "skype blocked" contacts is my boss. Tired of getting work emails
 stating I'm ignoring skype messages.&nbsp; I've tried uninstalling skype and going back to a previous version to no avail.&nbsp; I've even tried uninstalling the last windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found any tricks to resolve this issue?&nbsp; Please help :)<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t transfer files from an external flash drive to a new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothyfisher1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t transfer files from an external flash drive to a new computer with Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello. I know I've asked this question before but I thought I would just refresh the question.&nbsp; How do I transfer my file history from an external flash drive to my new computer using running Windows 10? Since Windows 10 doesn't have Easy Transfer anymore
 I am limited to a 2 options. One is to buy PC mover but this won't work as the old computer mysteriously crashed and therefore the files can't be moved via this method. The only other option is, is to do it manually, like drag and drop or copy and paste of
 which I haven't a clue how to do this. I am desperate to get these files copied over to my new computer, I just need a little help from Microsoft to get me through this. No matter what the&nbsp; reason MS had for not including Easy Transfer in Windows 10. I would
 overlook this ridiculous move to not include it in Windows 10 if I could only get some step by step help in moving these files over manually. H<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Moved from:&nbsp; Windows / Windows 10 / Windows update, recovery, &amp; backup

            Hi Timothy.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would sort your files into their User folders (Desktop, Music, Downloads, Documents, Pictures, etc) under your User account name at C:\Users\Your Name.  Favorites folder will have your internet Explorer favorites if you use it.
<br />
<br />Then copy each of those files to external to transfer to the new install.  This tutorial shows how to copy groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Plug in the external, open it, open each User folder, from the Home tab choose Select all, right click in the group to Copy.
<br />
<br />Now open the new PC's C:\Users\Your named account User folder, right click in a blank area of the target folder, choose Paste.  
<br />
<br />This makes it easiest and avoids losing files or transferring hidden AppData files that defeats having a fresh start.  
<br />
<br />If you want to use File History see this tutorial:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-windows-10-file-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Activation of Windows 7 not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activation of Windows 7 not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have followed the instructions regarding reactivating my Windows 7 Professional installation following a recent indication that my version was not genuine (it is, I assure you, unless you want to hunt down Amazon.com and ask why they might sell counterfeits)
 but I keep getting the error 0x80070005 Access is denied". For some reason, when I tried the diagnostic tool, it reports that the file "slmgr.vbs(1333, 5) VBScript runtime error: Permission denied" which, I presume, means that whatever the slmgr.vbs script
 is trying to access has been somehow locked against it. It gives no indication of what is actually locked (unless 1333, 5 means something).</p>
<p>Have also tried the "slui 4" option but that only brings up a popup telling me that my installation is not genuine and sends me off to a web page that tries to sell me another copy. What gives?!?</p>

    <title>No record of purchase history found. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drboggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            No record of purchase history found.</h2>
                    <p>Here's the scenario:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>I downloaded some apps through the Windows App Store on my desktop PC (which runs Windows 8).<br />
</li><li>At some point the game(s) require a purchase before you can go further.&nbsp; So I make the purchase.<br />
</li><li>Due to a system crash I had to reformat and reload my PC from scratch.<br />
</li><li>Most things purchased come back just fine.<br />
</li><li>I re-download the game(s) I have problems with.<br />
</li><li>My progress isn't there any longer.&nbsp; So I work my way back to the pay point.<br />
</li><li>Knowing that I already paid, I click the obvious "Already Paid?" banner.<br />
</li><li>Then I get the message "No record of purchase history found".</li></ol>
<p>I've tried calling support to get this resolved, but I keep getting transferred to people who seem not to work in this area.&nbsp; Eventually I "think" I was able to talk to someone who helps support the Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he is unable to help.&nbsp; Instead, he suggests I contact the maker of the game and see what they say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these games, "Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart", is not what I might consider a straight purchase.&nbsp; Oddly enough I've seen this same game sold by other places like iWin.&nbsp; They only support it when purchased through them.&nbsp; This same game
 is also sold by other online game hosts.&nbsp; Basically, while it was made by someone, it seems whoever sells the game is who takes care of the licensing issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, that leads me back to Microsoft.&nbsp; I have email receipts showing I paid for them.&nbsp; They even show up under my "transactions" section of my Microsoft account.&nbsp; I have no issues with the "Adera" game.&nbsp; That worked after the reload without issue.&nbsp; I need
 these things restored.&nbsp; And seeing as there is no way I can find in the game, or anywhere else, that leads me to some other support area, I need to come back to Microsoft and ask for help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<div>Since you cannot seem to help, then please provide info on who to contact. As previously mentioned, these same games are sold by a variety of game vendors. Each of them support purchases made through them only. And I'm unable to determine who the vendor
 is for them when purchased through the Microsoft app store. Nothing specific on my email receipt points to anyone other than Microsoft.&nbsp;</div>

            I have suddenly found the same issue.<br />
<br />
You say that Microsoft is not the seller so nothing to do with you (basically). But you are the shop, so it is everything to do with you. You got your cut of the money as any shop does.<br />
<br />
While we seem to be left in a place of either buying the game/s again or going on an endless trail trying to find who ever it is ought to have the record of us purchasing the game.<br />
<br />
At prices between £2-£6 you no doubt expect us to write it off as it is not worth fighting for.<br />

<h2>            Should I delete &#34;per user queued windows error report&#34; in Disk Cleanup&#63;</h2>
                    Hi I'm using Vista Home Premium and here's my question.<br />
<br />
"per user queued windows error report" on my Disk Cleanup shows over 16.5 GB so I'm thinking of deleting it. I checked many window forums and most said it's a bug and&nbsp;will mess up&nbsp;my data if I did. But the answers were quite old (2007-early 2009). My laptop
 is just upgraded to service pack 2. So I don't know if this so-called bug has already been fixed or not. Should I delete it or just leave it there? Will it keep growing if I don't do anything? I read&nbsp;a few posts and&nbsp;some said it grew to more than 100 GB.<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are not having any issues then you can use Disk Cleanup to remove all those error reports and<br />
dump files. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>
</p><p>why does copy and paste feels borked on modern aaps? </p>
<p>
</p><p>win32 - copy text &gt; can do whatever you want whit the app you copied the text from ( including close)&gt; past on whatever app you want</p>
<p>
</p><p>modern apps - copy&gt; close the app&gt; paste is not available</p>
<p>
</p><p>why does windows not have a clipboard on modern apps?</p>
<p>this is a problem that is there since windows 8... in 4 years you couldn't implement a proper clipboard on modern apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw, i posted on "system failures" because the way it works now is just a fail....</p>

            <p>I can confirm the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior has been showing since the first builds of windows 10 but I feel that it has been worse now (on Mail app). It's part of the annoyances and frustrains against Mail app since windows 10. Mail app was great on windows 8. Now on windows 10 there
 are these basic funcstion which are unreliable and break our workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wouldn't happen all the time (and when it does I'd have to right-click using mouse to copy) but lately it feels like it is 100% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many years have windows 10 been out? How can such basic function (which before windows 10 I have never experienced with bugs - that's since windows 95!) break?!</p>

            Hi Heather.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's a PITA and I'm sorry you're going through it, but I'll give you everything possible to do so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            How to Print to OneNote App</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro and Office 2016 on a desktop computer.&nbsp; When I was using OneNote 2016, I could print from a website to a Page in Personal (Web)\Quick Notes.&nbsp; Now I'm using the OneNote app from the Microsoft Store and haven't found a way to print
 to&nbsp;<span>Personal (Web)\Quick Notes\Page.&nbsp; I can copy to a page, but that technique introduces sizing issues.&nbsp; So, someone please tell me how to print to a Page in the OneNote app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, operations with the OneNote app run much slower than with OneNote 2016.&nbsp; I'm using an SSD for my C: drive, and operations on my computer are fast -- except for operations involved with the OneNote app.&nbsp; So, what's up with that?&nbsp; At first, I thought
 operations went slowly because of dealing with the Cloud, but the Cloud hasn't seemed to slow anything noticeably before.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The feature is not available in OneNote modern app right now, however you can install
<strong>Send to OneNote</strong> app from store which should allow you to print from any app to OneNote page.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open any file or webpage, select the
<strong>Print</strong> option, and choose <strong>Send to OneNote</strong>. OneNote automatically captures a copy of the file so you can access it on all your devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can download the app from:

<h2>            Xbox One Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t move content from Internal to External storage</h2>
                    
<p>I have a western digital 2TB USB 3.0 external hard drive set up with my Xbox, and while it is detected and I can see the apps and games I have on there, I can't transfer any games from my internal to external. I've already transferred games between in the
 past, so I know it can do that, but now when I go to any games in my internal and go to its options, "Move" isn't an option, only uninstalling it. This is the same with my internal games as well. The external hard drive is only a 25% full so that's not the
 issue. I've tried to hard reset and changing the hard drive to a different USB port.</p>

<p>Hey there laynlow247,</p>
<p>Have you updated the console's software? Have you changed anything else? You could try doing this with games that you have moved before and see if it works.
</p>
<p>I'd also try another drive (if you have laying around) and see if the problem comes from the WD drive or not.
</p>
<p>To verify that the WD drive works fine I'd connect it to a PC and run WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic tool and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests. Have in mind that the extended test would take quite a while. If the drive passes both
 tests it should be safe to use and the problem should be coming from elsewhere. Here's a link to the tool:
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=pnn2kP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">products.wdc.com/.../kb.ashx</a></p>
<p>Contacting the manufacturer's support can also be useful!</p>
<p>Post back with some progress or if you happen to have any questions! </p>

    <title>I am so fed up with xbox support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam legacy  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am so fed up with xbox support</h2>
                    
<p>You will love this story. I have the emails as well as the proof. So I bought a xbox one day one edition. After 24 hours, my day one edition controller stopped working. I contacted xbox support and was told to send in the controller for repairs. I would
 only get replacement / repaired controller after they received my controller. I didn’t mind that. I mean I could of been lying and wanted a second day one edition controller for free. So I get instructions on how to send the controller in and the service request
 number. I used UPS to send my controller to xbox repair. I was told, by UPS,that my package would be received and signed for on a specific date. I checked the tracking number a day after the quoted date and it was received and signed for as promised. I contact
 xbox support and I am told that it would take 5-10 days to receive my replacement and that I would get an email when it leaves the warehouse. After 10 business days, I decided to check on the service request order on myservice . Xbox . Com On the site, it
 shows that my service request was canceled Upon chatting with 4 different support reps, I am told that they never received the package and my order was canceled because it exceeded the 30 days. I gave them the tracking number and it proves that I sent in the
 xbox controller and it was received and signed for. This was 3 months ago. I have still not gotten my controller back or a replacement controller. My case was escalated to the advocacy team and it took them a month to contact me. Now I am told that they have
 been out of stock of day one controllers and are awaiting new controllers. That that is the reason behind the 3 month wait. Now am I supposed to believe that a company as big as microsoft/Xbox would run out of controllers for 3 months? Better yet, my brother
 who is in the navy and stationed in japan bought a broken xbox one from xbox . Com themselves and a 3 year warranty service on it. After he received it, he contacted microsoft support and asked for a replacement or a repair. They sent him a brown box with
 a pre paid label. He sent the Xbox one and now on his service request order, it shows that it had been canceled. Xbox support is claiming that they did not receive it. That they did not cancel it themselves. The problem is that his tracking number receipt
 was thrown out during inspections because his entire squadron had to clean out the one room that 20 of his fellow navy people share. He cannot get his tracking number from the usps because they cannot go back and get it thru the system. If anyone has any advice
 or suggestions for my brother to receive his console back or how he can go about trying to talk to the idiots at xbox support or any help for myself on how I can get thru to these idiots about my controller, Please contact me @<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>

<p>file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau...I did..but they kept my console for 3 weeks and never called me once on my issues I was having, just sent it back saying they couldnt find anything...duh, you probably didnt try using the digital surround
 sound on your surround sound receiver via the digital optical port...of course testing only the hdmi revealed no problems. &nbsp;This is the worst customer service i've ever received...I can only imagine how ticked off customers would be with me being an automobile
 service writer and they came to me having issues with their car and I kept it for 3 weeks and then told them I didnt find anything wrong and give them the keys back without ever calling them once to go over the issues...they need reported to the better business
 bureau as much as possible to get someone to see how badly they're treating paying customers. &nbsp;I'm awaiting a call back from a advocate team regarding a full refund of every digital purchase/console and extended warranty..im done with this junk company that
 turns customers over upside and shakes the change out of their pockets when they just want to game and have fun. &nbsp;Proprietary headset adapter(that creates popping/crackling and wasnt tested), propietary charging system (sold separately when sony just integrates
 it into their controller like MS should of) and I fear an upcoming proprietary external storage that costs probably double what a current same gigabyte harddrive costs. &nbsp;Nickle and dime me for too long and this is what happens...I dont care how long I've been
 a loyal gamer...your company is crooked and you treat your customers only has numbers.

<p>So here is a cruel joke I got from microsoft.</p>
<p>I received my controller today. What's the cruel joke? I sent in and selected for the service request order a "xbox one day one controller". What am I looking at? A standard xbox one controller.</p>

<p>I just sent my console, which is a Titanfall bundle console, to MS to be repaired because the disc drive didn't work. &nbsp;I tracked it and it showed arriving at its destination on Thursday. &nbsp;I pray I don't have this same experience. &nbsp;I inserted a note making
 sure that they know it is a Titanfall bundle console as well as having other paid downloads on the system. &nbsp;Since Titanfall was digital I hope I don't lose it.</p>

<p>I've changed to PS4 for that exact reason, so slow and they seem to just dont care.</p>
<p>- Luckely here in Denmark, the shop you've bought the Xbox One in are obligated by law to exchange the faulty part so you doesn't have to go through MS, so I will wait till it's launched here in september before buying an XBone again.</p>

<p>Digital downloads sticks to your Xbox Live profile, not the console it self, so don't worry about that :)</p>

<p>To make the joke even worse, I was told I would be compensated for my 3 month wait. You know what they gave me? 3 month xbox live. I already have 2 years on it from buying the xbox one day one 12 month membership (for shadow jago) and I got a 12 month subscription
 for xbox live as a birthday gift from a friend about a month ago. I doubt I'll use any of it. I am so dead set on selling my xbox one now. They can even have my account with all those games I downloaded. 6 full games $60 each and 2 arcade games. This is just
 wrong. I'm not sure why they don't care. I have to see if anyone is having these problems with play station support.</p>

<p>Nice offer?</p>
<p>Over 3 months to receive my controller</p>
<p>Ended up receiving wrong controller</p>
<p>Get 3 months of xbox live for the hassle?</p>
<p>Sorry, but a year of xbox live isn't worth it.</p>
<p>I just want to get the xbox one day one controller and sell the entire system as a day one bundle for $424. Why that much? So I can buy a new ps4. I'm done with this joke of a support team. I have nothing against the console. I've loved it since I got my
 hands on it. I didn't mind that my controller broke within 24 hours. Electronics break all the time. The problem is that I have to deal with a team behind the system that doesn't care about the customer. I have spent over $1000 on the system and games because
 I loved it. My love for the system has been pushed aside by my hate for the support team. 3 months for a controller and I end up receiving the wrong controller! That's outrageous.</p>
