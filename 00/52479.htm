    <title>Printer spooler goes offline after every print job - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidcutaia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer spooler goes offline after every print job</h2>
                    So I am finally making a topic on this as I have pretty much run out of options, i'll try to keep this as short as possible.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basics:</div>
<div>I have two printers. One is wifi, shared with the office of about 5 computers. The other is wired. No one else has this problem. Printers are lexmark 264dn (wifi) and epson workforce 645.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Every time I print, the printer disappears. Further inspection reveals that its offline (even though it not) further inspection reveals that the spooler has stopped. "Restarting" the spooler lets me print once and it stops again. Under the "action center"
 list of problems, the spooler subsystem app says "stopped working," here are the details of one of the problem details:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Description</div>
<div>Faulting Application Path:<span> </span>C:\Windows\System32\spoolsv.exe</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Problem signature</div>
<div>Problem Event Name:<span> </span>APPCRASH</div>
<div>Application Name:<span> </span>spoolsv.exe</div>
<div>Application Version:<span> </span>6.1.7601.17777</div>
<div>Application Timestamp:<span> </span>4f35fc1d</div>
<div>Fault Module Name:<span> </span>wsdapi.dll</div>
<div>Fault Module Version:<span> </span>6.1.7601.17514</div>
<div>Fault Module Timestamp:<span> </span>4ce7ca31</div>
<div>Exception Code:<span> </span>c0000005</div>
<div>Exception Offset:<span> </span>000000000006ad4a</div>
<div>OS Version:<span> </span>6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48</div>
<div>Locale ID:<span> </span>1033</div>
<div>Additional Information 1:<span> </span>8344</div>
<div>Additional Information 2:<span> </span>8344ba80baf6ab1aafe39af65adde6f5</div>
<div>Additional Information 3:<span> </span>e875</div>
<div>Additional Information 4:<span> </span>e875564b9a17e657da1507847a28e623"</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I've tried so far:</div>
<div>Read through a bunch of articles that google found for me. I am pretty well versed in this subject now. I uninstalled drivers, restarted, and reinstalled drivers, worked for about a week. I went through the solution of deleting the files in the printer
 folder, no effect, I went through the solution of taking ownership...no effect but I'm wondering if I did the delete command right. I've removed all unneeded devices. I've changed the default printer around among other things....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The thing that gives me hope is that the number of threads of other people having this problem go way down after 2011 on google, so I don't know if there is a real fix that actually works that I'm missing. If someone solves my problem, they will be decreasing
 my stress level, there by increasing my productivity, thereby increasing the amount of taxes I pay, thereby benefitting you as well as me. Seriously though, thanks everyone....</div>

<font><font color="#000000"><font>A print spooler is software that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them. If you've been waiting an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you

<h2>            System Configuration Services &#39;Stopped&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hey, a few months ago several services stopped functioning on my computer (including printing), and when I checked System Configuration, it said all these services were 'stopped'. There are no apparent ways to set these to 'running', and I was wondering
 if anyone knew a way to fix this?</p>
<p>Many thanks, Dan</p>

            Hi Daniel,
<br />
<br />Open a run command box with Windows Key + R
<br />Type services.msc and press enter
<br />Scroll down the the service you need, such as Print Spooler
<br />Right click the service, and click start
<br />
<br />You can also right click, go to properties and set the startup type to Automatic to prevent this issue reoccurring.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you get any errors!
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />Ryan

 I found a solution. But it deactivated my windows license. The solution was: 1st I needed to restart my windows explorer. 2. I needed to open the command prompt(admin) from the windows+x menu. In the command menu I typed slmgr /upk and restarted my computer.
 After that the message didn't appear but my license disappeared. Is there a way I can return my license?</span>

            Hi,
<br />unfortunately you probably did not have a license. Message about expiring means illegal activation for home computer.
<br />How did you get a license?

            Ok. So I went to activation and I clicked something like fix problem with activation and now I have license again. But the message that my license will expire soon again appeared. How can I fix it? When I go to Activation it says my Windows is activated
 and everything is allright.

            Hi Boris
<br />
<br />If you did have a legitimate Windows 10 licence you just removed it by running that command (slmgr /upk)
<br />
<br />Was that system originally Windows 10 or was it originally a different version of Windows - what Windows sticker is attached to that system?

            <p>I just updated to Windows 10 and can't set up Cortana. I click "Set up Cortana, then go to the settings tab and then I cannot switch to on to activate Cortana. It says Cortana isn't supported in my region. Puerto Rico is part of the United States territories
 though, So why can't I use it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to start-&gt; Settings-&gt;Time&nbsp;&amp; Language -&gt; Here I put Region to United States and the language is English by default. I still can't switch on Cortana. Can you help me?</p>

<h2>            Windows Logon Service Failed</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed windows 7 3 times now and just had to do a system rollback today due to various errors within Windows 7. Both Home Premium, Starter and Ultimate have all failed at some point. The latest problem appears that 6 MS Updates went in (publish
 date 13th April) and upon reboot, and logging in it says the login service failed to start and then throws you back to the login screen. I had to start up in safe mode, log in and then rollback.</p>
<p>I'm getting very frustrated now as the system won't remain stable for more than 1.5 months before something happens.</p>

    <title>Windows Defnder Blocked start up programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fizzlebizzle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defnder Blocked start up programs</h2>
                    I recently installed Malwarebytes but W.Defender blocks it on start up. I have read the help and it seems I should get an option to 'Always Allow' but all I see is 'run blocked program'<br />
If I open Defender and go to the 'Software Explorer'/'Start Up Programs' it is listed as not classified and the enable option is greyed out. I do have other stat ups on the list that are alsowlisted as not classified but they run ok. I am assuming that it has
 something to do with needing admin rights to run which my acccount has.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on this?

            Greetings. I'm also run into the same problem as you are, fizzlebizzle. The only thing I get was the "Run blocked program" option, but still can't find anything to clear off the notification icon.......actually, there is.......by uninstall the program,
 but that doesn't solve the problem either cuz after re-install back the program(Malwarebytes), it went back on. I didn't encounter this problem before, but I did notice this problem after updated the program.<br />
<br />
Please whomever that has a solution, please comment. Thanks.&nbsp;<span><span>

<h2>            High CPU Use from WSAPPX when Switching Users</h2>
                    <p>This week I just got a new Dell Inspiron 5570 laptop (i7-8550U cpu, quad core, 8 GB ram, 1.8 ghz) running Windows 10 Home (64 bit).&nbsp; I setup 2 user accounts, 1 Admin and 1 Local.&nbsp; Whenever I sign into the Local account<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 23, 1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 23, 1)">
 the CPU usage goes up to &gt;30% (due to WSAPPX) and the fan runs full speed even though the computer is idle and I have no programs or apps running (other than the normal background files).&nbsp; This does not happen when logged in with the Admin account.&nbsp; Looking
 further using the Windows Resource Monitor, it seems one of the cores is running at 100% constantly.&nbsp; When I suspend the svchost.exe (wsappx -p) process, everything returns to normal with the CPU running at only 2-5% capacity.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 23, 1)">I've tried deleting and re-adding the Local user account, but still have the same problem.&nbsp; This is especially frustrating as this basically occurred out of the box.</span></p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem on a brand new Dell XPS 13 laptop!&nbsp; Driving me mad as well as its making the second user account (also an admin account for myself as it isn't my laptop) do exactly the same as you report.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the windows "apps" or store work either and I thought maybe if I registered the account as an online MS linked one it will get around the issue somehow but that also doesn't help.&nbsp; &nbsp;So its something really funndamental in how new user accounts are
 created.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <span>My Dell Inspiron Laptop is pretty much useless st this point! I am poor and disabled and will not be able to have it professionally looked at to see if it is fixable. I had s computer friend guide me through very similar steps as mentioned
 above and in various places addressing the Microsoft Windows 10 problems that have either completely destroyed computers or almost did so. My laptop says no driver detected. All other diagnostics I could run were fine. I have also read The MICROSOFT POLICY
 ON HOW THEY WORK AROUND BEING RESPONSIBLE AND HOW THEY CAN ONLY POSSIBLY ARBITRATE ISSUES WITH YOU. The company willing pushed and forced its "latest" windows version in such a way that to use any of there products you have to "AGREE" to being forced into
 the newest version. Microsoft also assumes that people with computers have a constant internet connection to keep up with all the bad updates! I don't! I have to go find Wifi. I haven't been able to use my laptop for the past month and I am afraid the same
 thing will happen to a friend who really needs his computer to work but he is already having issues that sound like mine did before my laptop quit working. He and his son really depend on a working computer.it was a gift from me and at this point if his computer
 also becomes inoperable then I have no way to address the problems! I want Microsoft to take responsibility and fix the problems before damage is done and to quit the new tactic of using the public as guinea pigs! Unfortunately in our world now we cannot just
 abandon technology. If someone can recommend a way to really tell Microsoft what trouble they have caused I am open to suggestions! I have a feeling that I will have to spend a bunch of money I don't have to fix my computer!</span>

            <p>Thank you for the offer of help. I don't really understand or speak computer/tech but I will try to explain my issues. I can now only turn on and off my computer and access the Bios screen or get to troubleshoot screen. The most current message I am given
 is that windows is locked and to unlock it. But since I can't do anything with my dell inspiron &nbsp;laptop currently, I can't do that, let alone understand what that means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after that message and running diagnostics on my laptop as a whole, it told me it does not detect my hard drive/ drivers while everything else was fine. This is why I can't do anything with it.</p>
<p>I was given instructions from a friend who is a computer tech to see if I could reboot my laptop. All it would do before was show the SWIRLING thinking dots on a black screen. He told me how to access the troubleshooting menu and go into advanced options
 and from there follow prompts, it almost seemed like it was working but then nothing, I tried it a few times and eventually I got the message about needing to reseat my hard drive. He had also given me a thumb drive that should have reinstalled or fixed the
 issue but it didn't respond to it at all. This all started after the windows 10 anniversary update/install. It either failed and kept trying and failing or it just froze. The first thing I tried was uninstalling the update and reinstalling but it tried for
 14 hours and nothing. I saved everything important and tried to reset my laptop and that didn't work more did restore because it wouldn't let me go back to the Windows 8.1 that came preinstalled on my laptop when I bought it in December of 2014. It worked
 fine until Windows 10 slowed it down and then added the windows defender which I was Leary of because I had Mccaffe full protection running. Then it slowed even more and every time I tried to use my laptop I couldn't because I was bombarded with update messages
 and restart to the point it just stopped being usable. At this point I have tried everything my computer friends know to try and nothing worked. All I get now is the message saying my hard drive needs to be reseated; I looked up the term and from what I gathered
 it sounds like it needs to be taken out and put back in or my hard drive is fried. I have not tried anything else since this message and it has been about a month. I don't know what to do at this point . So I hope I was able to outline as well as I could with
 out knowing more computer terminology. &nbsp;I am a writer and I do research and I also have a friend with the same laptop I was able to purchase for him and his son. He expressed concern because he is now getting messages about the updates constantly and he said
 windows defender also slowed his computer down. I am afraid he might end up with a non working laptop. He and his son depend on their laptop for school and other important things. I cannot afford to completely replace these laptops.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is Caden Briggs again. The above statement is everything I could possibly do to try and get my Dell Inspiron Laptop working. Nothing I have read or any of the suggestions I have received were able to bring back my laptop to a usable state. I had no
 issues before Windows 10 and then especially after Windows 10 anniversary and having to add Windows Defender. After this though, my laptop became so slow it was pretty much more of a hassle to try and use because I was bombarded with frequent updates messages
 and then when I tried to do that it would quit, fail or continuously run. By that I mean I tried uninstalling previous updates and tried to redo them. My laptop did nothing but swirl blinking dots which I assume it means it is thinking for 14 hours! After
 this I saved all important information and tried to reset and that didn't work so I tried restoring my laptop and I followed the directions in each menu to do this. Again I had swirling dots for a period of 12-15 hours. Every time I tried to stop it and turn
 it back on this is all that would show up or do. By sheer luck I figured out what the Bios screen was and really didn't understand most of that. I was able to run diagnostics and everything checked out fine. I then asked a knowledgeable computer friend for
 help after research proving I was only one of many, many, many people having issues related to Windows 10. My laptop came with 8.1 and it was fine. I wish I could have stayed with that version and I still don't understand why Microsoft thought getting rid
 of XP was a good idea! I never had issues with XP and that was while using an 11 years old Dell laptop with a dead battery, so I would have to plug it in. &nbsp;I only finally gave that laptop up because Windows XP was basically killed off! I lucked into getting
 a new Dell Inspiron Laptop which was just a newer laptop but the same exact brand, model, etc as my old laptop. AGAIN I REITERATE THAT I HAD NO ISSUES UNTIL WINDOWS 10 AND THE CONTINUING UPDATES AND ANNIVERSARY UPDATES! My friend sent very detailed instructions
 and a thumb drive that should have restored/reset my computer but after 3 tries and hours of waiting I got one message telling me WINDOWS WAS LOCKED AND TO UNLOCK IT! But I couldn't do that because I can't do anything with my computer except access trouble
 shooting menu and diagnostics and the Bios screen. After trying one more time in the trouble shooting menu to follow the last untried way the menu had it did nothing for three hours after looking like it was finally going to work, because it asked me to setup
 my computer. ALAS, this did not work either. I ran one more diagnostics test to make sure all was fine with my laptop but this time after finishing the tests I said it could not detect my hard drive or drivers, then it said my hard drive needs to be "RESEATED"!
 &nbsp;I googled the term on my phone and phone yes it is indeed a computer term and means my hard drive needs to be taken out and it back in or that my hard drive is now fried and will cost me money I don't have just to replace it. I was able to help a friend out
 last winter and I got him the same exact laptop I have except the chip in it is not intel like mine, it is whatever the other popular chip is (amd?). &nbsp;I dread what would happen if his computer also finally quits working because he and his son depend on it
 for school and many other important things! If that happened I would be out somewhere between $1200-$1500 dollars that I have no way to spend again just to get computers running WINDOWS 10 latest failure! I need help and I am begging someone to offer any other
 thoughts they have because I have tried all steps suggested and nothing worked and now my laptop is in no condition to even work because the HARD DRIVE NEEDS TO BE RESEATED! I will have to wait until January to take it to a professional to have fixed. I also
 want to be informed on what to do in case my friend has to fix his computer because MICROSOFT CANNOT SEEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WINDOWS 10 is a FAILURE! I have heard from too many people and read too many things to discount this as my own error because I am
 not a tech person! MICROSOFT NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MISTAKES AND FIX THEM AND THEN OFFER WAYS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR COMPUTERS ESSENTIALLY KILLED TO GET THEM FIXED! NOT ALL PEOPLE WITH COMPUTERS HAVE RESOURCES TO FIX OR BUY NEW COMPUTERS! II ALSO
 WANT TO NOTE THAT MICROSOFT AS A COMPANY Should UNDERSTAND THAT FORCING PEOPLE INTO USING THEIR FLAWED NEWEST VERSION IS NOT GOOD! I CANNOT FIND ANYWAY OF ACTUALLY TALKING WITH MICROSOFT ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO RECOVER OR RECOMPENSATE ME OR THE MANY OTHER
 WITH THE SAME ISSUES! If you read the terms and policy notices than you see a clause in which the company had legally excused themselves from being sued and will only arbitrate. I am pretty sure many people have no resources to fight a multi billion dollar
 company, which for all the anti monopoly and antitrust laws is essentially one giant but for legal purposes supposedly split up Monopoly! I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO FIX MY COMPUTER AND I WANT ANSWERS FROM MICROSOFT! BUT I AM REALISTIC AND KNOW THAT IF AT THIS POINT
 AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE CAUSED THE COMPANY IS STILL NOT ADMITTING THEY FAILED AND RUINED &nbsp;MANY, MANY PEOPLES TECHNOLOGY, THEN I DONT HOLD MUCH HOPE FOR ANY ACTUAL ANSWER OR HELP. This forum is somewhat useful because people are trying to help but I can tell
 that they are not actually part of the company who caused all these issues to begin with. I apologize for my rant that is mixed in with my plea for help. But I am desperate and I live on $735 a month! I can't just replace expensive items and I am sure many
 others can't either. Thank you for reading and sharing anything that might help. I hope the holidays will be good for everyone.</p>

    <title>Inconsistent results between machines with Microsoft Print to PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angus kitchin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inconsistent results between machines with Microsoft Print to PDF</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book laptop and an HP desktop.&nbsp; Both are running Windows 10 and I make a lot of use of the Microsoft Print to PDF driver.&nbsp; I also make a lot of use with OneDrive to provide me consistent access to the latest versions of all my files wherever
 I am, in the office or out on site.&nbsp; Everything works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when I create a PDF with my laptop I have found that I get different results to when I create a PDF with my desktop.&nbsp; Futher experiments show this is mostly (possibly even exclusively) with Excel, and specifically with Excel when it has
 to scale the worksheet to 'fit all columns on page'.&nbsp; <span>I can take exactly the same document with exactly the same settings and print it in exactly the same way, but get two different outputs.</span></p>
<p>The way in which the two PDFs differ changes from document to document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one case a work sheet with a company logo in the header has a good 'Print Preview' but massively magnifies the logo.&nbsp; When there are multiple pages (across several work sheets printing at the same time) it will only do this on some of the pages, typically
 the ones which the 'fit' function applied to the print preferences.&nbsp; Print preview functions show everything to be fine, but when I print from my laptop I get the occasional distortion, as described (the preview does not match the output).&nbsp; When I print from
 my desktop it's fine (the preview matches the output).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another case, a worksheet sized to fit on a page when previewed on the desktop will overspill onto a second page when previewed on the laptop.&nbsp; In this case the preview matches the output for both machines, but the output is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to completely remove and reinstall Excel on both machines.&nbsp; I have completely (I think) removed the 'Print to PDF' printer on both machines (difficult to know if I have *really* removed it, or if the reinstallation is using the same driver).&nbsp;
 In all cases the results remain the same: some documents print fine on both machines, others are changed in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating and I am hoping that a) I am not the only one out there to have had similar problems, b) if anybody has a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Angus</p>

            You should be using a real PDF reader that has a real PDF driver, like <a href="https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Foxit Reader</a> or <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CutePDF</a> or others like them. Not Adobe Reader, which makes you pay for a PDF driver.

<h2>            Canceling Auto-Renewal </h2>
                    
<p>Why do you make it so hard to cancel an auto renewal? It would be incredibly easier if you just had an option on the website in the first place! The calling just takes time and its rather annoying when you could EASILY just put an option in either the Xbox
 dashboard, or on this website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for making it harder on the community to tell you to stop siphoning money away from my account 10 bucks at a time.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi there.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>The option&nbsp;via xbox.com was removed early last year. Yes this may be an inconvenience but it should only take you a few minutes through phone support once
 you get a&nbsp;hold of a representative. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Good luck.

<p>Even worse, if you live in IL or some other country where not allowing users to cancel auto-renew online is illegal, the option exists on the website like it used to.
</p>
<p>Not allowing online auto-renew cancellations isn't for some safety reason. It's not for security. It's not for convenience. It's there so it makes us jump through hoops just to stop them from autocharging your account.</p>

<p>Absolute scammers,this is sneaky way to make money,auto renew should be a choice,you have none,when you make any purchase with a bank card they take money every month,ive been had many times.On one 800 point purchace ended up costing £40,in hidden charges,when
 you phone to cancel it is not quick and easy,it is withdrawn, and in india,they end up trying to sell you more live time and then ask you to complete a questionaire to rate the service....all this and i paid for the call aswell.Xbox doesnt care bout this either,most
 people dont notice small amount of money leaving their account &nbsp;monthly,but something needs to change.</p>

<p>Tehmhotabot: &nbsp;When a purchase is made with your credit/bank card on xbox they automatically assume to take money every month,when you make this purchase you have no choice to turn off auto renew, you must phone them.Your sarcasm is inherent of fools. When
 i make any purchase of any kind with my bank card i do not then expect to be fleeced every month for the same item. How do you propose to turn off auto renew, is there a button somewhere, no there isnt,because i just got off the phone to xbox after cancelling
 auto renew again. This is the choice I refer to,not getting pre paid cards. </p>

 buy 1month xbox and am then charged every following month until i pick up the phone and request the direct debit to terminate. &nbsp;Does it not seem odd to anyone. Probably not. Try terminating any other direct debit. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>You're not getting the option to specify an admin account because you do not have any such account left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You fell into a classic trap. You played with your accounts without having a spare admin account that you can fall back on in case of trouble. It's like having a single house key. You can recover from this like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask a friend with a Windows 10 machine to create a bootable flash disk, using the command
<em>recoverydrive.exe</em>.</li><li>Use this disk to boot your machine into Windows Repair Mode.</li><li>Use System Restore to set your machine back to a point before you did whatever you did with your accounts.</li><li>Create, test and document a spare admin account so that you never ever fall into this trap again.</li></ol>
<p>The above steps require a certain degree of experience at a maintenance level. You might want to ask a friend to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way - the native app <em>snippingtool.exe</em> is a far superior way to create a screen snapshot. I recommend you try it.</p>

<h2>            Unidentified network with wireless.</h2>
                    I'm having a very irritating situation. I've been using vista on a computer that I got from dell a few months back. I have had no problems using my wireless network until the last few months. I now get unidentified network with local access only. When
 I do an IPconfig id get an address for a class B network. I'm at home so I should get and address something like 192.168.1.2 W make some change to the network settings and reboot I get a private network and the correct IP address. If I reboot again I cannot
 get the correct IP. Can anyone tell me what is happening and how to fix it?

            Try this:<br />
1. Right click the network logo at the bottom right of the screen and click on "Network and Sharing Center"<br />
2. Click "Manage Network Connections" on the left<br />
3. Right click your wireless network and select "Properties"<br />
4. Click on "Internet Protocol Version 4 TCP/IPv4" and click "Properties" beneath it<br />
5. Select "Obtain an IP address automatically" and click "OK"<br />
<br />
And hopefully, the connection will sort itself out in about 10-15 seconds. Let me know if this works!

<h2>            Scam phone call claiming to be from Windows support</h2>
                    <p>original title:&nbsp;ammyy.com</p>
<p>I have just had a phone call from someone claiming to be from windows support claiming my computer has told them it's full of viruses. I was taken to a website called ammyy.com where the caller gained control of my computer and showed me my computer had
 1000s of viruses apparently because I was running windows vista instead of windows 7 meaning my Mcafee security won't work properly. I was told it would normally cost £400 to remove viruses and upgrade to windows 7 but they could do it for £160. At this point
 I said I couldn't afford it so they offered to remove the viruses for £60. I again said no and at this point they hung up. Are ammyy.com a legit partner of windows? Is my computer full of 1000s of viruses? Will I have security issues after they have had remote
 control of my computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
In USA you can contact FBI, State Attorney General, local law enforcement and consumer<br />
watch groups. Arm yourself with knowledge.<br />
<br />
No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors existed on your<br />
computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or worse to steal your identity.</p>
<p>Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make unsolicited<br />
phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

<p><br />
It is a scam !!!!<br />
NEVER, NEVER allow anyone to gain control of your computer. Not unless <strong>YOU</strong>yourself call someone for computer help.<br />
You'd better read a few 101 about safety in internet, public library may provide good source of such articles.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, use your installed anti-virus program and run a full virus scan. <br />
If you care to try it, here is one called &nbsp;<strong>Malwarebytes anti-virus</strong>. It is very good in catching viruses.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Scroll way down. Pick the “ Download free version “, unless you want to buy the paid version.</span></strong></p>
<div><strong><span>Instructions to run Malwarebytes :</span></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span>Open Matwarebytes &gt; Update tab &gt; get updates &gt;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>Scanner tab &gt; select Perform full scan option &gt; Start &gt;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>Will take some time. Wait. &gt;</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>When done, a message box will appear &gt; OK to close message box &gt; Maleware removal will continue &gt;</span></strong></div>
<div><span><strong>Back in Scanner window &gt; select Show Results button &gt;</strong><strong>Click “ Remove Selected “ button</strong></span></div>
<div><strong><span>It may ask for computer to reboot in order to remove some of the viruses, if so, allow it.</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>After reboot, log in and continue with the rest of the steps.</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>When removal done, a scan log will be displayed in Notepad.</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>Exit the program when you are done.</span></strong></div>
