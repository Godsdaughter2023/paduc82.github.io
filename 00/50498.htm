    <title>Blinking screen after Windows 10 install on ASUS X502C laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blinking screen after Windows 10 install on ASUS X502C laptop</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I upgraded my ASUS X502C laptop to Windows 10 last night. Now my screen is flashing and I can't do anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've tried holding down f8 during boot to get to safe mode. I still get the flashing intro screen with my desktop icons.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've read that ASUS may have an incompatible graphics driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Is there any way forward from here? How do I undo the Windows 10 installation?</p>

    <title>how can I reset my type cover&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevet-12  say:</h3>
<h2>            how can I reset my type cover&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My type cover (Surface Pro 4) stopped working a couple days ago. There was Windows update around that time, but I did not pay too close attention--I just do them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the type cover puts out gibberish. Some letters work while others type nothing, and still others output weird character strings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when I type the 'a' key, I get this: `7ypagb</p>
<p>The 'd' key yields: 9=o]d'm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backspace and Shift work, but the spacebar doesn't. (I'm typing all of this on the touchscreen.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- detaching and reattaching the type cover</p>
<p>- restarting</p>
<p>- two-button restart</p>
<p>- removing the device in the device manager, deleting the driver, and restarting
</p>
<p>- system recovery (keep my files version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware is clean and in good order, with no signs of distress.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Dock to Dell U2711 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pumpkincompass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Dock to Dell U2711</h2>
                    <p>Since the Jan 15 firmware update, I have been unable to get my Surface Pro 3 to display through the dock displayport to my Dell U2711.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dock connects to the monitor through a mini-Displayport to Displayport cable (CableMatters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the Jan 15 firmware update, there were problems; I was finding that I had to completely power cycle both the dock and U2711, and to reboot the surface, in various permutations, before it would recognize and display to the U2711.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Jan 15 firmware update, no amount of messing around with this seems to get the monitor to display through the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the monitor, cable and PC are working because if I connect the mini-Displayport cable to the Surface Pro 3 directly, the monitor comes right up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The news is that the Jan 15 firmware update did some things to "improve" displayport and in particular daisy chaining, but I don't have daisy chained monitors and for my configuration the Jan 15 firmware seems to be a regression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way this ought to work is that I drop my Surface Pro 3 into the dock and the monitor should come right up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell U2711 is an established very mainstream and straightforward monitor that has worked for me for a few previous generations of laptops. &nbsp; This really should just work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, I have a dock at home with a U2711 and the monitor and dock work fine there.</p>

            <p>No, my Surface Pro was not in the dock when I applied the Jan 15 firmware update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you suggesting that the Surface Pro must be in the dock, in order for firmware changes to propagate into dock firmware? &nbsp; Is this dock-umented anywhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wouldn't be a good design choice by MIcrosoft, to have dock firmware updates only when the Surface Pro is updated and when it is in the dock. &nbsp; It is not just the case where I did an update to the Surface Pro 3 when it was not in the dock, that illustrates
 this. &nbsp; It is also that I happen to own and use three different docks, among several different offices. &nbsp; So if I did an update in one dock, it would not help the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was kind of worried about this. &nbsp; It did seem like some of my docks were behaving than others. &nbsp;I did not engage in research to try to drill down on this (who has time for that kind of thing, drilling down to debug a dock!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to force a firmware update on the Surface Pro 3 dock?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think computer manufacturers in general are having a lot of problems with docks and DisplayPort. &nbsp;If you search the web you can sell all sorts of bug reports on various manufacturer sites about their docks. &nbsp; And you can see all sorts of dock firmware
 updates, which basically are not working for their customers. &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to bottom out that the hub chips that are available on the market for manufacturers to incorporate into their designs are basically lame. &nbsp;Hopefully MIcrosoft did not get stock with
 one of these lame hub chips in the Surface Pro 3 dock. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to escalate their attention to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Not sure either way about needing to be docked or dock-u-mentation. However,</div>
<div>what you might try is:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. system restore to a point before you installed the 1/15 updates.</div>
<div>2. go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826</a> and</div>
<div>download the MSI installer while docked.</div>
<div>3. While docked, run the MSI installer. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us know results. If the issue is still present, we need to get a case opened</div>
<div>for you. </div>

            <p>Apologies for the irony but I couldn't resist:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;IRONY ON&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I understand. &nbsp; Should I be probing with protons or electrons? &nbsp; And should the beam flux be at 125 GeV or do I need higher energies? &nbsp; I think I have a flux capacitor around somewhere in the garage, but I'm not sure I have the widger needed
 to get the muon flux reversal time constant high enough in it to ramp the current through the superconducting magnets in order to increase the partcle acceleration higher in the undulators and wigglers. &nbsp;And do the collisions events need to be done concurrently
 with the MSI reversal, or is this a reversable and non energy dissipating and non entopy creating process?</p>
<p>

</p><p>The point I am making is that my read on this is that there is a tricky, intermittent, but in the design of the Surface Dock. &nbsp; &nbsp;However, having customers work on "research projects" to try to determine the cause will be very time consuming because specific
 information that the electrical engineer who designed the dock would have at hand, such as the schematic, test measurements, solutions that have been tried so far, and so on, is not available to the customers. &nbsp; Most of the time in a diagnostic research project
 by customers would be consumed trying to discover these things. &nbsp; That is not a good use of time.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help Barb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty much done with the issue myself. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My read from having spent a few hours on this is that the dock (firmware or whatever) is defective as a product line. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's disappointing that Microsoft didn't validate this design before shipping it, but I'm not motivated by that to spend any more time debugging this product. &nbsp; A couple of hours cumulative of morning thrashing trying to get the monitor on my work desk to
 display (with a lot of fruitless power cycling of docks, Surface, and monitors trying to discern a pattern*) is enough. &nbsp;The cost of this debugging ought not get slayed off on customers thrashing "free labor," nor to the good time of volunteers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A work around is to plug the mini-Displayport cable directly into the Surface Pro 3 when it is in the dock.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Claire</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article that you reference gives no information on problems with DisplayPort and the dock. &nbsp;DId you mean to send me to a link that did have this official information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile there are quite a few other threads on this forum, and many reviews on Amazon, detailing customer's frustration and travails with the dock and DisplayPort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time I do not think I have time to engage Microsoft for assisted support. &nbsp; Reading the dramas posted by other customers about mini-DisplayPort dock problems in the other threads, the common theme is that the customer is walked through a time consuming
 process of dock swaps, recalls, reboots, depowering, plugging permutations/combinations and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which in the end for most of them is for naught.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My earlier ironic post before about getting engaged in a "fundmental particule physics"-like research project to probe the mysteries of the dock tried to make the point. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like instead of thrashing your customers futher someone on your end ought to rig up one of the problematic configurations over in Redmond (e.g., buy a used U2711 on Ebay or a 4K monitor on Amazon), and look at the schematics of the dock (it is not
 really a black box - a Microsoft electrical engineer somewhere knows what is inside), and look at the firmware, and diagnose the problem and and
<p>
</p><p>This would be so much more effective and appreciated than wearing down a succession of customers through a pointless ritual of swaps, power on/offs, etc. that leaves everyone with no progress. &nbsp; When I write everyone I mean to include you folks at Microsoft.
 &nbsp;It's got to cost you guys something to have your front line customer support be on the phone with these customers steaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one other unique aspect to address from my thread and that is that there is general confusion about whether the Surface needs to be in the dock for updates to be relevant. &nbsp; (This is the kind of information Microsoft would have at hand but which
 has not been posted as far as I can tell, that would benefit the community suffering from this bug.) &nbsp;Documentation and people are hinting that is actually true. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would not be a good requirement, as the Surface is a Wireless Mobile device and likely to not be in a dock when updates are applied. &nbsp;And particularly also because it raises the question of how to address the bug when a customer has more than one dock
 (e.g., home, office, school, ...) for the same Surface; one might get lucky and have the Surface in one dock and get the updated firmware in, but what about the others? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there will be answers to these mysteries (the electrical engineer at Microsoft writing the updates ought to just know) and particularly if there is a mode where firmware updates for DisplayPort/Dock are coming out but are dropping on the floor due to
 unspecified requirements for installing updates, &nbsp;it would be great if someone from Microsoft could just clarify (to the forum, to documentation, in the newsletter to customers) what the requirements exactly are.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a design suggestion for this Microsoft engineering. &nbsp;They could design the next dock firmware updates so that they go in foolproof; that the firmware update to the dock will flow at any time after the update when the laptop gets docked to any dock.
 &nbsp; This way the firmware updates to the dock would not depend on the Surface update happening when the Surface is docked, and it would also flow to multiple docks virally whenever the Surface is docked. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another aspect of this problem is that if, actually there is no fix, admit it. &nbsp; I suspect and am dismayed that this is actually is the case, and fear in particular that the hub chip in your dock has timing defects that no "firmware fiddling" can address.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyind why I am reluctant about engaging Microsoft customer support on this issue is that I tried to run nearly this exact issue - Dock not working with DisplayPort and a vanilla Dell monitor - to ground, &nbsp;with another PC company. &nbsp; The PC company was very
 diligent - sending me several new docks, new motherboards (which ended up damaging the laptop functionality), walking me through firmware updates, and so on. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I should probably do some more introspection on why I spent 30-40 hours on that, but for some reason I was keen to see the configuration "just work" as it had with previous laptops.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the end they could not get dock to work properly. &nbsp; They did not admit it, but in the course of this the manufacturer of the hub chip in their dock was identified, even the part number, and it looked pretty much like that chip was "end of life'd"
 and the supplier had moved on. &nbsp; (That manufactuer was kind enough to refund me for my laptop and docks.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;SPECULATION ON&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my my speculation: that the technical challenge of designing a good dock hub chip (that can daisy chain a couple of 4K DisplayPort monitors, talk Gigabit Ethernet, handle four or five USB 3.0 ports, supply power to charge devices through USB, isolate
 high quality audio from power supply hum, and so on, using a regular old AC power supply) is actually pretty extreme, while the price point that the market for docks can support is pretty low, and further the voumes are also pretty low. &nbsp;It's not a part that
 any sensible chip engineer would try to design, or any sensible company (that wants to make a profit) would want to sell. &nbsp; So some second-tier supplier put out a half-backed hub chip, and due to lack of any alernatives on the market, the PC manufacturers&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span>
 jumped on it for their docks, put the products out,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span> to find that the chip doesn't work and their docks don't work. &nbsp; Then the supplier folded up and/or got acquired, the original engineer who designed it moved
 on, and that's that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this doesn't seem to be something that the PC companies are prepared for in their support offerings: basically, unfixable, defective elementary functionality of a peripheral. &nbsp; The support organizations genuinely want to help, offering replacement parts,
 walking through BIOS and firmware updates, and are willing to spend endless time escalating through the support organization. &nbsp; Just search for Dock and DisplayPort on Google and you can see people having this sort problem with Lenovo, Dell, HP, ... &nbsp; Apple
 is exceptional in this regard because they don't produce a dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see that Microsoft is caught in this sort of cycle for this bug based on the posts and reviews on Amazon for the Dock/DisplayPort issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not going to happen fast, but the PC manufacturers who want to sell docks that work are going to have to somehow step up and put some top tier chip designers to making a good hub chip. &nbsp; Or bite the bullet and design the hub using an expensive FPGA.
 &nbsp; It's going to mean that supplying a dock will be a money losing proposition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;SPECULATION OFF&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS</p>

            <p>No progress on getting the dock on my work desk to work. &nbsp; I was plugging the miniDisplayPort into the Surface 3 Pro directly, but that didn't solve the problem where the dock's internal USB hub was locking all the other peripherals up. &nbsp;My ritual to get
 the dock USB working &nbsp;is to pull the AC on the U2711 display, pull *every* connection out of the dock, let it sit idle for 60 seconds, then plug things back in.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm starting the process of returning all of my docks as defective. &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm going to replace them with Amazon 7-Port Powered USB3 hubs and separate Surface 3 power supplies. &nbsp; It will mean that I have to spend 10 seconds when docking or undocking to plug
 three connections in, but that will be better than 15 -30 minutes trying to reset the hung dock when plugging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my colleague showed me her Surface 3 Pro setup. &nbsp; When she uses a USB hub like this, she does split displays and she can take notes on the Surface while working on the monitor. &nbsp; Pretty neat. &nbsp; A good reason not to get the dock even it wasn't a defective
 product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's the solution! &nbsp;Don't use the dock.</p>

            <p>As a sysadmin trying to incorporate the Surface Pro 3 + dock into our healthcare facility, I have to say, I'm on PumpkinCompass's side in this matter. The useless troubleshooting steps that are being thrown out to customers is not only a slap in the face,
 it's a waste of time for everyone involved and the end result has been nothing but failure. Why should we, as the customer, be troubleshooting this for Microsoft? They have the means (money + talent) to figure this out but it seems it's not a high priority.
 The technology involved really isn't anything new, you should slide it in and it should display on the external monitor. If that doesn't work consistently, the product is defective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I for one feel Pumpkin's frustration and think that instead of confusing the matter with steps that, to an experienced tech, don't make a lot of sense, support should be more open about the scale of this issue and work together to get MS attention and hopefully
 a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, while this was a minor annoyance on 8.1 and manageable, with 10 it's unusable. It's so bad today that it's made our surfaces unresponsive even after pulling from the dock, requiring a forced reboot to even use the device further. Aside from
 the docking issue, Win 10 is phenomenal on the SP3, so it's a shame that this taints what could be an all around success for MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's someone out there that can fix this issue, I'll buy you a keg.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            XPS viewer won&#39;t print an actual XPS file to a physical printer</h2>
                    I asked this yesterday, but no MS-approved person deigned to review/answer.<br />
<br />
From various web pages, I printed to "XPS Document Writer" and it dutifully created XPS files (I gave them names, obviously, not the "*.xps" that was the default), and I see them in Win Explorer. When I right-click and say "open with" and choose the XPS viewer,
 the files appear. When I then say File, Print, and choose me actual Printer (an HP Color LJ 2600n, which I've had for 3 years and has worked flawlessly), the doc doesn't even go into the printer's queue. I've been forced to revisit the original web pages to
 find whatever and print them directly to the physical printer (which worked fine).<br />
<br />
I downloaded Hotfix Windows6.0-KB948924-x86 but when I click on it, it says this does not apply to my system. So ... what DOES apply?? System has been updated/is up to date, as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
Vista Home Basic, 32-bit, at SP2.<br />
<br />
Please advise. I am very frustrated at this point. Will W7 fix this?

            Try to uninstall and re-install the updated printer driver.<br />
<br />
That should [probably fix this issue.<br />
<br />
You can also check with the clean boot troubleshooting because sometimes other softwares running on the computer conflict with the printing:<br />

            Thanks for your reply ... but am not sure that will do the trick. I believe I am running into an actual bug, and was hoping an MS engineer would point me in right direction as to hotfix ... or say that none existed yet.<br />
<br />
The XPS driver / writer "came with" Vista, so far as I can tell (or, did it come as a complementary part of MSO2007, which I did not install?). The driver / writer seems to be&nbsp;working fine (I can "print" / create XPS docs, no problem).&nbsp; When I click on them,
 they open, and I see what I "printed." I have no idea where to get the software (and thus, how to reinstall it if I uninstall it). If you could tell me that, I'll uninstall.<br />
<br />
As for repairing Vista ... the rest of Vista is working fine, SFAIKT. I am under impression the XPS Viewer program OUGHT to print _any_ XPS document to an actual printer ... but it doesn't seem to want to do that.<br />
<br />
XPSviewer.exe (associated with XPS files)&nbsp;sits in Windows\System32, and says its version is 3.0.6920.4000, dated Feb 18, 2009, 2:39 pm.<br />
Is that the "right" version?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.

            I too am running into the same issue trying to print XPS documents on Windows 7.&nbsp; All other types of files print with no issue, but as described you can view XPS documents but you cannot print them.&nbsp; I ultimately get that a print spooler isn't running.&nbsp;
 Checking system services I found this was true.&nbsp; Restarting and trying to print again causes the print spooler to shutdown..&nbsp; Again this only happens with .XPS documents.&nbsp; As NYCTSMichelle states, this sounds like a bug with Windows 7..specifically the print
 spooler.

<p>Judging from searches this is quite a common problem but there are no answers available.</p>
<p>I am viewing an XPS document with the latest version of viewer downloaded and installed. My .NET framework is up to date and I am running Windows XP SP3.</p>
<p>Every other application you could possibly imagine will print to my network printer HP Laserjet with no problem whatsoever, but when I click print in XPS Viewer, I get a message box that says "The Viewer cannot print all of the pages in the document. Verify
 that the printer is installed correctly, and that you have permission to use this printer."</p>
<p>It is and I do, and it works with <strong>everything</strong> else I have installed.</p>
<p>QED: XPS Viewer is rubbish.</p>

<p>Opening in Internet Explorer worked for me. You can then select print from "File'". I too had issues trying to open .xps files with the&nbsp; XPS viewer in&nbsp; WinXP.</p>
<p>Don't know about any later versions of Windows. Good Luck. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip, I just tried this and it wouldn't work across the network or printing from the PC to which the network printer is attached.</p>
<p>In both cases the printer dialogue came up (which is more than happened using xps viewer), but the file disappeared into thin air, not appearing in any print queue anywhere and giving no message.</p>

            To back up ideasfarm, this very same thing happens to me, as well. &nbsp;One clue might be that I have Chrome installed, and is set as my default browser. &nbsp;When I first opened the XPS file the viewer simply opened chrome, which, not knowing what to do with
 the content type, simply downloaded the file. &nbsp;Back to square one. &nbsp;I changed to always open in IE, and now I can see the file, but File -&gt; Print only brings up the print dialog, hitting Print does not add the document to the print spool.

<h2>            How do I remove the memory card from the card reader on my computer&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi... I basically just (finally) got a computer &amp;&nbsp;I'm trying to figure things out along the way.&nbsp; I&nbsp;somehow managed to take the card from my digital camera, insert it into the side of my computer, click on a few things, and voila!&nbsp; My photos were on my
 computer screen!&nbsp; Right when I was starting to feel pretty proud of myself, I realized that I had no&nbsp;!@#$ idea how to get the card back out!!&nbsp; I've been googling my head off, and my 7-year-old could probably show me how to do this,
 but she's at her grandma's &amp; I'm left to fend for my computer-illiterate self!&nbsp; I can't seem to find the answer to this question!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; SOS &nbsp;- Help me!

<p>Depends on the card &amp; reader. They usually either pull straight out or push in slightly to then pop-out. Finger, not arm strength should be more than enough.</p>
<p>Both memory cards and readers are quite flimsy bits of kit, so don't force it.</p>
<p>What sort of memory card is it: SD, SDHC, CompactFlash, Memory Stick Duo Pro ?</p>

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually this issue is caused due to many reasons such as due to minor settings changes or due to any third party program that is blocking the computer to get updated. I would like to know some information about this issue so that we can help you better.</p>

<p>2. Which security software is installed on your computer?</p>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>

</p><p>These threads are months old and have exhausted all of the standard troubleshooting lines of attack that you are suggesting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are a support engineer, which means that you have access to developers and code within Microsoft.&nbsp; Find one.&nbsp; Seriously, get up or get on the phone and find&nbsp;someone&nbsp;who&nbsp;has access to the source code&nbsp;and get them to explain to you what would cause this
 specific error code to occur.&nbsp; The answer to that question is not "many reasons".&nbsp;&nbsp;That isn't how code works.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some piece of code is deciding that it cannot proceed and is purposefully placing this error message as a result.&nbsp; Follow the logic of the code or
 get someone who can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the whole reason that error codes exist.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you cannot do so, then please pass it along to a senior support engineer or whatever other name given to the guy that does have access to developer and code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been going on for 6 months now, and we deserve a little bit more than generic troubleshooting responses like this.&nbsp;

            <p>I worked with two Level 1 support techs until they gave up and escalated the issue to a Level 2 tech. All three of them tried the same standard troubleshooting steps that I had tried on my own. They even ran a shotgun style troubleshooting utility that messed
 with Windows Update, and just about everything that's not Windows Update too. Eventually the Level 2 guy gave up and sent me to Enterprise support. Apparently he wasn't supposed to do that, as I was informed by the Enterprise tech that I either needed a contract
 with them, or pay over $200 (he didn't specify if that was for one session, or one hour). He eventually sent me back to Level 1 as I wasn't willing to pay to help Microsoft fix their software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a hardware problem. I have 8.1 installed on a custom desktop, so it's certainly not unique to HP. I finally gave up on the whole "calling tech support to save time" thing and reinstalled 8.1 (I have a Windows 8 product key, and therefore can't
 use an 8.1 ISO... I have to install 8, run a zillion updates, then install 8.1, run more updates... Microsoft needs to have a system to convert 8 keys to 8.1. It sucks to be an early adopter sometimes). So far the issue hasn't returned, but it took several
 months for it to become a problem the first time, so I still don't trust it. I even have identical drivers and software installed as before. It has to be registry problem or some obscure corrupted system file that none of the repair tools or troubleshooters
 target. It's especially worrying that no one was able to figure out why the problem exists, or what the problem is; and that's with full access to my file system, including Windows Update log files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst part about this issue is that most people won't notice when Windows Update is broken, and so Microsoft will likely continue to think that this problem is isolated to just a few hardware/software configurations. I didn't realize anything was wrong
 until I noticed that Microsoft Security Essentials was out of date. Normally that gets updated frequently through Windows Update. The action center flag did not show any problem with Windows Update, so I literally had to manually check for updates to see the
 error. How many people manually check for updates? Not many.</p>

            <p>I'm just hoping this is something they know about and will patch on patch tuesday next month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>until then I won't be reinstalling windows I can update through wsus offline and so I can get any patch they release, its just rubbish windows update won't do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also will be running procmon etc when I can to try and determine what files that windows update actually touches and then it'll be a case of looking into everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do this as I'm a windows developer (I write code FOR windows platform not windows itself, and I do not work for microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this is indeed a serious issue. The entire 8 key to 8.1 is quite frankly DISGUSTING.. there is a recover option in the gui and it should work... it doesn't plain and simple.. we are paying customers .. smaller companies wouldn't treat their customers
 this way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get an 8.1 key and 8.1 disk from msdn but I'm loathe to start using them as it'll make me put a different key in and god only knows were the installation will end up registered to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a reformat will fix it .. but thats sledgehammer to crack a nut, after all this service should really just be connecting to another service getting a list and using bits to stream.. I've written stuff that does this.. and mine never went wrong.</p>

            <p>I agree with everything you've posted. &nbsp;It's also interesting that Windows Defender will install the security updates independently of Windows Update and works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just completed a clean install (reformatted C) of 8.1 using the ISO image the tech burned to a DVD - it's working at the moment - but like you don't trust it will stay that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until this time was using the Proxy Bypass to run Windows Update - it works - but then you're back and forth with the browser changing the setting</p>

<h2>            So Close&#33; medal</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot find a way of getting this medal. The description says "Lose your last heart by touching a trap that is adjacent to the exit" but having played many many many levels I have not find a single map in which a trap is adjacent to the exit. The exit
 is always surrounded by empty cells. How can one get this medal?</p>

<p>Sometimes there are traps one square away from exit. I got mine by triggering it while standing next to the exit (facing away from exit). This gets much easier when the number of traps go up very quickly at later levels.</p>

<p>Ok, so i'm not sure if this will help you guys or not, but I was struggling to get this medal for a while. The first time I tried what SkinnyDecaf says, the game offered me the option of coming back to life with one heart by watching an ad. I accepted this
 offer, and then repeated the procedure, so lost my last heart twice, but didn't get the medal either time. But later, I tried again and this time DECLINED the offer to come back to life, and immediately got the medal. I'm not sure if I have the reason pinned
 down (could have done something else different) but it's probably worth a try.</p>

<p>I can cofirm the method suggested by BouncedChimp3 still works in windows 10. Its technically a bug sinse at first you die two squares away from the exit, but by saying no to the advert, you "die again", right next to the exit.</p>

<p>Hi PCP-in-utah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mainly a computer with USB 3.0 ports should still be able to work with devices that has USB 2.0. Only difference is that a USB 3.0 would be working with lower versions and adjust it's speeds with it's respective version, and the USB 2.0 does the same to
 it's predecessor. Let's see what troubleshooting can we perform as I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same issue with other user profiles?</li><li>Have you tried updating or reinstalling your drivers for your printer?</li><li>What is the current build installed on your computer?
<ul>
<li>You'd be able to have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard and type
<em><strong>winver</strong></em> on the <strong>Run</strong> box, and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compatibility troubleshooter</a></strong> and the
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_devicec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for Device and Printers</a></strong> on
<strong>Windows </strong><strong>10</strong>. This way, we'd be able to have it automatically detect and fix issues on the computer to get your up and running with your task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to get back to me for the results and further assistance.</p>

                    <span>I have tried updating from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 through Windows Update, but when I reboot to start the installation it shows just a black screen with the blue Windows logo on it and nothing else.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">No</span> loading circles (like when Windows 8.1 turns on) and no loading bar. I have tried also with the .iso file, still same problem. Also when I try to boot from USB, it doesn't start at all, it keeps showing the
 Windows blue logo like in the previous attempts(the same USB but with W8.1, it boots). It keeps staying like that for up to 2 hours and the only way I could get out of is turning the PC off with the power button and after choosing "Windows 8.1" to boot instead
 of "Windows Setup". When I boot into W8.1 it shows something like "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;0xC1900101-0x20017 -&nbsp;</span><span>Windows 10 failed to install because of a SAFE_OS error". In previous

</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">While trying again and again it gave me another error, something like "Couldn't update the system reserved partition", but not anymore because I successfully extended that partition.

BTW, nobody understands the setuperr.log's errors log?<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 6 track pad freezes fequently - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 6 track pad freezes fequently</h2>
                    <p>Track pad on My surface pro 6 type cover freezes frequently and it's annoying as hell. Other peripherals work just fine. Type cover keyboard works just fine without any problem. Just that the mouse pointer freezes while using track pad. NOTE : the mouse
 pointer works just fine when connected to external USB mouse and when checked the track pad, it is not responding.</p>
<p>At times I touch on the screen to complete the typing to get work done for the moment but mouse pointer still doesn't work for a few sec there. It is terribly annoying.
</p>
<p>I have read multiple threads on Microsoft community and observe this problem in almost all Surface pro devices. The response from "Microsoft Agents" have been - update the windows, re-install the drivers, reset the Windows, detach and re-attach the type
 cover, if the cover is original and if so is it buggy or problematic..</p>
<p>I've tried it all. I replaced the type cover already with another Original one, I reset the whole windows thrice by now in just span of 46 days, check for updates and drivers..
</p>
<p>The track pad still freezes.</p>

<p>None of the "solutions" you mentioned here are "new". They are all mentioned somewhere in forum and I've ran it all.</p>
<p>Toolkit diagnosis says my surface is absolutely fine. There's no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to answer your 3 questions : </p>
<p>* I am facing the problem since day 1 when I bought it. </p>
<p>* third party software : Please elaborate. Which ones? (or eg)</p>
<p>* I tried connecting my type cover to other surface and I used new type cover on my surface. Both have been surface pro 6.</p>
<p>Came across same problem in both when used them as i'd use my daily device.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick update on this, and thanks for answering some questions that I provided. To answer your questions, what I'm trying to say is 3rd party anti-virus or other 3rd party apps that was not download under Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>Basing on your answer, this issue was happening on the first day of the device. Have you tried to store on where you purchase the device?</p>
<p><strong>Becuase if you've already done all the steps, even re-installing windows then possibly this is a hardware issue.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>But when you said about re-installing windows, are you referring to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RECOVERY IMAGE</a></strong>?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If yes, then we conclude that its a hardware issue. If no, I highly suggest to try that to re-new the Software of your Surface device.</strong></p>
<p>Please keep us posted..</p>

<p>Mine had the same problem, luckily enough a nice person helped my problem. Lets see if it works for you :)
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In desktop mode, on your taskbar you'll see a sound icon, right click on that and press "Playback devices" head to your speakers and right click, press "properties" Go to "enhancements" and press "DISABLE enhancements.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That should work for you. If not, get in contact with your audio drivers manufacture.

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12- Playing songs out of order</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Media Player 12- when I play an album (or manually add songs or videos to the playlist) it plays them out of order. I do not want to shuffle songs...I want it to play them in the order that i add them. Playing about with List Options seems to make
 no difference.</p>
<p><br />
Any ideas?</p>

<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn off and turn on Windows Media Player in Turn Windows Features on or off<br />
1. Click Start, type optionalfeatures and hit enter.<br />
2. From the list of items, expand Media Features.<br />
3. Uncheck Windows Media Player and click ok.<br />
4. Restart the computer.<br />
5. Click Start, type optionalfeatures and hit enter.<br />
6. From the list of items, expand Media Features.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 desktop icons keep rearranging themselves - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roadhazard386  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 desktop icons keep rearranging themselves</h2>
                    Every few days, all the icons on my Win7 desktop rearrange themselves. Usually they move to the left edge of the screen. I laboriously move all the icons back to where I like them, and 3-10 days later, they all shift left again. I've found no pattern or
 event that might cause this -- but it's very annoying!<br />
<br />
I've got Win7 build 7100 running on a Dell Latitude D830 laptop. Totally standard hardware and very little non-Microsoft software. In short, it's a pretty clean system.

            To supplement Reyas.M.I.'s answer, Under View is the option to select the icon size, Auto arrange icons and Align icons to grid.&nbsp; The Sort by option includes Name, Size, Item type and Date modified.&nbsp; I suggest you check both View and Sort by.

<h2>            SPWIZENG.DLL not valid &#43; Autorun error. Upgrading from XP-7pro, with an image form MSDNAA</h2>
                    
<p>I downloaded my&nbsp; copy of Windows&nbsp; 7 pro (x86) from MSDNAA, but when I try to run setup, from a Partition, a created DVD, and either of my External HDs, I get an error.</p>
<p>SPWIZENG.DLL is not a Valid windows image file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>followed by an Autorun error.</p>
<p>I've searched google and yahoo, and I've even tried replacement Dll files, but nothing seems to work. I cannot install windows 7 (x86) on my xp PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; I AM tempted to try x64, since I run a 64 bit processor, and upgrade advisor said my machine was capable,
 I just need a custom install.</p>

            Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes.
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website.

            Heya<br />Try searching for the drivers for your webcam brand or the model of the webcam. If it has them try installing them and configuring your webcam image.
