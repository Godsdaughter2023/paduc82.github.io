<h2>            replacing &#47; finding xml tagged text - comments - wildcards</h2>
                    I am trying to find all xml comments in an xribbon markup.<br />
A comment is text between "&lt;!-- " and "--&gt;"<br />
<br />
I'm trying to run the replace in Word on text imported from Custom UI Editor. I've tried understanding the instructions at
<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/general/UsingWildcards.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Finding and replacing characters using wildcards</a> but am not getting it. The search pattern I've tried is not recognized as valid. That is &lt;&lt;!--&gt;*&lt;--&gt;&gt;<br />
I guess the key is I don't know how to search for a character that is used as a wildcard.<br />
<br />
I also tried &lt;!--&gt;*&lt;--&gt; and &lt;--*--&gt; and &lt;\&lt;\-\-*\-\-\&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
When tried at the beginning, \&lt;([!\&lt;\&gt;]@\&gt;)*\&lt;/\1 will select the entire ribbon.<br />

<h2>            Word equations stopped autoformatting underscores for subscripts and &#94;for superscripts.</h2>
                    <p>The equation tool stopped converting linear format to the professional display format. Even the manual convert does not work. I have tried repairing tools, I even reinstalled Office, deleted my template to reset to the default one nothing seems to work.
 And it is a chore having to select with mouse for every subscript when writing.&nbsp;</p>

            Unfortunately Latex or not, the issue is still there it does not automatically convert to Professional format.

            Yes, apparently this was a bum steer (or at least a red herring). I later had confirmation that the LaTeX setting was irrelevant. Sorry!

            I believe it turned out that the cause of this problem (and several others) was having English (Israel) installed.

<h2>            office 365 home - Excel freezing and not responding</h2>
                    <p>I have Win-10 and my 2016 Office 365 Home "Excel" is "Freezing" and "not responding" for periods of time. These same spreadsheets have worked in all of the last several versions of office &amp; windows. I have worked with Microsoft for several months and not
 only done everything including letting them on my computer 3 times and they still can't fix the problem. They say they will call me back but never do or I get cut off on the phone.&nbsp;HELP!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***

            <p>Hi Parth,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your reply. Yes I tried <strong>Disableing my&nbsp;hardware graphics acceleration</strong> and it did not make any difference. I believe I have tried everything suggested and the only&nbsp;minor change accures when in safe mode and even then in still
 freeze's. I was wondering if hyperlinks and graphs have a effect on windows 365 home 2016 version'</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>I really appreciate your help. I tried a clean boot and it made very little difference.</p>
<p>My Excel file worked better but still would freeze up.</p>
<p>I am begaining to think there is a conflict between Office 365 Home 2013 and 2016 and Windows-10.</p>
<p>These files worked well in Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again and I still need more direction, Please.</p>

<h2>            Office Outlook 2013 slow on Windows 8.1 64 bit</h2>
                    <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a new computer with Windows 8, I install all my applications and it is super fast, but with Outook 2013 it's very slow when I select subfolders, send and Forward messages. I made the update to 8.1 and it's the same thing. Also my IE11 is also very
 slow, but Chrome and Firefox is fast. Outlook is connected to Exchange 2010 SP2 (over 1500 enterprise user) and IE11 via a Linux proxy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Someone can help us with that?</div>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Hello Martin,<br />
<br />
From the provided description, I understand that you're experiencing performance issue in Outlook and Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
I will work with you to resolve the Outlook issue.<br />
<br />
Let's first start Outlook in safe mode and then try working in it and verify the result.
<br />
<br />
1) Start Outlook in safe mode following the below mentioned steps:<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe <br />
<br />
Note: There is space between Outlook and /<br />
<br />
If Outlook safe works, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
2) If issue still occurs, create a new profile and add a Non-Exchange server email account and verify whether issue re-occurs.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new profile:</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-HA102749460.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-HA102749460.aspx?CTT=1</font></span></a><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span><font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3) If issue doesn't re-occur, add the Exchange server email account in new profile and check if Outlook works correctly as expected.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply with the result and I’ll be glad to further assist you.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</span></font></font></p>

<div><span>I have been working on this for days now and tried every trick I have googled from this forum and others. I have tried the&nbsp;</span><span>Google

<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>One suggestion was to forward my emails/contacts etc to an Outlook alias, which I have done - The emails come into Outlook and I have setup an account
 on the phone. I can see the emails and the contacts via the web browser on a PC, but I get no google contacts sync'd on the phone despite this option being selected on the Lumia (all of my contacts are in google - so I need this working)</span></div>

            <p>Hi Simon</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could trying a workaround for the sync issue. go to settings-&gt;keyboard-&gt;add keyboards this should force the phone to run an update for the new keyboard language and then setup the keyboard after which the phone will restart at this point your accounts
 will also be refreshed and the problematic folders will start to update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>you simply uninstall the keyboard afterwards </p>

            <p>Hi again Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well i tried this, but it made no difference unfortunately. As before, when i try and sync, the sync runs for ages then gives a google imap error (as discussed the imap settings are fine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, i stopped the email sync, and just set contacts to sync. This works fine and finishes after a few seconds. So the issue just seems to be with the email/imap sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers </p>

    <title>Has OneDrive for Business prioritized linking to online resources even - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Has OneDrive for Business prioritized linking to online resources even when they&#39;re synced locally&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I began to put some PowerPoint files on OneDrive for Business (as ODB below) as I'm working with them. My ODB has "Files on Demand" enabled to save local space but I always reserve the files and folders being worked with locally by right-clicking
 these items in Explorer and selecting "Always reserve on this device" <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<em>(this may not be the same as in the English version because I'm using a Chinese Windows 10 OS)</em></span>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened up these PPT files, it seems they were being loaded from online as the speed was much slower than loading files on local drives most of the times. And when I tried to add a hyperlink to some elements, the default path pointing to URLs that
 were actually somewhere on my ODB websites rather than the local location, even when all these files had been synced both locally and remotely. Besides, when I attempted to pack up the PPT for lecture use, most videos that were also synced couldn't be included
 into the package folder (but a few at the same location were packed in successfully). So weird and annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but not least, this ODB policy of&nbsp;<span>online resource priority is causing a great deal of lags.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I wonder if someone can help tell me what's the problem and how to make ODB local-files first? Thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for reply and sorry for a late response. Here are the details you demanded:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I copied my slides to a local drive, they just launched instantly in contrast to 20 secs or so that was taken when launched from the OneDrive Sync folder (my system drive is SSD while I put my user folder and OneDrive folder on an hdd, so a quick
 response is expected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Only some background threads were actually occupying system resources significantly when my computer slowly opened up the slides: intel uhd graphics, ccleaner, and OneDrive (I even disabled all the Adobe things by removing them from the registry). OneDrive
 sometimes took up more ram than usual and it has been always stuck at "more than 100,000 changes" according to the notification from the icon on the system tray. I think this phenomenon woud be associated to the sluggish problem of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. We are a small team with four people and the other three seldom use any Office365 apps apart from Word and Excel. They just store some small-sized files on their OneDrive space, so they couldn't have noticed the problem. On the contrary, I've taken OneDrive
 for Business as my file warehouse where I threw in all my design assets and that's why I have millons of files here. But that shouldn't have held OneDrive stuck on "processing 1xx,xxx changes" in the background, right? I tried to fix this by logging out and
 then back in but that attempt ended up in vain.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c3b43b3-5acc-49c8-a816-2f9a7029ec95?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c3b43b3-5acc-49c8-a816-2f9a7029ec95?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Besides, when I re-signed in OneDrive app by clicking Sync button on the OneDrive web, I found the web took up abnormally too much ram which should be far beyond necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf18572f-0824-4188-9090-388abfa16f65?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf18572f-0824-4188-9090-388abfa16f65?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Elements in question were pictures and videos, which are located in a subfolder of the OneDrive sync folder and is reserved locally. I created hyperlinks in my PPT slides rather than inserted them directly so as to keep the keynote small and to shorten
 the time used to sync it on every save. One thing to be noticed is that I can't open some of the pictures in the OneDrive sync folder and get warned with "OneDrive doesn't have the permission" (translated from Chinese). But these pics are actually synced to
 my hdd and can well be copied and opened somewhere else locally. You can refer to some of them in the screenshot below. Pay attention to the red frame I drew which said "synchronization has been suspended".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/848d7102-e314-448f-a7bb-80a5d436147b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/848d7102-e314-448f-a7bb-80a5d436147b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. By saying "pack the PPT for lecture use", I meant to export the slides to a separate folder whereby I think could adjust hyperlink destinations automatically. This feature can be accessed in the way shown below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4961290c-978a-441f-94dd-e3cd3393f938?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4961290c-978a-441f-94dd-e3cd3393f938?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, a brief description of my system:</p>
<p>1. CPU i5-6500 with integrated Intel UHD 530 + 8G DDR4 RAM</p>
<p>2. An SSD for Windows OS installation and an HDD for storage. Win10 is installed to a VHDX files and is actually running on its differencing VHDX.</p>
<p>3a. OneDrive for Business version:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. Office version:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Other major software: Adobe Creative Clouds; IBM SPSS, R, Python.</p>

<p>Being unable to withstand the unresponsiveness of the whole system, I spent days rebuilding the whole VHDX from ground up, leaving the OneDrive sync folder as it had been. When I finished installing all the software as before, the system wasn't that sluggish
 any more. Can't explain why the performance differs greatly with the same hardware and software. Maybe that's why Windows 10 is widely claimed to be buggy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after I set up synchronization folder of OneDrive for Business and pointed the location to where it used to be with some synced contents reserved, it was stuck at "processing xxx,xxx files" once again following logging in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't come up with any idea why OneDrive warned me that administrator privilege is needed to apply property change to the files and folders
<span>stored locally </span>when I tried to release them all. What was even more surprising is that after I clicked on Continue to pass UAC and let OneDrive proceeded releasing<em> (which cost high on CPU and
</em><span>actually </span><em>took several hours to be finished)</em>, OneDrive itself was also released from being stuck at&nbsp;<span>"processing xxx,xxx files" and began to upload some other files having been moved in the synced folder but waited in the queue
 since. So previously the problem was caused by privilege control? But I'm in fact using the same user names to have logged in both my computer and OneDrive for Business (as well as Office 365).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>S</span><span>o, would you please elaborate on what could have been going wrong here and any potential solution? Thank you in advance.</span></p>

<p>Hi, Tina</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I had mentioned "logining out and then back in" somewhere in the previous posts (the same as you said "unlink, quit and run it again"). That's what I had come up with the moment I found the syncing problem. And like I said, it was helpless. I had
 done this a couple of times, if not dozens. And that's why I left out this piece of instruction of yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the time I'm writing back, the notification "processing xxx,xxx changes" has come back again, and this time it has occured after I confirmed to release all the files as an administrator!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's even more weird was that I installed Win10 as a virtual machine for my MacBook Pro yesterday, using the same installer USB stick, signning in the same OneDrive account, and installing Office 365 with the same installer freshly downloaded from the
 offical office.com website, etc., it finishes synchronization check for just a little while without the aforementioned naughty notifications!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two things different about these two environments:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The computer with the problem I've been complaining about is actually my computer at work, which accesses Internet via the same ISP as I use at home, both randomly assigned with IP addresses and are likely to be in two separate subnetworks. But I don't
 think this would contribute to the OneDrive problem I'm suffering from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I built the virtual machine from scratch and OneDrive was assigned with a new location for storage. Like I mentioned in the last post however,&nbsp; on my work computer the OneDrive-synced folder with contents<em> (some reserved and some others could exist
 in ghost links only)</em> existed before a newly clear Win10 installation was carried out, and then I set up the new OneDrive app with the same old synced folder. Then the problem occurs time and time again. Well, I started to believe this is where the answer
 lurks and it has everything to do user privileges. Do you think so?</p>
<p>

    <title>Patch number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squirrel_jube  say:</h3>
<h2>            Patch number</h2>
                    
<p>I had Word, Excel etc. 2003 on my computer, but did not have Publisher. I tried to download a free trial of Publisher, but as it was downloading, it also upgraded/installed the other Office products on my computer to 2007 versions.</p>
<p>I lost the product key for this download, and then couldn't get in to my other programs (Word etc.) as it wanted&nbsp;a product key for them (I assume the one I got for the free trial of Publisher).</p>
<p>I unistalled these programs and reintalled the original Office programs I had, but its asking for a patch number to open them. What's a patch number? How do I find it?</p>

this thread</a>. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I want to bash my brains out against a rock!!! That would be less painful than the full five weeks of aggravation I have endured with this stupid product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am told that I can use files on the cloud without downloading them to my computer.&nbsp; I would prefer to use the app rather than the web based interface which crashes, freezes etc. (also, does not search my huge music library which I want stored ONLY on the
 cloud...not on my laptop which has only 250 GB of storage and I was talked into buying against my better judgement because of the terrabite in the cloud.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I was able to drag my music file (and other files) from my external hard drive.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; MY REAL MISERY began when I rashly and stupidly tried to set up an alternate itunes library to sync to the cloud.&nbsp; Itunes completely trashed my cloud
 backup and re-arranged it.&nbsp; I am still trying to pick up the pieces.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to me, it made a local copy of all the music on my C drive.&nbsp; Meanwhile, while it was in limbo it deleted half the library (eventually putting it back but with certain things
 missing which I am still painstakingly trying to figure out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no choice but to let it finish or I would have had to re-upload the files again.&nbsp; Now, however, I find that everytime I open OneDrive, it makes a copy on my C drive.&nbsp; This after a massively aggravating game of whack a mole where I would delete the
 files, only to have them pop back up.&nbsp; Of course the files were hidden from me because they were in C:MyName/OneDrive not C:MyName/Music.&nbsp; No matter how many times I deleted it, it kept coming back (and still keeps coming back if I try to reactivate one drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep hearing about these placeholders, but I cannot get it to work.&nbsp; the moment I open onedrive it starts recreating the behemoth folder and you can't stop it.&nbsp; Even when I pause sync, it will not stop.&nbsp; Or at least not soon enough.&nbsp; I would like to have
 a chance to select all folders except Music.&nbsp; Or to have a place holder for&nbsp; the music without the files on my hard drive, but this is not possible because the "fetch file" option is grayed out and it will not let me select it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am ready to tear my hair out.&nbsp; My neighbors must think I am being murdered because I have not stopped cursing and screaming since the day I bought this thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I enable this feature without starting the rampaging download which is like a runaway train that caj't be stopped until it destroys everything in its path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I can't use the app.&nbsp; Also, why wont' OneDrive search ALL OF THE FOLDERS IN ONEDRIVE.&nbsp; IT CONTINUOUSLY FAILS TO FIND THINGS THAT I IKNOW ARE THERE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why won't anyone ever give an answer that truly helps. I have been asing and asking...</p>

<p>Hi Mothra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I'd like to know more about your situation. Could you please provide the below information?</p>
<p>1. How is iTunes related to OneDrive? Please provide some screenshots to show the situation.</p>
<p>2. Are all your files already synced up to cloud? Please go to OneDrive Online to check it.</p>
<p>3. About "<span>Of course the files were hidden from me because they were in C:MyName/OneDrive not C:MyName/Music.&nbsp; No matter how many times I deleted it, it kept coming back (and still keeps coming back if I try to reactivate
 one drive)", please also provide some screenshots to show the sitution. Where and what did you delete? How do you reactivate OneDrive?</span></p>
<p><span>4. If you right click a file in OneDrive sync folder &gt; click Free up space, how much space does the file take up? What does Status column show?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9c3f04c-c23f-496d-8673-3859457a0704?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9c3f04c-c23f-496d-8673-3859457a0704?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;</span>Are you using a Microsoft account (e.g. ***@outlook.com) or work account (e.g. tenant.onmicrosoft.com or tenant.com)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I can do none of these things because to activate OneDrive is to dump a load of stuff on my hard drive.&nbsp; I don't get the chance to turn it off.&nbsp; It will not pause, it is like a speeding out of control locomotive speeding down a cliff.&nbsp; If I wait for it to
 stop I will have to wait for hours and hours for it to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to do files on Demand.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I have the 1803 update (shouldn't everyone by now??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention iTunes because I rashly and wrecklessly tried to get my library to point to the cloud.&nbsp; That was a disaster of titanic /hindenber proportions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent something like 15 hours dragging my music from my external hard drive to One Drive using the app.&nbsp; After trying to to connect iTunes to this source it proceded to trash everything I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to describe it is it emptied out one drive and downloaded everything to the C Drive.&nbsp; Then, it put everything back in one drive in a thoroughly mixed up and idiotic order.&nbsp; But that is not the worst part.&nbsp; The worst part is that when I try to
 activate the OneDrive app, it downloads everything to my computer (or it starts to because I have no choice but to turn it off and delete everything it did).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to be able to select the files to sync and not to sync, but that is impossible because you don't have a chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And where is this settings on the One Drive app.&nbsp; I have been all over the online version of One Drive and there is Nothing of the kind there.&nbsp; If you are talking about the app on my PC, I cannot activate it because of the reason I just told you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have 12 hours to babysit.&nbsp; I wish I could take an entire week off to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Files on Demand option.&nbsp; The save space option is grayed out.&nbsp; I do not want to turn off the app because how else am I going to upload a terrabites worth of files.&nbsp; The web site is a pieice of garbage and so is the online storage search engine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to literally scroll through thousands of files.&nbsp; Then when you find the one you want, you cannot open it in a new window.&nbsp; So when you&nbsp;back, you are back to letter A.&nbsp; Then you have to scroll through every time (as I am doing to fix the mess iTunes
 made of my music folder).&nbsp; TEDIOUS BEYOND WORDS!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DON'T KNOW IF I JUST HAVE TO DO A FACTORY RESET/EMPTY THE CLOUD FOLDERS&nbsp;AND START OVER.&nbsp; NOTHING ON MY PC MATCHES ANY THING THAT YOU ARE TELLING ME.</p>

<p>I know.&nbsp; I used those readily available screenshots to try to explain so I could get this situation sorted before the end of 2018 (since I work 16 hour days and do not really have to time and motivation to do all this after work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot that indicated what I could and could not see, is a reasonable facsimile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't the Fall Creator update happen a year ago?&nbsp; How can I not have that?&nbsp; (I am not talking about 1809.... the one that trashed millions of files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, I will be devoting EVERY WAKING MOMENT OF MY ENTIRE WEEKENED to this so stay tuned.&nbsp; At this rate, I highly doubt it will ever get solved since nothing I am seeing matches any of the so called "help."&nbsp; That and the catch 22 of turning on the
 machine blocks all attempts to change settings (because it is constantly syncing), and turning off OneDrive will not allow me to make changes either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only there were a way to deactive OneDrive while I change the settings.&nbsp; I still can't believe in 5 years nobody has thought of that, but then again, I do not know what goes on there.&nbsp; Windows 8 was not nearly as awful as all this and I have been through
 every windows upgrade since 1995.</p>

<h2>            Sync of Calendar and Contact limitations</h2>
                    My current calendar items sync okay but my reoccurring calendar items did not sync.&nbsp; Also, my contacts were limited to 24 characters in the title area and 1024 characters in the note area, can anything be done to resolve these limitations as Google GMail
 appears to not have the same limits.

            As you have discovered there are limitations in the way data is stored in Windows Live.&nbsp; Unfortunately these limitations are real and there isn't a way around them at this time.&nbsp; I believe the Windows Live team is aware of the issue and I hope they will
 address the issue sometime in the future, but at this point we really don't know if or when this issue will be addressed.<br />

                    I just upgraded to the new version of Skype. I had a contact that worked before the upgrade. That contact disappeared. I did a search and found the person. I clicked on add to contacts. The app automatically send a contact request. That person never received
 the request. I have tried several times. Of course the contact shows off line. What is the problem here?

<h2>            Outlook 2013 does not delete emails from exchange server</h2>
                    <p>Hi there - I've been searching for an answer to this, so apologies if this is obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;Since then, my Outlook 2013 has not been deleting emails from my Office 365 Exchange server - it is as if the "keep emails on server" has been selected, although this option is not available with Exchange. &nbsp;How do I fix
 this?</p>
<p>

            That's how Exchange accounts are supposed to work. Exchange accounts are two-way synching accounts and all the messages are kept on the server always. They only go away if you explicitly delete them.

            <p>I think you misunderstand me - when I delete an email on Outlook on my PC, that action is not replicated on the server or on any other email clients (obviously, as they are looking at the server). &nbsp;This is not intended behaviour (or how Exchange has worked
 for me for the last decade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have solved the issue by deleting my Exchange account in Outlook and re-installing it. &nbsp;Should have tried this first!</p>

    <title>Input Language Switch Appears on New Desktops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> safe exam browser project  say:</h3>
<h2>            Input Language Switch Appears on New Desktops</h2>
                    <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When creating a new desktop via the native Windows API and starting a Windows Forms or WPF application on it, Windows displays the Input Language Switch / Input Indicator as it e.g. also does when showing the UAC:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca900b8a-3b8e-4780-9674-ecfae14e7304?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca900b8a-3b8e-4780-9674-ecfae14e7304?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps To Reproduce</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Run Windows Version 1803 or later</li><li>Configure multiple input languages / keyboard layouts in the system settings</li><li>Build the attached solution (see "Source Code") and copy the output from project "WindowsFormsApp" to the output folder of project "NewDesktopBug"</li><li>Run project "NewDesktopBug"</li><li>Enter a name for a new, temporary desktop and hit enter</li><li>The new desktop should be activated with an empty form. In the lower right corner, the language switch should appear (see image below).</li><li>Close the form -&gt; the language switch should disappear</li><li>After 10 seconds, the default desktop will be re-activated.</li><li>Confirm with enter to terminate the application</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02804b80-26a0-4c4f-995a-0830452c1590?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02804b80-26a0-4c4f-995a-0830452c1590?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Source Code<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The Visual Studio solution linked below consists of two projects, "NewDesktopBug" which controls the desktop logic, and "WindowsFormsApp" which is an empty Windows Forms application. The relevant desktop logic is in the following two files: NewDesktopBug\Program.cs
 and NewDesktopBug\NativeMethods.cs.</p>

                    I tried some of the solutions on this forum without any success; clean boot, run in compatibility mode, open IE8 with no add ons, disabled every switch in Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; Is seems like someone somewhere could find a soultion to this problem.&nbsp;
 I have had my computer for less than a month; Windows 7 64 Bit OS and IE8.&nbsp; Please Help!

                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up a Community of Practice for grant recipients outside of the GoA platform.&nbsp; When I go to "create group" it only gives me a internal group option.&nbsp; I was successful setting up an external yammer group in 2013...so unsure what I am doing

<p>You question troubles me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in 2013, Yammer does not have the ability to create external groups. This feature only became available back in 2016. So are you referring to something else?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hello Angela, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The External group creation on your yammer home network has been disabled, hence you do not see the option for External group. You need to contact the Verified admin of your yammer network to enable the External group creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extracted from the previous article.<br />
Q. I don’t want the external groups feature enabled for my network. What options do I have to disable it?<br />
A. There are two ways to manage external groups and external messaging in your Yammer network. We recommend enforcing your Exchange Transport Rules in Yammer. For more details on how this works, please see this support article: “Control external messaging in
 a Yammer network with Exchange Transport Rules.” Alternatively, you can contact support for assistance implementing the following scenarios:</p>

</p><p>I discovered this issue as well because my Windows performance was horrible so I went digging. &nbsp;I had over 100,000 of these images in the temp folder which was making my system useless because of constant drive access. &nbsp;There were so many files in that folder
 I couldn't even open the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed it by doing the following;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I disabled OneDrive by right clicking it and selecting Exit</li><li>You can either uninstall OneDrive or disable it which is what I did. &nbsp;Task Manager -&gt; Startup -&gt; Microsoft OneDrive &amp; click Disable</li><li>Open a CMD prompt by clicking Start and typing CMD and selecting it</li><li>CD to the temp folder (when you open a non-admin CMD it starts in your profile) by typing "cd AppData\Local\Temp" without the quotes.</li><li>Then type "del /F /S /Q *" without the quotes to delete everything from the temp folder along with its subfolders.</li></ol>
<p>However from reading it seems other applications besides OneDrive can cause this to happen too if they have animated tray icons.</p>

            <p>Don't click anything in that message. Chances are it's a scam. Be sure to note the web address you see when you hover the mouse over any link. If it's not a Microsoft link, it's a scam. All links must be Microsoft links. If you're reading the message using
 a web browser, there should also be a green lock in the message list for the sender address, which also should be a Microsoft address.</p>

                    <p>I am working in OneNote 2010.&nbsp; One of the things I&nbsp;do is insert a file as a printout, then read through the printout making notes, highlighting etc.&nbsp; The problem I'm having is that my notes and hightlighting do not move with with printout.&nbsp; So, if I resize,
 or reposition the printout, the notes etc. stay put and become useless.&nbsp; Is there a way to&nbsp;"pin" those notes to the printout so that they move, resize, etc. along with the printout?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 software is expecting information about 2 email addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knowledge248  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 software is expecting information about 2 email addresses</h2>
                    <p>I have over 10 computers. I installed Windows 10 on this HP mini 210-4000cto netbook - I used my email account like I use&nbsp;it on&nbsp;every Microsoft account I have. Therefore it worked and I am here writing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 10&nbsp;needed to verify something it choose a different email address and left out characters to prove I know them yet when I did prove it it refused&nbsp;to continue - it&nbsp;was strange. I do not use that email address to verify anything - I only used
 it to try to forward my outlook email to this other email address - it does not work therefore I stopped trying to forward it. Windows 10 will not verify the information it requests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it would be better to use Ubuntu - Linux. Intel is providing a lot of Linux drivers and not Windows&nbsp;10 drivers. Windows 10 is useless without some way to fix the problem I have - Without Intel drivers I better stay with Windows 7. Windows 10 is working
 against me - its really silly.</p>

<p>You can remove and block a specific site by clicking the red X in the corner of that tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only remove all of these tiles by clearing History. </p>
<p>Internet Options&gt; General tab&gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete&gt; uncheck "Preserve Favorites website data" then delete History. Delete other data such as cookies, form data, passwords, etc. only if you want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set IE to clear History every time&nbsp;IE is closed from Internet Options (General tab) Browsing History...</p>
<p>Again, you should uncheck anything you don't want to delete like cookies, passwords, etc.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.

Set the Windows Defender service to <strong>Automatic</strong> instead of <strong>
Disabled</strong> or <strong>Manual</strong>. To do this, follow these steps: <span>
</span>
<ol>
<li>
Click <strong>Start</strong>, type services in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>Services</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.
</li><li>
Double-click the Windows Defender service, and then in the <strong>Startup type</strong> box, click
<strong>Automatic</strong>. </li><li>
Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you trying to install the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried saving the driver to your desktop</p>
<p>Close all windows and/or applications</p>
<p>Right click on the driver and select Run As Administrator</p>
<p>
<span>If Windows Device Manager indicates a device problem, or if the driver version of Windows Phone 8 that's installed isn't the current version, update the driver. To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
</p><ol>
<li>Connect your Windows Phone to your computer by using the USB cable that was included with your phone.
</li><li><strong>Windows 8 users:</strong>&nbsp;From the&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>screen, type "Device Manager," tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and then tap or click

<strong>Computer</strong>, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>A window will appear with the name of your computer and a list of files. (If you don't see the files, click the name of your computer.) The name of your Windows Phone 8 should be listed under
<strong>Portable Devices</strong>. If Windows Phone was incorrectly installed, it may be listed with a yellow exclamation mark. Or, it may be listed under
<strong>Other Devices</strong> as a USB device or an unknown device.</li><li>Double-tap or double-click <strong>Windows Phone

<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong> and then tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Return to the Device Manager window. Tap or click the
<strong>Action </strong>menu, and then tap or click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Portable Devices</strong>, double-tap or double-click the name of your Windows Phone, and then click the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. <br />
<strong>Note </strong>If you don't see your phone's name, tap or click the unknown device that is listed under
<strong>Other Devices</strong>, and then tap or click the <strong>Driver </strong>
tab.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Update Driver</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Browse</strong>, locate the C:\Windows\Inf\ folder on your computer, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Next </strong>and if you're prompted, click
<strong>Install</strong>. You may only be given a <strong>Close </strong>option.</li><li>After the driver installation is complete, close the open windows until you exit Device Manager. Restart your computer if you're prompted.</li></ol>
<br />

(just below the search box).&nbsp; </li><li>On the <strong>Updates in your basket</strong> screen, tap or click the
<strong>Download </strong>button. Tap or click the <strong>Browse </strong>button and select a convenient location to save the file, such as your Desktop or the Downloads folder. Tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>Close </strong>when the file has downloaded.&nbsp;</li><li>Browse to the file you downloaded (which may be contained in a folder called "Windows Phone - Other hardware - WinUsb Device") and then double-tap or double-click it.&nbsp;</li><li>Double-tap or double-click the file&nbsp;<strong>winusbcompat.cat</strong>. Select a location (such as the Desktop) to extract the file.
