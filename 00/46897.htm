<h2>            No Internet access under &#34;Administrator&#34; profile, but Guest Yes. </h2>
                    I'm not able to access the internet&nbsp;through my&nbsp; user profile which is the administrator.&nbsp; When I go to the "networking and sharing center" i have access to the wireless router and the internet, but when I open IE or other browsers I can't get on-line.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I decided to create a guest account and&nbsp;am able to&nbsp;log-on to the internet without any issues (through the same wireless router).

            <p>If you use a headset with a 3.5 mm plug and 3 rings on the connector, know that there are two standards for those headset connectors called "OMTP" and "CTIA".&nbsp;</p><p>If you have 3 headsets with a OMTP setup, then the headset is "talking" to the ground pin of the controller, and the controller is "listening" for the microphone on the ground-pin of the headset.&nbsp;</p><p>You need to get a CTIA to OMTP adapter, which simply reverses these two contacts. You can get these adapters online or in most cellphone stores. </p>

Thank you for your reply. I had tried all that, the simple truth is, I am VERY computer illiterate, and the solution was none of the above: I had touched the icon on my keyboard, but the icon did not look to me like a mic. I'll know next time, thanks again.

<h2>            Xbox One Family ... multiple homes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So here is a question I haven't found an answer for.&nbsp; I have a split home, my kids spend most of the year with their mother and share time in a different state with their stepmother and I.&nbsp; We have an Xbox One and have them as family members (of course)
 on my account.&nbsp; If I were to buy an Xbox One for them to have at their mother's house would I have to buy a second gold account for that xbox? would I have to have them set it up using my account somehow? Or could they simply sign in with their gamertags and
 be good to go for accessing out digital games and playing online with me?</p>

<p>hi i looked up the code for you and it is a code saying the xbox live marketplace is down, which is strange because to the best of my knowledge it has not been down recently. there are a few things you can do to see if this will help and in some cases this
 does. the first is to clear your system cache. the other is to go to your primary storage device and delete marketplace system data. then restart your xbox and see if this helps. hope it does.</p>

Status code: 80072746
<div>
<p>This error occurs if Xbox LIVE Marketplace is undergoing system maintenance, if temporary files on your Xbox 360 console are corrupted, or if you need to open network ports.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, try the following solutions:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Try again later</strong></p>
<p>Xbox LIVE Marketplace might be unavailable due to system maintenance. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Check the Xbox LIVE status</a>. If there is an Xbox LIVE service alert, wait, and then try again later.</p>
<p>If there are no Xbox LIVE service alerts, try the next solution.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Clear your system cache</strong></p>
<p>The system cache contains temporary files that are used by the Xbox 360 console. Clearing the system cache may fix this problem. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your Xbox 360 system cache.</a>&nbsp;
</li><li>Restart your console. </li><li>Try to access Xbox LIVE Marketplace. </li></ol>
<p>If you still get status code 80072746, try the next solution.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Clear your Marketplace system cache</strong></p>
<p>The Xbox 360 console also stores temporary files for Xbox LIVE Marketplace. Clearing the Marketplace cache may fix this problem. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, go to Settings, and then select System. </li><li>Select Storage, and then select your primary storage device. </li><li>Select <b>System Items</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Marketplace System Data</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Delete</b>. </li><li>Restart your console. </li><li>Try to access Xbox LIVE Marketplace. </li></ol>
<p>If you still get status code 80072746, try the next solution.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 4: Open network ports</strong></p>
<p>If you have a firewall or are connected to a network through your workplace or school, you might need to open network ports in order for your Xbox 360 console to communicate with Xbox LIVE. See
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network ports used by Xbox LIVE</a>&nbsp; for help with opening network ports.</p>

 this message :&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">"The application has failed to launch because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or
 use the command line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">- Following the advice of a kind reddit user, I tried to install the latest Visual C++ Runtimes, to no avail. He then told me to check the Event
 Viewer to look for the error, and there I found 72 errors, all identical to this one&nbsp;</span><a href="https://imgur.com/6I9f5CR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/6I9f5CR</a>&nbsp;except
 for the file paths.</p>
<p>- When I tried to take another screenshot for an error concerning the game itself, my PC crashed to a blue screen displaying "Your PC ran into a problem and need to restart". It stayed stuck there for some time so I rebooted manually.</p>
<p>- The PC booted up on the system repair tool. I performed a system restore to right before the installation of the game and it booted up fine.</p>
<p>- I launched the installation of the game and left for a couple minutes. I came back to the game running, my destop flashing black and Windows not responding. I had to reboot manually again.</p>
<p>- Now everything seems to be back to normal, except this morning, on first boot, my PC was in safe mode resolution. A reboot got rid of it. The Even Viewer is now at 79 errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my problem is somewhat fixed, but all this can't be normal. Does anyone know what part of my system might be unstable and causing all of this ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that the game itself probably has something to do with it so I have also made a post about it on their technical forums, but I'd also like to know what could have gone wrong as far as Windows itself is concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

            Hi Sogaath, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It sounds like there might be some errors in your Windows installation, so I'd suggest firstly running the System File Checker to see if it can repair any corruptions:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />I'd also recommend performing a clean boot to see if the problem persists:
<br />"<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135</a>...
<br />
<br />- Sign in to the computer as an administrator.
<br />- Click Start, and type msconfig.
<br />- Select System Configuration from the search results.
<br />- On the Services tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then tap or click Disable all.
<br />- On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click Open Task Manager.
<br />- On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click Disable.
<br />- Close Task Manager.
<br />- On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click OK, and then restart the computer. Once the computer restarts in a clean boot environment, you can follow troubleshooting steps to install, uninstall, or run your application. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting."
<br />
<br />It might also be a good idea to update your graphics drivers:

<br />AMD Radeon:

<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

<p>Hi Graeme, thanks for trying to help !</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what the command prompt reads after running System File Checker :</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them." followed by the location of the CBS log file. How would I go about fixing the corrupted files ? Would a full CHKDSK do anything useful ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I would try a clean boot but the thing is, my computer actually works fine at the moment. A clean boot won't tell me much for now I'm afraid. I'm basically trying to understand what happened to prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My graphics drivers were relatively up to date. 4-5 days had passed since I last updated them, which might be more significant than I realise, but still not that much right ? I'll update them anyway, but do you think it could have caused such a widespread
 issue ?</p>

    <title>Unidentified Network through Ethernet Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edmund kong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unidentified Network through Ethernet Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So my problem is that I am having problems getting internet access through ethernet for my PC. It says it is an unidentified network. Sometimes it has trouble connecting to the network and tries to identify it, sometimes it doesn't realize that ethernet
 has been plugged in and and no network is sensed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, internet through Wifi works.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yesterday night I managed to solve the problem (I have no idea how) but when I woke up it didn't work again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried different ethernet cables, different slots.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried ethernet over my laptop, which also says unidentified network.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional info:&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>The previous problem was that my WiFi somehow doesn't show up on my devices. However, the internet worked perfectly fine through ethernet cable for my PC. All my other devices such as my phone and laptop dont see the router even though I
 have enabled wifi through the router control panel. I also have reset the router manually, updated to recent firmware. My ISP said it might be my computer so I disconnected the cable from the pc to the router and hardwired to another computer, tried that for
 a day but still no help.&nbsp;</span><span>I thought it was my router's problem so I exchanged it for the same model (Netgear N300) but the problem still exists.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>I found an old router(D-Link) and connected it up and wifi came up, but I didnt know the password for the router page or for the wifi, but that didnt matter because I am not going to use this D-Link router.&nbsp;</span><span>Therefore,
 I went to exchange my router for a new one (still netgear, but different model N600). Connected it all up, wifi works but somehow my computer isn't connected to the network.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Sometimes
 it manages to connect and shows it as a unidentified network. I tried going on 192.168.0.1 from there, but my browser says unable to connect. Sometimes it goes off and no network is identified and a red cross is shown on the network symbol.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I
 tried ethernet through my laptop, but same result as computer</span><br />
<span>Determined to get internet up for the day, I decided to set the router up using my smartphone. Now I have Wifi over all my devices except my computer&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sevenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsad.gif" /></div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope that helps you help me find a solution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Windows 10 - Start Icons&#47;Tiles not showing pictures</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are experiencing a problem in relation to the pictures not being displayed on the Start Icons/Tiles using Microsoft Windows 10.&nbsp; As you can see from the screen capture below the icons/tiles are there and work but the pictures are not displayed.&nbsp; This
 is happening on quite a few of our laptops running Windows 10.&nbsp; You can remove and pin to start again this makes not difference, however if you resize the icon/tile the picture is then shown, resize again and perfect until you restart or shutdown the laptops?&nbsp;
 Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>If you are&nbsp; talking about&nbsp; live tiles then I can help. Since, I have encountered this issue too and later fixed it.</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>1. Live tiles won't work if the size of tiles is below medium.</p>
<p>2. You have to interact with the app for few minutes to let live tiles start working.(I mean use the app, open it use it for few minutes)</p>
<p>3. Also make sure that apps are allowed to run in the background. You can find this setting in Settings app&gt;Privacy&gt;Choose which apps run in the background.</p>

<p>This sounds like a rather odd glitch. You're saying that your name from time to time will change from SOFLAM to soflam? The only thing I could suggest is to delete and recover your gamertag on your Xbox. Here's the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to www.xbox.com/accounts &amp; click on Sign in at upper right - if you can't sign in then STOP: DON'T delete your profile. Please call Xbox Support support.xbox.com/contact-us for help with your account. If you can sign in, delete &amp; redownload your profile
 on your Xbox this way: </li><li>Go to Settings </li><li>pick System </li><li>choose Storage </li><li>pick All Devices </li><li>choose Gamer Profiles </li><li>pick the gamertag </li><li>choose Delete, and </li><li>pick Delete Profile Only. This deletes the profile but leaves saved games and achievements. Now, re-download your profile.
</li></ol>
<p>Then to re-download your profile do these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap the silver Xbox Guide button </li><li>Select Download Profile (and if you don't see it, press the blue X button to make sure you're not signed in) and proceed with Profile Download.
</li><li>Enter the Windows Live ID for your Xbox LIVE gamertag when asked. </li><li>Enter the password for the WLID. </li><li>If your account is an Xbox LIVE child account, the parent’s Windows Live ID &amp; password is required as well to download your profile.
</li><li>Pick the storage device for your profile (choose Hard Drive if you have one, or Memory Unit if you don't have a Hard Drive).
</li><li>When the download completes you will be asked if you want the console to remember your password. If it's your home console, I'd say yes, otherwise I'd think carefully about leaving my profile unprotected on somebody else's Xbox!
</li><li>Sign in, and retry. </li></ol>
<p><strong>Okay, now if your gamertag still has the odd glitch after this process then I don't know how to help you other than to contract Microsoft Support at this URL:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, you can't change your gamertag back to capitals without having to pay. Good luck with contacting support!</strong></p>

                    <p>I rarely use the audio ports on my Toshiba Satellite A660.&nbsp; I plugged in a jack in order to pipe sound to a boom box.&nbsp; I get a popup window entitled RealTek HD Audio Manager, with the question "Which device did you pluge in?"&nbsp; The two options are "Headphone"
 and "Line out".&nbsp; Well, it's not a headphone, and I have no idea what "Line out" is.&nbsp; Line out for the laptop is not the same as Line out on an external boom box, and I assume that if you connect the two, the analog drivers will fight each other.</p>

            Hi Franky,<br />
<br />
We'll be glad to look into this for you. The <em><strong>Headphone </strong></em>option carries amplification which does not route to other gears connected to your device. This option is usually used for output devices like headphones and speakers while the
<em><strong>Line Out</strong></em> option allows output devices to be connected to your device, transferring computer-generated audio to the devices so that it can be heard. For other queries with the 3rd party audio utility program that you're using, we recommend
 that you contact its support team for the most appropriate assistance.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help with any Windows issue.

<p>Hi, Paolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please clarify your explanation?&nbsp; Your explanation for Line Out sounds a lot like a Headphone.&nbsp; A signal is driven onto the cable to whatever device is on the other end.&nbsp; So it's output from the computer, but input to the external device.&nbsp; I typically
 hear of 8 ohms associated with the apparent load the the receiving end presents to the driver (presumably the computer).&nbsp; But none of these vague concepts in my head distinguishes between the two options presented to me, as described in my original post.&nbsp;
 As well, I don't see any inconsistencies between these concepts and the two explanations that you provided for Headphone and Line Out.&nbsp; So I'm still missing the information/knowledge with which to understand the difference between the two options.</p>

            There is a difference between the <em>Headphone </em>option and the <em>Line Out
</em>option. If you select the <strong>Headphone </strong>option, audio signals that are transmitted to your speaker or headphones are amplified. Unlike in the
<strong>Line out</strong> option, the audio signals transmitted to your speaker or headphones are raw.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to post back.

<p>Hi, Paolo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering.&nbsp; I don't know much about audio standards, since that's not the area I specialized in, but all signals are delivered to some kind of driver.&nbsp; Words like "amplified" and "raw" are very ambiguous, as the signal can
 be measured using power or voltage, and delivered signal depends on the impedance of the driver and the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technical details can get grungy very quickly, so it's more useful to talk about standards that are assumed and/or supported by the driver side and load side.&nbsp; I know that 8 ohms is often the standard receiver side impedance, but I don't know if there
 are common standards for the "amplification" (or what is measured to determine amplification).&nbsp; I've never heard of a "raw" signal before.&nbsp; Do the two options simply support different standards?&nbsp; What are these standards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an understanding as to what devices are being interfaced to via these two modes, that might give a clue as to the standards.</p>

<p>Perhaps this explanation that I copied from one of the many hits a Google search found for your question will help:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>Line level outputs typically have a source impedance of 50 to a few hundred ohms. They are intended to drive loads that have a high input impedance, usually greater than 5k ohms. They are typically optimized for very low noise
 and low distortion when used with high impedance loads.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Headphone outputs typically have a source impedance less than a hundred ohms and the better ones have a source impedance of a few ohms or less. They are intended to drive the lower impedances presented by headphones which typically range from 16 ohms to
 300 ohms. They are optimized for being able to drive higher current and for delivering reasonable distortion and noise with low impedance loads.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Line level outputs usually do poorly when driving headphones because their higher source impedance will not properly damp the driver at low frequencies and they can suffer from high frequency rolloff when loaded with significant capacitance.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Headphone outputs can be used to drive line level loads and can provide good noise and distortion performance but are typically not as good as line level outputs.</em><br />

<p>Or you can search for more detailed information.&nbsp; This isn't a topic that is within the scope of this forum.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 changes the aspect ratio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> douglascoup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 changes the aspect ratio</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new workstation that had Windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp; I have it connected to a Samsung television that can double as a computer monitor via an HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop display doesn't fit on the screen.&nbsp; It's cut off at the edges.&nbsp; So the start button in the lower left corner is cut off, as is the clock in the lower right corner, the Adobe Reader icon in the upper left corner, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the TV's remote control and change the display from 16:9 to Screen Fit (may not be the exact name--I'm not in front of it right now), then the desktop display fits just fine.&nbsp; But something on the workstation eventually resets the aspect ratio to
 16:9, and the desktop display is again cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried getting into the display driver's properties and using the "sliders" to adjust the aspect ratio, but eventually the display still reverts back to 16:9 and is cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>

            <p>The setting is changing on the TV, probably when the computer monitor goes to sleep and wakes back up. &nbsp;But it's the TV's settings that are the root cause. &nbsp;It probably sees the signal stop and start again, and "helpfully" re-applies the 16:9 instead of
 staying on the fit option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd see if the TV has an option to stop this. &nbsp;Your PC is definitely not changing the signal it is sending, but the TV is resetting it's preferences.</p>

            <p>It may be the TV, but it doesn't seem to be related to any one event; it's more random.&nbsp; It may be fine after a wake up, but it has also changed while my wife has been in the middle of actively doing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried making the Screen Fit setting the TV's default, but that hasn't worked.&nbsp; I'm thinking I'll go back to using a VGA cable, which was what I used with the previous workstation that didn't have HDMI output.</p>

            Hey. I had the same problem. After doing online research, here's what worked for me.<br />
<br />
[Step 1] Uninstall all display drivers using this utility provided by wagnardsoft "DDU (display driver uninstaller)"<br />
<br />
[Step 2] Manually download (do not use auto detect) AMD/Nvidia display driver from thier website and install. Done!

    <title>Music file properties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apone512  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music file properties</h2>
                    I have a fresh install of Win 7 and have copied my music files over to a second hard disk. The music files are all visible in media player and play normally. Icannot see any of these files over the homegroup shares nor over internet streaming. THIS IS
 SETUP CORRECTLY as any music file ripped since installing Win 7 plays fine over the internet and homegroup.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be that the security tab for the music files from my old PC only lists the main PC in the group/user names box. They are shared. The music ripped since Win 7 installed lists the homegroup and WMP network Svc ( hence all works fine).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have rebuilt the library from scratch in media player but the files still remain as before.<br />
<br />
How can I update all of the imported music files (all 260 odd) to be shared over the internet and homegroup apart from manually adding the permissions to each folder.......<br />

            Now sorted this problem, I needed to manually enter each folder and go into security/advanced/change permissions. tick the include inhertiable permissions from this objects parent. This added the "My Music" sharing permissions for homegroup and internet
 streaming.<br />
<br />
A bit tedious but works...........

    <title>Windows 8 Performance Options Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v.poghosyan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Performance Options Problem</h2>
                    Hi to all! I have a frustrating problem I hope someone can explain.<br />
This happened to me all the time right from the beginning and I only accidentaly found the reason today. So, as you can see my "Show window contents while dragging" is checked in the Performance Options box. Every time I would turn on my computer, after some
 time that feature would stop working and WHILE it remained checked, only rectangular borders would be visible, when dragging windows. I have found that the problem causes one of the programs that I've installed. This is the program that my Internet provider
 (VivaCell-MTS) gives to enable the access to the Internet via a USB Internet modem.<br />
When I start the program and drag windows, they're moving only with the borders visible. If I close the program, everything works normal. I have tried running it with compatibility modes like Windows 7 or XP but the problem remains. I can't uninstall it, otherwise
 I won't have access to the internet. I contacted the company that provides the Internet and they couldn't help me. Troubleshooting doesn't help too.
<br />
Anyone who can help me with this? In 1 word, this program doesn't let me use the "content dragging" feature.<br />
<br />
Using a pre-installed Windows 8, on an ASUS x501a.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Vahagn, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message when you try to uninstall the program?</p>
<p>2. Did you contact the <strong>ISP(Internet Service Provider</strong>) for the uninstallation issue or for troubleshooting the content while dragging issue?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. Since the feature <strong>Show window contents while dragging
</strong>was checked and still the contents are not visible, it would have happened due to some system file corruption.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform a <strong>SFC(System File Checker) scan</strong> and see if it helps. </p>

                    Please Help. I'm using a Dell 1011 mini laptop and i'm unable to boot at all, including all the options when F8 and F12 are pressed. I get the following error msg; STOP: 0x00000024 (0x001902FE, 0xF7A563EC, 0xF7A560E8, 0x8626F889). I would try to re-install
 windows but cant because this mini laptop (and most other notebooks/mini laptops) has no dvd drive, just a hard drive nothing else. So is there a solution to fix this with-out a dvd drive. Please help - desperate.&nbsp;

<p><strong>This issue can possibly be repaired with a floppy disc if your notebook has a floppy drive. Follow the instructions on the link below. There is a chance the partition is corrupt beyond repair. If this is the case you will need an external cd drive
 and the windows installation disc. Post your results please.</strong></p>

<h2>            Upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10... LOST ALL SOUND&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Last night I upgraded my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Everything seemed to be working fine until I realized I have absolutely no sound. I have checked all my sound options, made sure everything was turned up, I even contacted Microsoft help chat
 and after being on chat with someone for over an hour she asks to restart the computer, when it turns back on she was gone and I still did not have any sound. Is anyone else having this problem??

Have you tried getting the latest Sound Drivers for your PC or laptop Computer? This might be your problem. If it is not, then look on your PC Manufacturer's website for your PC model and see if it has the latest Drivers for Windows 10 on it. If it does get
 every last one that pertains to your model and install them and see what happens.

            <p>Gateway may not have any yet, because they are working on making the driver, or your model is not being supported anymore. Did you check gateways's website by PC Model? I ask because you did not say if you checked by looking for&nbsp;your model by searching for
 drivers and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP Laptop is different then your gateway I know, but it has some drivers out for it now, but it has not been tested to work with Windows 10 yet, so I have to wait until I get a notification before I can upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro before I can get Windows
 10 Pro. I am sure it will upgrade sometime soon because I keep getting failed attempts by Windows Update without messing with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But like I said about Gateway just search by PC Model and if they have none yet then contact them about getting a fix out for you. That is all I know to do since HP and Gateway are different brands.</p>

            <p><strong>PROBLEM SOLVED</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 home edition, HP Compaq C500 (c581wm)<br />
</p>
<p>Conexant High Definition SmartAudio HD2 Driver (for sound,video and game controller) does NOT work with windows 10 !<br />
</p>
<p>High Definition Audio Device Driver DOES WORK!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how mine was fixed</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>If reinstalling the driver doesn't work, then try using the generic audio driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in&nbsp;<span>Device Manager,</span>&nbsp;right-click (or tap and hold) your audio driver &gt;&nbsp;<span>Update driver software...&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Browse
 my computer for driver software&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer,</span>&nbsp;select&nbsp;<span>High Definition Audio Device,</span>&nbsp;select&nbsp;<span>Next,</span>&nbsp;and then follow the rest of the instructions
 to install it.</p>
