<p>For character building, I'd recommend having a high Intelligence and Agility, as those two are your most useful SPECIAL stats.&nbsp; Don't worry too much about Endurance and Charisma; if you lower them to four or five, you should be fine.&nbsp;
 As for skills, Guns, Lockpick, and Speech are all very useful, so focus on those; Energy Weapons can be useful later on, but don't worry about it too much in the beginning of the game.&nbsp; On the other hand, don't pay too much attention to Explosives or Sneak,
 and you don't need to bother with Melee Weapons or Unarmed that much.&nbsp; And for traits, I like Small Frame, unless you're playing the game in hardcore mode, in which case I wouldn't recommend taking it<br />
<br />
Also, while you can go around killing everyone, I wouldn't recommend it.&nbsp; And pay attention to your reputation with certain factions; you'll eventually have to choose who to side with, and helping one group of people sometimes means making enemies with another.&nbsp;
 Other than that, save often, save in multiple slots if necessary, and make sure you back up your saves from time to time.&nbsp; Believe me, it's monotonous, but s*** happens and you'll be prepared when it does</p>

<p>Yoda is a Fallout expert around here and all his points are great. &nbsp;I also strongly agree with this advice to take the Small Frame trait. &nbsp;I always pick that trait and even on Hardcore mode it's only a little big more of a problem. &nbsp;There is also a perk
 you can take later on that basically negates the cripple penalty. &nbsp;Also, here's a few extra things I thought of...</p>
<p>Be careful where you wander at the beginning (and at least to level 15). &nbsp;Enemies DO NOT scale to your character and you will run into some foes well beyond you level if you explore in the wrong direction. &nbsp;The ending is never pretty.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Loot. &nbsp;Always pick up any loot that you find(even if you don't need it/have ten of them already). &nbsp;Selling loot is you best way to make money, and you will need a lot of it over the course of the game as there is a ton of stuff to buy. &nbsp;Ammo alone can get
 expensive and you aren't going to get through the game by just using ammo you pick up in the wasteland.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you wandering and find yourself at your weight limit, don't just stop looting. &nbsp;Check to see what you have and what there is to loot. &nbsp;Some expensive items weight a lot and you can often use that same inventory space to get smaller stuff that is worth
 more overall.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>V.A.T.S. is you're best friend. &nbsp;Everytime you have action points use them. &nbsp;I've had a few friends come into this game thinking it was a shooter, and even if you're a good shot it's pretty much impossible to playthough this game just free aiming</p>
<p>(especially at lower levels). &nbsp; All you gonna do is find yourself with a empty gun that is now broken, and you haven't even been out of town for ten minutes.</p>

<p>First I would recommend playing in hardcore if You want to get that achievement out of the way in the fist playthrough. It's easy.</p>
<p>I would play on the easiest difficulty as there is no reward &nbsp;(faster leveling) in this game.
</p>
<p>Check out the buildings for supplies and &nbsp;learn Your surroundings.</p>
<p>Here is a good map to check out <a href="http://planetfallout.gamespy.com/maps/3/Fallout-New-Vegas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
planetfallout.gamespy.com/.../Fallout-New-Vegas</a></p>
<p>If You follow &nbsp;East past Jean sky flying school to an continue East until You find railroad tracks, this will lead You past a good deal of the crap until You can get better equipped.</p>
<p>You will first run in to the Emergency rail road station and continue until You reach Nipton.
</p>
<p>You can score on some good gear here. Head back &nbsp;up the road Eastward , then North and You run into Wolf horn ranch for more gear.</p>
<p>Now head North up the highway to Nipton and recruit Boone as Your bodyguard. </p>
<p>Now make Your way to Vegas and gamble at the atomic wrangler for more caps. ( Do some saving along the way as this game can freeze.
</p>
<p>As for perks,here is a list: Comprehension ( collect the books and read them for 4 points each). &nbsp;Educated &nbsp;(gives You two extra points per level up).</p>
<p>Pack rat and strong back are good too, but stay away from perks that raise skills as there are more then enough books to raise them.</p>
<p>I would agree with Maul about the saves and reputation, even though He's kind of a novice at this game.</p>
<p>The biggest thing though is look at playing Fallout 3 to get a feel of this game, because it's like the "Lone wanderer" from that game went on vacation in Vegas.</p>
<p>. Good luck and have fun</p>

<p>•Did you buy the ultimate editon? If so when starting out I suggest using the skilled trait, increases all skills by 5, and then you can use it again for another 5 after being given the choice to recreate character. (don't worry you don't have to change
 anything, just go back to the traits and choice it again). Small frame is good, but if playing through hardcore I'd suggest trigger disciplined (comes in handy with gunfights).
</p>
<p>•Boost up you intelligence and agility like Maul said. (luck if you wanna make some easy caps later on)</p>
<p>•for skills I'd suggest tagging speech, lockpick, and repair. You can level up others over time, but these three help out throughout the game. Keep away from explosives, unless you really want to use them. Melee and unarmed are also useless unless you want
 that kind of playthrough.</p>
<p>•Save, save, and save!</p>
<p>•If you have decent luck I suggest maxing out bets, you earn caps really fast in the casinos (or at least I did)</p>
<p>•sell anything you don't need and pick up anything with decent amount of value.</p>
<p>•get Ed-e or Boone as soon as possible (you'll find both within the first 2 hours). Have them carry your loot.
</p>
<p>•Use VATS when its to hard to aim, but don't just use it whenever. Take your shots if possible.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Well that's all I have when it comes to tips. Hope you like the game as much as I did.</p>

<p>I would agree with Maul about the saves and reputation, even though He's kind of a novice at this game.</p>
<p>[/quote]Always have to take stabs at me, don't you Gutsy?&nbsp; Rather than derailing this thread, I'll just say that I've been playing
<em>Fallout </em>games for much, much longer than you have, so I think I know just a little more about the series than you do, and I think 99% of people on this forum would agree with that.&nbsp; Then again, I know you have a ton of misinformed, preconceived notions
 about me, so I guess it isn't really worth it to disprove this<br />
<br />
As to the OP, don't go out of order.&nbsp; Play the game in its legitimate order at least once; if you feel like going out of order on subsequent playthroughs, that's fine (I sometimes do that with
<em>Fallout 2</em>), but go through the game in order once so you can get the real experience.&nbsp; Hell, you might not even feel compelled to go out of order on subsequent playthroughs because the experience of building a character is fulfilling.&nbsp; Although Gutsy
 is right, hardcore mode is the way to go (or definitely something you should try), but don't lower the difficulty unless the game actually gets too hard; the reward of having a higher difficulty is actually having a challenge</p>

<p>I was just being silly, sorry. I do agree with most of what you tend to advise as well. I disagree that Agility is right up there as one of the most important stats, since I think both Strength and Endurance are of comparable value, though Intelligence is

<p>[/quote]I think Strength is of considerable worth (especially in <em>New Vegas</em> where Strength factors into weapon strength requirements and SPECIAL checks, not just carry weight), but I've never found Endurance to be all that useful other than if you're
 doing a Melee Weapons or Unarmed character.&nbsp; Speaking of which, it's not that I don't use those builds, it's just that they're not my main build.&nbsp; I mean, isn't shooting someone more efficient than hitting them?&nbsp; Plus, I also normally play a democratic build
 who likes to solve problems through talking rather than violence, so the combat skills I focus on are just for random enemies and I never focus on all of them since I have other skills that need investment<br />
<br />
That being said, Melee Weapons and Unarmed builds in <em>New Vegas</em> are definitely more useful than they were in
<em>Fallout 3</em>, both because of the increased number of powerful weapons (i.e. the ballistic fist) and the extra options in VATS.&nbsp; And I found them pretty fun in the original
<em>Fallout </em>games, especially in <em>Fallout 2</em> where you could become the boxing champion of New Reno or fight in martial arts brawls in San Francisco.&nbsp; You could also kick or punch or hit people with whatever in the groin in either game, and it was
 pretty damn satisfying to read the descriptions of them writhing in pain and seeing them fall down (you could also shoot people in the groin, but you were more likely to kill someone so it wasn't quite as fun).&nbsp; Hell, not only did you have different melee
 weapons and unarmed attacks like in <em>New Vegas,</em> you could also aim for any body part with precision aiming.&nbsp; Thus, it kept Unarmed and Melee Weapons much more even with Small Guns and Energy Weapons as combat skills<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I felt like VATS kind of tipped the scales, as you couldn't aim for any specific body part with melee or unarmed weapons, which made them less even with the other combat skills.&nbsp; Add to that a greater abundance of ammo in
<em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em> early on, let alone cheaper ammo, and it just sort of made Melee Weapons and Unarmed builds less fun.&nbsp; I mean, I had to rely a lot on Melee Weapons Unarmed in the early stages of
<em>Fallout 2</em>, and the builds weren't more challenging so much as they were different.&nbsp; They were harder, sure, but they were much more even, especially by the later levels (the Slayer perk worked wonders for Unarmed characters).&nbsp; But the limitations
<em>Fallout 3</em> placed on them added a level of forced difficulty that put me at an evident disadvantage and kept me away from these builds.&nbsp; I don't mind something being harder by design and something being harder unnecessarily.&nbsp; That is, Melee Weapons
 and Unarmed characters should have a harder time because they have to get up close to do any damage, not Melee Weapons and Unarmed characters should have a harder time because they have to get up close to do any damage AND they don't play by the same set of
 rules as other combat skills.&nbsp; And it's even more ridiculous when you consider that you could launch a mini nuke at any specific body part in
<em>Fallout 3</em>, which affects jack s***, but can't have precision strikes with melee or unarmed weapons.&nbsp;
<em>New Vegas</em> fixed Melee Weapons and Unarmed to a certain extent, and it does make them fun to try from time to time, but they're certainly not as useful as they used to be</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Not really. It sounds a little odd but you'll barely miss with a melee/unarmed weapon and, in part thanks to the armour system in Vegas, will do much better damage than guns will in almost all cases. An Anti Materiel Rifle will do lots of damage, but too
 slowly to matter. Same thing with the Brush Gun/Trail Carbine, but.... those you could miss with much more easily than a melee weapon.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I understand only caring about combat very little to play more diplomatically, that's cool, just saying :D</p>

This is due to unmovable files scattered in the free spaces.&nbsp; windows disk manager has a kinda limitations........You may use a thrid party freeware utility like
EaseUS Partition Master 9.2.2 Free Edition<br />
<br />
Its very user friendly and you can drag and rezise your drive ...<br />

    <title>Reset password for unused Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reset password for unused Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I need a way to reset my password for an unused microsoft account.<br />
</p>
<p>I was required to setup a microsoft account when I purchased and registered my surfacebook. I don't use the hotmail account I had to setup and never have. I get endless prompts to update my security settings / outlook settings (it interrupts everything I
 do many times per day) but I don't know that the password is. I can't reset the password because in the reset form it asks for things like 'what folders have you setup in your hotmail account?' 'what emails have you sent?' but I have never used the account
 so there are no answers to this.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Have you tried reinstalling Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package or later versions of it?
</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can repair Windows Essentials by going to Control Panel &gt; programs &amp; Features &gt; Scroll down to Windows Essentials 2012 , right click and uninstall/Change.
</p>
<p>I hope your Windows is uptoDate with latest updates &amp; drivers and also running latest ver of Windows Essentials.</p>
<p>You can get latest ver of Windows Essentials (Movie maker) from <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-install-offline-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Install the ver according to which Windows you are running.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A newer ver of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 </a>as pointed by Cadhead, thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>None of these options worked for me. It says I already have the latest. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried repair, then&nbsp; uninstall - reboot - reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both redistributables were already installed and I was warned I am up to date, x86 and 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOLVED: Their is an update 4 that needs to be installed. Now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the need for DLLs, but C is a compiled language and these should be in the program itself.</p>
<p>That is the difference between C and Visual Basic. C is now an interpreted language in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the initial lead though.</p>

            &nbsp; Day three. Yes, indeed, I spent 3 days searching for the cure to launch the Windows Essentials 2012. I found out that while scanning the system with **** (I haven't fixed the performance problems yet) I can launch the Movie Maker easily. I tested
 twice. After I had rebooted my PC I tried to start the Movie Maker and the error massage appeared. So I started to scan with the **** and observed the phenomenon twice. The Movie Maker is working! &nbsp;

            <p>Hi MichaelPearlman,</p>
<p>Does this happen when you visit other links? Which browser and OS are you using? If your Windows is not up-to-date, please install the latest updates.</p>
<p>Have you tried in some other browser? </p>
<p>In IE (or any oth browser) are you running any add-ons? Try to run the browser without any add-on and see.</p>
<p>Run IE11 from Run box&nbsp;'iexplore.exe -extoff'&nbsp; to run IE without addons.</p>
<p>Can also try Resetting IE from the tools &gt; Internet options&gt;Advanced tab </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also should scan your PC and check for virus, malware. (Can try <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>) </p>
<p>If the problem still there, please put the query in appropriate section of the Forum like in IE, Virus and malware.</p>

                    I asked this question earlier but it was put in windows 7. I have a vista. The dialog box doesn't come on eventhough it is turned on. I can open a dvd by going to computer and tuning it on. But the thumb flash drive won't&nbsp;open for me. It works just fine
 on my friends comp. I tried the auto play wizard but there was a problem and it kept stopping. I tried it several times. Any suggestions?

<p><span><span>As you are able to open the CD-Rom from the Computer, this means that the Thumb drive could be not be working. Many viruses create a new autorun.inf file for infected
 drives to run their executable files from auto run. If these files are created on the Thumb drive it would crash and would not open.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Begin with formatting the thumb drive from the Disk Management.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click on start and type ‘Diskmgmt.msc’ in the search field after connecting your thumb drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select your Thumb drive volume, right-click and then click Format.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. To format the volume with the default settings, in the Format dialog box, click OK, and then click OK again.</span></span></p>

            I did as you suggested and I got a pop up that said," This is the active partition on this disk. All data will be lost. Are you sure you want to format this partition?" That doesn't sound like what I want to do.&nbsp; Should I do this? What eles would you suggest?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Thanks!

            Can anyone move this for me again? I see that it is in the Windows 7 and I have a Vista. Once again the dialog box doesn't appear at all even though it is turned on. And the auto play wizard program stops running.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>What error message do you get when you run autoplay wizard?</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to this location gpedit.msc&gt;computer config&gt;Administrative Templates&gt;windows component&gt;autoplay policies.</span></p>
<p><span>1.In autoplay policies, double click Turn off AutoPlay.</span></p>
<p><span>2.Make sure that the Turn off AutoPlay is not configured.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue repeats,
</span><span><span><span>log on to any other user account and check. If you do not have any other user account, create a new user account with administrative privilege and check. If it
 works fine, it means that the other user account is corrupted.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer:</span></span></span></p>

            Debleena thank you for your response. The wizard starts then immediately says "Wizard has stopped working. Windows will close the program." This happened before and after a system restore. Unfortunately I've had no luck with any of your suggestions. I'm
 not sure how to get to the location -gpedit... I tried 'all programs' - no match. I tried as a web site and was sent to google. I figured if I needed to turn off the auto play I would go to the control panel and turn it off. Then I tried to create a new user.
 There was no 'local user group' I&nbsp;needed to add 'snap-in'. Following directions there was no 'snap-in' under 'file'. I hope all of this made sence to you. It makes no sence to me. I can open adio CD's by going&nbsp;into 'computer'&nbsp;and manually doing it. I'm so
 frustrated!&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try to open Local Group Policy Editor by typing
</span><span>gpedit.msc in the run box.</span></p>
<p><span>Click start &gt; run. In the run box type ‘gpedit.msc’.</span></p>
<p><span>If it opens
</span><span>Local Group Policy Editor follow the steps as suggested in the previous post.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, if it doesn’t help, run a System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing or corrupt files.
 Then check if you are able to get autoplay dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button.</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option.</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option.</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You
 may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time.</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue.</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity
 violations".</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>For further reference check the link given below:</span></p>

Use the Clean Boot method and Process Explorer to determine what those services are and if any<br />
are causing the issues. Of course check the other methods as well to help improve the system<br />
performance.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />

TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>My scroll bar keeps jumping back to the top of my page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My scroll bar keeps jumping back to the top of my page</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Window's 10 with the free update. Since the update I haven't been able to keep my scroll bar from jumping back to the top every 5 seconds or so. It only happens when I look through my photo's or documents, never on webpages or anything.
 It's so annoying being unable to look through my photos, especially when they're in larges folders. Is there anyway to stop this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(edit) It also happens when I use my mouse to scroll and keep the button held down. It's like it overrides my mouse.</p>

            <p>I recently updated to Windows 10. That's the only thing that's changed since this has happened so I'm assuming it has something to do with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both steps and neither worked, I also tried to scroll using my arrow keys and the same thing happened, about 5 seconds later it jumps right back to the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would I just be better off resetting my computer back to before I updated to Windows 10? It's more of a hassle than I imagined. Or is Window's 10 a necessity to continue getting updates?</p>

<h2>            Problem downloading apps from the store</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have had Windows 8 for about 2 weeks, and in that time I have downloaded a few free apps: Angry Birds, Where's my Water?, Jetpack Joyride, and Cut the Rope. For the past few days when I have&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to download an app a notice pops up that says: "Your
 purchase could not be completed, something happened and your purchase could not be completed". I have searched the&nbsp;forums on this topic and tried several remedies:</div>
<div>Switch to Microsoft account and then back to local account</div>
<div>Disable Windows firewall and Defender</div>
<div>Changed proxy settings</div>
<div>Empty Windows store cache</div>
<div>Signing out of my&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;account and back in</div>
<div>&nbsp;Changing date and time</div>
<div>Run the network diagnostics&nbsp;</div>
<div>Synced app licenses</div>
<div>Created new user</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>none of these solutions worked, is there any known update or fix other than the ones mentioned above?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also these are the free apps I&nbsp;tried&nbsp;but got the&nbsp;error&nbsp;message:</div>
<div>Pin Steam</div>
<div>Steam launcher</div>
<div>Amazon&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ebay</div>
<div>Geared</div>
<div>Shuriken ninja</div>
<div>Skype&nbsp;</div>
<div>Xbox Smartglass</div>
<div>Google Search</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be&nbsp;appreciated.</div>

<b>Important:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>

<h2>            Skype Update Problem</h2>
                    <p>When I log on to Skype, I get message that the version will no longer be supported and that I need to update Skype. However, the auto-update feature doesn't work; I get message that says "Download of the Skype Update Failed". But when I go to the "Click

<h2>            Additional Clocks &#40;Taskbar Clock&#41; not applyng DST correctly.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am based in the UK and normally have my system clock set to the correct time zone. DST changes appear to be working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set an additional clock for California (which is normally GMT-8) time zone; but is now on DST so should be GMT-7 (at least until the UK enters DST).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The additional clock for California is therefore currently showing the wrong time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do additional clocks not use the same rules for DST changes as the main clock would?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rules are clearly already there and in place to use DST change rules so why not apply them to all clocks; not just the main one! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>

            <p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are facing an issue where the additional clock displays wrong time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually if the Daylight Savings time is observed in a particular time zone, the additional clock will automatically show you the correct time and will use the Daylight time instead of showing the standard time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Example: California observes Pacific Standard Time and when daylight is observed the clock is automatically set to use the daylight standard time. Though the time zone will reflect as GMT -8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the time is not displaying correctly, I suggest you to ensure that the time zone selected is PST.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also follow the steps below to synchronize the time with the server to make sure that the time displayed is correct:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></li><li>Type <strong>timedate.cpl</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Internet Time</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Change settings</strong></li><li>Make sure that the server name is <strong>time.windows.com</strong> and select
<strong>Update now</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided. In this case, we suggest that you check for corrupted Windows system files. System File Checker (SFC) is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to
 replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If SFC can’t replace the files, the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM) can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on running SFC and DISM, see <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

            Hi Monica,<br />
<br />
I rarely run into the problem, as I rarely run the battery down to the problem.&nbsp; So unfortunately, I haven't noticed a pattern as to when it might have started.&nbsp; I have a relatively new battery (a few months), but with the old battery, the system ran until
 it just died (no automatic hibernation).&nbsp; With the new battery, it runs until it hits Critical, then *appears* to hibernate gracefully.&nbsp; When I power up, the power up sequence doesn't match a wake up from hibernation.&nbsp; Instead, I get what I described in my
 original post.<br />
<br />
As for making any changes, the company pushes out changes at its own rhythm, and I don't track these.<br />
<br />
As for whether the power plan settings worked before, I don't typically go changing them, so I don't know.&nbsp; I only went checking them now because of the issue in my original post.<br />
<br />
There is an administrator account, but I don't have access to it.&nbsp; It also means that I can't run the Power troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Pretty dismal situation in terms of control (I know).

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that you can have access to the administrator account? Or at least, let the owner of the administrator account give your user account administrative privileges? To successfully fix the issue, you will need to make changes on the system which
 means, you need to have administrative access on using the system's utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having administrative access on the PC is important because we are going to make changes on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are using an administrator account, please get back to us.</p>

            Unfortunately, the answer is that getting administrator privileges is not the norm.&nbsp; There are certain requirements for which we can get administrator privileges temporarily, but as there is always more demand for IT support than there is supply, those
 requests are best reserved for problems that the users cannot work around.&nbsp; I will try to work around the current problem by manually hibernating before the battery level reaches critical.&nbsp; Like going back to the stone ages, I know.<br />

Can you install programs without needing administrator permission?<br />
<br />
If you can, then you might be able to install a free power management program. <br />
It might be able to override the windows power management where the users can't.<br />
<br />
Muhahahaa.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this works btw lol.

<p>Just to verify, is the PC that you're using connected or part of a domain? Administrator access to the system is needed to make any changes and apply fixes to resolve this concern. In your case, it is best to let your I.T. support know about this issue.</p>

            I think that in an ideal world, letting them know would be best.&nbsp; In a world in which demand exceed supply, I have to prioritize.&nbsp; As I said, I can take measures to avoid this problem.&nbsp; The issues that I bring to the IT folks are show stoppers that I cannot
 work around.&nbsp; I appreciate the suggestions provided, but I will have to bide my time and wait for the right time to bring it to their attention.&nbsp; This will be when the more operationally impactful issues are dealt with, and when I run into a situation in which
 I run the battery to empty on a routine basis.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br />

<h2>            Account hacking and dissatisfaction with treatment</h2>
                    
<p>I am a loyal Xbox customer of two years and I am extremely dissatisfied with the customer care I was met with. On Tuesday, October 8th, I returned home from my job at 4 pm and turned on my Xbox 360 as I usually do and found a message telling me that my account
 was unavailable and needed to be redownloaded. Upon doing so, I was greeted with an Xbox generated gamertag that was not my own and my found that my entire friends list had been deleted. I immediately called Xbox Live support and voiced my concern. During
 the course of the conversation I checked my e-mail and found three fraudulent purchases, two for $59.99 (yearlong subscriptions) and one for $9.99 (a gamertag change). Along with the other evidence I already had, I deduced that my account had been hacked and
 my hard earned money had been spent without my knowledge or consent. After calling four times over three days, I once again returned home and checked my e-mail. In my inbox I found an e-mail from Customer Care Advocate Blaine, who had decided that no, my account
 had not been hacked, indicating that after clocking into my full-time job at 7:00, I was given permission by my supervisor to leave and make it home at 7:43 am, on the clock, to make these purchases, even though my only break of the day was taken at 9:05 am.
 I called once more, now tallying up five calls about the same problem, and spoke with Georgie, who went above and beyond to get me at least one of the three charges refunded (one of the $59.99 charges). Upon asking more questions, I found that the gamertag
 charge was not going to be refunded an inquired as to why. He then went above and beyond to get me my refund. However, I soon learned that the $9.99 that was fraudulently charged, and was now going to be refunded, would go back int Microsoft's pockets because,
 ironically, I'm required to pay $9.99 to change my gamertag back to the one it was five days ago, before all this mess. I requested to speak with a supervisor, and after being put on hold, supervisor Josh answered the phone. He was rude and disrespectful to
 me, stating that they didn't need to refund me the fraudulent charge at all, and that I was lucky I was getting any money back at all. He cared little about my problem, and all I had to do to get even the one refund. When I requested to speak to someone above
 him, or with legal, I was told that he was who I got and no, I could not speak with legal, I would need to send them a letter. I was charged a total of $129.97 fraudulently, which less than half of that amount was going to be refunded, and I would still need
 to pay to change everything back to normal. Since September 1st, Microsoft has received multiple complaints of accounts being hacked and amounts upwards of $100 per person being fraudulently charged. Yet, for an organization that prides itself on customer
 service, little to nothing has been done to remedy these problems. I am extremely dissatisfied with the company, the conduct of its employees, and plan to take this as far up the ladder as it needs to go to see that my problem is remedied, and that no one
 else is put through what I was. Thank you.</p>

<p>If you've called that many times then it's not likely they're going to help you. You can always call your credit card company and dispute the charges though. It takes a few minutes on the phone, but most credit card companies are really good about returning
 your money in cases like this. You'll just need to tell them your Xbox account was compromised and you did not authorize those charges.</p>

<p>Well I got home and had to redownload my profile, which instead of having my gamertag, showed up with an Xbox generated one, and Xbox generated avatar, and an empty friends list. I figured out I had been hacked because the purchases had been made while i
 was at work, and the only other person that had access is my girlfriend who was also at work.</p>

            <p>If you believe that you have lost access to your account you do need to contact support and open an Unauthorized Access Ticket. &nbsp;You should also contact your credit card company (or Paypal if you use that) and dispute the charges and have the info changed.</p>
<p>As for being hacked, this cannot be done unless you've been phished or given out personal information. &nbsp;To start, you should look at people in your household who may have done this to your account. &nbsp;Also, have you ever downloaded your account to a friends console? &nbsp;If so, double check to ensure you didn't save your password on that console.</p>

<p>If you haven't already done so, pop into your local police station and file a criminal police report in regard to fraudulent use of your credit card citing the organisation involved aren't helping to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Once done you will have a police incident case number. Your may get a copy of the report in writing but very unlucky at such an early stage.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Contact customer support and your credit card company advising that you've filed a report with the police and give them a copy of the police case number your companies details.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm betting that you will now start receiving some world class customer service.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You should now be dealing with an Complaint Handler/Financial Crime Officer with each company</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>These individuals with have to work according to regulatory guidelines. In which they will be contacting the police for a copy of the police report (which will result in you also getting a copy). They may require you to fill out a separate report as pre
 their own procedures.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Both companies will now investigate the matter individual/jointly. Reporting their outcome to the police and yourself.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The end result can vary but if your being truthful and honest about what has happened. You'll get you money back and compensation.</p>

<p>Another thing that could be happening here, is that you actually don't have the correct email for your account. Have one of your old friends on your friends list go online and see if your original GT is still there. If it is, that means you do not have the
 correct email address. This could also explain as to why when you called Xbox they did not find any fraudulent charges on your account, since they were looking at a different account.

<p>As far as I understand it, Xbox doesn't issue refunds for fraudulent charges. &nbsp;Credit card fraud is handled by the bank or credit card company. &nbsp;Customer Support should be able to help you regain control of your account if you're locked out. &nbsp;The financial
 stuff, though, has to be disputed through proper channels. &nbsp;It's not the customer's job, nor customer support's, to handle that stuff. &nbsp;When you file a dispute with you credit card company or the bank, their dispute team contacts the company on the backend
 to work out all the details, and the financial institution does the work of requesting money back.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm not sure how recently those changes took effect, because my brother got refunded by Xbox years ago when something similar happened to him (serves him right for logging into 3rd party stats tracking sites using his Microsoft info. &nbsp;Lesson: &nbsp;Never do that).
 &nbsp;But apparently, sometime since then, the financial part of these situations must be handled by the bank. &nbsp;That's not poor customer support, that's just how business works. &nbsp;Everyone has a certain job to do.</p>

<p>5 calls and that's the service you got? odd if you ask me. Anyhow I have &nbsp;a little I can add to these statements.
</p>
<p>If the purchases were made in the past 30 days, just call xbox one last time, and have them cancel the 12 month memberships assoaicated with your account. This should put you in the automatic refund process for the money to be put into your account</p>
<p>With your gamertag, go ahead and disput that with your bank. Should be a simple process. But unfortunately, you will have to pay to get your gamertag changed back. sorry, nothing much I can other than that.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Well I had a issues like but not situation but I took over 4 calls to get correct. the first being over a hour and a half. A total of 364mins. It was not corrected within the first-four but on the fifth for. I called three times and I got tired after that
 so my mom (which a lot of people/ company fear if they screw up and don't won't own up Like when I was in summer school about six or more year ago my bus driver decided to speed up and over a bump (note I had my seat belt tight as well) and flew into the window
 and had to get stitch. They would not take me to the hospital or do anything but call my parents. Which took me to the hospital to find out I need stitch. Now down the road a month or two the school would not want to pay for the medical bill their driver cause
 so my mom called several times and the last time she threaten to get a lawyer they finally paid) she was talking to a guy name George head of billing and he hanged up on her. She called again and said it nicely that she want to talk to the CEO, supervisor,
 or someone in charge about the issue. Then a few mins later it was fixed but not before my mom told this lady that she was going get a lawyer for they didn't want to fix the issue.</p>
<p>P.S my mom also had a issues in New York with state for they wound not send someone to come see there's and issues that the land lord should fix and the house (well) should be condemned for the water from sink, toilet, or anywhere in the house was able to
 be lit on fire and stayed on fire. When someone finally came they saw it they self but not before ask what she was doing with a liter and water. He then tested the water and saw the same thing.</p>
<p>I do feel bad for you and hope everything get resolved. </p>

            It is nice that you have plenty of useless CPU.&nbsp; CPU availability and power has nothing to do with these issues.

            Why did Microsoft promise to restore my previous version?&nbsp; Are they sitting around trying to think up evil stuff to torture us with?&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed the above instructions and did not get any further than it does not recognize my USB. My other searches on
 Google provide instructions that make no sense. The usual Microsoft stuff- every instruction leads to a step or link that does not exist. I am paralyzed with fear that I will get to a certain point and then-gasp!- the next step IS NOT THERE!!!!!!
