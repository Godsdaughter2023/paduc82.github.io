<p>
</p><p>You have to consider that an&nbsp;<em>empty string</em> returned by a formula (e.g. "") is not considered a blank cell. It is considered a text string of zero length. This returns a COUNTA() of&nbsp;<em>1</em>, not
<em>0</em>. However, the LEN() (aka <em>length</em> can be checked to see if the cell in column A is either truly blank or an empty string since LEN() will return a
<em>0</em> (aka FALSE) for either circumstance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(LEN(A2), &lt;<em>my formula&gt;</em>, "")</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in F2, you can fill or copy down as required. Note that F2 will return another&nbsp;<em>empty string</em> if A2 is blank or an empty string so it is not considered truly blank.</p>

            I have heard of others having the same issue ... what a pain!&nbsp; This is what I would do:<br />
<br />
Change the password on the email account so YourProvider/OZmail can't get it (and thus not notify with a text message)<br />
<br />
I've never seen the program so this is just a guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would&nbsp;deactivate the email account notifications and deselect "remember my password" from the program (is that option set on your providers website for OZMAIL?).&nbsp;Now delete the application from your device.

    <title>Content Organizer Works Intermittently - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Content Organizer Works Intermittently</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with the Content Organizer feature in SharePoint Online where sometimes the rules are applied correctly and documents are properly routed while other times they just remain stuck in the Drop Off Library. All rules point to the same document
 library and they are all very similar and route based upon the same managed metadata field. See the attached screen shot for the properties of the rule. I have approximately 500 rules as there is one for each client folder. The destination library has approximately
 35,000 items in it. When I go to save a document I get the "Something Went Wrong" message and a correlation ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hours with the phone support people for Office 365 over multiple sessions&nbsp;and they have no clue how to fix this. The internal reference number for this case is *****-********, which may be helpful to the Microsoft employees on here. The phone
 reps have blammed this on&nbsp;eveything from general service degredation to having too many rules or too many files in the destination document library. Eveytime they have a different guess, but never an acutal answer or explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the problem is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rules set up like this where the document is routed based upon the value of a managed metadata tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fgxcuf89792.i.lithium.com%2ft5%2fimage%2fserverpage%2fimage-id%2f9568iC791E500880AD6D7%2fimage-size%2flarge%3fv%3dv2%26amp%3bpx%3d999" height="821" width="800" /></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I complete the required metadata tags and submit the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fgxcuf89792.i.lithium.com%2ft5%2fimage%2fserverpage%2fimage-id%2f9570i95A39863F8D678E0%2fimage-size%2flarge%3fv%3dv2%26amp%3bpx%3d999" /></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>SharePoint thinks for a bit and then gives me this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fgxcuf89792.i.lithium.com%2ft5%2fimage%2fserverpage%2fimage-id%2f9571i08C13DE6BDC0F7B0%2fimage-size%2flarge%3fv%3dv2%26amp%3bpx%3d999" /></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The document then sits in the Drop Off Library forever. It does not work with the nightly timer job either. I get the same results with different browsers. When saving through the Microsoft Office client application I do not get an error message, but the
 document stays in the Drop Off Library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this only happens sometimes. Other times the rules work and the document is correclty routed. There appears to be no differentiation between rules that work and those that don't. I have tried rebuilding the rules, rebuilding the destination folders,
 and I have deactivated and reactivated the content organizer, but nothing has worked. I am at a loss. Hopefully someone can help.</p>

<h2>            Comment Balloon now has Reply and Resolve Buttons - How do I get rid of them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My machine updated today and now every comment balloon has these two button at the bottom that take up space. I'm trying to give students feedback on their writing and need every inch I can get, yet these buttons take up 1/2" per balloon. What do I have
 to do to turn them off permanently? I don't care if this is a feature for sharing documents; they aren't going to reply or resolve.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'm leaving out a whole string of things I want to say about this......) Please someone make it go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Problems with firmware V 4.0623.0.41</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I managed to successfully flash my N80 to V4.0623.0.41 a few days ago and so far this is what I have found.<br />
<br />
1. No improvement in conecting to Nokia bluetooth headset.<br />
2. Still crashing intermittantly admittedly a lot less then before<br />
3. Enable to use voice dial feature when phone is locked.<br />
<br />
on the +ve side,<br />
<br />
1.no longer crashes when recieving txt during a call.<br />
2.Synchronisation with outlook calendar is now working again<br />
3. Camera timings seem better<br />
4. Real Player can fast forward and rewind now, never worked for me before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still some work to do?<br />
<br />

            It flashed successfully, I can't see how flashing again would make any difference. It either worked or didn't.

            I think .42 is only available via FOTA. So no, it's not the same scary technique :)<br />
It's a minor firmware update. The changes are:<br />
<br />
FOTA<br />
*Camera forward compatibility fix for FOTA update;<br />
*Sync agent forward compatibility fix for FOTA update.<br />
<br />
Messaging<br />
*SMS sending delay<br />
<br />
Display<br />
*Correction for miss-read of ASIC version causing pink display

    <title>Norton blocks download of build 15025 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mymindstorm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Norton blocks download of build 15025</h2>
                    <p>Norton seems to think that there is a threat in the file&nbsp;fxsext32.dll for some reason and it blocks Windows Update (error 0x80070002) from installing the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the full report from Norton&nbsp;<a href="https://hastebin.com/wexufibexo.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I add an exception for the current file it wont work due to windows update re-downloading the whole update as soon as Norton detects the file. So what happens is:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Norton detects threat in fxsext32.dll</li><li>Windows Update errors as soon as the threat is detected (Norton blocks anything from touching the file), and must re-download the build again</li><li>I add an exception to Norton for the old&nbsp;fxsext32.dll</li><li>I tell Windows Update to try again</li><li>Windows Update replaces&nbsp;fxsext32.dll with a brand new one with a different id</li><li>Norton&nbsp;detects threat in fxsext32.dll, ignoring my exception due to it being a brand new copy of the file with a diffrent id</li><li>Repeat</li></ul>
<p>Can anyone help me install the update?</p>

            <p>It has been well documented in this forum to completely uninstall (not disable) any third party antivirus using the uninstall tool from their web site. They are deeply rooted and interfere with the downloading, installation, and performance of these Windows

Excel has workbooks with one or more worksheets in each workbook.</p>
<p>Pages are what you print out from the data on one or more of those worksheets.</p>

<p>Can you try to explain what you want to do on one or more worksheets?</p>

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Open Skype and hit the 3 dots at the right of your name then Settings &gt; Audio &amp; Video.
<br />
<br />Once You're there make sure that your camera is selected and that is working fine.

<br />Go to Privacy - Camera

    <title>Assign a hyperlink to a button in Outlook 2010 ribbon&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike celone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assign a hyperlink to a button in Outlook 2010 ribbon&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In Outlook 2003 we used to be able to create our own toolbar in Outlook and then deploy that toolbar to our users.&nbsp; On this toolbar we would add buttons and then assign hyperlinks to them.&nbsp; Our users really like this feature since they spend so much time
 in Outlook and it made it easy for them to get to their out most used sites.&nbsp; I cannot figure out how to assign a hyperlink to a button in the Outlook 2010 ribbon.&nbsp; Is there anyway to do that?</p>
<p>I've found a way to build a custom group in the ribbon but can't assign a hyperlink to any of the buttons.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            That did not answer the question at all.&nbsp; I've already checked the help file and it has nothing about adding a hyperlink to a button.&nbsp; From what I have found on the internet it seems the only way to do this is with a add-in.&nbsp; It's a shame since this was
 so easy to do in previous versions of Outlook...

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Assigning hyperlinks to "open form" buttons in Outlook 2003 was easy. But now it seems you have to use macros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2003 I simply choose the&nbsp;"open form"-button and draged it to the toolbar and by right clicking I could assign hyperlinks and change the icon.</p>
<p>I can no longer figure out how to assign a hyperlink to a button in the toolbar.&nbsp;(without using macros).</p>
<p>What I am trying to achieve is a button that, when clicked, opens a pre-written mail.

            Yes you could if you have no plans to continue using it. Without the setup files you will need the installation disk to do repairs.<br />

Have you tried tools like CCleaner to free up some space?<br />

<p>After installing Windows XP Service Pack 2, I found folders inside C:\Windows with such names as "$NtUninstallKB810217$". Each holds more than 800MB of files. Can I get rid of them?</p>
<p><i>Ibrahim A. Al-Harun, Chittagong, Bangladesh</i></p>
<p>When you update Windows 2000 or XP, the update program often saves uninstall information to a folder such as the ones you describe. If you're sure you want the update, remove its uninstall folder.</p>
<p>To see your PC's saved uninstall folders, open Windows Explorer to C:\Windows (in Windows XP) or C:\WINNT (in Windows 2000); you may need to click
<i>Show the contents of this folder</i>. If you don't see any folders, select <i>
View, Folder Options</i>, click the <i>View</i> tab, select <i>Show hidden files and folders</i>, and click
<i>OK</i>.</p>
<p>The Windows Service Pack uninstall is in the folder $NtServicePackUninstall$ (see
FIGURE 1). Others are named $NtUninstallKB<i>nnnnnn</i>$ or $NtUninstallQ<i>nnnnnn</i>$ (each
<i>n</i> represents a digit).</p>
<p>If the folder is more than a few weeks old, you can remove it without risk. You then won't be able to remove the associated update--not necessarily a bad thing. Read about updates before you remove their uninstallers at support.microsoft.com/?kbid=<i>nnnnnn</i>
 ("<i>nnnnnn</i>" is the six-digit number in the folder name).</p>
<p>To get rid of an uninstall folder, select it in Windows Explorer, press <b>Delete</b>, and confirm your decision. The uninstall may still be listed in the Control Panel Add or Remove Programs applet, however. To remove it, select the program and click
<i>Remove</i>. An error message will ask whether you want to delete the entry from the list. Click
<i>Yes</i>.</p>

</span></span></b><b><span>2</span></b><b><span>) CleanAll Updated</span></b></p>
<p><span>Two years ago, we ran a series on simple text-based, command-line scripting, intended to help you control your system at a low level--- to help make the system do what *you* want it to do, instead of what
 someone else (the vendor, for example) wants.</span></p>
<p><span>All versions of Windows support text-based, command-line scripting. They either let you get at underlying DOS, the disk operating system that's the foundation of all versions of Windows through Win98SE;
 or (in NT, Win2000, XP) to a "command window" that accepts commands entered by typing instead of by pointing and clicking.
</span></p>
<p><span>WinME is a hybrid: It's really Win98SE under the covers, but the DOS elements are hidden and made hard to get at; WinME users are supposed to use a command window rather than to directly access DOS.</span></p>
<p><span>Either way--- in true DOS or in a command window--- you enter your commands by typing at a "command prompt," which is usually something like "C:\&gt;". Done manually, you normally type the commands one at
 a time. But you can also place a series of commands in a special kind of text file, and the operating system will run through the whole series of commands, step by step.<br />
<br />
These text scripts are, in essence, a whole "batch" of commands, and so they're called "batch files." Although a batch file is just an ordinary plain-text file, it's given a special batch file extension (".bat") so the operating system knows that it contains
 commands that should be processed line by line, just as if the commands were being typed in by a live human operator.</span></p>
<p><span>All versions of Windows recognize and can use batch files, but the available commands and syntax vary from version to version. Different versions of Windows also allow (or prohibit) different kinds of command-line
 actions.</span></p>
<p><span>Our original series on text-based command-line "batch" scripting, two years ago, was aimed mostly as Win9x and--- to a degree--- WinME. The base information in those articles is still 100% valid, and can
 be applied to all versions of Windows, although Win9x and ME users can use the information there mostly as-is; WinNT/2K/XP users will need to modify some of the information to make it work with those versions of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>That original series is still available online:</span></p>
<p><span>Part One of the series ( <a href="http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/15.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/15.htm</a> ) sets the context and gives the essential ground-zero information on DOS commands; it also contains a plethora of DOS-related links to get you started. Part Two (
<a href="http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/16.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/16.htm</a> ) details how to create a custom boot or "emergency" disk -- a better boot disk than the one that may have come with your copy of Windows, or that you can make via the Control Panel "Add/Remove
 Software" applet. Part Three ( <a href="http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/17.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/17.htm</a> ) helps you stock your DOS toolkit with interesting, worthy -- and mostly free! -- DOS tools. Part Four (

</span></span></b><b><span>3</span></b><b><span>) Basic Cleanup: All Versions Of Windows</span></b></p>
<p><span>As a demonstration of the power of batch files in the above series on scripting, I presented a very simple disk-cleanup tool file, and was astonished at the response. Many readers reported that the cleanup
 file recovered hundreds of megabytes of disk space that they couldn't otherwise recover; and a few readers reported truly staggering gains of up to *12 gigabytes of space!*</span></p>
<p><span>Even some expert readers who were using every trick they knew to keep their drives clean -- including using automated, commercial cleanup applications such as the $40 "Window Washer" -- found my little
 free batch file saved them up to tens to hundreds of megabytes that otherwise had been wasted!<br />
<br />
That suggested to me that hard drive cleanup was a worthy subject in its own right, and that many people might benefit from a discussion of the best free ways to scrub your hard drive clean of junk files -- for free! So, the "Cleanall" batch file project took
 on a life of its own.</span></p>
<p><span>But two years ago, when we first covered this, Win9x--- Win98 especially--- was top dog. WinME was just released, and not in wide use. WinXP was unheard-of, and NT and 2K were used by a relatively small
 portion of users. As a result, our coverage focused mostly in Win98, with only a little in ME and 2K.</span></p>
<p><span>That's all changed now. The rest of this Special Issue is the result: and includes a new download method for Win98 users, and all-new batch files for WinME, Win2K and WinXP.</span></p>
<p><span>But some parts of the overall cleanup process haven't changed: In fact, the first steps apply to ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS, and are spelled out here:
<a href="http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/18.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://content.techweb.com/winmag/columns/explorer/2000/18.htm</a> ; scan down the page to the section that starts with "Easy First Steps." The concepts presented there are totally valid and applicable for all browsers and all versions of Windows, although
 you may need to slightly adjust the general instructions there to suit your specific setup.</span></p>
<p><span>In fact everything on that page is worth a look and can save you a ton of disk space in itself--- except for one thing: The batch file information ("Just Batch It"), is version-specific to Win9x.</span></p>
<p><span>Don't miss the sections after "Just Batch It;" they also are quite generally applicable. (Please note especially the admonitions about making a backup.) It's just that one "Just Batch It" section that's
 highly specific to Win9x. </span></p>
<p><span>So let's now revisit that "Just Batch It" section, and update the info for current OSes.</span></p>

</span></span></b><b><span>4</span></b><b><span>) Advanced Cleanup Batch File For Win9X</span></b></p>
<p><span>The Win9x operating system has not changed, so the original batch files still work fine. In fact, the "Clean9x.Bat" file remains one of the most powerful free disk-cleaning tools you can find: It cleans
 up *all* Temp files, compacts your Registry and Cookies Index, completely empties the Temporary Internet File (TIF) area, compacts your Icon Cache, and can automatically run either Scandisk or Norton Disk Doctor at the end of the cleanup process to ensure
 the health of your hard drives.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean9x is especially good because the documentation links that accompany that file let you modify Clean9x's actions to your heart's content. Want to totally erase all Cookies on your machine? No problem:
 Cleran9x can do it. Want to totally eradicate your browser's History file? No problem: Clean9x can do that, too. In fact, you can make the Clean9x&nbsp; file as powerful as those commercial "erase all traces of your browsing!" tools--- except that Clean9x is free!
 Just read the documentation and tweak away!</span></p>
<p><span>However, in the past, some users have reported problems downloading the files because some browsers, security tools, and filters (see item#1, above) interfere with the smooth delivery of batch and REG files.
 So, I've repackaged the Clean9x files into a single Zip-compressed download that should come through fast and clean. Once downloaded, use your favorite UnZip tool (such as WinZip---
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winzip.com</a> ) to extract the files. The ReadMe.TXT file contains further (essential!)&nbsp; instructions.</span></p>

</span></span></b><b><span>5</span></b><b><span>) Advanced Cleanup: Other Versions Of Windows</span></b></p>
<p><span>Because other versions of Windows either don't have true DOS, or limit access to it, the Win9x method (above) won't work without a lot of tweaking, and/or the use of DOS boot disks, etc.
</span></p>
<p><span>Instead, here's a simpler way that's almost as thorough but that requires no access to DOS at all, and that works on virtually all versions of Windows. To differentiate it from the earlier versions of "Clean*.Bat",
 I'll call this one "CleanXP.Bat," but note that it does NOT REQUIRE XP. In fact, it will work on XP, Win2K, and WinME.</span></p>
<p><span>But you knew there had to be a catch, right &lt;g&gt;? It's this: XP, Win2K, and WinME can be set up in different ways, with files placed in different user-specific locations. In addition, you may have access
 to only part of the system files, depending on whether you're logged in as a system Admin or not.</span></p>
<p><span>So, there's no "one size fits all" universal cleanup file. Instead, CleanXP.Bat is a kind of easy-to-modify template you can use to create a custom tool that’s specific to
<i><u>*your own particular setup and needs</u></i>.* Just follow the instructions in the rest of this article (and inside the downloadable files) to ensure that the file contents and structure are OK to run on your specific setup.<br />
<br />
Before we go on: Please click back to Item #3, above, and follow the steps there, if you have not already done so.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, we need to modify one of Windows' own cleanup-tools, before we combine it with a custom batch file to erase what the Windows tool leaves behind.</span></p>

</span></span></b><b><span>6</span></b><b><span>) Sageset Unlocks CleanMgr's Power</span></b></p>
<p><span>"Cleanmgr" is a disk-cleanup manager included in all Windows from Win98 onward. It doesn't do a lot in Win98, but has gained power in succeeding releases. In Win2K and XP, it's actually a decent little
 tool that has the potential to clean quite a bit from your system, and can even automatically compress little-used files to make them occupy less disk space. Oddly, simply running Cleanmgr does NOT normally give you access to its full power: Instead, you need
 to modify it a bit.</span></p>
<p><span>We'll get to the mods in a moment, but if you want more info on CleanMgr, click one of these links:<br />

<p><span>Now, to the mods:</span></p>
<p><span>For our purposes, we only need to focus on one pair of Cleanmgr commands: SAGESET and SAGERUN. These commands are designed to allow the Windows "System Agent" to automate the running of Cleanmgr, but we
 can co-opt it for our purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Start, Run then type</span></p>
<p><span>cleanmgr /sageset:99</span></p>
<p><span>in the Run box, and hit Enter. The Disk Cleanup Tool will run in a special mode that offers you an expanded selection of cleanup choices. Most importantly, it will remember whatever choices you make now,
 and re-use those same choices when you use a matching "sagerun" command later on.</span></p>
<p><span>For now, step through all the choices that the Disk Cleanup Tool offered you, and make whatever choices you wish. Note that some of the offered items may have additional options or advanced settings that
 become visible when you click or check the item.</span></p>
<p><span>I generally select everything that's offered--- I'm looking for maximum cleaning, so I just check everything. But you can select any, all, or none of the offered choices: It's up to you.</span></p>
<p><span>And don't worry. If you want to change your mind later, you can. Just re-run the command "cleanmgr /sageset:99" and make a new set of choices.</span></p>

</span></span></b><b><span>7</span></b><b><span>) SageRun Completes the Picture</span></b></p>
<p><span>To run the Disk Cleanup tool and invoke the choices you made above, you simply replace "sageset" with "sagerun."</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Start, Run then type</span></p>
<p><span>cleanmgr /sagerun:99</span></p>
<p><span>in the Run box, and hit Enter. The Disk Cleanup Tool then runs, using the stored preferences stored by the previous sageset command. You can run the cleanmgr command this way any time you want.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also create many different cleanup scenarios, if you want: The "99" in the example above is arbitrary. You can use /sageset:1, /sageset:2, /sageset:3 and so forth, all with different cleaning strategies,
 and then invoke them with matching /sagerun:1, /sagerun:2, /sagerun:3 commands later. For our purposes--- aggressive cleaning--- we'll use /sageset:99 and /sagerun:99</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let's take care of what the Disk Cleanup Tool leaves behind.
</span></p>
<p><span>Although you'll soon have access to a downloadable file that combines the following sets of commands into a single unit, the next few items will discuss the commands separately, as if you were going to
 type them in manually: That's the best way to understand what the commands do, and to see how you can modify them for your own specific setup.</span></p>

</span></span></b><b><span>8</span></b><b><span>) Cleaning the Temporary File Areas</span></b></p>
<p><span>Although Cleanmgr says it cleans your Temporary file areas, it doesn't do a very thorough job. That's where our batch file comes in. But to set it up properly, you need to know where your Temporary file
 areas are, and that varies from user to user and OS version to version:</span></p>
<p><span>Use the Search tools that comes with your version of Windows to look in "All files and folders" for anything with "temp" as part of the name. For example, in XP, I'd click Start/Search, then click "All
 files and folders;" then I'd enter "temp" (minus the quotes) in the "All or part of the file name" box, and select C: in the "Look in:" pull-down menu. You may also need to adjust the "Advanced" search functions to cast your net as widely as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>When done, you may be surprised at how much supposedly "temp" stuff has accumulated on your hard drive--- many "temporary" files turn out not to be so temporary!</span></p>
<p><span>(BTW: If your Windows Explorer is in its default state, it may not show you "hidden" and "system" folders. However, you can use Explorer's "Tools/Folder Options" menus to tell it to show you everything;
 and you usually can adjust the Search function to look for these items, as well.. For example, see item #2 in
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20011204S0009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20011204S0009</a> )</span></p>
<p><span>In theory, *any* "temp" file should be able to be deleted safely, but some vendors don't play by the rules and--- stupidly, IMO--- place valuable stuff in "temp" locations. This is one of the reasons why
 human intelligence--- yours--- is needed to set up the CleanXP batch file properly. It will clean anything you tell it to, but only you can decide what should and should not be cleaned.</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, two areas that should always be safe to clean out are the "Local Settings\Temp" and "Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files."</span></p>
<p><span>In my case, these are located as follows, but the path will be different for you, unless your logon name is "fred" and your system is set up identically to mine! &lt;g&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Documents and Settings\fred\Local Settings\Temp<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\fred\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files</span></p>
<p><span>In any case, make a note of the full path (like the above examples) to any and all areas you want to clean.</span></p>
<p><span>We'll do that cleaning via the "DEL" command, which in Win2K and XP is more powerful than the DEL command in Win9x; or via the "DELTREE" command in WinME. On my XP system, the basic series of commands for
 the Temp directory looks like this (you can type the commands one at a time, in sequence, or add them to a batch file, as we'll soon show):</span></p>
<p><span>c:<br />
cd "C:\Documents and Settings\fred\Local Settings\Temp"<br />
del /q /s /f *.*</span></p>
<p><span>The C: command switches to the C: drive. (This is actually not essential, but I prefer to play it safe by using explicit navigation commands when possible.) The "CD" command is a "change directory" (i.e.
 "change folder") command that tells the system to work on--- in this case--- the "C:\Documents and Settings\fred\Local Settings\Temp" directory. Naturally, you should substitute the path and name of whatever directory/folder you want to empty. And note the
 quotations marks around the path; these quote marks help Windows not to be confused by any long folder names or spaces within the names.</span></p>
<p><span>The "del /q /s /f *.*" command tells XP or 2K to DELete everything (*.*) in that directory, to do so in Quiet mode ("/q") with no prompts, to Force ("/f") the deletion even of read-only files, and also
 to work on any subdirectories ("/s") beneath the target directory.</span></p>
<p><span>There's obviously some danger to this kind of mass-deletion of files, so if you have any doubts about what you're doing, you should temporarily substitute a "/p" in place of the "/q." This tells Windows
 to Pause at each file and ask if it's OK to delete. If you have many files in a directory, this is a major pain, but it ensures that you won't delete anything you shouldn't. After you gain confidence that you're not deleting any files you shouldn't, you can
 switch the "/p" back to a "/q" for no-prompt, high-speed mass deletion of the files.</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: The WinME "DEL" command does not support the /q /s and /f options. Instead, like Win98, WinME uses the "DELTREE /y *.*" command (minus the quotes) for fast cleaning of a folder and all its subfolders.&nbsp;
 But the first few times you use Deltree, omit the "/y" so WinME will pause at each file and ask if it's OK to delete. After you've gained confidence that you're deleting only the correct files, you can add the "/y" back in for no-prompt, high-speed mass deletions.</span></p>

</span></span></b><b><span>9</span></b><b><span>) Extending The Commands</span></b></p>
<p><span>You can use the same command structure to work on other folders/directories, too. In XP/2K, you just keep adding
</span></p>
<p><span>cd "FULL PATH TO FOLDER WITH FILES TO DELETE"<br />
del /q /s /f *.*</span></p>
<p><span>for each additional folder/directory you want to clean out. In WinME, you simply add
</span></p>
<p><span>cd "FULL PATH TO FOLDER WITH FILES TO DELETE"<br />
deltree /y *.*</span></p>
<p><span>for each additional folder/directory you want to clean out.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, you replace "FULL PATH TO FOLDER WITH FILES TO DELETE" with the actual path and name of a folder whose contents you want to delete. You can clean as many directories/folders as you wish simply
 by appending as many "CD" and "DEL" or "DELTREE" lines as needed.</span></p>
<p><span>But note again: Mass deletion of files can be dangerous. For safety, the first few times you use these commands, use the file-by-file confirmation settings described in Item #8.

cleanmgr /sagerun:99</span></p>
<p><span>This set of commands looks simple but actually does a lot: It wipes out the contents of whatever folders you've specified (in this example, the Temp and Temporary Internet Files folders), and then invokes
 the extended version of CleanMgr to do everything you've set it to do. It can reclaim a *lot* of space for you, especially in XP and 2K, as (over time) the automatic compression of older files augments the basic deletion of unwanted temporary files.</span></p>

<p><span>Although you can type the commands as shown above, few people would want to do it that way. Instead, you can download an easy-to-edit template (see next item) or batch the commands into a file yourself:
 Open NotePad, and copy/paste the commands shown in Item #10 to Notepad, edit the paths and folder names so they reference the areas on your system you want to clean up, and (if needed) change the "sageset:99" line to be whatever you previously used in Item
 #6.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, if you're using WinME, substitute DELTREE for the DEL commands, as discussed in item #8.</span></p>
<p><span>And no matter what operating system you're using, for maximum safety the first few times you use these commands, use the file-by-file confirmation settings described in Item #8 rather than the no-prompt
 mass-deletion method.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Save the batch file where you want, and give it a memorable name--- such as CleanXP.Bat. You can run it any time by double clicking on the file or its icon; and you can add it to Task Scheduler (also called
 "Scheduled Tasks" on some versions of Windows) to run it automatically.</span></p>

    <title>Excel 2016 corrupts older Excel spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack hidley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 corrupts older Excel spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>We recently installed Excel 2016. When opening some Excel files in 2016 which were saved in Excel 2003 (97-2003 xls format), some of the cells are corrupted. Their row height has been changed from 12.5 to 409.6. In addition, the text in some of the cells
 is not visible in the spreadsheet, but it is visible in the formula bar at the top.&nbsp; In other cells, the text which was in the cells is gone (not visible in the spreadsheet or the formula bar).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the cells which have a height of 409.6, there is no row number on the left side of the spreadsheet. If I resize the cells to 12.5 high, the row numbers do not come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no formulas in these cells. Just some text and comments. The cells with the missing text seem to be the ones with the comments. The comments are visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to figure out a way to get Excel 2016 to repair corruption in the file, but the directions in the help file and on Microsoft's site can't work because the options do not actually exist to do this.

<p>
</p><p>That is perfectly normal.&nbsp; Any time an Office application opens a file created in an older version of the application it displays the "Compatibility Mode" warning.&nbsp; This just tells you that your version of the application has been "dumbed down" to only allow
 functions available in older versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in Word 2010 they added the "Text Effects" feature (fuzzy blue icon in Home tab).&nbsp; If you open a file created in an earlier version, that feature is "disabled", the icon becomes monocolor (B&amp;W instead of color).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't already have it, you can download the "Office 2007 Compatiblity Pack" and install it on your machine that has Office 2003 on it.&nbsp; This will allow the 2003 programs to open and save files in the new "x-file" formats.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you could then try opening the problem XLS files in Excel 2003, and using SAVE AS to create XLSX versions. Hopefully they will open in your newer version of Excel.</p>

            The population of the bookmarks is probably being performed by an Autonew macro in the template what you would need to do is open the template, using File&gt;Open and then after modifying it, save it back as a macro enabled template (dotm) and use File&gt;New
 and select the template when you want to use it.

<h2>            Office 365 hybrid migration - end point not discoverable</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm hoping someone from the community can throw some light on a problem we have. we run a Hybrid Exchange solution, with Exchange 2010 locally. we have full mail flow in and out of the business. recently, I've come to migrate an account across to Office
 365, and is fails as it can't find the migration end point. I have been assured that there have been no DNS changes to our infrastructure. if i run the remote connectivity analyser with a cloud account, it passes without issue. if I run the remote connectivity
 analyser with an exchange account if fails on autodiscover (I can't see why though as nothing has changed though). Autodiscover has always been a "challenge" for us - in a hybrid solution, do we need anything other than autodiscover pointing to office365.
 the only difference I can see is:</p>
<p>

<p>and then this:</p>

<p>any pointers are very much appreciated -this was working fine, I had some time away from the business, came back and it's not playing ball.</p>

            Hi PeteGibson2663,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, I understand that the issue (can't find the migration end point) occurs when you move mailboxes from on-premise to Office 365 cloud. If I misunderstand anything, please feel free to correct me.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the autodiscover record needs to be pointed to your on-premise Exchange servers in Hybrid environment. Secondly, may I confirm whether you follow the steps in the link below to move mailboxes?<br />
<br />

<br />
If yes and the issue persists, I’d like to collect some information:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you mentioned “it can't find the migration end point.”, in which step did you get any error messages? If so, can you upload some screenshots?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Please provide the full test results. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message：<br />

            Hi Pete,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information in the private message (PM).<br />
<br />
I have checked your domain name and noticed that the autodiscover record is pointed to cloud. It should be pointed to on-premise servers in Hybrid. Can you change it?<br />
<br />
After that, it the issue persists, can you run the following PowerShell command to test the connection and provide the results in the PM?<br />
<br />
Test-MigrationServerAvailability -ExchangeRemoteMove -Autodiscover -EmailAddress &lt;email address for on-premises administrator account&gt; -Credentials $Credentials<br />

            <p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I really struggled with this previously. I've added an A record to point autodiscover to here. do I need to remove the exising autodiscover entry? I'm cautious as we have 90% of our users already in the cloud and I don't want to disrupt that. some guidance
 would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

I definitely understand your concerns. Here is a reference:<br />

<br />
Actually, if you point the Autodiscover to cloud, it will not affect the hybrid you set up. However, it may affect some features. Meantime, I noticed that you had moved 90% users to cloud. May I know how you did that? Did you do that before changing any DNS
 or other scenarios?<br />

            <p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we moved the other users via the Migration tool. I've come back from some time away and migrations now don't work. I've been told that "nothing has changed" and am&nbsp;a bit lost as to why? I'm trying to retrace my setup steps, but didn't make notes.

<p>

<p>Availability of update depends on Product Code / Region .. Also, for Network locked devices, update is possible only after an approval from the operator. It seems that one of the above is preventing you from getting the latest update. In this case your only
 option is to ask your local Nokia Care whether they can install the latest version.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Whether or not this can be done may depend on the type of account you have. If you are using an Exchange account, you may be able to use Outlook Web Access to get in and make the changes you need.
</p>

<p>Other than that, I can't see how you could accomplish this if someone else is using the computer at the time.

            Perform a 3 finger reset. Be sure to backup your data as this will remove all your files. Also this will remove store, maps, social and many of the apps/services which should be available via software update client on your phone.<br />
And a point of caution here - it worked in Anna, but not sure of belle. Or the next better option will be to take your phone to Nokia care where they'll be flashing your phone and reinstall the firmware.

            The normal template for Word 2007 is normal.dotm. Only Word can create this template, which it will do if it cannot find it in the user templates folder. If a normal.dot file from an earlier version is in that folder the new template will be based on that
 instead of the program's defaults.<br />
<br />
I don't believe Garamond has anything to do with the original styles from Word 2007 which tend to use the new 'C' series fonts - Calibri, Cambria and Consolas.<br />
<br />
A good start would be to allow Word to recreate it, by renaming the original. You can then open the template and make changes to it, but it would probably better to leave it alone and create document templates for your documents.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does MSN load in Internet Explorer?</li><li>Has MSN loaded in Firefox previously?</li></ul>
<p>When you have a problem with a site that has been updated and previously worked fine or does not open, a good "first thing to try" is clearing your Firefox cache and deleting your saved cookies for the site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Bypass Firefox's Cache </p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Ctrl+Shift+r to reload the page fresh from the server. </p>
<p>Alternately, you also can clear Firefox's cache completely using: </p>
<p>"3-bar" menu button (or Tools menu) &gt; Options &gt; Advanced </p>
<p>On the Network mini-tab &gt; Cached Web Content&nbsp;: "Clear Now" </p>
<p>If you have a large hard drive, this might take a few minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Remove the site's cookies (save any pending work first). While viewing a page on the site, try either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>right-click and choose View Page Info &gt; Security &gt; "View Cookies" </li><li>(menu bar) Tools &gt; Page Info &gt; Security &gt; "View Cookies" </li></ul>
<p>In the dialog that opens, you can remove the site's cookies individually. Then try reloading the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, I would recommend posting your query in Firefox support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<br />
Try changing the way it connects.&nbsp; Usually we ask folks to go into Advanced Network Functionality and uncheck it then try to connect again (<strong>Start</strong> &gt;
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Connections</strong> &gt; <strong>USB to PC</strong>, and uncheck
<em>Enable Advanced Network Functionality).</em><br />
<br />
<br />
I believe that your device may list it differently and there is a "USB Device Type" setting, which permits a change in USB protocol from "ActiveSync Serial" to "ActiveSync RNDIS".&nbsp; Change it to RNDIS, soft reset your device&nbsp;and connect again.

<h2>            Critical Error - Shell Infrastructure Host - Cannot resolve</h2>
                    <p>I am running build 122 on a Toshiba Satellite laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system has been running&nbsp;fine until today.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had the "A critical error has occurred in the Shell Infrastructure Host." dialog pop up and the system wanted me to sign out.&nbsp; Start, Cortana, etc.&nbsp; would not work.&nbsp; I was able to get to&nbsp;cmd.exe&nbsp;through This
 PC and ran it as administrator.&nbsp; I ran sfc /scannow and it found errors that it could not fix.&nbsp; I did a recovery and&nbsp;the laptop started working correctly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had the error message come up again.&nbsp; Is this a build 122 issue?&nbsp; Any work arounds to avoid this error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I was getting the same sporadic crash as well on 122 and now on 130.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;that&nbsp;this is only a Tech Preview, and I have provided this as feedback to the MS Devs.&nbsp; Just really disheartening that this is still an issue (a pretty big issue).&nbsp; Just hope relief
 comes soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Mike-PDW, try rebooting.&nbsp; Its not a solid fix, but I have seen this issue come and go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, I noticed on the MSDN forums, that Devs have seen this when a Windows 8\8.1 app is installed and has not been migrated to Win10 yet.&nbsp;

</p><p>Interesting hypothesis.... I had one app installed (Netflix) and I just removed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a sidenote this error seems to happen less when the computer is actually in use.</p>
<p>I have mine set to stay on always and just blank the screen after 15 minutes.</p>
<p>If the computer is idle it is a sure fire way to trigger it for me each and every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart it I have a 50/50 it does not happen at startup.</p>
<p>If it does not then I am usually good for awhile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE TO MODS AND DEVS......</p>
<p>
</p><p>This scan the disk notion is nonsense. I have several computers all doing this and all running 10130.</p>
<p>These machines did not all develop a failed drive syndrome overnight after installing 10130.</p>
<p>Doing the scans yields no problem on all three machines afflicted with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bug. Not a bad hard disk. Plain and simple.</p>

            I got this error today with Build 130. Happened several times just after I installed the free versions of SuperAntiSpyware and Malwarebytes. Hasn't happened since I uninstalled them.

            Installing buid 10130 has corrected the issue for now. &nbsp;It took awhile as the system kept giving me the error untilnit installed.

            The error has just come back again. sfc /scannow doesn't help. Logging on with another account still comes up with the same error. Booting off a USB disk and doing a system refresh was not able to complete the refresh, but it made the error go away!

            <p>Your possible answer... as I posted in another thread...</p>
<p>Trying to get the word out in the hopes this solves it for others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure I found the culprit here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to the control panel, scheduled tasks you will find two tasks in the Microsoft tree under&nbsp;</p>
<p>MemoryDiagnostic</p>
<p>Both have a condition set if idle for 10 minutes and are triggered off several different events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I disabled both of these tasks I have seen no more of this error.</p>
<p>Now, the evidence is if I triggered these tasks manually I got the error immediately so I am 95% sure this is the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is, what are these MemoryDiagnostic tasks for?</p>
