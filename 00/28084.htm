<h2>            Same problem again.  Old thread referenced...</h2>
                    <p>As stated in this old thread this problem is likely to recur.&nbsp; Well, it's baaaack!</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/what-does-use-this-account-everywhere-on-your/c8a36884-2354-4c6a-9a93-b61b7c4b7b13</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to use my legal subscription to Office 365 on my completely legal Windows 10 system.&nbsp; Knowing I am going to have to go through the same issue on three other systems makes me want to [self-censored].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office needs me to log into my account to verify the subscription.&nbsp; Despite that the subscription is paid a year in advance and the software knows that fact and it knows the subscription doesn't expire until January 2020.&nbsp; I try to play the game, however,
 Microsoft wants me to agree to the following five items.&nbsp; None of which I agree to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[1] Use this account everywhere on your device<br />
<br />
[2] Windows will remember your account and make it easier to sign in to apps and websites.<br />
<br />
[3] Clicking Next means that you'll be able to find a lost device, </p>
<p>[4] sync your settings to other devices, and </p>
<p>[5] ask Cortana for help.&nbsp;&nbsp; [I really, really don't want Cortana!]<br />
<br />
However, it seems if I want to continue using my legitimate Microsoft Office products I must allow Microsoft to invade my computer.&nbsp; Anyone have a solution?&nbsp; At this point I am even willing to maintain the yearly subscription but use ANY less invasive method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.&nbsp; Microsoft proved last year they have no solution.&nbsp; Perhaps one has been developed.&nbsp; I will now hold my breath.</p>

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />When you use a subscription, it needs to check the license at least once every 30 days. #2 makes this easier.  #4 is optional and is turned off and on in Windows Settings. #5 you can't totally remove Cortana but can turn off some features in Settings.

<p>Thanks for the explanation.&nbsp; Remember, I did log in as requested, multiple times.&nbsp; The only denial was to open up my system to perceived security issues for conveniences I neither care about nor want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I know understand:&nbsp; Even though I have only local accounts, it is for my convenience that I must allow my Microsoft account remembered [2]&amp;[1] and that anyone with my credentials [Microsoft] can track my device [3].&nbsp; I don' have to sync to other devices
 but that information is available in case I choose to do so.&nbsp; After turning off Cortana, as much as possible, Microsoft is now going to turn it back on every 30 days [5] requiring me to go through the trouble of turning it off, again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very similar to MS changing my settings, including security settings, and even the lock screen images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I should only have to log in once a year, when added to a new computer, or when reinstalled on an old computer, for Office to know when the subscription expires.&nbsp; Unless MS now has the right to simply cancel subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no alternative, I will simply ignore the demand to be spied on, and discuss options should my legal software quits working.&nbsp;

<br />Microsoft is now going to turn it back on every 30 days [5] requiring me to go through the trouble of turning it off, again.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />No. That's not how it works here.  My settings arent changed. This has nothing to do with the account checking for a valid license - the license check is normally done in the background. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Also, I should only have to log in once a year, when added to a new computer, or when reinstalled on an old computer, for Office to know when the subscription expires.  Unless MS now has the right to simply cancel subscriptions.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />While it would be good to check the license yearly, they choose to require it monthly. If you are online, office will do a license check every day or when you connect to the internet.  If you arent connected to the internet all the time, you need to connect once every 30 days. 
<br />
<br />The perpetual version doesn't have this requirement, but it doesn't allow subscription sharing and is not updated with new features. (To the best of my recollection, it will still ask for the 1-5 in your list.)

<p>It demands us to agree.&nbsp; If it only asked if I wanted these "features" there would be no issue.&nbsp; Remember, I did log in, as requested.&nbsp; At that point the new demand is made.&nbsp; Refusing causes the "license check" to fail.</p>

<h2>            Excel 365 - how to step through a complex formula</h2>
                    Hi, I have been given a spreadsheet which has a complex formula (probably not so complex, but it is for me!). It involves a look up, which is on another tab in the same workbook, and the look up will determine a date. &nbsp; I need to recreate this in another
 spreadsheet, and therefore I need to full understand it step by step. I see there is something I can use to evaluate - initial glance at that was not that clear to me - I really do need a step through for dummies. Can you offer any resources?&nbsp; Thanks so much.

    <title>Outlook 365 for MAC keeps closing the window WHILE typing an email. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsvdijk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 for MAC keeps closing the window WHILE typing an email.</h2>
                    <p>Anytime I compose a message in Outlook for MAC, a few seconds later, it just closes the window. Then I have to wait 30 seconds or so, until it appears in my drafts folder, reopen and continue typing until a few seconds later, it closes again. Sometimes,
 the autosave doesn't have enough time to kick in before it closes so I end up retyping everything a second or third time. It's frustrating and I feel like I'm racing against the clock to compose and send before the window closes. Cannot figure it out so I've
 also started composing in Pages and then simply pasting it in the email window. My homemade workaround, which is absolutely not conducive to productivity or efficiency. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I see something related, but it happens only when I have an attachment to a file. When a file has attachments (either attached files or inline pictures,) the auto-save kicks in every 30 seconds or so and it removes focus from the email document. This means
 that I have to re-click in the document every so often to keep editing. Not as annoying as your problem, but annoying nonetheless. No way that I've found to delete it. Outlook for Mac has far fewer user-settable options compared to Office for Win.

            Onenote for mac allows only one account at a time. You need to sign out from one to sign into other account. You can send feature request to MS on the same by clicking on the smiley icon found on the top right hand corner.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you ever lose access to your account, having a secondary email address and mobile phone number can help us easily restore your access. However, if you want to remove some security information on your account, you can perform the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;In a web browser, sign in to your <em><strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/?refd=support.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account</a></strong></em>.</li><li>Select <strong>Security</strong>, then <strong>Update info</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2e0f118-861d-49c8-bf0c-9ee75e4393d2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2e0f118-861d-49c8-bf0c-9ee75e4393d2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 3. Before you remove an alternate email or phone number, make sure you have one verified option that you can use. If you only have one option and are replacing that, add the new phone or email before removing the one currently on record.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4. Select <strong>Remove</strong> next to the email address you want to remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 5. You'll receive a notification at your existing email address or phone number. This is a precaution in case someone else made the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be asked to enter a security code to continue.&nbsp;If you don't have access to your alternate email or phone number, choose&nbsp;<strong>get a code a different way</strong>. Use the drop-down list to choose security info that you can access, or choose&nbsp;<strong>I
 don't have any of these</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also review this <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong></em> to learn more about Microsoft Security info
 &amp; Security codes.</p>

    <title>Entry in startup batch file after Defender removes a threat - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Entry in startup batch file after Defender removes a threat</h2>
                    Even though a severe malware trojan was removed by defender, upon startup a batch file is still looking for the file in the now non-existing directory since Defender deleted it. But what line in regedit or other do I use to remove the command to look into
 that folder to start the virus. IT keeps coming up as an error upon startup.

            I was able to disable the two startup items that relate to a now non-existent location because of Defender's deletion of it. It now longer shows up on 'my PC' files, but only in 'quick access'. So the situation is now fixed but it would be nice to know
 how to remove the item from startup. It appears I can only enable it or disable it. Nevertheless, the problem is fixed. Thanks.

<p>I switched from Defender to Norton Security Suite provided by Comcast. When it occurred again, I received the message 'Norton blocked an instrusion--Fake Tech Support Website 165'</p>
<p>The tab was closed completely so I did not get to read anything from it---Defender smartscreen did NOT do this but displayed the info despite my changing to block from warn yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I guess one needs to be aware of pages with ads on them running scripts like this. And perhaps Defender needs to truly block the page and provide an explanation like Norton did.</p>

            Yes but it comes back when I try to delete it, even after taking the read only attribute off of it.&nbsp; It is under local folder under appdata folder under my username. I went up one level and took off read only attribute of local file and children, but it
 comes right back after I delete the intrusion files. I have three or four intrusion file folders under the local folder. Too bad defender doesn't delete them when it quarantines the virus.

            The short answer is no, but it might be possible to process the folder and write information relating to the files into a worksheet. See

Nokia offers several choices, including ACP-3U, ACP-4U, ACP-5U and the CA-100 USB cable. Do all have a small barrel connector? Do all three ACP units support 120-240 VAC input, which I'll need for dual US-France use? What are the power outputs of the various
 models? The AC-5X has input of 100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz, 180 mA, and output of 5 VDC and 800 mA.

            i think all Nokia Chargers are rated at 100~240 VAC, 50/60HZ, hence you can use it anywhere in the world, the only difference are the plugs... just choose the right plug for you...

            On <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/A4431594," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokiausa.com/A4431594,</a> where the adapters are listed as AC-3U, AC-4U and AC-5U, all have pictures with US plugs, slightly different body shapes, apparently small barrel (2mm) connectors,
 and different prices, but their descriptions are maddeningly inconsistent.<br />
<br />
Just to confuse the issue, Nokia's USA site says the E51 phone ships with an AC-5 adapter, which Nokia does not sell online. Its picture,
<a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/AC-5," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokiausa.com/AC-5,</a> has a European plug.<br />
<br />
Enough already. I'll get an AC-5U.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.

            I'm wondering in general if there's any difference.&nbsp; My sister got a Nokia 95-3 not too long ago, but it's acting up so Amazon sent a replacement.&nbsp; We will be sending the defective N95-3 back, but we noticed that we now have two different plugs - the AC-4U
 and the AC-5U (I myself have an AC-3U that I got either with my N76 or my wife's N82).&nbsp; Any thoughts on which one we should hold onto?

<h2>            users not able to change contact details</h2>
                    <p>i recently found that users cannot change their contact details, but that this must be made by me as admin. not convenient.</p>
<p>* on checking exchange admin center - permissions - user roles - default role assignment policy i find that everything that should be checked also is checked:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84bde953-5977-42e7-a1e0-d53995791cb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84bde953-5977-42e7-a1e0-d53995791cb4" /></a></p>
<p>* on googleing, i find this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2797931," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2797931,</a> but of course a standard user cannot access exchange admin center, so that is of no help to me.</p>
<p>* then i find <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-and-edit-your-profile-in-office-delve-4e84343b-eedf-45a1-aeb9-8627ccca14ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 is shown. that does not seem&nbsp; reliable.</p>
<p>is delve the right place for users (non-admin) to go to to add/change user contact details?</p>

<p>Hi MandMand,</p>
<p>For “<em>users not able to change contact details</em>”, may I confirm whether users cannot edit their contact details in the
<strong>Office 365 settings &gt; Personal info</strong>?</p>
<p>If so, have the users tried to edit the information via <strong>Outlook Web App &gt; Settings &gt; Options &gt; Account &gt; Edit Information</strong>? For your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2797931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to update contact information in Exchange Online in Office 365</a></p>
<p>If there is anything misunderstood or the users cannot edit the information via OWA, let us know and we will continue to assist you based on the update.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>First, it sounds like your method to uninstall the other AV programs was incomplete and did not include the required removal tool in each case.&nbsp; That alone may be the root of the problem.&nbsp; Please do this and see if it helps.&nbsp; If not, then please follow these
 instructions (which include more on how to check and do the above correctly for any others EVER installed on that computer) and we'll see what happens:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80070005 is an Access is Denied error this is because either an application or executable does not have the necessary elevation to invoke a specific action. One possibility is you are trying to do this or did the update or installation as a standard user
 instead of as an Administrator - especially if you are using XP. Login to an Admininstrator account to proceed. This is not always required and I'm not sure about your circumstances or configuration or operation system, but given that error we should err on
 the side of cautiion and use the Administrator account here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with some possible troubleshooting ideas and solutions from others who also experienced this error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if the answer in the following thread helps: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the answer and the other suggestion in this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d</a>. It is similar to the above, but includes another link which may apply depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are or where you got the download or what you've done, so if the above didn't help, let's just start from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE which we are testing). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate,
 or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we don't know how much of what installed is good or possibly corrupted (or what that malware may have done even if it was removed), we need to first uninstall and then re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair
 any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first
 or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem.

</p><p>I watched one of our production assistants at work.&nbsp; When an item comes in they copy it and paste it into&nbsp; a text box or directly onto the page.&nbsp; There are lots of ads floating around off the page on the screen.</p>
<p>

<p>OK, I have a guess as to what is happening. MS changed the way text boxes work for some reason and by default the boundaries are invisible unless you mouseover them. This would explain why your users can draw a text box, move the mouse away from them, and
 they seemingly don't 'hold'. You can change the default settings. Have your users go to the View tab and check 'Boundaries'. Now when they draw a text box and change the focus by moving the mouse away from the text box the boundary of the text box will remain
 visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the answer then chances are your users will see some other empty text boxes on the page from the last time they tried to draw a new text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the linking and or simply copy and pasting, I am of the school of opinion that it is better to save the submitted Word, Publisher, PDF and image files to a folder on my local hard drive (or your server if that is the way you work) and then insert those
 files from those local folders. I like having the original files saved as backup. This work flow is especially helpful if you edit the image or content after it is inserted into the publication. In the worst case you can always go get a copy of the original
 and start over if you make a mistake in editing. If it is a Publisher file then you will probably find copy and pasting from the two files is the better workflow. I don't think importing or inserting a Pub file into another works very well.</p>

<p>Sorry but I am out of ideas for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps as a short term workaround copy and paste an existing text box, delete the text and use as a new text box? If that works you could also save a formatted text box as building block (rt click, save as building block) and then insert page parts to insert
 that formatted text box in future publications.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I assume this is happening on more than one computer, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is with just one file, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would be willing to upload a copy of the file and provide a link I would be willing to see if I can recreate the problem and find a solution. You can use any online storage that you want. Free
<strong>SkyDrive</strong> storage which is now called <strong>OneDrive</strong> is available from MS. Also
<span><strong>SendSpace</strong> is easy to use and free: <a href="http://www.sendspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="http://www.sendspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SendSpace</a> site the following steps are all you have to do.</p>
<div><span><br />
Left click the Browse button and it will open a window that allows you to access the files on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
Navigate to the folder your .pub file is in and select it. Fill in an optional 'Description' for the email.
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>Put your own email address in both the 'To: 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'&nbsp;and 'From: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' email fields.</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<span>
<div>
<p>Left click the Upload button.<br />
<br />
When the Download Link screen appears, left click the Copy Link button and then right click &gt; paste the link into a reply to this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also get two emails. Not only will you get a download link you will also get a link that allows you to delete the file so you do not need to worry about it being stored up there indefinitely. Further, the file is only available to download for 30
 days even if you do nothing.</p>

            Hi Alynn,<br />
<br />
If the SharePoint site is syncing on your PC, there should be a folder in quick access section in file explorer. Also, there should be a record about the SharePoint site synced folder location in OneDrive<strong> settings</strong>. Please right click on the
 OneDrive icon for your Office 365 business account in task tray &gt; <strong>settings</strong> &gt; in
<strong>Account </strong>tab, check if there are SharePoint site location:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/300a30a9-c51a-4876-9abe-b3937ff73381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/300a30a9-c51a-4876-9abe-b3937ff73381" height="566" width="617" /></a><br />
<br />
If yes, the SharePoint site is syncing on your PC, and as you said that when you drill down to C:\, the folder is still here, so you can just right click on the synced folder &gt; click
<strong>Pin to Quick access</strong> to check the outcome.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cd1754e-2cd0-4081-84cd-4df1a2e5bff8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cd1754e-2cd0-4081-84cd-4df1a2e5bff8" height="326" width="513" /></a><br />
<br />
If no, the SharePoint site may has been stopped syncing in unconscious, I suggest you re-sync it. When you set up the syncing, you can choice using the same location.<br />
<br />
If this is not your situation, I would like to confirm the following information to clarify your situation:<br />
1. A screenshot of Account tab in OneDrive settings, just above picture one shows that.<br />
2. A screenshot when you right click on the Sharepoint site synced folder, as the second one shows that.<br />
3. The OneDrive version you are using.<br />
4. When did you found that, did you do some settings for the folder or something else?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda

                    I have activated the 'check spelling as you type' and the 'autocorrect' feature, but the spellchecker still does a poor job at correcting typos, even obvious ones. it only highlights the word. is there a way to get the spellchecker to learn my writing

<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Sub Copy()</div>
<div>Sheets("SHEET1").Columns(2).Copy Destination:=Sheets("SHEET2").Columns(1)</div>
<div>Sheets("SHEET1").Columns(3).Copy Destination:=Sheets("SHEET2").Columns(2)</div>
<div>Sheets("SHEET1").Columns(4).Copy Destination:=Sheets("SHEET2").Columns(3)</div>
<div>Sheets("SHEET1").Columns(5).Copy Destination:=Sheets("SHEET2").Columns(4)</div>
<div>Sheets("SHEET1").Columns(6).Copy Destination:=Sheets("SHEET2").Columns(6)</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The thing is that I have to copy columns from sheet1 to sheet 2, but sheet2 has a different structure with more fields between the columns. I'm doing this one by one on the code. I don't know if there's a way to look the headers on sheet1 and match them
 with sheet2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!!</div>
                </div>

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub somesub()<br />
&nbsp;Dim col As Long<br />
&nbsp;Dim src As Worksheet, Dst As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp;Dim x As Long<br />
&nbsp;Set src = Sheets("Sheet1")<br />
&nbsp;Set Dst = Sheets("Sheet2")<br />
&nbsp;For x = 2 To 6<br />
&nbsp;col = Application.Match(src.Cells(1, x), Dst.Rows(1), 0)<br />
&nbsp;src.Columns(x).Copy<br />
&nbsp;Dst.Cells(1, col).PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues<br />
&nbsp;Next<br />
&nbsp;End Sub<br />

    <title>Visio Pop Up&#47;Data Presentation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Visio Pop Up&#47;Data Presentation</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using visio to define several high-level business processes and want to add additional detail without cluttering up the visual nor require the user to click into a sub-process.&nbsp; Users who access will not be familiar to Visio and I want access to be as
 simple and friction-less as possible.&nbsp; So I'm envisioning creating a page in SharePoint that uses the File Viewer web part.&nbsp; But I'm open if there are other options that are simple and through a browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm envisioning a pop up so the user can review the overall process and then through depending where they place their mouse, can view additional details.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reviewed both the ScreenTip and Data Graphics features.&nbsp; ScreenTips is ok in terms of data entry for content thought would be great if it had more formatting options and perhaps an import capability.&nbsp; But the roadblock is that ScreenTips are not rendering
 when the diagram is displayed in SharePoint through a File Viewer web part.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Data Graphics is the right direction as I have a variety of data from other locations to source in BUT the options for presentation don't allow for a text item that displays just an icon/graphic with the ability for the text to present as a pop up on mouse
 over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm a bit stuck. I'm pretty new to Visio so hoping there may be some SMEs out there with suggestions on how to approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the question on our forum.</p>
<p>According to your description, I have tested this, file viewer couldn’t display ScreenTips of Visio files:</p>
<p>1. Create a Visio file&gt;click Insert.</p>
<p>2. Select ScreenTip&gt;then save it to OneDrive.</p>
<p>3. Open the site&gt;add a File Viewer&gt;navigate to the Visio file.</p>
<p>4. It can’t display the ScreenTips.</p>
