<h2>            Disappeared October Challenge &#47; Contest&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;definitely saw a challenge for October (in the first week of October)&nbsp;which stated :&nbsp;1. Apply for a gamepass trial in October&nbsp;<br />2. Log in 15 different days in october (on console)&nbsp;<br /></p><p>3. earn an achievement in 4 different games in october.&nbsp;<br /><br />Doing the above entered you to win a large 4k TV, and every participant was also guaranteed a reward valued about $10. The customer service agents can't find anything either. I just want to know the status of that contest, and its name, so I&nbsp;can be updated regarding the $10 reward.&nbsp;<br /><br />It has disappeared from the Xbox website and the console hub???</p>

            Hello MÃ©lissa, <br />
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Store formerly known as Windows Store, was first introduced on Windows 8 operating system. In line with this, it is designed to run on the Metro User Interface which ships as a part of Windows 8 and above. If you wish to have Microsoft Store, I'd
 encourage you to upgrade the version of Windows on your device. By doing this, you can also enjoy new enhancements and features available to it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have any other concerns, don't hesitate to post back.

<h2>            Windows 8 stuck at black screen after &#34;preparing automatic repairs&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've had my HP laptop for five months now. A few days ago I opened the lid of my laptop and it loaded and said "Configuring automatic updates" at this point it was frozen. I held the power button down to do a hard restart. I turn it back on and it wouldn't
 boot. I've done a system refresh, HDD defragment, ran CCleaner and booted in safe mode. At this point the Hard Drive was running at 100% usage no matter what I did. I couldn't find a fix so I did a system reset. It reset the whole PC and reinstalled Windows
 8.&nbsp; It got stuck in the installation at a black screen with just my mouse. I turned it off. Now when I turn on my laptop the screen goes black for about 15 seconds, then the HP logo appears with "Preparing automatic repair" underneath. It does this for about
 20 seconds then the screen goes black. I left my computer on for about 7 hours and the screen was still back. I have no windows 8 CD or USB drive. What can I do? No one here has been willing to help with this problem even though there are alot of Windows 8
 users that have this. At this point I'm considering purchasing a Mac as I can't deal with Windows 8. If someone could help me that would be apprciated. Thanks.</p>

            I've tried multiple repairs. I did a disk check by pressing F2 during launch and it said the Hard Drive failed. I contacted HP support and they are sending me a box to place my laptop in which I'll send back. So they'll be replacing it since there is somehow
 warrenty on it. If anyone is having this problem, it's probably a hard drive crash. Good luck

    <title>Problem with printing in color - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jelenavaskovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with printing in color</h2>
                    <p>System : WIndows 10</p>
<p>Office 2016</p>
<p>AutoCad 2017</p>
<p>Printer : RIcoh Aficio 2500 and Ricoh Aficio 3000 (printing via network connection)</p>
<p>Laptop : Lenovo B50-80</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is my problem. Everything worked just fine, but one day I have decided to reinstall windows on my business laptop. I have formatted everything and installed programs from beginning. I used same installations for windows 10, office 365 2016, AutoCAD
 2017, same printers.... everything same. And suddenly &nbsp;this happens: I cannot print at all everything that is in colour from excel,word,outlook or autocad.</p>
<p>I can create PDFs from office in colour, and can print them in colour. I have printed test pages,and they are in colour.</p>
<p>When I open excel and click print, I can hear printer doing something, but paper never come out. But when in excel (or word or autocad) I select to print in black and white, then page is printed. It is very annoying to convert pages to pdf and then print
 them., not to mention quality of printed pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I cannot print pages from browser in colour. &nbsp;I tried to reinstall printers, office, autocad, update drivers for printers... Tried everything that crossed my mind, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know where could possibly be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            <p>I've read somewhere that problem is in colour management. As I understood - colour palete from printer need to be&nbsp;adjusted with colour palete from windows.

<p>

<p>I have to imagine that MS had the chance to counter offer Amazon on the buying of DH. Assuming they did, they passed on DH for a reason. They originally wanted IG, IIRC, but went with DH because of their passion. IG wasn't able to start on KI because of
 obligations anyway. I think DH was just a springboard to get the game on the system then IG was going to take over eventually anyway. The buyout has been known since around the end of last year.
</p>
<p>Honestly, I think they passed on buying DH because of their follow through. They made a great product but it isn't without consistent errors. Each patch has had at least 1 flaw in it usually many. Even to this day I'm dealing with something as simple as
 an achievement bug. I've never really seen this many issues from another company except for DICE as of late. They are a great company but they aren't right for the KI model.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Print Log&#47;History</h2>
                    I'm trying to see if I printed a confirmation&nbsp;page from Internet Explorer&nbsp;last year. However, I can't locate any sort of printing history in Windows 8.1. I've looked online, and I can't even find mention of a print log for Windows 8 systems. Is there any
 way to find this, or is there really no such option for Windows 8 and above?

                    Hi!&nbsp; About a week ago, every time that my screensaver should come on, the screen goes black and I can't wake it up.&nbsp; I hit escape, mouse buttons and finally only doing Alt+Control+Delete will get be back to my desktop.&nbsp; I've tried all the hints and ideas
 I could find, and changed all the settings to see if I can get the screensaver to work and have been unable.&nbsp; Would appreciate some help.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi Kathie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you referring to the Screensaver at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings?  This is an outdated feature that is likely being phased out soon.  I would consider setting instead a background or Lock Screen slideshow in the same Personalization settings.  
<br />
<br />If you want to try to fix it make sure you're using only the Photos app and not the discontinued Photo Gallery app.
<br />
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi! Greg - thanks for the response.&nbsp; Yes, I was in the old screensaver area.&nbsp; I now have no screensaver in that and instead I have picked a folder in the background slide show on the lock screen tab.&nbsp; How do you determine how long your desktop stays until
 this background slide show starts???&nbsp; I don't want to try to fix something if it will be gone in the next update.&nbsp; Thanks!

            Hi again Kathie -
<br />
<br />If it's the Lock Screen slideshow then that doesn't have frequency settings, while the Background slideshow (on desktop) tab does allow you to set that.  
<br />
<br />If you want some spectacular pictures for your slideshow try the Themes packages via the Theme tab and it's link to the store for more free themes.   These are some of the most spectacular and expensive pictures ever taken, and can be changed but not modified in the Themes tab where they will install.  Some of the nautical themes even have sound schemes included like foghorns, seagulls, etc.       
        </p>

            OK I have also changed the background to pictures changing a new one every minute.&nbsp; So if I understand this correctly, when I leave my computer and want to see pictures, I would have to go back to my desktop and then the background would change every minute????&nbsp;
 There isn't anything like the old screensaver that would start regardless of where you were on the computer if you were idle for a few minutes???&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;missing one or more network protocols&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am fed up with this nonsense Microsoft. Fix your product, all my devices connects to internet fine except for my desktop. I have tried almost everything. But i cannot establish wire connection. I even bought a new network card and still the same problem.
 I have clean install windows 10 twice now so don't ask me to install it again. This is really frustrating, $169 CDN is not a joke Microsoft, either refund my money and fix this problem. Without internet today there is nothing to do on computer. I may as well
 use my cell phone instead of my desktop since internet is not working. Do you guys have any solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resetting win sock, ip using netsh in ip reset, netsh in ipv6 reset etc etc</li><li>Shut down the computer for 30 min and disable adapter and restart router.</li><li>Disable netbios and dhcp </li><li>Physically took out my network card, turned on my computer then shut down and put back the network card in.</li><li>Switch network card.</li><li>reinstall ip protocol http://www.surfacetablethelp.com/2015/05/windows-108-one-or-more-network-protocols-are-missing-on-this-computer-error.htm</li></ul>
<p>And some other stuff that I cannot recall now out of frustration. And thanks for help in advance community and shame on you microsoft for releasing yet another broken product.</p>

            <p>Well I have the internet again on my desktop. However, that is not because I performed any of the above or any steps that Microsoft IT guy on chat told me. After giving up on Windows 10, it just came to me and I did the following.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took out the Ethernet cable from my desktop and plugged it into my Dell Inspiron 15R ( I disabled the wireless internet on this laptop first). After I did that, my laptop was on wired connection I used the internet for few minutes and check the speed of
 my internet to make sure internet is running at its normal speed and then I took out the cable and connected it to my desktop and wala internet back on my desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone care to explain why did that work? and no its not my router, the problem is not at my end period because I had my friend over few days with his laptop and he used the wired connection and it worked without a problem (windows 7)

            <p>I can only guess the computer did some kind of handshake with the router - an exchange of information - when you connected them with the Ethernet Cable. This kind of information (from IPConfig)...</p>

<p>..., or something even more basic -&nbsp;can it actually have downloaded WiFi network protocols? And it persists now on WiFi. Here are the various types of cable...</p>
<p>

<p>What are the Different Types of Ethernet Cables?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know, one way to get WiFi working on my Brother MFC-L2740DW printer was to connect it temporarily with a USB 2.0 cable during the install process. Doing it that way, I didn't even need to type in the&nbsp;router name or the wireless password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confess, I never even knew until recently a wireless router <em>could </em>be plugged in. The Verizon guy never said. But he did leave behind a two-sided telephone wire, which actually is a CAT5e Ethernet Cable. (I've yet to plug it in - all is lightning
 without it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a friend with your problem on a Latitude D530, Win 7, machine whose WiFi worked well until the day it wouldn't. Instead of his router name showing up at "Click the Internet Access icon in the Tray",&nbsp;he gets&nbsp;something like "Unidentified Network"
 at the top of the list.&nbsp;We did the other things others did: &nbsp;uninstall in Device Manager &amp; reboot, Registry restore,&nbsp;NETSH, long talk with Verizon, etc. That guy had him set up a proxy, which didn't work.&nbsp;His other computer continues to work wirelessly off
 the same router w/o a proxy. We downloaded all his drivers, but did&nbsp;not install them, seeing they were Win XP versions.&nbsp;He called
<del>MS</del> Dell,&nbsp;but they wanted money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, we'll try this Ethernet thing: temporarily plugging it in, that is. Thanks. (Now I'm thinking I've misread you, but we'll try that anyway.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE 12/25/15:</strong></span> No, connecting through the Ethernet Cable was no cure. It won't establish a wired connection either, giving an error 651.</p>

            I too have been having the same problem exactly as described by previous posters. I too have done all the things suggested.&nbsp; The problem arose after the last update&nbsp; number 1511. It even occurs on your new browser Edge, Chrome, and Fire Fox. Tell Microsoft
 we are getting tired of this issue. Don't give us anymore suggestions...fix the product. It is the product not our computers.

 the modem to, does and has been allowed to be my network's DHCP.&nbsp; Problems solved.&nbsp; The infuriating thing is that this once (in my naivete) worked.&nbsp; The good thing about all my pain is that I now know a heck of a lot more about networking than I did before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help. His&nbsp;other computer continues to work fine with his&nbsp;Verizon router, using WiFi.&nbsp;The computer that won't do it anymore (but it did once) is a Latitude D530, Win 7 (but the latest drivers at Dell for him are XP). I believe we discovered
 he is IPv6 when we played with "Ipconfig". But I'd have to be with the machine to verify that.

<p>
</p><p>In my case my modem is a DSL modem provided by my ISP.&nbsp; It has a built-in router which does DHCP but the main thing it does is PPPoE.&nbsp; If it wasn't locked down I would have would passed that directly into my Dlink's Internet port.&nbsp; Instead what I was able
 to do (fortunately) is disable the DHCP in the modem and pass just the 192.168.1.1 local address to the DLink, which now does DHCP for the rest of my local network (using a different subnet).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get 2 computers to talk with each other</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the title says, I can't get a Windows Vista Home Premium PC to connect to a Windows XP Home Edition computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I need to do this is to share a PRINTER and configure it to connect to the XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Vista and the XP they are in the same workgroup, I have administrator access on both of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Vista it has a password which I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the problem starts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the network folder of the vista, it shows my router, printer, and the computer itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the XP, I click on view workgroup computers and I click on the Vista PC. Even if it shows there, it says that the network location is not found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get them to work somehow? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Failing to boot from Hibernation on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholasmulholland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failing to boot from Hibernation on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I - like many other people, it would appear - have an issue with my PC not booting out of hibernation mode. It's a self-built desktop and I have Windows 10, so I had to work around reenabling the option for hibernation because Microsoft hid the option away
 in the power settings rather than fix the problem with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hours know here and other forums trying to find a fix and have tried everything I have read:</p>
<p>â hard reset</p>
<p>â disconnecting all cables</p>
<p>â disconnecting from power and holding the power key for 30 seconds</p>
<p>â attempted to log in "blind"</p>
<p>â attempted to boot to the BIOS screen</p>
<p>I have tried these individually and collectively in multiple orders and even disconnected everything overnight and tried again but one of this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the power button, just appears to load, but I get no signal from the monitor (a Samsung TV), the keyboard and mouse are unresponsive no matter how many times I restart or hard reset the tower it will not boot into Windows or the BIOS so I have
 absolutely no use of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of the solutions talk about going into device manager, changing power settings, performing tasks in CMD, but none of this solves the problem for me when I can't get into anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's getting exasperating because I need the PC for when I work from home and I don't have the time or the inclination to reset it again, not that I even have that as an option anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People's responses to similar issues seem to stop suddenly on other posts, presumably because it fixes for them, but surely I can't be the only person that still can't get into my system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated&nbsp;</p>

<p>I already attempted this and unfortunately it is not possible to do. I have created a bootable install on a USB stick, but it doesn't go through a normal boot sequence at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get the manufacturer logo on the screen, pressing to go into the BIOS also does not work. I have absolutely no signal coming from the tower to the screen whether I use an HDMI or a VGA cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried on different screens as well, but still the same.</p>

            <p>Reset and restore are two options in the same window from the bootable USB stick, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned previously, the tower will not boot out of hibernation. I am unable to even get to the options to restore or reset the PC. Because the regular boot sequence won't start, I have no access to the BIOS or reset/restore options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From other forums, it appears that because I have 16GB of RAM installed, hibernation does not function correctly, but nobody seems to know how to reset the boot sequence beyond restarting the PC five times in quick succession or disconnecting from power,
 removing the battery from the motherboard and waiting several minutes before returning it to normal. It still leads to no signal on the screen and an unresponsive mouse and keyboard.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Code 39 means the driver is corrupt or missing.<br />
<br />
Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which solves
<br />
the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also check with your System Maker to see if there are updated drivers for your DVD. Or even if there<br />
are old ones you can reinstall. Many use the Windows Default drivers however a few will have special<br />
ones. Also check the drive maker's site.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Microsoft surface RT can&#39;t connect to Wi-Fi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameshhall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft surface RT can&#39;t connect to Wi-Fi</h2>
                    <p>We switched from Xfinity to Uverse (AT&amp;T) and all was well until I changed the Uverse password.&nbsp; Now my Surface recognizes the presence of the AT&amp;T network but tries to connect (maybe?) with the old password.&nbsp; From "Settings" I get Wi-Fi on and the list
 of available networks.&nbsp; When I touch the AT&amp;T network I get the "connect" panel. When I touch "connect" I get the rotating dots and "checking network requirements".&nbsp; Time passes then the message appears "Can't connect to this network".&nbsp; Underneath it says
 "get help..." then it tries to sign me into a nearby Xfinity account, which I no longer have.&nbsp; Any help or suggestion will be appreciated.&nbsp; I'm well out of warranty and really do not want to pay for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>I don't have an RT device, but I assume the setting for wifi are similar to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to enter &gt; Settings&gt;Network and Internet&gt;Wifi and delete the old details and add the new one - I assume the new router/modem came with a password (look at the setup book that came with the device (or look for the serial/mac/and other stuff on a
 sticker on the device itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also worth mentioning is that when you enter the new password you will be presented with a check box to always use these details without asking permission first, I always like to turn this off, so I know which wifi I am connecting to and saves all this stuff
 when passwords are changed (you can add new password details instead of having to delete every time you change).</p>

            Try running that website in compatibility view. From the menu click on tools, Compatibility view, and add the website to the list. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

            Check your display resolution and make sure you are at your recommended setting. In your browser exit full screen and use the smaller windows that is adjustable. There should be a tiny icon upper right to toggle between full and not full screen.

</blockquote>
<p>Do the "buttons" provide any kind of keyboard access?&nbsp; Tab from others for example?&nbsp; Sometimes accessing window elements that way can cause them to be redrawn where you can see them.&nbsp; Otherwise provided you use Desktop IE not in Fullscreen mode you should
 be able to resize and move the window to make your "buttons" accessible that way.&nbsp; BTW if you are in Fullscreen mode keyboard methods of toggling out of it include pressing F11 and pressing Alt-Space R.&nbsp; Another possibility would be that a web page should
 have included a vertical scrollbar.&nbsp; You may be able to workaround that deficiency by using&nbsp; Middle-click to invoke AutoScroll and then going down.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that we are unclear about your symptom description and just trying to make some reasonable interpretations about what you might be trying to describe:&nbsp; Desktop IE or MUF IE?, Fullscreen problem?, Desktop window problem?, OS Display problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows 10 task bar not working correctly</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10.&nbsp; In the last week the toolbar stopped working correctly.&nbsp; When I click on a button of a open program, it will not bring the program to the front.&nbsp; I usually have to minimize the other open windows to get to it.&nbsp; Also, when I have multiple
 pages open within the same program, it does not let me click on the one I want.&nbsp; The previews just disappear when I try.&nbsp; Help!</p>

    <title>Can I re-run Windows 10 Compatibility Report manually&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew hynes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I re-run Windows 10 Compatibility Report manually&#63;</h2>
                    I have a PC and a Laptop networked together&nbsp;both using the same WiFi USB Adapter and both running Windows 7. My laptop has passed the Windows 10 Compatibility test but my PC failed with the message 'This PC can not run Windows 10. It does not meet the
 system requirements. There are no supported networking devices.' Though older than my laptop my PC has a higher spec and has all the same network devices as my laptop. The only difference I could find was that my PC WiFi Adapter driver was an older, non Windows
 10 version, where as my laptop has a more up to date, Windows 10 compliant driver. I have upgraded the WiFi driver on my PC and it works fine. My question is how do I now get the Windows 10 upgrade icon to re-run the Windows 10 Compatibility Report?

<p>Hi Andre, thanks for getting back so quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp; tried your solution but have a slight problem with your first instruction:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Command Prompt (admin)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hold down the Windows Key and press X&nbsp;nothing happens. I have also tried Windows+Shift+x.</p>
<p>Just pressing the Windows Key brings up the start menu so it must be the combination I am typing incorrectly.</p>
<p>I am assuming we are trying to run the 'DOS' command window in administrator mode.</p>
<p>I have gone into the Start/Accessories/Command Prompt and tried to run the schtasks command but get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]<br />

<p>C:\Users\Andrew&gt;cd /</p>

<p>C:\&gt;cd Users\Andrew</p>
<p>C:\Users\Andrew&gt;schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience<br />

ERROR: Access is denied.</p>
<p>C:\Users\Andrew&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>User\Andrew is the only user on my machine and in User Maintenance shows as being the Administrator. The only other user&nbsp;is the default Guest user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How else can I run the Command Prompt windows in admin mode?</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew, based on the fact that you are running Windows 7 and I get the same result, I'm guessing the 'Windows key + X' method is intended for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 7, run cmd as administrator:</p>
<p>Click on Start, type 'cmd', right click on 'cmd.exe', then click on 'Run as Administrator'.</p>
<p>In the command window, run the command </p>
<p>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser".</p>
<p>You should get the response: SUCCESS: Attempted to run the scheduled task "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange thing about this, and also when running the task in Task Scheduler, is that the task ends immediately, albeit indicating success, and the Get Windows Check PC Status timestamp is not updated. I suspect we're missing something.</p>
<p>

Are you able to browse the internet using Internet Explorer?&nbsp;<br />
Are you using a wireless connection? (if so, plug the computer into the router and see if it's still a problem)<br />
Do you receive any error messages?<br />
