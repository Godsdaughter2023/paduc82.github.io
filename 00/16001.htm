<p><span>Hi Ashlee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my test, I didn’t meet the issue when I try the same steps with you.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you try the following steps to check if the issue still exists:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Uncheck the option <span>“Always use these values regardless of sign in to Office”</span></span></p>
<p><span>2. Reopen Word&gt;then check the option “Always use these values regardless of sign in to Office” again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. The Office version. (Click File&gt;select Account)</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if all files meet the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>3. When did the issue still exist? Which operation have you taken before the issue occurred, such as updating Office?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Qing</span></p>

    <title>Multi-line Chapter Headings Causing Other Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyproctor1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi-line Chapter Headings Causing Other Issues</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word 2007 to format a book but I am having trouble with chapter headings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the chapter headings to be two-line, with the chapter number above the chapter name, both center-justified, e.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to avoid this messing up the TOC, I insert a "soft enter" (Shift+Enter) between the chapter number and the chapter name in the heading. This works fine and my TOC entries are single-line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it then messes up my page headers because the soft enter if not suppressed there. I have odd-page headers with right-justified chapter&nbsp; name and page number, and even-page headers with left-justified page number and chapter name, e.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example&nbsp; 101</p>
<p>
</p><p>102 Example</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example 103</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like these to be single-line but the soft enter, present at the start of the chapter name, causes a line-throw. In the even-page headers, especially, it splits the chapter name onto a different line from the page number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this properly, or maybe a better way of achieving my original goal?</p>

<p>If you could settle for having just the chapter name in the header (without the chapter number), or if you were willing to use two StyleRef fields to get both, you could use the solution described at
<span><a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TOCTips.htm#UnnumberedHeadings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TOCTips.htm#UnnumberedHeadings</span></a>, which uses separate styles for the chapter number
 and chapter title. One of these styles will be Heading 1 (or whatever level you're using for chapter headings). Whether it is the chapter number or the chapter title will depend on whether or not you're relying on the heading number for page or caption numbering.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another approach that would work would be to define a character style (identical to Default Paragraph Font, so it adds no formatting) to apply to the title and use that style for the StyleRef field in the header. The problem with this is that you will
 have to take care not to apply the style to the paragraph mark (or to remove it if Word insists on adding it anyway), as the style applied to the paragraph mark is also applied to the auto number.</span></p>

            In other devices it is updated It's only in Windows Phone that isn't updated, so according to your response I think I will just have to find another device despite knowing how much I Will miss. Goodbye Windows Phone. I am disappointed.

<h2>            Office 365 and Office 2003</h2>
                    I have used Excel and Word since Day 1.&nbsp; I love Office 2003 version of Excel although I feel it could use a couple of enhancements.&nbsp; I know it is OLD so when I purchased a new system this past fall or late summer, I did not hesitate to purchase 365.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp;
 What a change in Excel and quite frankly in the beginning I told myself, "settle down, use it, learn it, it is the new thing and you have to get use to it.&nbsp; Folks, I feel that when a version of software is updated to a new version, it should be as good as
 the previous with a bunch of changes that makes it even better.&nbsp; Now it is true I know, that my 2003 was a bit old by the time 365 came out but still in all, going from 2003 to 365, one would never, ever know they are related versions of the same software.&nbsp;
 I have now used it since August 22 and I am done with it.&nbsp; I am going to get a refund on my subscription and go back to&nbsp; 2003 because it makes sense whereas nothing, or very little makes sense about 365.&nbsp; It is cumbersome; one must take five steps to do what
 we could do in 2 steps previously and that simply does not make any sense whatsoever.&nbsp; At first with that darn "Tell us what you want to do" thing, I though well probably use something enough and it will pop up on a menu here somewhere.&nbsp; No luck!&nbsp; I hate it!&nbsp;
 I do not know what directions were given to the team in going from 2003 to the next version and so forth until they ended up with 365, but they either did not follow directions or whomever gave them did not know what they were doing.&nbsp; Quite frankly I would
 give 365 a <strong>HUGE "F".&nbsp; </strong>Am I wrong?&nbsp; Am I missing something here or do you all agree that it now takes more steps to do things than in previous versions and thus Microsoft headed totally in the wrong direction.&nbsp; IF I am missing something, what
 is it?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to inform you that the features currently included in Excel for Office 365 are from accumulated suggestions and feedback from various users on how the Excel experience can be improved further. Please don't forget that the basis of these features
 are not only from Office 2003 alone, but also from succeeding versions, i.e. Office 2007, Office 2010, and Office 2013, each of which also had unique new features carried over from its predecessors respectively.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that jumping from Excel for Office 2003 to Excel for Office 365 right away has been quite an overwhelming experience as you did not get to experience the other versions of Excel. Still, we would highly suggest giving it a chance to see its
 great features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you may also submit a feedback form to help us improve the Excel experience further in the future by going to this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cyprus/cpe/feedback.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I am fully aware of what you are saying and knew when I prepared my statement someone would concentrate on the vast changes from '03 to 365 meaning you entirely missed my point.&nbsp; In my humble opinion, if you just load Excel 2016 and look at the menu items
 at the top, the things most commonly done in Excel are missing.&nbsp; Therefore the only way to get to them is to go to the infamous "Tell&nbsp;Me What You Want To Do".&nbsp; For an example, formatting cells for borders and numbers, deleting and inserting cells.&nbsp; There is
 so much missing and so much that I personally do not need or use.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am having a difficult time trying to grasp that people would want things "hidden" or done away with like in my examples above.&nbsp; When you take a version of software, Excel for an example,
 and try to improve it or enhance it, one involved must always remember to make it easier to do.&nbsp; For an example, in 2003, they were menu items under "Edit" and "Format".&nbsp; Neither of those two menus exist today in 365.&nbsp; Therefore the only way I have found to
 date to insert cells or delete cells or to format cells for either "numbers" or "borders" is to go to the "Tell me what you want to do and enter it.&nbsp; I do not set up spreadsheets so that cells are the same format in all cases, ever.&nbsp; In 99.999% of my spreadsheets,
 you will find a multitude of formats for various cells therefore every time I want to format a cell for something, I must go to "Tell me what you want to do" and I call that cumbersome.&nbsp; I am 100% positive if I downloaded every version from 2003 on through
 2016 and examined the formatting and menus and so forth, it would not follow a logical path putting us where we are today.&nbsp; For those not use to previous formats, then this new format might not be so bad but for those of us who have used many of the previous
 formats, this new one is not logical at all.&nbsp; I would love to see&nbsp; a survey of 2026 users, how many have used previous versions and what versions they have used and among those who have come from 2003 to 2016 even going through versions in between, how many
 agree with me as a percentage and I believe it would be a large percentage.&nbsp; Many of the capabilities we have had previously are now even gone completely or so difficult to do it is not worth doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example, before the 2003 version, and I do not
 know the title,&nbsp;if one was running a spreadsheet where data was needed from another spreadsheet, it was easy to do.&nbsp; In fact, I established a spreadsheet application where 49 differrent spreadsheets analyzed through macros and&nbsp;etc. sets of data from different
 sources.&nbsp; The 50th spreadsheet then presented the analysis from the other 49.&nbsp; In order to do this, you had to grab data from different spreadsheets and copy that data into the 50th sheet.&nbsp; Try to do that today!&nbsp; You would be in a straight jacket a quarter
 of the way through it.&nbsp; In fact, just&nbsp;trying to copy the data from one cell in one spreadsheet to another cell in a different spreadsheet is nearly impossible where before it was simple.&nbsp; In fact, here is the process to do that previously:&nbsp; In the cell from
 speadsheet "A", where you want to present the data you just simple enter an equal sign then go to the spreadsheet "B" that contains the data you want in a specific cell and click on it and spreadsheet "A" will display the&nbsp;data contained in the cell from spreadsheet
 "B" even if that cell contained a forumla to calculate the value shown in that&nbsp;cell.&nbsp; That is the easiest way possible to do such a thing, and yet today you cannot come close to doing that easy.&nbsp; If you are creating a new version of software such as spreadsheets
 and it is easy to do something in the original spreadsheet, your creation of a new and improved spreadsheet should never be more difficult but should be easier, it should eliminate or shorten steps to accomplish things and not add steps ever!&nbsp; One people&nbsp;make
 recommendations, it is vitally important to understand not only what they are suggesting, but the&nbsp;effect of making the changes and if that means adding steps or making it more difficult, then do not do it!&nbsp; New and enhanced and improved all mean "easier" not
 more complicated and that is something I feel has been forgotten completely.&nbsp; There are a lot of capabilities no longer available and that is not right and should never happen.&nbsp; If you are getting a suggestion from a brand new user of Excel who has never used
 Excel before&nbsp;nor for that matter, any spreadsheet application available any where, the suggestion will either be a brilliant idea to improve things or something that makes no sense at all.&nbsp; In other words, just because people suggest it does not mean it is
 the right thing to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in my opinion, from what I have seen in going to 2016,&nbsp;perhaps new changes, or changes to the application should be put&nbsp;before the users first and allow them to decide if it should be done or not.&nbsp; I hate 2016 Excel so much,
 I am considering what my options are to rid myself of it.&nbsp; At first when I prepared this, I was ready to cancel my subscription and throw&nbsp;it out completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, there are other capabilities within&nbsp;Office 265 I might like or might need to use that I cannot
 go back to older versions for and therefore I may have to&nbsp;keep the subscription just to be able to use those parts while in fact, I will reload my Office 2003 and use the Excel and Word from that.&nbsp; I just know that to&nbsp;those I know who are heavy users of Excel,
 I would NEVER recommend 2016 versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I absolutely deplore are the "colors".&nbsp; I want all of the colors as my choices and not "theme" colors which I absolutely hate.&nbsp; In order to properly deploy colors with theme colors, one must know the colors from every single theme, otherwise,
 how else can we make a solid choice when we first begin with Excel 2016.&nbsp; Further, right now in Windows 10, trying to see the scroll bars is as close to being impossible without it actually being impossible and how to change it is beyond my current knowledge
 level but, having begun with this system late August and it is now mid-November, it is something I should have learned LONG ago but have not yet discovered.&nbsp; IT has to be easier for everyone and before anyone jumps on that, I am a long time user of Excel having
 been one of the very first to use it.&nbsp; I was a beta tester for Windows&nbsp;and before that we used DOS to get around in a computer and true, we could not do nearly what we can now but with every new version, we lose capability and that should not be the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, let me please ask you a question, a personal question which you need not answer publically but the answer is something for you to think about.&nbsp; How long have you been with Microsoft?&nbsp; What version of Excel was current when you began?&nbsp; Have you ever
 used Office 2003's Excel?&nbsp; If you are given an assignment to incorporate a suggestion from a user, do you go back through previous versions to see how it was done then?&nbsp; And if so do then consider, okay, here is how it was done then, how can I change it so
 it can be done as suggested?&nbsp; Then while making those changes, do you consider, "am I making it easier, or more difficult to accomplish?"&nbsp; IF you are not making it easier, then it should not be done.&nbsp; If you must eliminate some other capabilities to accomplish
 this one, it should not be done.&nbsp; Sorry, but that is how I feel about the situation.&nbsp; No company can expect people to complete relearn software every time a new version comes out.&nbsp; In the very beginning, it was said, the reason for the personal computer is
 to make it easier to accomplish tasks.&nbsp; THAT has NEVER happened for in every case it has taken more time to do it in a computer than to do it by hand!&nbsp; And that is because the programmers forget the original task - to make it easier to do.&nbsp; As we go through
 time and people use the software frequently, they think of new things that would be possible to do in the computer and then they submit an idea to Microsoft.&nbsp; At that point in time when the programmer gets the idea, it is an idea in and of itself.&nbsp; But before
 anything begins on the idea, it must be married into the software as the software stands and then look toward incorporating the idea.&nbsp; IF it always remains as an item in and of itself outside of the current version of software, it can never be married in allowing
 a way of doing that makes it easier.&nbsp; Everything is already possible but it is the programmer's job to do make it easer to do it and if that is not accomplished, the programmer has failed to perform their jobs properly.&nbsp; IF it is necessary to completely rewrite
 the application but nothing gets more difficult to accomplish, that is fine.&nbsp; But if in the incorporation of the idea even if it means a completely new system, everything remains no more difficult than previously, there is no problem but the moment something
 becomes more difficult to accomplish or impossible or nearly impossible, then it is a failure.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this is ludicrous to say the very least.&nbsp; This is a good example of what I call the poorness of Office 365!&nbsp; I am right now attempting to learn how to setup Windows 10 to go to Google and download my email.&nbsp; This is a practice I have ALWAYS done.&nbsp; I
 have first searched on how to do it and then picked certain sites I wish to copy their material and put into Word for later reference as I do not have the time to actually do it right now.&nbsp; At one site, http://www.groovypost.com/howto/add-gmail-email-windows-10-mail-app/
 I am attempting to copy the material and paste it into the Word document I have open for this purpose.&nbsp; I copied the material I want and then went to the document and hit CTRL+V as I have always done.&nbsp; All of the text was pasted into the document, however,
 none of the images employed as visual samples of what the text says pasted into the document.&nbsp; I went back to the website and several times highlighted one of the images and then went to the document and attempted to paste&nbsp; but it would not do it.&nbsp; Instead,
 first it came up with questions as to the format to use to post with but even after I told it by clicking on the choice, it still did not paste.&nbsp; Then suddenly it began asking how I wanted to format the picture and again same thing.&nbsp; Suddenly here is a message
 stating Word quit working and the system was restoring it but when it did the restore, guess what? it took out everything I had previously pasted.&nbsp; Now I have to go back, copy it all and paste it again and again the images will not paste.&nbsp; This never happened
 in 2003, so why does it happen now?&nbsp; Why is it so difficult to do the simplest things and most of the time it doesn't work at all!&nbsp; It is revolting!&nbsp; I do not mind learning and dedicated myself to learning long before most of you were born but this is far
 beyond learning.&nbsp; It simply does not WORK!</p>

            <p>No one cares to reply to my last entry?&nbsp; I would really like to hear some opinions on this as to whether or not it is just me, or the system, or what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will admit, very happily, that recently I learned in Excel 2016 we can create a menu item of our own with the items in that menu as we choose.&nbsp; Therefore what I did was to create my own menu item called, as an example "My Menu" and in it I placed all of
 the items from available commands I use frequently and when I discover a new one and use it a lot, I then add it to my menu item so I can avoid the "Tell me what you want to do?" as I simply hate having to click on that, enter what I want to and then get to
 do it or go to where the items are or whatever as I believe I should be able to click on a menu, view the drop down list and select that which I want to do and do it, just as we did in Excel 2003.&nbsp; Again, when newer versions are created, it must always be
 in the minds of the programmers that they are working to enhance or &nbsp;improve the product, not rewrite it and in doing so, they make it easy to go from version to version without getting lost.&nbsp; Excel 2016, in my humble opinion is nearly a complete rewrite of
 Excel which was not needed.&nbsp; I am not familiar any longer with any other versions of similar programs so I don't know if Microsoft programmers were attempting to "catch up" when they were not behind or what was in the minds of the programmers when they were
 writing Excel 2016 and I do not know what changed in the various versions from Excel 2003 to Excel 2016.&nbsp; I am just trying to make things better for EVERYONE and in doing so, may appear to be complaining but that is not my main aim or goal and really do not
 intend to do so.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I start up the phone connecting to Power and Volume Up key works and I use it for control volume with on screen controls, but, I cant make my phone restart or turn off, just&nbsp;screen lock with an app named Touch Lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I downloaded many appls like Reboot Now and Quck Reboot but they don't work on Windows 8.1 devices, is there an chance or a way to do this no matter if is an app os is something else than Power button or volume - options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot I will really appreciate this, I was a little confused and frustrated.</p>

<h2>            I get a blue screen asking me to sign in to one of several accounts in outlook</h2>
                    <p>When I read an email and click on an email address in that email to create a new email instead of replying, I get a blue screen asking me to sign in to one of several accounts. Is there somewhere in settings I can change it so when I click on an email address
 it goes to new email and not the blue screen.</p>

            <p>Hello Sushma:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely appreciate the kind reply and assistance. If I understand your question correctly, I do not believe I have configured any email accounts in Outlook other than my bellsouth.net account. I have attached a screen shot of the page that pops up. After
 my system crashed I remember a level 3 engineer from the escalation department who reloaded my computer from scratch did something in settings so the screen shot page that is attached does not pop up when I click on an email address to create a new email.
 &nbsp;Thank you very much! I look forward to further guidance in resolving this issue.

            <p>Hello Sushma:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for replying. Based on your reply that the mail app that comes up with Windows has nothing to do with Office Outlook, then how does one go about resolving my issue. As I stated earlier, and for example, when reviewing my email inbox in Outlook,
 if someone replies to me and provides the&nbsp;email of a person to contact in the body of their reply, when I click on the email to create a new email and send it, the screenshot pops up instead of being able to draft a new email like you get when a person clicks
 on new email. How do I bypass if you will the screenshot and when I click on an email address in my inbox it goes to new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I assume it has to do with settings but I have no clue on how to do it or where to begin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Multiple columns with VLOOKUP</h2>
                    I know this has been posted before but I cannot find the answer I need.&nbsp; I'm trying to "VLOOKUP" in different columns, such as..."In Shop", I can get it to work with 2 columns but if I try 3, 4 or 5, it will not work. Maybe I'm not using the correct formula.

            There are 130 cells in each category. I figured it out, I needed the screenshot I posted to go into another sheet to be filtered per each piece of equipment, there will be 1 sheet per day all going into this one sheet. This is so we can see how many times
 each piece of equipment was in the shop etc. Since I could only get VLOOKUP to reference two columns I used this =IFNA(VLOOKUP($C4,'1'!$R$5:$R$20,1,FALSE),IFNA(VLOOKUP($C4,'1'!$V$5:$V$20,1,FALSE),"")) three times in&nbsp; separate&nbsp; cells, then I used =IFNA(HLOOKUP($C4,$M4:$O4,1,FALSE),"")
 to reference those cells into one.

<h2>            Mystery Symbol on 6300 Display</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hello there&nbsp;friendly Nokia users, have any of you come across a mystery symbol on the screen of a 6300 like mine I wonder. Two small horizontal&nbsp;parallel black lines have appeared near the top of the display and are just visible and present
 at all times whenever the phone is on whatever it is doing. There is a fuzzy black mark also between the two lines. This symbol&nbsp;first appeared a few weeks ago and is growing&nbsp;longer each day. It is not a problem at present but the symbol now covers half the
 width of the screen already so it could become a problem if its growth continues.</font></p>
<p><font>Any ideas, please?</font></p>

    <title>Alternative to All Apps list - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Alternative to All Apps list</h2>
                    <p>Start menu:<br />
All Apps - Seeking an item<br />
<br />
Although, the All Apps bit on the Win10 Start menu is pretty much what the All Programs list was/is in Win7... and some ppl are coming from a Windows 8.1 background...<br />
<br />
Have heard that some Folks are not liking scrolling through an A to Z list.&nbsp; Even, though things can be&nbsp;Pinned or type a couple characters into Search, sometimes there's scrolling the list seeking something.<br />
<br />
Well, here's an alternative.&nbsp; It provides for a folder on the Taskbar that opens a window.&nbsp; The nav tree can be removed.&nbsp; The windows has (All) Applications in it.&nbsp; The contents can have the View&nbsp;desired style set&nbsp;and Sort can be set, as desired.&nbsp; Point being,
 instead of scrolling down a&nbsp;grocery store list, the window can be an array of icons (Hint: Medium size works really well).&nbsp; Look 'em over for what you seek.&nbsp; It's how I &amp; my clients&nbsp;do it in 8.1 &amp; it is, still, terrific w/ Windows 10.&nbsp; If you would like&nbsp;try
 it...<br />
<br />
Rt Clk on Desktop (anywhere)<br />
&gt; New<br />
&gt; Shortcut<br />
<br />
In the "Location" box put, &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{4234d49b-0245-4df3-b780-3893943456e1}<br />
In the Name box, change it to Applications<br />
Hit next, OK, Done, Finish whatever it says, LOL</span></p>
<p><span>Ok, so now, find it on (or in) Desktop<br />
Click it to open<br />
Remove the nav tree<br />
Set the View you like/want<br />
Sort it how you desire<br />
<br />
MINIMISE&nbsp;&nbsp; DO NOT CLOSE!<br />
It will sit @ the ready on the Taskbar.<br />
<br />
If you do not close it... you only have to Click the Desktop icon &amp; set it if &amp; when you reboot or after a reboot.<br />
<br />
Some of you may, really, like this.&nbsp; Configuring it takes all of about 2 seconds.&nbsp; And the results can be neat to use.<br />
<br />
Example of one way it can be...<br />

            I must say, this sure is more appealing, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
to me</span>, looking @ an array than through a list. Nicely laid out right in front of me to see all @ once&nbsp;&amp; select. Saves time &amp; searching or drilling down or going up &amp;&nbsp;down a list.<br />
<br />

            <p>I tried your App shortcut it's<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> very&nbsp;cool
</span>. I &nbsp;pinned it to my task bar ! (I'm using W10 9296) for the daily driver now on this PC&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(the daily driver here ).</p>
<p>I named it Applications 2&nbsp; so it doesn't conflict with my pre existing application folder (see below)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did&nbsp; something a little different a while back . I copied all my&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> desktop shortcut icons, frequently used windows applications ,utility&nbsp;,program &nbsp;and folder shortcuts &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;to a new desktop folder and &nbsp;named it
 application's .</p>
<p>
</p><div>You can add or delete items in there at will and have a bunch of stuff&nbsp;you wouklden't nornally have
<div>on your desktop instantly accessible from your task bar providing you have a win explorer shortcut pinned there. &nbsp;This &nbsp;is an alternative to&nbsp; drilling down through file explorer navigation trees for whatever you put in there it should work fine in Win
 Vista ,7, 8, 8.1 and 10 I'm using it in 10 x64&nbsp; and 7 x64</div>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a file explorer icon pined to the task bar so I pinned this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
new folder </span>to file explorer </p>
<p>it shows as a link just above the desktop at the top of the navigation tree just right click your &nbsp;pinned &nbsp;file explorer icon in the task bar and it comes up as a pinned folder .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Libraries ,drives and the usual stuff are still visible in the nav tree &nbsp;in the new folder&nbsp; along with all of your desktop apps&nbsp;,windows apps and&nbsp; folder shortcuts&nbsp; or whatever you put in there ( Excluding your modern UI apps of course )&nbsp; it's just a right
 click away &nbsp;on file explorer icon in the task bar . </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the new application shortcut folder &nbsp;is opened&nbsp;you can minimize&nbsp; this new app folder &nbsp;while you work and treat it like any open folder or if it isn't open you can open with rt click on the pinned file explorer icon in the task bar .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside thought you could actually have both app folders open while you work if needed and treat them as you would any open folder or toggle through them in task view in W 10&nbsp; or the usual KB shortcuts in earlier windows

            BTW, if using Applications window, File Explorer is&nbsp;on its Jumplist; ergo, still, 'right there'.&nbsp; Opening it will give you all your Quick Access&nbsp;pinned folders.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
No real point here, just anecdotal.&nbsp; I had pretty much quit using the Start menu, @ least sometime early in Win7, maybe earlier.&nbsp; The lack of one in 8.0 &amp; 8.1, you can imagine, never really bothered me.&nbsp; Nor do I use the Start screen in 8.1 (or the ALL Applications
 screen).&nbsp; Do often use them, those screens, to Search.<br />
<br />
Now, w/ Win10, even though it has a Start menu, I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
hardly ever</span> have any call or need to open it. I don't use it to access All Applications nor to Search; use Taskbar Search.<br />
<br />

            Yes, that one, actually called "Power Users menu" is terrific; though not new to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Don't panic, anyone, don't, really, have to be a Power User to use it, lol.&nbsp; Should have called just
<strong>Users menu</strong>, me thinks.<br />

            I can't find the original poster to give him some kudos but if you go taskbar&gt;Toolbars&gt;New Toolbar.... you can point to a folder that contains more folders or shortcuts to programs. You can have several of these. Very neat and clean. A shortcut to a folder
 causes the folder to be opened in Explorer however.

            I have given this to Redmond, @ their request &amp; to the Microsoft Store, here in Calgary. I have used it for years, not only w/ Windows 10 &amp; give it to all my friends, colleagues &amp; clients; all like it a lot! It is very likely anyone would like it. It saves
 open Start &amp; going through the All Applications there. It, also, shows ALL items w/out having anything inside folders. It gives a window that 'lives' on the Taskbar and its 'display' can be User selected for View &amp; Sort.<br />
<br />
Using this line <strong>%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{4234d49b-0245-4df3-b780-3893943456e1}</strong><br />
<br />
Rt Clk Desktop &gt; New &gt; Shortcut. Put the line in Location, hit Next. Change (name) explorer.exe to Applications, hit Finish. Now, click on the resultant icon, get rid of the Nav Tree, select the desired View &amp; Sort and MINIMISE, do not close (X). If closed,
 have to redo it. Has to be redone, via the Desktop icon, after a Restart. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also, remember, in Windows 10, one can search by just hitting the Win key &amp; beginning to type what one seeks.<br />

<h2>            Math add-in Installation</h2>
                    <p>The Math Add-in runs fine on computer A (Win 7 Ultimate&nbsp;32-bit, Office 2007 32-bit) but I cannot get it to run on machine B (Win 7 Home 64-bit, Office 2010 32-bit).</p>
<p>I go to File | Options and find Math Add-in listed as installed; open up the COM dialog and put an X in the Math Add-it box; finish with the OK button. But there is still no Mathematics tab on the Ribbon. I tried to use Remove in the COM dialog (so that
 I could reinstall) &nbsp;but was told that only an administrator can do that - I AM the administrator of that pc (its a home unit)</p>
<p>Any idea how to get it up and running? Thanks.</p>

<p>I go to File | Options and find Math Add-in listed as installed; open up the COM dialog and put an X in the Math Add-it box; finish with the OK button. But there is still no Mathematics tab on the Ribbon. I tried to use Remove in the COM dialog (so that

<p>Close all your Office apps, then right click on the Word icon and select "Run As Admin". Then try to uninstall the addin.</p>

            Your method for removal worked just fine. Thanks. But when I did a reinstall I am back to square 1 - I open the add-in manager, check the box and Ok. Back to Word and there is no Mathematics tab. When I open the add-in manager again, there is no X in the
 mathematics add-in box.

            The Math add-in doesn't create a separate tab on the ribbon. It adds a one-button group to the Add-Ins tab, and the same to the Equation Tools context-sensitive tab.<br />
<br />
However, the symptom of it being unchecked in the COM Add-Ins dialog does indicate that something is turning it off, possibly another add-in. When you go through a check-it-and-return-to-find-it-unchecked cycle, does any useful message appear in the Windows
 Event Viewer under the Application or System categories?<br />

            It's possible we're using different versions of the add-in and that could account for the different behavior. On my computer it shows up in the Programs &amp; Features dialog as version 3.5.0, installed on 10 March 2011.<br />

            The location of the file is the same.<br />
<br />
Hearing how much trouble you're having, I'm reluctant to "upgrade" my add-in to the later version. I prefer my software to work, thank you!<br />

<h3> jwinnovate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two companies, two instances of Office 365, synchronize calendars</h2>
                    <p>Our company contracts from another company for some of our job functions.&nbsp; The employees that are contracted must have an e-mail address with our company (Company 1) in order to represent us and perform their job functions.&nbsp; They also maintain and must have
 an e-mail address with their host company (Company 2) in order to perform the other tasks they perform for their primary employer.&nbsp; These users have meetings scheduled in each place, but it's quite difficult for anyone, including them, to keep track of their
 master schedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both companies utilize Office365. Is there any way to make it so the same individual can synchronize their calendars automatically between Company 1's Office 365 instance and Company 2's Office365 instance for their respective accounts?&nbsp; For example, if
 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** gets invited to a meeting, the meeting invitation gets replicated to the calendar for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; and vice-versa, if *** Email address is removed for privacy *** schedules a meeting with others, it is reflected on his *** Email address is removed for privacy *** calendar
 so others at company1.com can see that Bob is unavailable at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you for the link, and I had actually read that thread prior to posting my question.&nbsp; However, it does not answer my question about sorting collections/locations, instead only addresses the volume of such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to sort the collections/locations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacts: Atlanta</li><li>Contacts: Bellingham</li><li>Contacts: Portland</li><li>Contacts: Seattle</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And not have them sorted as entered according to entry date (which is the current default), which might look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacts: Seattle</li><li>Contacts: Bellingham</li><li>Contacts: Portland</li><li>Contacts: Atlanta</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>HereMaps (which I originally used for similar purpose since I purchased my old Nokia920) automatically sorts Collections alphabetically on its mobile version (though not the individual Locations, and not at all on desktop), which is at least a start.&nbsp; Even
 better, I can use HereMaps on Android, which Microsoft all but forced us onto, but that is another conversation...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it is relevant that given BingMaps is not available for Android while the arguably more feature rich HereMaps is, so perhaps the easiest/best thing for me to do is simply give up on BingMaps.</p>

    <title>SMS backup fails to load texts on new phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewfields  say:</h3>
<h2>            SMS backup fails to load texts on new phone</h2>
                    I have an issue that has persisted over several resets. I always had my text backup on and assumed that my texts would be loaded into my next windows phone. With a new phone I let the messaging app download text from "all time" and the phone would only
 manage to backup about two months worth of texts from over a year ago. If i changed the settings to "from last year" it would load a couple months from the beginning of 2014 and stop (if it ever began to load new texts at all). Then if i set it to "from last
 month" it may load at most two weeks of texts (and not the most recent two weeks) or at the least a couple days of texts if it loaded any texts at all. I have reset my phone a number of times but at most only received as many backed up texts as described above.
 Is there a fix? I was sent here from the windows support twitter account.

            <p>Hello AndrewFields:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having with your SMS back up.&nbsp; This is an issue I have personally encountered, on my Windows 8 phone pre developer preview.&nbsp; In my case there was one very long SMS thread I had that was preventing
 the full SMS backup from pushing to the phone.&nbsp; What I did was deleted this long thread from my phone and this led to the other messages coming to my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you consider looking for this and taking the above action, there are a few smaller things I might suggest and some questions related to your set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would like you to do is to sign into <a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://accounts.live.com</a> with the Microsoft account on the phone.&nbsp; Once signed in go to the basic info. section and make sure you have a time zone listed here.&nbsp; Once this is done, go to the phone and tap settings &gt; time + date &gt; turn automatically set OFF
 &gt; set the time, date and time zone on your phone manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done the above reboot your phone and then check your SMS history again.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you continue to miss&nbsp;chunks of your SMS the next thing to try is a soft reset of the phone.&nbsp; Go to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet
 Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is&nbsp;done, press and hold the down volume button + the power button until the phone&nbsp;vibrates and reboots.&nbsp; Upon the reboot, look over your text history one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no progress is made I would like to know the following.&nbsp; If anyone&nbsp;else has had the same experience, please post here with the requested details and any tips if you were able to resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of your phone.</li><li>Current OS version.</li><li>Current firmware revision.</li><li>Country you are located in.</li><li>Regional setting of your phone.</li><li>Language setting of your phone.</li><li>Speech setting of your phone.</li><li>Did you last create this back up when your phone was on 8.0 or 8.1?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>Customization Themes - the look of Windows and its icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorbitol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customization Themes - the look of Windows and its icons</h2>
                    <div>Hey! the German News-Channel "N-TV" is moaning about the design of the Icons of Win10 and saying "allegedly" a lot of other testers of Win10 TP do too...<br />
<br />
I do not necessarily agree nor disagree to that...... but maybe a suggestion:<br />
<br />
Many apps nowadays&nbsp;have custom applicable designs and themes, meaning it would change the complete look of it and its icons.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;And in&nbsp;Windows it was always the case so far that&nbsp;you could always choose your own icon for a certain programm.
</div>
<div>How about this: <br />
<br />
<strong>Theme change in sense of that you can make your Windows look like an older Windows Version (e. g. like Win3.1 or WinME or WinXP)<br />
<br />
</strong>I do not mean by that, that Windows 10 should be changing the look itself.<br />
<br />
Even if it was just the icons it would be a bit interesting..... that way maybe&nbsp;some of the&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(from above)&nbsp;would&nbsp;be 'satisfied` because they will find their favourite icons again from their most favorite Windows-Version.
</div>
<div>And that had another&nbsp;good fact that would boost&nbsp;Windows:&nbsp;It would make younger people be able to make a small kind of "travel" through the history of Windows.
<br />
<br />
Remember: people who this year become 18 years old, do not know anything anymore about the Windows-Systems beyond 2000/XP!!</div>
<div>Also imagine how cool that would be, if you had a mobile Windows looking like an oldskool Windows ^^</div>
