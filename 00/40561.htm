            <div>There is no amount of troubleshooting that has helped others with this issue</div>
<div>(and sadly there are lots of others with this problem). Your only real option is</div>
<div>to exchange, which currently is $450 out of warranty. If you are in the US, you</div>
<div>should go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store</div>
<div><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations</a> - outside the US,</div>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<h3> te33er  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lips for Xbox one</h2>
                    Could someone please tell me if lips will be made available for Xbox one. I have all the disks and so many dlc songs. I find it very strange that this hasn't been carried over seeing as ps4 has continued the sing star platform. I feel very gutted as I
 (we) absolutely love this game as it certainly gets the the party started. If someone could shed some light that would be great. P.s. The servers that have been shut down is there any chance of these re opening????

    <title>Xbox Live Gold Refund or Credit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niteboi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Refund or Credit</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I purchased the Xbox Live Gold 3 Month subscription for $24.99, the same day it was cancelled and I was suppose to be getting a refund to use it towards the discounted Xbox Live Gold 3 Month they had at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still wanted to play online so I used my reward points to purchase an Xbox Live Gift Card for $10. With that gift card, I got the Xbox Live 1 Month subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, the refund team refunded me the $9.99 I used for the 1 month instead of 3 month for $24.99. I attempted to let them know that via email since that is the only communication I know of to contact them but no response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I contact Xbox live support via phone they tell me to put in a refund request since they have no power to give out refunds. This is my third time putting in a request and being denied since they refunded the incorrect subscription and based off
 the Microsoft Terms of Sale I can only be refunded once every year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't understand how I'm getting short end of the stick when the refund team made the mistake and even the phone representative stated that I never used the Xbox Live Gold 3 Month subscription since it was cancelled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this situation would be great, even if I'm not refunded the money, should I not be able to get a credit on my Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for the help.<br />

            This seems to be highly unfortunate, hopefully it gets sorted out, if you have contacted support that many times and been denied its quite the possibility that this is a lost cause and I apologize for the loss and time spent trying to fix it, maybe you
 could just ask for credit of the difference in lost $

                    My PC was automatically updated with the Anniversary update for Windows 10. &nbsp;I began receiving the crashing issues and my PC would return to a boot screen. &nbsp;I followed instructions provided by MSFT to return to a previous version of Windows 10. &nbsp;It worked.
 &nbsp;Crashes have stopped. &nbsp;Windows Update decided to try and install the new update, again, I disabled the automatically restart machine feature, and the update gave me a failure status, will try again later. &nbsp;I go to try and launch some games from Steam and
 they say Preparing for Launch and then do nothing. &nbsp;Steam Games that still launch are games like Arma3 and Fall of the Titanic (i know lame, but kids like it), &nbsp;DayZ does not launch. &nbsp;It says Preparing for launch in 2nd Steam Window and in Main Steam it says
 &nbsp;"DayZ - Running", then briefly I see "DayZ- Synching", then nothing. &nbsp;I uninstalled DayZ and reinstalled and this did not work. &nbsp;Any recommendations? I saw another thre

<h2>            KB4503286 causing odd problems with Lenovo Yoga connected to CalDigit Dock - sleep or power related</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 920 connected via thunderbolt to a CalDigit dock.&nbsp; Normally, I start the PC with lid open in order to start "Thunderbolt* Software".&nbsp; I typically have to start the program, then right click in the system tray and "Manage approved devices"
 in order for the CalDigit dock to be recognized.&nbsp; Once I have done these steps I am able to use the wireless mouse and wired keyboard connected to the dock.&nbsp; At this point I close the lid on the Yoga which always causes the PC to enter "Tablet Mode" in the
 notification center.&nbsp; At this point I simply turn off tablet mode and use the PC as a desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the update&nbsp;KB4503286 installed I have problems.&nbsp; Once I have booted up the PC and close the lid the monitor displays in "Tablet Mode" as usual, but but neither the devices connected to the dock or the trackpad and keyboard on the laptop are functional.&nbsp;
 The PC is completely frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially checked the power plan options thinking "choose what happens when you close the lid" had changed, but it has not.&nbsp; The selected option is still "Do Nothing".&nbsp; None of the power settings have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with the update installed, when the PC goes to sleep it will not wake up.&nbsp; The power indicator is still on, but it won't wake.&nbsp; At this point I have to hold in the power button until the power goes off and then turn it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I uninstall this update all these problems disappear.</p>

            Hi gc168170
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There are two actions which I can recommend. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h3> minivama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows says &#34;A network cable is unplugged&#34; after clean install, but it&#39;s not__</h2>
                    (I apologize in advance for the length of this message - I just wanted to include as much info as possible)<br />
<br />
I clean-installed Windows XP SP1 (from an OEM disk) onto a new hard disk yesterday, and immediately upgraded from SP1 directly to SP3.<br />
<br />
I have a cable internet connection through a Netgear router. Modem connects to the router input, computers connect to the router outputs. Other computers are connected to the router and they're working fine so I know the router or connection aren't causing
 this problem.<br />
<br />
I can switch back to my old hard drive with the original installation of Windows XP SP2 and the internet works fine, exactly as before, so I know the cables are functioning and the PCI card is seated correctly.<br />
<br />
It has to be something inside the new Windows installation that's causing this problem, I just don't know what or where to look.<br />
<br />
Once the XP installation and update to SP3 finished on the new drive, I installed drivers for my sound card and then installed Zonealarm firewall (although I hadn't connected the ethernet cable yet).<br />
<br />
I didn't install any of the drivers for the motherboard or chipset. I don't know if that matters? XP would be using the default ones it already has, right? All of the other components connected to the motherboard that I tested seem to be working (integrated
 USB hub on the front of the case, Sound Blaster Audigy soundcard and its front hub work fine after installing the drivers). I'm trying to duplicate my old setup as closley as possible and I'm not sure the chipset/motherboard drivers were ever actually loaded
 - is there any way to check?<br />
<br />
There are two ethernet ports on my system - one on the motherboard, the other a PCI card.<br />
<br />
In Device Manager, the ethernet port on the motherboard is VIA PCI 10/100mb Fast Ethernet Adapter.<br />
<br />
The addon is D-Link DGE-530T Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.<br />
<br />
I have always used the D-Link port. I can't remember why the people who built my computer added the D-Link card, but someone told me the VIA ethernet/audio driver has been known not to work well and that's probably why they did it.<br />
<br />
Both ethernet ports show up as Local Area Connections under "LAN or High Speed Internet" in "Network Connections".<br />
<br />
I'd rather use the D-Link adapter versus the integrated VIA one since I've used up till now and know it works.<br />
<br />
However, when I connect the ethernet cable to the D-Link port when booted onto the new HD with XP SP3, it lights up but Windows says "A network cable is unplugged". I updated the D-Link driver to the latest version, but that didn't fix it. (Also, the driver
 on the old HDD with the original XP installation, which I'm actually using to post this message, has the same older driver (v. 6.23) that the new installation had before I updated it, so it should have worked fine without needing an update.)<br />
<br />
When Windows prompted for the disk to install the original D-Link drivers, it said the adapter had "failed Windows logo testing". Does that matter? I know it works with Windows XP - I've been using it for years (under SP1 and SP2, not SP3). (The same thing
 happened when I installed the Sound Blaster Audigy drivers, but again, I've been using the SB for years, and it seems to work fine on the new installation regardlessl.)<br />
<br />
There are diagnostic tests in the Properties of the D-Link; it can successfully test the cable it's connected to, but Windows still says a cable is unplugged. (The cable test also says there's a short in two of the "cable pairs" - what does that mean? I know
 the cable works though.) I can also run the tool that tests the linkup and it makes the light on the port flash, so I know the computer can access the port.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens when I plug the cable from the modem (which normally goes into the router) directly into the D-Link port--it says a cable is unplugged, but the diagnostic tool is still able to test the cable. (However, in this case it says there's an
 "impedance mismatch" in one of the cable pairs along with the two shorts. Again, I know the cable is functioning - I'm using it to post this message.)<br />
<br />
I'd rather not attempt to install any drivers from the CDs that came with my motherboard because it's an 8-year-old board and I don't want to mess it up? I suspect they aren't installed on the old HDD I'm using now either (under Device Manager "System board"
 says "No drivers are installed for this device" - is that the motherboard?)<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice on why the D-Link would be reporting a cable is unplugged when no cables are unplugged? Are there any specific devices in Device Manager I should be looking at? I don't see any yellow exclamation points. Should I try uninstalling
 SP3 and go back to SP1 and see if it makes a difference?<br />
<br />
When I set up the new XP installation I gave the computer a different name from what it's called on the old HD. Should that make a difference? Should I have used the same name?<br />
<br />
As for the integrated VIA Ethernet port on the motherboard, it does something different. When I plug in the cable, it takes a long time but eventually says it's successful at acquiring a Network Address. At that point, in Network Connections it says it's connected
 (at 100mb/s), but I can't get on the internet. Do I have to do something else to make to work? Set up an Internet Connection? Would I need to restart for it to even work? (I didn't) Or should it just work?<br />
<br />
Also, the VIA port is set to acquire network address automatically (just like the D-Link is on the old installation). On the old installation, the IP address the D-Link acquires is a local one (192.168.1.5). On the new one, the VIA port it gets an address I've
 never seen before, which is also different from the static IP address of my modem.<br />
<br />
My primary concern is getting the D-Link working, but if I can get the VIA one working at least I might be able to use the internet on the new HDD and not have to switch back and forth between the old and new drives (I'm afraid of damaging the IDE cable by
 repeated plugging and unplugging it).<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there's any other information I need to post. And again, I'm sorry this message is so long!

<p>I'm so sorry but you've gone through a lot of troubleshooting work for nothing. After you install an operating system you must then install drivers for all your hardware. This includes the motherboard (chipset), network adapters, video, audio. Normally you
 start with the chipset. The problems you are experiencing are because you haven't installed the drivers. There may be a few basic drivers for your hardware that are included in XP but not always. As you have found out.</p>
<p>Since you apparently don't have a branded OEM machine (Dell, HP, etc.) you would need to go to the motherboard mftr.'s website and download/install the latest drivers for that particular motherboard. You would not use the ones on the CD since they are quite
 old UNLESS there are no current drivers available for your very old board. In that case you WOULD need to install the drivers from CD.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can see if the chipset drivers are installed on my old installation? I think they may not be (hence my questions) - under Device Manager &gt; System devices, many of the entries say "No drivers are installed for this device", including "System
 Board". My old installation works fine so I was trying to duplicate it as closely as possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the company that made my board (Chaintech) doesn't make motherboards anymore and removed the section for them from their website several years ago.</p>

<p>If you are having difficulties with your hardware, it's most probably because you don't have drivers. The only way to see if you have drivers installed on the other hard drive is to boot into Windows from it. Or it might just be that your 8-year-old motherboard,
 which gave you valiant service for many years, is ready for replacement. :-(</p>
<p>BTW, the "failed logo testing" isn't really important. It just means that the drivers are very old and/or weren't submitted to Microsoft to be certified. This doesn't matter in a 32-bit OS like what you have, only in 64-bit OSes.</p>

I can use my old HD with old XP installation just fine, it behaves exactly as it always has (internet connection and all). There's no indication anything is wrong with the CPU or Motherboard. I am almost positive the chipset drivers were never installed on
 the old HD's XP installation and it has worked fine for five years.</p>
<p>However, on the new HD with the new XP installation, I went ahead and uninstalled the the sound card drivers and D-Link drivers I had previously installed. On restart, XP sees the D-Link card and prompts to install drivers. I canceled that and installed
 the "VIA Service Pack" that came with my motherboard, which includes the VIA 4-in1 Driver package. (I assume that's the "chipset drivers"?) Then I installed the D-Link drivers again.</p>
<p>The icon that says "A network cable is unplugged" shows up in the system tray, but when I plug the cable in nothing happens. Exactly as before, it still says "A network cable is unplugged" even after I plug the cable in. I can test the cable and it sees
 the first two cable pairs (I'm not sure what that means?), and the light on the post is lit up.</p>
<p>Again, in my old HD installation the D-Link port works perfectly and I can get on the internet with no trouble. I can literally swap the Molex and IDE cables onto the old hard drive, turn on the computer and it works perfectly. So I know for a fact all the
 cables are working and the card is seated correctly. I can switch back and forth between the new and old hard drives, and the D-Link continues to function on the old one, but not on the new one.</p>
<p>I forgot something - when I install the d-link drivers, after it completes it says:</p>
<p>"D-Link Network Installation Package has been successfully installed.</p>
<p>"The installation started an asynchronous "Scan for new hardware" operation by the Plug and Play manager to bind new drivers to currently removed adapters, i.e. adapters not bound to a driver.</p>
<p>"This operation doesn't run under the control of the installation program. You can exit the installation program while the operation is still in progress.</p>

<p>Hi minivama,</p>
<p>You simply forgot to disabled the Onboard Via Ethernet Port Adapter, in the new operating system's installation. That's why you get a Cable is unplugged, but you are still online. You are always going to get that message, until you disable the Ethernet Port
 in either the Computer Bios or Device Manager.</p>
<p>You are using D-Link Ethernet Adapter, are you not, for Internet access?</p>

 Port in either the Computer Bios or Device Manager.<br />
<br />
I was never online in the new installation. There were two "Network cable is unplugged" warnings in the system tray, one for the VIA port and one for the D-Link. When I plugged the cable into the D-Link port, there were still two "cable is unplugged" warnings.<br />
<br />
After I installed the D-Link drivers like I said in my last post, I restarted the computer and was then able to get on the internet through the D-Link. However, when I installed the drivers for my Sound Blaster Audigy PCI sound card and restarted the computer,
 the sound card worked by the "network cable is unplugged" error returned and once again I wasn't able to get on the internet. I disabled the B Audigy and restarted the computer, and the D-Link internet connection worked again. So I couldn't have both the sound
 and the D-Link working at the same time. I assume it's a driver incompatibility problem, but I don't know where to look?<br />
<br />
Also, at some point (either right before or right after installing the SB Audigy drivers, I'm not sure) Windows said "found new hardware" and prompted me to let it install the drivers for a PCI controller or something (I can't remember the exact name) and I
 let it.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it's because of that or because of the Audigy but now the USB ports don't work. There are six, two in back and four on an mobo-integrated hub in front. When I plug a card reader or external drive into one of the ports, it says "unknown hardware",
 that it "malfunctioned", and it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
This is extremely frustarting, because, again, I can switch back to my old hard drive and everything still works perfectly.<br />

            Sorry but I don't know. If it were me and I'd just installed the OS, I think I'd do another clean install and then immediately afterward install the drivers. Maybe someone else will have the solution for you. I'm sorry I was unable to help.

<p>Hi minivama,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Switch back to your old Hard Drive.</p>
<p>Install the BelArc Advisor 8.1m and do a printout of its output.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switch back to your new Hard Drive, unless you have room and the connections to operate with two Hard Drives. You can use BootIt NG to boot between both Hard Drives.</p>
<p>Do a printout from the new Hard Drive and compare both.</p>
<p>Also, it may not be a conflict, but a conflict in Interrupts assigned by the operating system or Computer Bios. Go into Computer Bios and check the Interrupt Assignments. You can also disable the OnBoard Ethernet LAN Adapter which may help.</p>

            I'm having the same problem. Keep getting, "network cable is unplugged". I installed a new nic with drivers thinking this would be the cure. Imagine my surprise when the same error message kept popping up. I went through ALL the steps and nothing cured
 this problem so I reformatted the drive,(clean install), and this hasn't worked either. OS = XP Connected through router, modem combo, DSL. Late one night recently thought I read something about it might be malware\adware on the device. hope someone can help.
 Connection really sucks when it's only on fer a few secounds at a time.

<h2>            My new white battery wont charge.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have a problem with my brand new white Play and Charge kit.</p>
<p>First, i had a problem which i solved by myself. I put the battery in my white wireless controller, and it charged for about 5 seconds, then it stopped.</p>
<p>Finally, it started to charge, when put in my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there is the problem : My pc had to restart. I restarted it, so the battery stopped charging for a moment.Now, it doesn't want to charge, whatever i do, it charges for about 5 seconds, then the light on the P&amp;C cable turns green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should i do to charge my battery?</p>
<p>I tried every method i found in the Internet.</p>
<p>TL;DR: What should i do with my battery to charge it, if the first charging was interrupted?</p>

    <title>Problem with the new keyboard language switching menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jugand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with the new keyboard language switching menu</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
So I've upgraded to the 1903 win 10 version and I've had an encounter with one of the new features - the menu that lets you switch between keyboard&nbsp; languages when you hold Alt + LShift. The main problem is that this menu pops up in games and it is really annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I could stop that menu from showing, but keep my keyboard combination to switch between languages?</p>
                </div>

<p><span>Hi Jugan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The default keyboard shortcut to switch between system language is by pressing the
<strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Spacebar</strong> keys.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you don't want the language menu to appear while playing the game, then I suggest you to change keyboard shortcut by following the below steps and change the keyboard shortcuts for changing
 the system language or keyboard language.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>
Typing</strong> from the left pane.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Scroll down and click on <strong>Advanced keyboard settings</strong> and click on
<strong>Input language hot keys</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the <strong>Advanced Key Settings</strong> tab, you will find the key sequences for the input languages that you can change as your preference.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

            First of all thank you for the reply!<br />
<br />
The problem however is that holding the Alt + Shift key combination <strong>does the same thing
</strong>as Windows + Spacebar combination.<br />
<br />
I've already tried switching the <strong>input </strong><strong>languages </strong>
key combination (from Alt + Shift to another one from the list) before posting this question, but ultimately it poses the same problem - when holding the new key combination it still opens the same language switching menu.<br />
<br />
Alt + Shift key combination has been in Windows for a long long time and I don't really want to change it because of that menu (not that I have a lot of key combination choices in the provided menu).<br />
<br />
So basically, from what I understand, I am offered two choices - either change the keys in the game or change the default language switching combination as there is no way to prevent this menu from showing, or there is a third choice?

<p>Hi Jugan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are absolutely correct. You either need to change the combination keys within the game or language combination keys from Windows Settings as there is no third option to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Alt + Shift key combinations interfere in the game, then changing these combinations in Language Settings should not interfere in the game and you need to choose some other key combinations for the Language change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you not to change anything within the game, just change the key combinations in the language settings and you will not face this issue while playing the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to contact us back, in case you have any other questions/issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>Xbox One only reads &#34;oil-slick&#34; patterned discs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One only reads &#34;oil-slick&#34; patterned discs</h2>
                    <p>Hey all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of late I've noticed that my console has only been reading certain game discs. I've been wanting to play one of the games that was not being recognized, so I decided to dig into the issue further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blu-ray movies and certain game discs work just fine - I hear the drive spin up the disc and start reading right when I insert the disc. Other games simply do not get recognized at all - the drive begins to spin, and then stops. It tries a few more times,
 starting and stopping, before giving up for good. No errors are presented. </p>
<p>I figured the lens may have just been dirty, so I bought a lens cleaning disc. It is an audio CD, so I downloaded the CD player app, but am unable to skip to the "cleaning track" of the CD due to the disc not being recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On further investigation, the only game discs that are being recognized are ones that show a distinct, rainbow, oil-slick like pattern on their reflective side. This pattern can't be seen in daylight, but under the lightbulbs of my bedroom it becomes very
 apparent. Just in case it is worth anything, two of the working games with this pattern on the back include Battlefield 4 and Far Cry 4, while two of the non-working games are Final Fantasy Type-0 and Dragon's Dogma. The difference in disc pattern can be seen
 here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/YEKNXCA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/YEKNXCA</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my "oil-slick" games work just fine without fail, while the others (Xbox 360 backwards-compatible games included) are never recognized by the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for already attempted solutions following the laser lens cleaner disc, I have also:
</p>
<p>• changed the power options of the console</p>
<p>• hard power cycled the console</p>
<p>• reset the OS back to factory settings</p>
<p>• held onto the discs during insertion until the drive attempts to pull harder, then released<br />
</p>
<p>all to no avail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you fine people recommend? Anything else I should try out before ordering a replacement optical drive? Perhaps some settings I could fiddle with? Thanks for any suggestions in advance.</p>

                    Not sure when this quite happened, but I am unable to use my camera I have built in my MSI Apache pro. Its one of the newest MSI gaming&nbsp;laptops out there with an i7 processor. Ive been hearing that antivirus software sometimes block the usage of the camera.
 I'm thinking ever since windows defender was installed on to my laptop, that may have had something to do with my camera. I followed the steps and disabled windows defender and still nothing. I cant even update or roll back the camera driver because it doesn't
 appear in Device Manager. Can someone help me solve this issue??

                    <p>Original title: Cannot repair WinXP Pro to startup.</p>
<p>I has just added more RAM to the PC and the BIOS accepts new RAM, then when the system boots on by WinXP Pro it says PCI.sys is missing and wants me to hit R for Repair, &nbsp;After I put In Win CD and reboot the system, the system is loading up to Kernel and
 everything stops. &nbsp;What should I do? &nbsp;I prefer to generate a bootable CD that starts up into Safe Mode. &nbsp;Please kindly help. &nbsp;Note that I had no backup CD for System Recovery.

            I am having the same problem. &nbsp;All of my updates disappeared at one point and I lost the history. &nbsp;My Update Installer is saying to do updates NEVER when in reality it is set to download and install updates automatically. &nbsp;If anyone can help with this

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Based on the information you have provided, I understand that you too get a Windows update error 8007000D. Sorry for the delayed response. I would suggest you to run the Fix-it in the following article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components</a>? If the Fix-it does not resolve the issue then try the steps under 'Let me Fix-it myself'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, refer the steps suggested by Irfan H in the following <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_update/error-8007000d-on-update-kb938371/f6f38577-35a5-4ed4-a41c-15531b0597e4">
thread</a> which discussess a similar issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps.</p>

                    <p>Anyone else having problems with connection to co-op games. I send my US friends invite to my game (UK/EU) and after so long I get kicked out due to connection lost but when they invite me to their games I don’t get kicked out. I’ve just started the game so we all want to play on my game to help&nbsp;level up and get to where they are on their games but getting annoyed at being kicked out all the time can be from a minute to 10 minutes of gameplay before I’m kicked. How’s do I fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Compatible IR blaster for windows 7 MCE&#63;  &#40;64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    I am looking for an IR blaster for windows 7 64 bit. <br />
<br />
I want to allow media center to control my comcast DTA so media center can change the channel for scheduled recordings.<br />
<br />
I am having trouble finding an online listing for a remote-IR blaster combo that explicitly states it is win7 compatible<br />
<br />
Setup: <br />
Comcast DTA to avermedia USB TV tuner <br />
&nbsp;(this works fine, but mediacenter sees the tv tuner as always tuned to channel 4, since I have no IR controller that MCE recognizes)<br />
<br />
windows 7 64bit <br />
<br />
I have an MCE compatible remote (adesso ARC 1100) but no IR blaster&nbsp; - I am resigned to the possibility that I may need to buy another remote with an IR blaster bundled with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />

            Most people have either cable or satellite feeds, which use their own remote devices.&nbsp; There will never be more than one channel fed into the PC.&nbsp; Being forced to have an unused IR device installed is clearly a failure on Microsoft's part.&nbsp; Please let
 us know when this design failure will be fixed to match the setup for basically every potential user.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

<div>Can a IR blaster connected via MCE IR receiver control an A/V receiver?</div>

<p>wrong.&nbsp; I "upgraded" to W7 from XP and now WMC won't detect the IR blaster.&nbsp; Also tried a new W7 machine.&nbsp; Same problem.&nbsp; Have been trying for DAYS reading everything I can find on google and NOTHING works.&nbsp; Unbelievably frustrating!&nbsp; Am afraid to keep poring

            <p>Sorry to hear about your troubles. WMC is still the best platform out there for&nbsp;use with protected content via&nbsp;cable card and DVR, even though it is started to feel a bit aged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how new or old your MOBO is but, I've read that with the new systems, they are not required to carry support for the integrated hardware that is needed for the IR to work. This is obviously because MS has dropped the requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that help give you some clues as to way your having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a sad state of affairs, I will be with MCE till the wheels fall off!</p>

<h2>            MY PC won&#39;t recognize my printer anymore</h2>
                    &nbsp;I tried to use my printer yesterday for the first time in months (I had finally bought some ink). &nbsp;But my Windows 8.1 wouldn't recognize my printer. &nbsp;I even went manually to add my printer to my PC and it still wouldn't go to print when I pressed print.
 &nbsp;I have a HP Deskjet 3520. &nbsp;I went to Control Panel and it couldn't find my printer. &nbsp;I had disconnected the usb once, and thought maybe that was it. &nbsp;I tried to reboot it. &nbsp;But that wouldn't work either. When I went to print, the printer didn't receive the
 signal. &nbsp;I hope this is enough information. Any Ideas?

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done the above, you then need to run the driver file downloaded from HP. At no point should you be using the Windows 'add printer' function. The driver installation takes care of that..
