<h2>            Error sound out of nowhere</h2>
                    So as recently as 2 days ago I started hearing this error sound every 15-30 minutes or so.There is no pop-up or error code or anything,nothing is malfunctioning,just an error sound out of the blue.I can't see why that would happen,it's not an important
 issue,I'm just curios if that happened to anyone else and how they fixed it (if they fixed it).By the way,the OS is Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate your concern, we would like to ask which application are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For possible resolution, we suggest that you perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 Also, it helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, an update, or when you run a program in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Absolutely no application - just out of nowhere,as simple as that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Chrome? - error sound</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leaving the pc open with absolutely no program open? - error sound</p>
<p>
</p><p>Playing some random game? - error sound</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Weirdest thing that happened to me,really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Never had a software conflict as far as I know,and as far as updates know,I have no idea.Thing happened a week or more after the last Windows Update I have made.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS &#34;STACKED&#34; &#38; WINDOWS &#34;SIDE-BY-SIDE&#34; ISSUE</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Task Bar issue in displaying open windows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click Task Bar and choosing "Show windows stacked" works as expected, stacks the open windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choosing "Show windows side by side" produces the same result, i.e. stacks the open windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may recognize, windows "side by side" is most convenient when dealing with multiple windows with large number of folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions for a fix appreciated.</p>

    <title>Refresh Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Centre - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabirafrin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refresh Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Centre</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know this question is outdated but I am stuck up and could not find the relevant suggestions to resolve the issue. I had a Windows 7 preinstalled on my laptop and when the offer to upgrade to windows 8 pro was announced I was amongst the first few who
 immediately upgraded to windows 8 pro and then as a special offer i was also offered the windows media center to activate. I would like to confirm that I do have the mail where in the product key of windows 8.1 Pro 64 Bit and windows media center. After the
 upgrade barring a few hiccups there was no problem at all. Then when the windows 8.1 pro was available on the windows store I again upgraded to windows 8.1 pro. After the install my new configuration was Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But immediately after upgrade I realized that the refresh option in account and recovery was not working. It always prompted me that certain files are missing and I should insert the media. But I never downloaded an ISO image of Windows 8 Pro nor do I have
 a media of windows 8.1 pro because of the way in which I had been upgraded to windows 8.1 Pro with Media Centre. anyways I just overlooked the issue and never bothered about it seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But Offlate I realize that my computer has slowed down considerably. I tried the option of deleting Temp files, clearing Prefetch, scan /sfc, defragmenting etc etc. But nothing seems to work. Suddenly I also realize that while booting I am getting a Blue
 Screen with the message that Critical Process Died Blue Screen Error. Sometimes I just get a comd prompt with message tp press Press Ctrl Alt del and then some message about some problem in external media connected failure... I never took a snapshot of the
 same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now can&nbsp;you tell me how to go about:---</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to refresh windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center without any media. I only have the windows 8 Pro and Media Center Key separately.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; If there is no way to refresh windows 8.1 Pro without Media </strong>
then</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; How to download genuine Windows 8.1 Pro media with the key of Windows 8 Pro from Microsoft site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What If I download windows 8 Pro Media and then try to refresh windows 8.1 Pro? Will it work????</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I download Windows 8 Pro and then reinstall on my laptop running windows 8.1 Pro will it do a clean install?? what happens to the Sony Vaio Care which came preinstalled on my PC???? What about the Bios which has been
 upgraded on my PC??? I checked the Sony Vaio site and found that It has not released and drivers for Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;or Windows 8.1 Pro. Sony has only released the updates for Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro. So after clean install from where will the drivers
 for Bios, Graphic Card, Ethernet driver, Bluetooth Drivers, Wireless LAN Driver, SATA driver, Memory Card Reader, Vaio Care Driver, Vaio Control Center, Rescue Data, Notebook Utilities, Vaio Update, Vaio Gate, Quick Web Access, Vaio Smart Network, ME Driver,
 etc etc....</p>
<p>(c )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to address the ISsue of Blue Screen?</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What to do if I get the Message of Press Control Alt Del again and It refuses to boot... Keeps coming back to the same menu again and again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if tech wizards would care to guide me to address the issue. Any attempt to reply back in highly technical terms without the step by step guides is likely to confuse me further.. So a request you to keep it simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But a simple thought crossed my mind </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “<strong>Why did Microsoft complicate the issue so much.... Why couldn't they keep the Product key of Windows 8 and windows 8.1 same for anyone to download the windows 8.1 pro directly and refresh the PC</strong>”</p>

<p>Note I have attempted a refresh and reset&nbsp;of a&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;.iso&nbsp;on a VM with&nbsp;Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Centre&nbsp;installed and it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A refresh with only installation media (and not a refresh image) however will refresh your Windows system files with generic installation files which will not include your OEM system drivers. The Windows files will be replaced with fresh Windows installation
 files from the installation media but the documents and settings will remain. As the system drivers aren't present on the Windows installation media so will need to be reinstalled. The&nbsp;BIOS update is&nbsp;firmware and never gets wiped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to reinstall the drivers/updates offered by Sony.</p>

</p><p>You can use the Skype application to initiate a group video call. Take note that&nbsp;video calling&nbsp;can accommodate 10 participants including the initiator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have the Skype application, you can download it from the Skype website @
<em><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a></em></p>

However, Adaptec only supplies a Windows 7 32bit version of the drivers:<br />

    <title>System crash during video playback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuigg  say:</h3>
<h2>            System crash during video playback</h2>
                    I have x64 bit vista home premium, it was working fine for about a year after purchase but then it started crashing randomly during video playback, i have essentially replaced the computer part by part to fix the problem but nothing helped.<br />
<br />
Currently I am using geforce 9800 gtx with latest drivers as video card and for everything else for that matter<br />
Using CCCP as a codecs to play videos<br />
Using Zoom player as a player, the crashes are not affected by the player, I'm crashing just the same on windows media<br />
<br />
Computer freezes up at random times it can be days(no freezes for days) or seconds(under 20 seconds after starting to play video) between freezes. My screen goes either black or freezes the image, sound either dissapears or runs for a few seconds after the
 video freezes and then just cramps up.<br />
<br />
I am not sure it it is software or hardware issue or even both<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on it for me plese<br />
<br />
Much appreciated<br />

            &nbsp;Hello Yuigg,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Community Forum.<br />
<br />
Does your computer only crash when playing a video or in Windows Media Player?<br />
Do&nbsp; you get any errors or just a hang or freeze?<br />
It really sounds like a driver issue. <br />
<br />
Nvidia has a new driver as of March 3rd, not sure if&nbsp;you have this one.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/winvista_x64_182.08_whql.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/winvista_x64_182.08_whql.html</a><br />
If you do not have this version, please download and install the current driver version.<br />
<br />
If you already have the current version, then it would be helpful running a clean boot to
<br />
see if there are any third party software or programs that might be interferring.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps in the article below to see if we can determine if there is a problem with other programs.<br />

<h2>            Transfer Number From Skype To Skype For Business</h2>
                    <p>I want to transfer a Skype (non-business) number to Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using Port Order in **** Admin to do this but I cannot work out what to put in the Account Number field on the Port Order form, as Skype (non-business) does not have an Account Number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to make this transfer, please?&nbsp; If so, what should I use as the Account Number in the Port Order?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help on this.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I generally use a lot of sub folders when working with files, so normally have a file window open with a log of open file branches. It makes
 it easier to work among different file types, etc.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the update to Windows 10 I've noticed an extremely frustrating change, one I couldn't find any answer (or existence) for online.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The folders are fine, but as soon as I plug in and remove either an external drive or flash drive, all the open file structures (in windows
 that weren't related to the removed drive) collapse. I end up having to reopen all the folder branches.</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Anyone else get this???</span><br />

I have a HP Envy desktop, that is my own personal home system. Not sure if that's what you meant by local/Microsoft account.<br />
<br />
I ran both scans, with zero negative results.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've run across several other people that have the same problem. Please take note, it happens every time I remove a flash drive or removable hard drive.&nbsp;<br />

            Apologies for not responding for such a long time. I had some issues getting to the bios.<br />
<br />
The issue persists in safe mode, and continues to plague my experience with windows. Though it doesn't effect the system operations, it's a huge issue in the way I use my system, and wastes a lot of time.
<br />
<br />
Was really hoping to find some more info, if not a resolution.

            Couldn't replicate it here so probably it'll only be 'fixed' for you if/when you ever decide to reinstall the OS (preferably a clean install). Till then I suppose you'll just have to live with it.<br />

            <p>Hello Francis LEE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having trouble with switching the camera of Surface Pro 3 while using particular apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you notice this happening across all apps that use the camera, or just these webconference apps?</p>
<p>Are you seeing any error codes or messages?</p>
<p>Do both cameras work as expected with first party apps?</p>
<p>Have you contacted the developer of this software as well?</p>
<p>

<h2>            My Gave Saves Are Not Available</h2>
                    
<div>So I was playing Deus Ex earlier today, about 5 hours in altogether. Just tried playing it again, got to the main menu and the load bar is red and wont let me click it. No resume or load options, just new game. I went back to dashboard,
 checked my hard drive and it lists my multiple autosaves and manual saves still in the harddrive, i'm still signed in as the same gamertag and i still cannot access my saved game. At this point I really dont want to have to go through it all over again. I
 even made sure to manually save before turning off my xbox. Help ?</div>

<div>-Also my girlfriend beat the game on her own tag, I checked and her saves are still there and working, how can I fix this???</div>

                </div>

<p>When you load up the game does it ask you to select a storage device. It sounds to me as though the game may be looking in the wrong place for the saves. The only other thing I could think of would be not being able to connect to the Cloud if you have it
 setup but in that case you should still be able to access your local saves.</p>

<p>I did think of that but I disabled the cloud a few weeks ago before I started even playing because I never used it. The only other option I have is my harddrive thats already hooked up and displays the saves when I look in storage through dashboard.</p>

<p>Edit: For some more information I just tried starting over and when I first died, the game won't let me reload from my last checkpoint. So apparently it wont save files for me anymore or let me make new ones. The only option available is exit to main menu.</p>

<p>I can't think of anything that would specifically cause this issue but there are a few things you could try.</p>
<p>Try starting a new game on a different gamertag, if the issue persists then the issue would seem to be game based if it doesn't then there is either an issue with your saves specifically or possibly your tag.</p>
<p>If you couldn't save and load games on a new tag then I'd start by clearing your cache and redownloading the latest update, I'd also try and load your games again before getting the update as that result may be relevant to future troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>If a new tag did solve the problem then try downloading your profile again. If you still have no luck come on back and I'll see if there's anything else I can think of that might help out.</p>

<p>I just signed in with a different gamertag with no game data for this game and the load button was instantly available despite me never even playing with it. It seems to be only affecting my gamertag. I cleared my cache and tried with and without the update
 but that did not work either.</p>

<p>That's all the obvious suggestions out of the way and the only other thing I can think of at this point would be to have a look through Ubisoft's support forums for the game to see if any similar issues have been reported. Sorry I couldn't be of more help
 to you.</p>

<h2>            Status &#34;Seen days ago&#34;, can&#39;t receive messages.</h2>
                    Hello, for the past couple weeks Skype has been broken for my best friend. On her end everything looks normal, but on my end her status has been stuck as "Last seen days ago" and she can't receive any messages. Logging in and out will show the recently
 received messages, but only those, and any sent after logging in will once again fail to be seen. She can send messages to me without any issues, but the other way around no longer works. She's tried reinstalling, updating, nothing seems to be working. I've
 also uninstalled and updated to no avail.

<p>I need to know the definition of PC "ideling".</p>
<p>for example, does it include "Lock screen"? or "sleep'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;or is it just the time between not touching you mouse or keyboard until it goes to sleep?</p>
<p>&nbsp;please help me out!</p>

            <p><span>Hi reiminamida,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Communities. The computer enters idle mode if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Users have not interacted with it for a period of ten minutes.</span> </li><li><span>If in the same time period the processor and hard drive utilization has been idle as well for at least 90% of the time.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The computer is considered to be idle by Windows if there has not been user interaction via the mouse or keyboard for a given time and if the hard drives and processors have been idle more than 90% of that time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Task Scheduler in Windows 7 for instance considers the computer to be idle if the above states returned true for a period of ten minutes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There are a few exceptions to that rule. Applications may set a flag that prevents the computer from idle mode. Another possibility is low priority processes that may be ignored by the Windows 7 Task Scheduler. But that appears to be a Windows 7 only
 rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows app can&#39;t run on your PC</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP ENVY 700 PC with windows 8.1. </p>
<p>I get the following messages whenever my computer wants to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(We Couldn't complete the updates Getting ready to retry Don't turn off your computer)</p>
<p>It does not say what updates were not completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after a few minutes my desktop appears with another message (I tried to copy and paste but no success)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Black box with no words in the body but at the top C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>and a blue bar across the entire screen that says "This app can't run on your PC" To find a version for your PC, check with the software publisher." Then at the bottom right of the blue bar is a close button.</p>
<p>I don't know if the 2 are related or not because after a half hour or so the same black box appears and I just close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not impact or stop me from using my computer when i close it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not successful when I tried to update to windows 10 and have no clue if that is the reason for this error.</p>
<p>I need guidance to get this to stop please.</p>

<h2>            Redirect loop when trying to create xbox account for a child microsoft.com family member</h2>
                    <p>Initially described this issue in&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/580573D4-237E-467F-B0A7-10FC2A99E668?page=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/580573D4-237E-467F-B0A7-10FC2A99E668?page=4</a> and reposting here by request from&nbsp;Misses Quinzel...</p>
<p>Hopefully this'll make sense and help point to the root of the problem. We don't have an Xbox or a Windows 10 PC. We have a few iPads and my kids love Minecraft. I was trying to get them configured with an xbox account so that we can try our Minecraft realms that would allow them to play with their friends. Here is what I did:<br />
- Set up&nbsp;<a href="http://microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;accounts for both of my children&nbsp;and have them joined to my "family" in my microsoft account.<br />
- Set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com</a>&nbsp;account for myself (MingledMoney630)<br />
- Through Minecraft on ipad tried setting up one of the kids with xbox account. I believe this was completed because we got as far as picking a gamer tag for one of the kids (AwesomeSocks105)<br />
- Minecraft wouldn't let him join or start a new realm referring to "privacy and safety settings" in xbox account.<br />
- Trying to view privacy and safety settings on the computer for his account, kept redirecting to my account (probably because i am the adult). But his gamer tag was not visible under my profile on&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com</a>, only on&nbsp;<a href="http://microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;in the Family section.<br />
- I spoke with support and they referred me to this thread (<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/580573D4-237E-467F-B0A7-10FC2A99E668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/580573D4-237E-467F-B0A7-10FC2A99E668</a>). Sounds like the above is a known issue and there is a manual workaround that someone is using. All i needed was to get the second kid set up with a gamer tag and post both of those&nbsp;on that forum<br />
- Tried setting up the second child's&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com</a>&nbsp;account by going through the web, no ipad like the first time around. After a few steps the browser gets into an endless redirect loop, not letting me actually get to the place where i can pick a gamer tag. Tried different browser, different device, even doing this on ipad. This made no difference. At this point can't get the second kid set up with a xbox.com account at all.<br />
- At this point noticed that even going to my own&nbsp;<a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com</a>&nbsp;account and clicking on Privacy in my profile would respond with an error below. I have been able to view this page earlier.&nbsp;:</p>
It appears you've found a glitch in the system. Please try again later.

Have you used multiple browsers (for your account specifically, I see you did for your second child's account)?

Something is up with your son's account, and there was an error in creating the Xbox account for some reason. While it's not common, I have seen it before. I also believe something happened with this that "broke" your account and that's why it's not loading the privacy settings anymore; basically, I think that your son's broken account being linked to yours is preventing you from loading the privacy settings page <strong>because</strong> his account is broken. This is speculation based on correlation and I&nbsp;really cannot confirm that this is the case.</p><p><br /></p><p>The downside: I have no way to fix it myself.

<h2>            How to change install location for windows store &#40;for large games&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I downloaded Rise of the Tomb Raider that was somewhere in the area of a whopping 24 gigs.&nbsp; That is and isn't a problem.&nbsp; The way I have my computer is that I have a SSD for my operating system, which is 250 Gigs, and then a 1 TB WD 10k&nbsp;velociraptor
 spinning hard drive for my programs and games.&nbsp; I would like to install this game to my WD HDD, but I cant find the option too, so it automatically downloads and installs to my Solid State Drive.&nbsp; I hate to use up the space on my Solid State Hard Drive.&nbsp; Can
 I change this? Particularly for this game seeing its size.&nbsp; If I can't change this, then maybe you guys at MS should think about adding this feature, because there are a lot of gamers that use a separate drive for there program installs, especially large ones..&nbsp;
</p>

            Hi Raju,
<div>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to tell you that the playback controls will not go away if you move the mouse off the video. You need to leave the mouse, motionless, sitting over the video (yes, covering part of the video), then the mouse and controls will disappear in a
 few seconds. As you have checked the "auto hide" feature, which is default. If you move the mouse anywhere off of the video or totally off screen the controls come back and stay until you move the mouse back over the video. Also, autohide controls only work
 in full screen mode.</div>

<div>Thank you for replying.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry to know that methods suggested earlier did not help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to start the computer in clean boot to check if any third party program is responsible for not letting controls to disappear after specific period of time.
<div>To start your computer in clean boot, refer the following link:</div>
<div>
<div>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</div>

    <title>Lifetime ban with no reason behind it &#33; HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmiika-&#91;xboxvenue&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lifetime ban with no reason behind it &#33; HELP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />So everything started when I got my communication ban this week. I made a Case Review about it to see the reasoning behind it and when I went to see response, I saw that I was banned till year 9999. Thats when I totally flipped out, I didnt believe my eyes, and I hoped it was a bug.</p>

<p>I have been " Avoid Me" reputation for about 4 months now because of report abuse. Rainbow Six Siege has been the only game where I have been able to find any games. So I've been playing R6 only.</p>

<p>Now the tricky part comes: R6 has only 2 playlists: Ranked and Casual (unranked). I have the highest rank in the game (Diamond) and I mainly play Casual (where team of diamonds can match up against party of beginners). R6 is game where is ton of little things that matter and "nerdy" stuff what you can do when you practice a lot that beginners cannot. Skill cap in that game is very huge.</p>

<p>In R6 theres a thing called spawn peeking (Defender runs outside to kill Attackers from spawn. Defenders will have 3 sec timer counting down when they are outside before Attackers will see them with outlines: like wallhack, and the screen is red and there is a text: You are detected); which is totally legit and fair but it can be annoying when you get spawn killed beginning in the round and then have to wait like 4mins spectating. However beginners feel like its against the rules when they got killed like that and I've got TONS of messages saying: Reported, because of that. Sometimes the whole enemy team Reports me and let me know that they did with messages like that.</p>

<p>And theres the snowball effect; I have reputation: "Avoid Me" and the only way to get it up is to play games. And when I play, I get reported again, almost every game. Me and my friends think that they do that sometimes only because they see I have a bad rep and they know what that does to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had similar case last summer when I was playing Halo 5 with my friend. There was new playlist called social Doubles(unranked) and we grinded that like 4 weeks straight. When we started I had good rep, but after 4 weeks my friend had rep: (Needs work) and I had: (Avoid Me). Guess why? We won like 120+ games straight. We never sent any messages to anyone. We didnt even need to. We won all the games, we had fun. Untill I got that rep and couldnt play anymore.</p>

<p>This is so wrong. Microsoft banned the wrong innocent guy. I've always been competitive and emotional player but I have never been cheating in any way, yelling at game chat or trolling or whatever. But I've sent stupid messages sometimes and got banned because of it and I have learned my lesson. But this is so wrong. This is unfairest thing I've ever witnessed. I'm NOT that guy who does not belong to Xbox LIVE. I have 8-9 years behind that account (Gt:Miq) and thousands of money spent. And I have done nothing wrong, but winning games and played games how it is made and developed.</p>

<p>I hope this get attention and Justice is made. I dont deserve this suspension. If my gamestyle in games annoys enemy team it should not be the reason why I have life time suspension. Overally snd after all I have always been really nice guy in Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p>My suspended gamertag: Miq<br />Please Help me!</p>

            I am having the same trouble with a Surface Pro II. I can ctrl,alt,del and open Task Manager. I also see the Host Process for Setting Synchr.... running at high cpu. I can open other programs by using the start new task function and browsing to a program
 file. Most things run - like Control Panel, Device Manager, etc but the keyboard doesn't work. I've tried the screen keyboard, a usb keyboard, and the Surface keyboard.

<h2>            HOW TO SWITCH OFF THE AUTO SWITCHING OFF OF MICROSOFT WIRED KEYBOARD 200 IN WINDOWS 10&#63;</h2>
                    HELLO EVERYONE!!! I have a huge problem with my new WIRED KEYBOARD 200 (Microsoft) , because it is switching off while i am playing online games and because i am pressing a button for more than 5-6 seconds.....As you can understand i was killed 10000 times
 because my character was for example still running etc .....and the only reason is that my keyboard was switched off accidentally by holding down a button........My english is not so good but i think you understand my problem.......... Thank you in advance!!!

<h2>            Software for Watching Movies</h2>
                    
<p>Have a couple of sites to watch movies online. The sites require that to watch the movies you have to install&nbsp;a<strong>DivX Web Player</strong>, I downloaded a DivX web player from&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://www.divx.com/en</span>&nbsp;which
 downloads:</p>
<p><strong>DivX Plus Converter Trial</strong>&nbsp;software to: <strong>(Transfer To: DVD</strong><strong>Player, Blu-ray Player, Tv and PlayStation 3)</strong>. It works with converting online movies,&nbsp;at this time however I just want to use&nbsp;a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DivX
 Web Player</span> software to watch movies, also wondering if&nbsp;their are any other&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DivX Web Player</span> software sites&nbsp;that you recommend&nbsp;to download software to watch movies.</p>

            I have solved the problem.&nbsp; A program called "Constant Guard" was the problem.&nbsp; When I removed Constant Guard form my computer, the problem was gone and my cursor is now normal.&nbsp; A local computer technician informed me of this solution.&nbsp; Comcast has been
 distributing this program to its subscribers along with Norton.&nbsp; I have kept Norton and that is OK.

<h2>            EA account problems</h2>
                    
<p>I recently have found out that I have a problem concerning my EA account. I went to try to connect my gamertag with my ea account and it said it was already in use. I contacted the EA support and I either needed to provided the email address which it had
 been assigned to, or the correct date of birth. Well, I cannot seem to locate or be able to figure out or remember what this other email address was, and apparently I entered in my birth date incorrectly, and therefore they cannot verify my identification
 and won't do anything to change my account or to cancel it. So what I want to know is there anything on this end that I could do with XBOX to disconnect my gamertag from my EA account, so that I can reconnect it to one that I actually know. I did also try
 changing my gamertag, didn't work.</p>
