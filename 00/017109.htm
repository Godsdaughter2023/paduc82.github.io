    <title>Can&#39;t run Internet Explorer after what seemed like a successful - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry bank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t run Internet Explorer after what seemed like a successful installation</h2>
                    Even though I mostly use FireFox, sometimes I need IE.&nbsp; I had been using 7, but decided to update to 8.&nbsp; I assume the installation was successful, but I can't be sure.&nbsp; For a big company such as Microsoft the installation was oddly uninformative.&nbsp; It did
 various things that took a long time and then asked for a restart which I did.&nbsp; Surprisingly it did not create a desktop icon, nor an entry on the start menu.&nbsp; I did manage to locate a new version of IExplorer.exe (version 7.00.6000.17099).&nbsp; When I try to
 run it <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">nothing</span> happens.&nbsp; I have tried to run it via a shortcut that I created.&nbsp; I opened the properties window using the shortcut and then used the "find target" option and then right clicking
 on IExplorer.exe and choosing open.&nbsp; One time it opened a help file, but mostly it doesn't do anything.<br />
<br />
Even though I am an old guy (72), I have been using computers for over fifty years, and was even a professional programmer in the old days, so I am not daunted by the computer.&nbsp; However, it has been my experience that "new and improved" versions of software
 while usually new are rarely improved.&nbsp; Usually features that neither need nor want are added, along with bugs.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

            <p>Please answer <em>all of the following diagnostic questions</em> by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you install AVG (Free, I assume)?</p>
<p>1b. Why is MalwareBytes' AntiMalware (MBAM) installed? Has MBAM ever detected &amp; removed anything?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed AVG</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed AVG?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; PCTools Optimiser; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>7. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> (or a clean install) of WinXP for any reason? </p>
<p>8. Finally, open Add/Remove Programs &amp; make sure the Show Updates box at the top is checked. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2570947, <em>KB2607712 and/or KB2616676</em>; KB2559049, KB2567680, KB2393802 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as "Security Update for Windows XP" followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed, two will be displayed as "Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8" followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>

            1a.&nbsp; I don't recall.&nbsp; The exe file is dated 9/1/11, but that was probably because of an update.&nbsp; The folder than contains it is dated 11/10/10.&nbsp; However, I have two other avg folders dating back to 2009, but they are both empty, having only an empty log
 folder in eacy.<br />
1b.&nbsp; Someone installed it on my computer.&nbsp; I can't recall it ever having removed or detected anything.<br />
2.&nbsp; AVG is the only virus program&nbsp; I have used in XP.&nbsp; I previously was using Win98 and used Avast.&nbsp;
<br />
3.&nbsp; I had Norton in the Win98 partition.<br />
4.&nbsp; Nothing came on the computer pre-installed.<br />
5.&nbsp; I generally use Firefox, but some sites don't work quite properly with it so I like having IE as a backup.<br />
6.&nbsp; No.<br />
7.&nbsp; No.<br />
8.&nbsp; Yes I have all of the updates.&nbsp; I could wish that the Add/Remove Programs would give a true alphabetical listing, since finding all the updates was a bit difficult (small type).<br />
<br />
The reason I went from Win98 to XP was because too many websites no longer worked with IE6, and that was the only IE I could use in Win98.&nbsp; I am hesitant to install any other browsers, such as Chrome and Opera because I don't want to needlessly complicate things.<br />

<p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The computer come with Win98 preinstalled and you later did a clean install of WinXP on a separate partition; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp;The computer come with Win98 preinstalled then you later&nbsp;upgraded to WinXP.</p>
<p>3. If your answer&nbsp;to #2 above is (b) =&gt; Is the Win98 partition still present?</p>
<p>4a. Was IE7 working OK before you upgraded to IE8?</p>
<p>4b. Assuming you can open IE8, does it work OK? [1]</p>
<p>5. When (approx. date) did you upgrade to IE8? </p>
<p>6. Is&nbsp;<strong>Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> listed in Add/Remove Programs? [2]</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\<em><strong>IEXPLORE.EXE</strong> &lt;=this file
</em></p>
<p>Select <strong>PROPERTIES | VERSION</strong> (tab): What version is displayed here (e.g., v8.0.1234.56)?</p>
<p>8a. Which was installed first, <em>IE7</em> or SP3?</p>
<p>8b. Which was installed first, <em>IE7</em> or Firefox?</p>
<p>=====================================================<br />
[1] IN RE the missing IE8 desktop icon, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945402</a> </p>
<p>[2] Once IE8 is installed, you cannot "overinstall" IE7. You can, however, <em>
uninstall</em> IE8 via Add/Remove Programs; doing so would automatically restore the previous IE version (e.g., IE7 or IE6) upon reboot.</p>

            1.&nbsp; 10/2006<br />
2.&nbsp; The computer came as a dual boot machine (98 and XP).&nbsp; It was made to my specs.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Win98 partition is present, but I suspect that Windows 98 has gotten corrupted.&nbsp; However, the partition contains lots data and even some programs that I use.<br />
4a.&nbsp; It was working, but I couldn't access the "Internet Options" of the Tools menu item.&nbsp; Something flashed for a moment and then was gone.<br />
4b.&nbsp; I placed an icon on my desktop, but nothing happens either when I use the shortcut or when I open the program from Windows Explorer.&nbsp; It just sits there.<br />
5.&nbsp; Just a few days ago.&nbsp; I did it twice, after uninstalling the first time, I reinstalled it.<br />
6.&nbsp; Yes, it is listed, but with no install date!<br />
7.&nbsp; The version is 7.0.6000.17099<br />
8a.&nbsp; I really don't know.&nbsp; SP3 has no install date.<br />
8b.&nbsp; I believe it was Firefox.&nbsp; I seem to remember that I upgraded IE 6 to IE 7 while using FireFox.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.&nbsp; <br />

            I only recently was able to try again to get IE 8 working.&nbsp; Nothing that was suggested got working.&nbsp; I can access the Internet Options, but nothing there seems to help.<br />
<br />
I decided to look at what I have in the way of iexplorer.exe.&nbsp; I have many versions of it.&nbsp; The latest that I downloaded (6/20/2011)&nbsp; has a version # 7.00.6000.17099.&nbsp; I find it suspect that what is supposed to be IE8 should be 7.something, but that may be
 OK.<br />
<br />
I am stymied.&nbsp; Any advice would be welcome!<br />

    <title>Remove picture from Figures Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outdoorsteve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove picture from Figures Table</h2>
                    <p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>1. I have a picture somehow showing in the middle of my Table of Figures.&nbsp; When I go to the Table of Figures and click on the picture to delete it, it jumps to the page where the picture is.&nbsp; The picture is fine, BUT certainly I do not want to see a picture
 in my Table of Figures.&nbsp; How can I get rid of the picture in the Table of Figures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have made significant cut and pastes in my large docment.&nbsp; For example, Figure 146 was once located on page 280, and I then moved the section, including picture, to where the Figure number should have changed to Figure 1.&nbsp; The picture is relocated properly
 in the Table of Figures, but still has Figure 146 showing in the caption, when it should have been Figure 1. How do I update my Table of Figures with the Figure numbers also being re-numbered?</p>

            In addition to what Stefan has said, if the Table of Figures is based on the figure captions, it's possible that one of your figures has gotten inside the bookmark for the caption. See

<h2>            Open a New word dpcument from within Access 2010</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I have a need to regularly create new documents for customers, relating to their properties. All new documents are create in Word 2010. Once created, the documents are saved to the "documents" folder.
<br />
From within access I can bring up a form that filters my customer table to show me all documents relating to that customer only, and by clicking a thumbnail image on the form I can open the actual document.<br />
What I would like to do is add 3 buttons to this form which would open a word 2010 and immediately show the required blank template (rental agreement, pre-sales agreement, service agreement.). I can get the buttons to open Word without any problem, but don't
 know how to show the specific blank template associated with the button clicked.
<br />
Has anybody any idea how to accomplish this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Eleanna<br />

    <title>Is there a way to queue files for downloading&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmmccoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to queue files for downloading&#63;</h2>
                    I often want to download multiple files but I don't like the way IE tries to bring everything down at the same time. Most of the time the files I download are around half a GB and when the throughput is divided among them, the process takes that much long
 and is more likely to fail. I'd much rather the system to bring down a file or two at a time. It would be more likely to complete at least some files rather than dying with most incomplete.&nbsp; Is there some kind of add-on that would give IE11 a queuing function?

            <p>Hello Richard, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank You for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you are trying to manage the download&nbsp;through Internet Explorer. So, please refer to the suggestions that might help.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Actually, It is not possible to queue files for downloading. However as a work around you can use the Download manager in Internt explorer. This will list down the download files which&nbsp;you are downloading. In that&nbsp;you can pause the downloads whenever required
 so that you can proceed with the other downloads.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Also&nbsp;refer to this link below:</strong></div>

            <p>I understand the concept of pausing downloads but there are a number of problems inherent in that approach. First, it is not automatic. You can queue up twenty files and start three downloading but someone has to take action to begin downloading more files
 once the first ones have completed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Second, the pausing of files is extremely prone to error. Often the file will not restart and if that happens the file will have to be re-queued. I have also stopped files that were in mid-download and when I tried to restart them they had to start from
 zero. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous that in this day and age of automation that files can't be queued; however, I did have another thought. Could the files be prioritized? Files with a high priority would be about to use up to one-quarter of the available throughput, the
 next priority would get a little less, and so on that the line. All the files would be downloading at the same time but giving some a higher rating would be a de facto queuing system. Is there anyway that could be added on?</p>

            His not the only one, mostly Android has this, but not anywhere on PC...pause and click...Users need the Services to be in there hands. Not being able to automate even down to a download is a bit sad for Microsoft, even down to the fact it tells me something
 can not be done with this or that app being open...but no option to open it or if the wifi is off it wouldn't ask you or give you the option connecting like UC Browser, nope it instead wants you to check the website you typed is correct

<h2>            Auto-scroll in Word starter&#63;</h2>
                    I want to create a document that can be read using auto-scroll, ie the page slowly scrolls down automatically.<br />
Can that be done in Word Starter, or only in full-priced versions of Word?<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>I don't know the answer (I don't have Word 2010 Starter) but it should be easy enough to find out:</p>
<p>Click the middle mouse button or mouse wheel.</p>
<p>If auto-scroll is enabled, the mouse pointer should change to a black dot with upwards and downwards pointing triangles.</p>
<p>Move the mouse pointer slightly upwards or downwards to auto-scroll through the document.</p>
<p>The further you move the mouse pointer, the faster the document will scroll.</p>
<p>When you have found a comfortable speed, leave the mouse pointer where it is.</p>
<p>To stop auto-scrolling, click the left mouse-button or press Esc.</p>

            The QAT is the toolbar at the left end of the title bar of the Outlook window, just to the right of the Outlook icon.&nbsp; You can place than above the ribbon in its default position, or below the ribbon by clicking the down arrow at its right end and choosing
 "Show Below (or Above) the Ribbon".&nbsp; The Navigation Pane view buttons at the bottom of the Navigation Pane do not constitute the Quick Access Toolbar and they cannot be moved.&nbsp; They can be expanded into stacked buttons or compressed into a single icon row,
 but that's it.

<h2>            Images when zooming a page in publisher</h2>
                    Hello, is there any way to set publisher so that when I zoom in on a page say to 400% or 800%, that it does not filter the images on the page and leaves them pixelated?

+1 for "higher resolution image".<br />
<br />
Raster images...jpg, .png, .tif, .bmp, etc...will pixelate if scaled <br />
to a large enough size.<br />
<br />
Vector graphics...WMF clipart for example...will not pixelate.<br />

            By filtering I mean like this.<br />
<br />
I took a screenshot of the star on this page and put it in publisher.<br />
<br />
If you zoom the page in word or publisher to 800% then this is what you see<br />
<br />
http://www.freeimagehosting.net/x3q1r<br />
<br />
You can see it is filtered, it has had a bilinear or bicubic filter or something applied to it so it looks smoother and blurry rather than pixelated.<br />
<br />
What I want it to do is look like this<br />
<br />
http://www.freeimagehosting.net/pl9fb<br />
<br />
You can see the image is clearly pixelated by the giant square pixels compared to the zoomed page in publisher (since I did a nearest neighbour resize on it in photoshop to make sure it was pixelated).<br />
<br />
I want those big sharp jagged pixels when I zoom in on the page instead of the smoother but blurry looking pixels from the bicubic filter or whatever it is getting applied.<br />
<br />
Older versions of office it looked big and pixelated like the second pic when you zoomed in on the page, but this version seems to filter the image when you zoom so it doesn't look as pixelated.<br />

            I can see what you are talking about but I still don't understand why it is an issue. Again, why do you want to zoom in at 800%?<br />
<br />
Did you read Volunteer J's answer about vector graphics vs raster graphics? It would seem to answer your question.<br />

            I want to know the exact measurement of some distances between images I have in the documents.<br />
<br />
I want them accurate to 1/10 of a mm so i'm zooming in to 800% and placing guides on the edges of each image to measure the distance. Naturally I want the guides exactly on the edge of the pixels to measure to this degree.<br />
<br />
With the filtering as I zoom in, it's difficult to tell whether you are exactly on the edge of of a pixel or not since they arn't sharp from the filtering. If it's nice and pixelated when I zoom in then I can easily line up guides exactly on the edge of the
 pixels I want to measure from.<br />
<br />
EDIT: So here is the exact situation i'm using it in.<br />
<br />
In my physics class we do periodic assessments where we are given something and we have to analyse it, so do calculations etc to answer some questions.<br />
<br />
In the next few weeks one will be on projectile motion. We'll be given a print out of a strobe photo of a projectile in motion and we have to answer some questions on it. This will involve measuring some distances and performing calculations on them to work
 or what is asked.<br />
<br />
Most people will just grab a ruler and measure the distances but obviously if the distance between the edge of the projectile in one location and another rests just before the 30mm mark you can't really tell if it's 29.95, 29.96 29.97mm etc.<br />
<br />
There is a workstation in the lab and we can use the original digital photo if we want. The system basically just has office on it. Since zooming in in word or publisher also increases the division on the scale of the ruler it's easier to more accurately measure
 to these small amounts.<br />
<br />
Some of the questions we have to answer are things like:<br />
* Are you results any more accurate then the others who undertook the task?<br />
* Why are your results more accurate?<br />
<br />
So obviously measuring the distance in publisher with a scale that's more graduated (and even telling you the position of the cursor between graduations i the corner) will be more accurate than measuring a paper image with a ruler so i'd say my results are
 more accurate because of that.<br />
<br />
I know that some of the other people will also have the same idea and use publisher to measure as well however i'm pretty sure they wouldn't be thinking about the image being filtered as this is the only version of office they have used.<br />
<br />
So I could go on to say my results are also more accurate than people who also used the same method I did, as by having the image pixelated when zoomed in instead of filtered, I was able to more accurately determine where the edge of the projectile was each
 time.<br />
<br />
Of course, if there is no way to disable the filtering and have a pixelated image then I am unable to do that and will have to stick with just guessing where the exact edge is on the filtered image.<br />
<br />
I don't "need" to be able to have the image pixelated and it won't be "much" more accurate, however the task is about how to obtain the most accurate result and anything more accurate is still more accurate so if I'm able to do it then I may as well.<br />
<br />
In this case vector images have nothing to do with it since we are anyalsing a raster image, and in trying to prevent the image from pixelating anyway. I actually want it to be pixelated.<br />

<br />
Hence why I want to know if there is anyway to disable the filtering when you zoom so I can do it slightly more accurately.<br />

            <blockquote>I want to know the exact measurement of some distances between images I have in the documents.<br />
<br />
I want them accurate to 1/10 of a mm so i'm zooming in to 800% and placing guides on the edges of each image to measure the distance. Naturally I want the guides exactly on the edge of the pixels to measure to this degree.<br />
<br />
With the filtering as I zoom in, it's difficult to tell whether you are exactly on the edge of of a pixel or not since they arn't sharp from the filtering. If it's nice and pixelated when I zoom in then I can easily line up guides exactly on the edge of the
 pixels I want to measure from.<br />
<br />
EDIT: So here is the exact situation i'm using it in.<br />
<br />
In my physics class we do periodic assessments where we are given something and we have to analyse it, so do calculations etc to answer some questions.<br />
<br />
In the next few weeks one will be on projectile motion. We'll be given a print out of a strobe photo of a projectile in motion and we have to answer some questions on it. This will involve measuring some distances and performing calculations on them to work
 or what is asked.<br />
<br />
Most people will just grab a ruler and measure the distances but obviously if the distance between the edge of the projectile in one location and another rests just before the 30mm mark you can't really tell if it's 29.95, 29.96 29.97mm etc.<br />
<br />
There is a workstation in the lab and we can use the original digital photo if we want. The system basically just has office on it. Since zooming in in word or publisher also increases the division on the scale of the ruler it's easier to more accurately measure
 to these small amounts.<br />
<br />
Some of the questions we have to answer are things like:<br />
* Are you results any more accurate then the others who undertook the task?<br />
* Why are your results more accurate?<br />
<br />
So obviously measuring the distance in publisher with a scale that's more graduated (and even telling you the position of the cursor between graduations i the corner) will be more accurate than measuring a paper image with a ruler so i'd say my results are
 more accurate because of that.<br />
<br />
I know that some of the other people will also have the same idea and use publisher to measure as well however i'm pretty sure they wouldn't be thinking about the image being filtered as this is the only version of office they have used.<br />
<br />
So I could go on to say my results are also more accurate than people who also used the same method I did, as by having the image pixelated when zoomed in instead of filtered, I was able to more accurately determine where the edge of the projectile was each
 time.<br />
<br />
Of course, if there is no way to disable the filtering and have a pixelated image then I am unable to do that and will have to stick with just guessing where the exact edge is on the filtered image.<br />
<br />
I don't "need" to be able to have the image pixelated and it won't be "much" more accurate, however the task is about how to obtain the most accurate result and anything more accurate is still more accurate so if I'm able to do it then I may as well.<br />
<br />
In this case vector images have nothing to do with it since we are anyalsing a raster image, and in trying to prevent the image from pixelating anyway. I actually want it to be pixelated.<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
A very interesting approach and use of Publisher. Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I think 'vector images' does affect this issue as I believe that Publisher converts images to vector images when inserted. I could be wrong but I know that when you produce html code from Publisher the html coding engine uses VML or vector markup language
 and converts all the images into both a vml version of the inserted image for use by IE and another image for use by all non IE browsers. This is what leads me to believe that your raster image is converted when you insert it and you have no choice in the
 matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure there is a good solution or workaround. Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 with a Military CAC card on a MAC</h2>
                    <p>Ok everyone, I recently got Outlook 2016 and I was hoping to connect it with my cac card so I can access my email at home. Can anyone help me make this thing work? lol I put my email in, made sure the certificate was infact the email one, but the servers
 allude me, and I cant make it connect with <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
pop.us.army.mil or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">mailrouter.us.army.mil.&nbsp;</span>I use the Outlook Web app just fine, but even the settings in that wont tell me the POP, IMAP, or other servers it uses, it just says N/A, so I cant
 even attempt to piggy back off of that. If anyone that has gotten this combination of cac card use on a MAC with Outlook to work, Id really appreciate the help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for anyone that has suggestions!!<br />

            As I stated in my question, I have a Mac computer. Not a PC, and not Windows. Which also means I dont have Internet Explorer. And my certs work fine, Ive been using my CAC reader for 2 years with no issues. I just cant get Microsoft Outlook to work for
 some reason. I cant copy what any of that says because no part of what that is, is what I need. Thank you for trying to be helpful.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did Windows Hello work in previous build?</p>
<p>- When you say "where I have to set up reminders from my iPhone instead of using the PC", what exactly are you referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello, part of <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, is a new way to sign in to your devices, apps, online services, and networks. Windows Hello works with a credential technology called Microsoft Passport that’s easier, more convenient, and more secure than
 using a password, because it uses "biometric authentication"—you sign in with your face, iris, or fingerprint (or a PIN).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Devices with face sensors or fingerprint readers running
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> will work with Windows Hello. This completely depends on the hardware configuration and support of the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further info on Windows hello, you may refer the Microsoft article below.</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yes windows Hello worked fine and also the Cortana part is working great again...... I have a lenovo horizon 2s that was originally a windows 8.1 before I reverted it to windows 10 .I am thinking since I'm running preview versions of windows 10
 .....it may or may not be compatible with windows 10 once the final version comes out on July 29th......I do not have Microsoft passport, or can I use my face ,iris or fingerprint.....but I do use a four digit pin number to unlock my PC.....

<h2>            Creating Formulas&#40;like RTD call&#41; in cells programmatically</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I need to render RTD call into the Excel cells programatically. For example, writing =TODAY() for the excel to show today's date. I am able to get it working for most of the functions but not for the one I am interested in i.e. =<b>RTD(...)</b>. Whenever
 I try doing so, it throws a COM exception (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC).</div>
<div>I am using following code in my Excel workbook to do so.</div>
<div>Also, Please let me know how to distribute my completed Excel solution. Right now I am able to run it only through Visual Studio 2010 Debugger (i.e. by hitting F5). The project calls a WCF web service on hitting a ribbon button I created.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;// Call the Web service.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WCFServiceClient service = new&nbsp;WCFServiceClient();</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; VolumeData[] list = service.GetServiceDataObjects();</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (list != null &amp;&amp; list.Length != 0)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Set the range.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; range.RefersToR1C1 = String.Format("=R1C1:R{0}C5", list.Length);</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var oldCI = System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>//Setting the culture to en_US as suggested by many sites to resolve&nbsp;0x800A03EC error</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US");</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (int x = 0; x &lt; list.Length; x++)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int rowNum = x + 2;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Update data range, Excel uses 1 as the base for index.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; //This is where the runtime exception (0x800A03EC) occurs, dont worry about the obj1, obj2 and obj3 definition as the error occurs&nbsp;</div>

            I was finally able to render the RTD calls by using&nbsp;((Excel.Range)range.Cells[x + 2, 1]).<b>FormulaLocal
</b>instead of&nbsp;<span>((Excel.Range)range.Cells[x + 2, 1]).<b>Value.</b>&nbsp;However, I am facing another issue now. The formula renders #N/A when the initial load is done (i.e it doesn't renders
 any value) but it renders the values after the programmatically generated sheet is saved and then reopened.</span>
<div><span>Please let me know if anyone has faced similar issue earlier and know how to resolve. I shall be highly grateful.</span></div>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 email problems, need to know location of Draft&#40;this computer only&#41; File messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have tried everything that I can find so far to help fix the outlook 2016 mail problems I have had over the last week.&nbsp; Page down to *********** if you don't want to read the fluff of the problems I had to get to needing the location of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook was working fine for a couple weeks until a small Microsoft update was applied. I rolled everything back to the restore point before it was installed and outlook still didn't work. The error says "Microsoft outlook has stopped working" regardless
 of what profile I use on a regular start up. I have repaired the ost data files, repaired, as well as removed and reinstalled office, updated graphics drivers, Disabled hardware graphic acceleration setting in most of the office programs (ironically, this
 one won't take on outlook mail now but did before the reinstallation. The rest of the programs worked previously and still with, or without it), I also went into the graphics on the system and turned down office to having everything as performance versus quality
 based and even much more than that (COMS, OffCAT, registry, add ins, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's the thing, I added a new profile and it will only start in safe mode. Both the new and old do not start in regular mode. When I got irritated with this I resinstalled Windows Live Mail and just used the old files, NOT the outlook ones, the old
 live mail files AND Windows Live Mail was giving me consistent Recovering the database errors just like anyone that rolled back their system from Windows 10 to an earlier edition like I did. It made me wonder if there was a problem with outlook and rollbacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*********I have nearly given up on using Office 20sucksteen but I was wondering if anyone knows where the "Drafts(this computer only)" files are stored in Outlook 2016? At least If I had those back I can just use my laptop for email and purge the rest of
 the office garbage that clearly is useless to me now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me now if you have a good idea of where and how they are stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, CB </p>

            Thanks for replying. I removed and added back the add-ins the first time. I tried again with the new account I added after trying to repair it and reinstall it. It still does not start either account in regular mode and it still doesn't let me turn off
 Graphics acceleration for outlook mail and only the new account opens in safe mode.

<p>
</p><p>2) After not being able to access the original email set up, I copied the Entire Folder of outlook files twice to insure they do not get over written, then created a new email profile, and then added back in one email address in the new email profile (not
 the original one) to test if it would work. It is the profile email address that I can access right now only by using safe mode.

            <p>Well thanks for the attempt at helping Palcouk. Unfortunately removing Avast did not change anything. From here on out I will just never upgrade my OS when dealing with Microsoft due to this and many past issues with their crappy upgrades, that they claim
 will work based on computer specs, that they clearly have no knowledge of truly knowing it will work, but say it will all in their need to have other people's money. I will just buy a new computer with the new OS on it, if I really feel I need it, and I now
 am much more likely to try a Chrome computer as well as build a Linux system, so congrats on that one Microsoft. With your Windows 10 crap how many people did you turn into people more likely to try other OS and leave your platform? I'd bet it was easily in
 the tens of millions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And good to know about the data being in the data file you mentioned. I found a program that will allow me to view that data and hopefully the files didn't get corrupted so I can once and for all delete this Office 2016 crap.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much, CB</p>

            <p>I ended up being able to recover what I needed using Freeviewer. It's an OST file viewer and is free for the basic version and you can access the important files.</p>

<p>You're not alone. I've had this issue since RS2 began. First I couldn't join the homegroup at all, now I can join but none of my other computers can see my Insider PC.</p>

            <p>Try running the Homegroup Troubleshooter on the problem computer AND another one that is actively in the Homegroup. I have found that can resolve this problem. Also does your NETWORK see the computer and can you see other computers. If not Network Discovery
 may be off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is sad that the Homegroup MUST be setup after every time a new build is installed. VERY frustrating and I have left Feedback in the Feedback Hub numerous times to no avail !</p>

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with Skype and my Microsoft account. When I log into my Outlook email, Skype automatically logs me in and I don't want that to happen. I asked the Skype support about it but they said it is Microsoft issue. Does anyone know how to turn this
 feature off? I would like to be able to manually sign into Skype if I want to and not automatically as soon as I log into my email account. Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>The above solution doesn't last &nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the above advice several times.</p>
<p>The first attempt just kept giving me errors.&nbsp; So I waited a day, and tried it again, and this time it worked; I was unable to unlink my email from my Skype.</p>
<p>This made me have to log into my email again, but once in my email, clicking on the place where it shows as 'Available' or 'Invisible', instead showed 'Messenger unavailable.'</p>
<p>I was soooooooooo HAPPY&nbsp; \[&nbsp; ^0^]/</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was last night.</p>
<p>This morning however, leaving my email open and computer on, and not having changed ANYTHING!</p>
<p>Skype is not only BACK, but once again, shows me as 'AVAILABLE'!!!&nbsp; ['-.-___-.- ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening more and more!?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEVER use Skype!&nbsp; EVER!</p>
<p>I do NOT have it installed on my computer!</p>
<p>I am just using Firefox to sign into my hotmail email.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-How did you create and share the file?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have saved it on OneDrive and then shared it with the customers then whenever you make the changes in the file it would reflect to them if they refresh or re-open
 the files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the article below for more information.</span></p>

<p>The question is - google does it in real time and there is no need to sign in or refresh the page in oreder to see changes.</p>
<p>Does microsoft do the same? Or you need to refresh the page each time to see changes?</p>

    <title>Cell formatting does not move with Sorting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toydude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cell formatting does not move with Sorting</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to make the formatting of a cell stay with that cell when i sort a list of data?</p>
<p>IE:&nbsp; I have a price list that has item number, description, cost, and minimum pack.&nbsp; If I BOLD and BOLD OUTLINE the prices that have changed, then sort them by item number, the BOLD and BOLD OUTLINE stay in the actual cells, but the data moves to where it
 should be in the sort.&nbsp;&nbsp; This never happened in previous versions.....</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I looked for a setting but could not find anything.</p>

<p>In my experience, in all versions, borders stay put but Bold travels with the cell.<br />
Just tested in 2003, 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>Only if the border formatting was caused by conditional formatting based on the cell's value then I would expect it to travel with the cell.</p>

<h2>            PC Access to Phone Calendar and Apps Data Xfr When Changing Phones</h2>
                    <p>2 questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My Lumia 521 died and I am getting a Lumia 640. Until I get and configure it, can I access to the Calendar via my Windows PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When my new phone is configured will the apps and data be transferred to it? Automatically, or will I have to do it myself? I vaguely recall that there is some utility for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
