    <title>Surface Book Battery Drain while Powered Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> netwirejohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Battery Drain while Powered Off</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to share my experience with the constant battery issues on my Surface Book. I originally purchased the Surface Book back in November of 2016. I got the i5/256/DGPU version. I've realized when the Surface book is fully charged at 100% and when the
 Surface book is powered off the batteries drain on their own. I started to observe the behavior for a few months and consistently has gotten worse. I finally reached out to Microsoft support and they agreed the device was defective. They ended up replacing
 the laptop and yet again I'm observing the same issue. I can have the laptop charged to 100%. Shut down the Surface Book and leave it off and in about 24 hours 4% is drained leaving it at 96% upon boot up. The longer it is powered off the charged battery %
 continues to slowly discharge. I can't understand why it would discharge if it is powered completely off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reached out to Microsoft tech support again and they agree that the replacement unit is also defective. At this point being furious that I am I asked that my case be escalated. All Windows updates and firmware have had been applied to both affected systems.
 Could it be the hardware combo causing this issue?</p>

            I've contacted the Answer desk again today and didn't receive a response from my escalation I've requested. All they did was reinstall the system drivers and firmware which was already performed. It is either bad hardware or bad firmware causing this power
 drain/parasitic power draw while the Surface Book is powered off.

<p>Hi MN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fast startup does help with the keyboard backlight turning off properly when the Surface Book shuts down, but it continues to drain when its powered off.</p>

            My issues still persist and on my 3rd replacement. Called tech support and they advise they will escalate the case again. I never heard back from the original escalation of the case. At this point the issue appears to be a hardware defect as multiple replacements
 all exhibit the same problem even after the latest firmware updates. I called tech support again requesting that I get refunded as I spent close to a month back and forth without any real resolution besides replacing the Surface book multiple times and lack
 of response. This absolutely leaves a sour taste in my mouth as I was an early adopter of Microsoft products and even purchasing this Surface Book year after release and there are continuing issues it is not worth the money I've paid to have to go through
 hoops.

            Have tech support gotten back to you with a resolution yet? Mine suffers the same battery drain even when completely shutdown. Only reason why I haven't brought it back to the MS store yet is because I don't want them to give me the same answer as they
 did you which would completely waste everyone's time :)

<p>I have the same issue with my laptop. It seems like its a design/hardware issue since all of us have had the exact same problem. I wonder what percentage of Surface Books are affected and encounter this battery drain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean it's an issue that is only noticeable if you're paying close attention so I'd imagine a lot of Surface Book owners don't even realize they're laptops are defective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean who knows, Microsoft could know they have a hardware/design flaw in many of their Surface Books and are chosing to keep it under wraps so as to not have to replace everyones device. Which department at MS did you contact to go about replacing your
 laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I may actually look into this and see if its a common issue. If it is I smell class action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that if I undock the tablet from keyboard after shutdown the power drain is significantly less, so if I'm going to be leaving it unused for a few days I separate the tablet and keyboard. &nbsp;It's not ideal as both then become vulnerable to knocks and
 bumps., but at least I'll have enough juice to get some work done when I next power up, which isn't the case if I leave it docked.</p>

<p>You are fortunate to be able to get through to tech support.&nbsp; Their virtual support is a joke.&nbsp; Spent an entire afternoon &amp; evening when I finally got thru yesterday &amp; the download of new ios on other laptop finished when they were closed.&nbsp; Told me to call
 phone # w case # today &amp; when I try to book a call I'm told none available today to finish this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Battery never holds charge.&nbsp; Charging cord won't stay plugged in w/o duck tape otherwise it falls out.&nbsp; Its been reloaded 2x.&nbsp; Worst excuse for laptop ever.</p>
<p>Bought extended support but its useless when you cannot get through to a human being.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've tried numerous times but you need an entire day to sit &amp; wait.</p>

<h2>            Cortana opens by herself</h2>
                    <p>Anyone having this issue and know of a fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cortana opens by herself when ever she wants randomly, while typing, listening to music, watching Amazon Prime and even when not doing anything.</p>
<p>She pops up full screen with a black background and trying to find answers but struggles a there is no question. I can press close to get rid, but really while watching a show and she pops up is really annoying. And, nobody in the show/film (or music I listen
 too) said/sang "hey Cortana".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not use Cortana that much nor want to disable her... she must be felling neglected and want to get my attention.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

    <title>Bandwidth Limiting in Vista Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> autumnale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bandwidth Limiting in Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Is there any way to limit the amount of bandwidth that Vista Home Premium uses?&nbsp; I have a home network and one of the computers is running a P2P television viewing program from CCTV that likes to suck up ALLLLL of my upload.<br />
<br />
It makes the internet connection usable in all my other computers because using up the maximum allotted upload bandwidth with my ISP will cause the download to slow to a crawl.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if Vista has a built-in network bandwidth limiting or not.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if that sort of stuff were available.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            Autumnale,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Answers Beta Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloading programs like “P2P” usually have bandwidth limiting in the options or settings within the program. Vista will only let you turn off “Ports” via Firewall, but if a program is using that specific
 port then it will not connect online. There are many freeware programs that you can find that act as a bandwidth manager. You can find these programs by searching in your favorite search engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Please let u know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App - Outgoing mail being blocked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryceptor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App - Outgoing mail being blocked</h2>
                    <p>I have my mail.com account connected to Windows 10 Mail app and for some reason outgoing mail I'm sending to Craigslist addresses will be blocked during a conversation. Other addresses from Craigslist will be blocked immediately after a composing a message
 and they go to the drafts folder. I have to go resend them in my browser from mail.com&nbsp;in order for them to go through. All I know is that I'm getting an error and it must be a security setting in the App. Does anyone know how to fix this?

<p>
</p><p>Would you be able to provide us the complete error message that you're getting so we could further check?<br />
<br />
Have you checked if the Mail app is allowed through the firewall? <br />
<br />
Furthermore, make sure that your computer's anti-virus software is not interfering with execution of commands in the Mail app.<br />
<br />
We will keep an eye out for your update.<br />

    <title>Unable to load device driver error code 39 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wizardndog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to load device driver error code 39</h2>
                    
<p>original title: windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. the driver may be corrupted or missing. (code 39) This applies to the generic disk drives not the DVD drive</p>
<p>I am running windows vista service pack 2. For reasons unknown to me I got the error code 39 on my DVD drive AND my generic disk drives after a reboot. I unintalled the software I had just installed...didn't change a thing. Anyway, I was able to go into
 the the registry and delete the upper and lower device filters for the CDROM and now have my DVD drive back. I tried running System Restore and it won't work. It completes OK..but says it encountered an error so could not restore the system (this is regardless
 of what date I chose to restore to). This is the second time this error 39 has happened to me and a system restore fixed it the first time.&nbsp; My hard drive is listed in with the drives with the error 39, but doesn't have the same error, although it uses the
 same drivers. I know this is an issue with the registry...but I am Leary about deleting the limits filtering for the generic drives for fear of losing my hard drive. Now, my question is: if I remove the upper and lower filters for the disk drives and reboot,
 am I going to hose my hard drive?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You really need to be in the Vista Forums and not the Windows 7 Forums.</p>

<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windowsvista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/windowsvista</span></a><br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Code 39 means the driver is corrupt or missing.</p>
<p>Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which<br />
solves&nbsp;the issue. If you do these as listed you should not lose any drives. If you are concerned<br />
about making unwanted changes then create a Restore Point first so you can return to where<br />
you were.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />

<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<p>As you can see in the screenshot, there is a setting to change the product key. Just wondering what this is for because you can't use real windows. Maybe in the near future, we could install Windows 10 on ARM.</p>

<p>Sorry, meant to say product key.</p>
<p>I tried to install Windows 7 on it, and that didn't work either. Apparently, Windows RT is for ARM devices, and Surface RT cannot run other OS's, but if that is true, then why is there even an option to change it? My guess is that it is for Windows 10 on
 ARM, but who knows? </p>

</p><p>If the webcam is connected to the computer, then you can press Windows key + X, then click Device&nbsp;Manager. Then you can check if webcam is detected there. If yes then right click on it and select properties.

<h2>            Windows 10 explorer not searching for exact phrases</h2>
                    I had windows 10 in the past and did not have this problem. I recently purchased a new laptop, and I cannot get the file explorer to search for exact phrases. I have tried indexing, quotation marks, content: (phrase), running the troubleshooter, and changing
 file explorer search options. I cannot keep this laptop if this continues. Please help.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you searching File Explorer for phrases in Documents, as it will not search the web?  
<br />
<br />If so there is a Setting to check to search within contents of files in Indexing Options &gt; Advanced &gt; File Types tab.  Choose the file types you want searched inside and tick the box to Index Properties and File Contents.
<br />
<br />Also in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; Search tab tick the box to Always search file contents , Apply and Save.
<br />
<br />If this is the factory install on a new PC then we cannot eliminate the possibility that it's load of bloatware is interfering.  This is why most enthusiasts won't ever run a Factory install.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            How to roll back to Windows 7 from Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>initially, I upgraded from Win7 ultimate to win10. it would freeze every 5 minutes of use. after 5 days of troubleshooting every possible problem on the forums, I decided to rollback. Then my PC wouldn't run win7, couldn't even repair with the repair disk.
</p>
<p>And so, I choose to reinstall win10 as I have gone nowhere in my attempts to recover my beloved win7. All went smooth, my files from win 7 were in the windows.old file. This was less than 12 hours ago. This morning, I turned on the PC, get a message that
 all my files are here after the upgrade as windows is starting, only to find that they are not. So, I attempt to migrate them from the "old" file and all files are empty.</p>
<p>Where did they go? I was told they were here a few minutes prior and I had seen them just a few hours ago. How to I recover them<strong>?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Original title:</strong> windows 10 has now screwed me over twice</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing issues on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced upon upgrade to Windows 10 and I regrets the same.</p>
</span></span></span><span>
<p>
</p><p>You have only one month to retrieve most files from the <strong>Windows.old folder</strong>, beginning from the time you install, upgrade to, refresh, or reset Windows 10. After that time, most of the content of Windows.old is automatically deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to go through the below article and follow the steps given to roll back to previous version of Windows.</p>

<p>I would recommend a full uninstallation of the product from Programs and Features, as well as deleting any copies of the printer from the Device Manager or Printers and Faxes.
</p>

</p>
<p>Check the link mentioned below and see if it works. </p>

<h2>            &#42;&#42;New Armor Confirmed&#33;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>Somehow there is a hidden helmet on the disc... I have no idea how any of the modders and hackers haven't found it. Confirmed by bs Angel (Basically the new Frankie/Urk for 343i's) to be ON THE DISC. So that means it's encoded on to all the maps and will
 be usable everywhere. Makes you wonder how they've kept this hidden so long... And it also confirms that a hidden ending may still be in there somewhere. Looks like hackers in the gaming community aren't as good as they think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must say it looks freaking BA as well. Here's a pic of it along with the comparison to Marathons helmet -
<a href="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/7425/proofcs.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in regards to how it's unlocked, 343i's is holding the keys to that one. Along with the Helmet, there is a rumored Chest piece but I haven't seen pictures of it just yet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's bs Angel's comment about the armor... Read a little bit down and you can see it -
<a href="http://halo.xbox.com/forums/general/f/14/p/3087/19307.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I whole heartedly believe this will be a Halofest related event at the end of August or so. Along with that, the details for the Title Update will be released then too. It's also rumored that the helmet will be included in the Title Update and will unlock
 it. 343i's has also said we'll have to work for it so a Community Challenge will be in order!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know about you guys, but more content would be nice. Let's get another set of Forgetacular maps going! Along with that, we desperately need another Forge World. It's not anywhere near a huge issue, as I love the maps that have been added (Abridged
 is a personal favorite. The epitome of what Big Team Battle should be... lots of vehicles/power weapons. All out war!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>The new Forge World isn't for forging ourselves... It's playing on the maps the community makes that we get for free. I love basically all the maps (Well, maybe not Wayont so much) and it adds variety to the matchmaking.

<p>Whatever it is, I'm very excited for Halofest this year. Some juicy details should be released about Halo 4 and Halo Anniversary, along with details about the Title Update and the new armor. There's also a video of Frank O'Connor stuttering through a question
 about new armor for Halo: Reach. He basically just starts laughing at himself for it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's also a rumor going around that new armor DLC may be possible, regardless if it's on the disc or not. Maybe they found a way to get new armor on to the maps!?</p>

<p>I saw that thread the day it was posted back in February, but that comment hardly confrims anything. In your eyes, maybe. But to me, confirmation would be "there is a hidden hemlet locked on the game disc, but you'll have to find it". All she said was that
 it wouldn't be a mystery if she told us the truth about it. That could mean that it ISN'T going to be released, but if she told us then we'd have nothing to speculate about.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>In all honesty, I still wouldn't get my hopes up for new armor. This could still very well support the theory that 343 added that helmet into the coding for the Defiant maps, and thus wouldn't be compatible with other maps. That little sarcastic comment
 she posted doesn't confirm anything to me. We won't know until August though. I do believe that August 2nd is the day where 343 gets 100% control of the game and franchise (according to Bungie's "Per Audacia Ad Astra" farewell post from yesterday).</p>

    <title>November upgrade on 16gb tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trishau  say:</h3>
<h2>            November upgrade on 16gb tablet</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering if anyone with a 16gb windows tablet has successfully installed the November upgrade ? I bought my tablet in July this year and upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10 with no problems, using an installed sd card.</p>
<p>However the November upgrade has failed three times. The first time I had the sd card installed in the tablet, and the upgrade stopped at 41percent with the message that windows needed another 5.63 gb on c drive, and to either clean up unwanted files or
 choose an external drive.&nbsp; When I choose external drive the same message appears again even though it has 24 gb free and the install wouldnt progress.&nbsp; Second time I tried with a 16gb usb flash drive and with the sd card removed.&nbsp; Third time I tried using
 a 32gb sd card in a usb card reader, didnt get the message for more space needed, just that the installation failed and it will try again later.&nbsp; Googling for answers some people are saying that threshold 2 needs 20gb, is this true ? and does that mean that
 16 gb devices will never be able to store apps to the sd card ?</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to upgrade successfully, please share :-)</p>

<p>Yes, I had upgraded from 8.1 to 10 somewhere around in August. The upgrade had worked fine without a single hiccup. But, in&nbsp;the current scenario I've already used Disk Clean up as per instructions of MVP Andre DaCosta but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm max able to free up only up to 4 gigs on c drive and it's still asking me to free up an
<strong>additional</strong> 5.85 GB on c drive for the update to continue. I guess I'll adopt the tried &amp; tested policy of wait &amp; watch, I'm quite certain that Microsoft Will issue a fix for this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my tablet manufacturer does not make the drivers available for download so I'm afraid that if in case something went wrong I'll have to eventually give my tablet for repairs which I've already done so in the past. I'm no longer willing to do so again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might wonder why I am hesitating to use the media creation tool, the ans is simple I've read that many users have had issues while using it so it's better to wait&nbsp;&amp; watch, I'll keep you posted on further developments, if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I just called up Microsoft India support and talked to one of the Customer support representative Mr.&nbsp;Rahul and his response was that Microsoft does not officially support&nbsp;tablets having screen sizes of less than 10 inches?!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then transferred my call to the Microsoft Lumia section!! This is clear case of incompetence on MS's part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone at MS is listening, Kindly fix this ASAP.</p>

 most of the space.</p>

</p><p>To spare you the trouble, here's what I wrote on November&nbsp;21, 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked Windows Update and it is showing that my system is up to date! I'm no longer seeing nagging messages about update failed to install. But, the files pertaining to the Nov update are still there in my C drive and SD card.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I just ran Disc Clean up and chose 'Clean up System Files', I got the option</p>

<p>All right so today, I got rid of the earlier Nov update files and restarted my tablet. but, the same update was downloaded via Windows Update and the end result is the same issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse,&nbsp;it is now asking for an <strong>additional</strong> 6.64 GB free space on C drive!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if anyone at MS is listening, then please respond. I'm super flustered about this problem, it is affecting my work flow very badly.</p>

            <p>I doubt that MS gives a hoot about those of us with 16gb devices.&nbsp; I asked if we could have a standalone update just to allow us to use the sd card for apps on the older build, but the answer was "that would be nice but You have to update to 1511 to do that"&nbsp;
 well duh microsoft we keep telling you the upgrade isnt working for us !</p>
<p>One thing for sure though is my kids will be getting ANDROID tablets for christmas not windows ones. :-(</p>

    <title>How long will the installed free version of Windows 10 last&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramyymohamed  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long will the installed free version of Windows 10 last&#63;</h2>
                    You said "If you upgrade within the first year it's free for life" but I don't get the literal meaning of "upgrade", I reserved an upgrade, on 29-7 it will be available and downloaded, let's say I installed it on 30-7-2015, does that mean on 30-7-2016
 my free upgrade license will expire in case I didn't "Upgrade (buy the full license)" for my free upgrade version?<br />
Or you mean that from 29-7-2015 till 29-7-2016, if I didn't upgrade using the free upgrade reservation, I won't be able to download it for free after that and if I downloaded it during that year I will have my lifetime full activated version?

            <p>If you upgrade within the first 12 months July 29th 2015 to July 28th 2016, it will be free for life, no payment required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.

<h3> kurpingspace2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 crashes after update.</h2>
                    <p>So I installed the windows 10 update back somewhere around new years day and after the update the computer works fine, except when I use my computer, it randomly reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a scenario:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You're watching a video on YouTube and then the screen goes black, A few seconds later you get your boot-up screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it says it's updating after it boots up, but it's uncommon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor: AMD A8-5600K APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics.&nbsp; (it's uninstalled now) &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.60 GHz</li><li>RAM: 8GB</li><li>System: 64 bit</li><li>Graphics card: Zotac GeForce GTX 1060</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<p>Is your graphics driver updated?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes</li></ul>
<p>Did something go wrong during the update?</p>
<ul>
<li>Nope, it said it was updating, then it restarted a couple of times and each time it restarted it continued where it left off.</li></ul>

            No offending driver was named neither any bugcheck was noticed.
<br />Is the system running under optimal temperatures?
<br />For that, you can run HwInfo or BIOS settings.

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(239, 239, 239, 1)">Hi,&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(239, 239, 239, 1)">besides the fact that Win10 installed the update even though auto updates were disabled and with the tons of the usual problems, there is one major one, which still remained after a clean reinstallation.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(239, 239, 239, 1)">I with this Win10 version I can use just one GPU. It does not matter if I use 2,3 or 4 GPUs and in whatever (nonsense) viarity I set them up, the problem is always the same. When I open the device manager
 there is the little warning sign visible on each but the 1. GPU, when I click on either of GPU 2-4 it says the reason this card cannot be used is CODE 12 = Bios/Uefi doesn't support the card with enough power. Well I tried the possible solutions for this problem,
 but unsurprisingly they did NOT work, 'cause as I guessed from the very start onward this problem is caused by Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(239, 239, 239, 1)">So now I am either forced to reset / reinstall it to a previous version or wait some days and hope for a hotfix update.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(239, 239, 239, 1)">Oh and btw it does not matter which driver version you use.</span></p>
<p>In case you ask: No not any of my devices has any kind of dmg, everything works perfectly fine!</p>

            you honestly might as well save your breath, There are a million posts about this on the MS support forums and their "techs" are just ignoring it and telling people to check a list of pre-bought laptops to see if your system is compatible. Pray that Nvidia
 comes out with a driver soon

<p>Looks like I might have good news!</p>
<p>After a couple of days working with Microsoft Tech support, we were able to update my Windows 10 to the latest version 1709.</p>
<p>Well, the whole problem with installing the update was my second monitor on the NVidia GeForce GT 720.</p>
<p>I tried updating the driver using Chrome to download and install ver 388.31 but failed.</p>
<p>I used Internet Explorer to auto detect the compatible driver. To do so, it required an update to Java. Once done, it detected that Ver 388.31 is the latest compatible version released 11/15/2017. I successfully downloaded and installed the driver.</p>
<p>Restarted the computer and connected the second monitor. I got an error message blue screen that caused the computer to restart.</p>
<p>Once restarted with the monitor connected,&nbsp; it worked fine with no issues.</p>
<p>I hope this is it the and problem is solved.</p>
<p>Good luck to you guys!</p>

If our computer is not compatible, why did Windows update anyway?<br />
As users, what we experience is: One day our computer is working and the other day you have completely ruined our computer. And we do not have much choice.<br />
Also, why would our computers suddenly not be compatible with Windows 10 due to an update for Windows 10?<br />
I don't believe there is a compatibility issue. I think you have introduced a bug and that you Stephanie are too incompetent for your job.</p>

In your response regarding compatibility issues, this cannot be the case.&nbsp; I am having the very same issue and my computer is less than a year old.&nbsp; There is absolutely something wrong with the way Windows 10 configures computers/laptops use of GPU's.&nbsp; In fact
 my NVIDIA GPU (NO MATTER WHAT DRIVER IN OR OUT OF SAFE MODE) will not work and the OS will only allow the use of an Intel card.&nbsp; This is really frustrating for users of Windows 10 (like me) that can no longer roll back the Windows version on account that it
 completely crashed my laptop.

            After doing extensive research I'm fairly sure this is a problem with how windows is allocating PCI-e lanes (processor to IO bus inter connects). by default GPU's uses 16 PCI-e lanes from the processor to a GPU, although theoretically a GPU only needs
 one (you just need more if your memory requirement throughput goes up). So your laptop/computer is probably only using less than 8 PCI-e lanes for its GPU and windows by default thinks it needs at least 8 and nopes out. we just need to wait for a fix

<p>Thanks. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have reverted to the earlier 1703 build and placed the computer on a metered internet connection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Nvidia SLI is working.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope the fix is announced to the world so I can have a working computer and upgrades again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Such a pain.</p>

<h2>            How To Change Your Name&#47;GamerTag on X-Box &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I started up my Windows 8 for the first time, it just automatically logged me in as
<em>SpeedyHealer43</em>.&nbsp; I don't have an X-Box, and I certainly never used the name
<em>SpeedyHealer43</em> for anything.&nbsp; I don't like this Name/GamerTag.&nbsp; Is there a way to change it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hey there</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you sign into Windows 8.1, you would have signed in using your Microsoft Email Account. This allows you to use the Xbox Live Services, and other Microsoft Services including but not limited to Skype, Bing and these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also guessing you have opened the Games Application on your Windows 8 Computer. If so, this would connect you to Xbox Live. This is where you will be able to play Windows Games, otherwise known as Games for Windows Live. However it has been moved to
 Windows as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you have connected to Xbox Live for the first time, it will create you a random Gamertag. This means you can change your name for free if you wish. You can use your Gamertag on the Xbox One, PC, and Xbox 360. You may also use the Xbox.com website
 at, https://xbox.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to change your name, please open up your Application on Windows 8.1. It will have a Controller on the Tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in the Application, scroll left, you should then see your profile settings, where you can change your motto and information etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there you will be able to change your Gamertag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also need to follow the Xbox Live Code of Conduct and Terms of Use. If you dont, then you could be landed with an Enforcement Action Taken Against your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be sure to let me know how you get on with these instructions</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

Hi</p>
<p>Your first stop and best source&nbsp;for compatibility&nbsp; information&nbsp;about a specific product is the developers of the product. They will have specific information about system requirements and recommendations&nbsp;when upgrading to&nbsp;newer operating systems.</p>

<br />
<div>Run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.. you may have more problems ahead than whether AutoCad 2000 will run.
