<h2>            Can&#39;t skype at the office on the new laptop...</h2>
                    It works fine from home and the old laptop can send messages via skype just fine.&nbsp; What could possibly be the problem?&nbsp; Using the same cables even, one laptop works - the new one just says "Not sent" to ever request to send a message.

<p>Hi blanquito,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible to delete only individual contacts on the phone but remember that it will also remove the contact on your Windows Live account. If you want to easily remove all of your contacts you'll need to log on to your Windows Live account, like roope70
 mentioned, and use the contacts tool there. Alternatively just reset the phone and create a new Windows Live account so your list of contacts will be all nice and empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because Windows Phone works differently when compared to the other phones as it will primarily store all your contacts to your Windows Live account and sync the contacts from there. I<span>f you decide to sync with your Facebook, all your friends
 will be added and merged to the list of contacts if you so decide.&nbsp;</span>This makes it easier if you ever need to reset your phone as there won't be need to back up your contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey vukajla,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Nokia Discussions! Good to hear you got the update already! If you want to change the language package in your phone you need to go to a local
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care point</a> to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the original language package has been replaced, doing a hard reset or updating the phone will wipe the current package and it needs to be reinstalled in the Care point. Usually Care points take a service fee for installing the package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a Wifi router today. This is the first time I have connected this phone to Wifi. I can browse the web with Opera Mini but the default browser refuses to open any pages saying "There's no Wi-Fi or mobile data connection. Please cheack your connection
 settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I opened the App store isked me to update but that failed too. Facebook app is working. Its also strange that I didnt receive an OS update I guss thatmust have failed in the background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a new Wi-Fi user but are these known issues ? Are there workarounds ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, my cable ISP provides a web interface for login. The web page is on the LAN (Local Area Network). Can Nokia's default browser open pages on local net ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a problem regarding automatic replies.</p>
<p>We have tried to set the settings locally in all outlook clients that all automatic replies shall be answered in English.</p>
<p>But for some reason the automatic replies comes in Swedish instead.</p>
<p>Is it possible to set this option in power shell to the exchange environment in Office 365 instead.</p>
<p>Sort of like hard code it?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my test, the Automatic Replies subject language is based on the language setting of the mailbox. I suggest you change the mailbox language to English and check if the issue persists. You can go to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Outlook Web App">Outlook Web App
</a>(OWA) -&gt; Option -&gt; Mail -&gt; General -&gt; Region and time zone. You can also run the command to change the setting:
<em>Set-mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -Languages </em><em>&lt;</em></span><em>culturecodevalue</em><span><em>&gt;</em>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>A screenshot of the Automatic Replies settings.</span></li><li><span>A screenshot of the automatic reply email.</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur to all the senders?</span></li></ol>

    <title>Sorting multiple ranges in a worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nuculerman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting multiple ranges in a worksheet</h2>
                    
<p>I'll have a worksheet that has data separated by merged cells.&nbsp; There are four sets of data, and they're all the same number of columns, but the amount of rows in each set can vary.&nbsp; I've tried finding the end of each set of data and using .Sort.Sortfields.Add
 to find the right range, but it's not working.</p>
<p>If I record a macro to sort a selection I get something like</p>
<p>ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets.Sort.Sortfields.Add Key:=Range(&lt;selection&gt;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to use that same code and just replace key with a Range such as:</p>
<p>Range("O35", Range("O35").Offset(placekeep, 0)) I get a compiling error on that line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if anyone knows why Key:= doesn't like that Range, or how to sort a variable length of selections with the same field, I'd really appreciate your input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Document for Word on Android got corrupted</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been working on a document on my tablet. &nbsp;It was low on power and switched off without me expecting it. &nbsp;When I found an outlet and tried to reopen the file it had become corrupted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word offers to recover the document, and tries, but then it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my system's shutdown process may have messed up the autosave feature, that's my best guess. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure the document's just toast, as the most I've been able to find converting and using other programs is a bunch of zeros. &nbsp;Are my earlier autosaves
 stored anywhere I could access them? &nbsp;Or is there some other way to restore the document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a part of the thesis I'm working on. &nbsp;I still have other versions but I've probably lost at least a couple week's work. &nbsp;I'm heartbroken. &nbsp;Please help if you can.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Ashishsrkhan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for delivering wrong information. After read the article provided by Bourne Zhang, I did some tests and found it worked. Please use this PowerShell command to add alias email address by using CSV file:</span></p>
<p><span>$Users = Import-CSV C:\TEMP\book1.csv $Users | ForEach {Set-Mailbox $_.UserID -EmailAddresses $_.NewAddress,$_.UserID }</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The format of CSV file should be like this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0730dba1-a38d-4994-b544-686bd557feb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0730dba1-a38d-4994-b544-686bd557feb8" /></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: Only the primary email address will be changed, you still need to use the previous user name to log in.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need any help, please feel free to post back.</span></p>

    <title>Build 14257 consistently fails to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rivergoatjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 14257 consistently fails to install</h2>
                    The first time I've experienced this on any of the builds. HP ProBook 6470b. The build installs to over 70%, then I see it's rolling back to the previous build. Not seeing what is failing, just that it will not complete the install. I'll probably just
 wait until the next build and see what happens.

            Hi Michaelj1981.<br />
<br />
First of all, thanks for trying out the My Phone server.<br />
<br />
Lets say that the "archive to web" feature will archive the content on web and delete the content on phone.
<br />
This way, you can release space in your phone, keeping the content only on web. Afterwards, if you want bring back the content to the phone you can easily go to the web portal select the content and the option "restore to phone" and the content will be sent
 to the phone again (it will be in both sides - phone and portal).<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask for further information.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Miguel Lopes.

<h2>            Office 2016 Uninstalled while doing an Online Repaie</h2>
                    I recently bought a new Dell PC with Office 216 pre-installed. I was trying to get OneNote in Outlook to work but it gave me an error message that OneNote needed to be set up. I was able to run OneNote, but still couldn't get it to work in Outlook. I tried
 Microsoft's Online Repair but it uninstalled the entire Office program! I seemed to have misplaced my product key and can't reinstall. Why did the Office REPAIR uninstall Office?

            <p>I had the same thing happen to me. Microsoft is almost all Indian programmers now and it shows. They have zero ability to design and implement software or intuitive user interfaces. American business is dying because of its dependence&nbsp; on the failed technology
 being produced these days. Pakistani programmers would be a better choice. </p>
<p>Hopefully I or someone can start a class action suit about Microsoft deliberately removing and disabling legally acquired software.
</p>
<p>For me, the fix for this was to buy a Chromebook. It is working flawlessly and their office products are much more stable.</p>

<p>Hi Chris and everyone else suffering from this severe issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft product with this kind of destructive feature still sucks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for what it's worth I used the Microsoft Chat Support and Rose (Rosemarie T) is my hero of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She was able to provide me a link to download an install file for the product key I rightfully bought, so I'm up and running again :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did suggest though, to remove this destructive feature from the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might be worth a try for you as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Version 1706 that keeps on restarting every second time I try to open an email, but even worse Search has become completely unreliable!</p>

 using this brand new Dell PC for months now with no problem and then today every time they went to open an attachment in their email, their entire office suite froze up requiring ending the tasks through task manager.&nbsp; When I went to do an online repair of
 the suite it progressed to step 1 of 4 and then completely uninstalled the entire office suite.&nbsp; So is MS trying to say that the best repair for their product is not to use it in the first place?&nbsp; Kinda seems like it.

<h2>            negative number and it subtracts twice the value in excel</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm hoping that someone could help me. For some reason, the negative value is being subtracted twice its value when I try to do a summation of a group of numbers. For example:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A1: 100</div>
<div>A2: 100</div>
<div>A3: 100</div>
<div>A4: 100</div>
<div>A5: -100</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The calculation should be 400, but for some reason excel would double the negative amount which results the calculation to be 300. Does anybody know why I get this result in excel? Please help!!!</div>
                </div>

            <p>NO, it's not subtracting twice - you're being fooled by the DELTA or change in total values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this (I'll put in commas to make visibility easier)</p>
<p>C1:&nbsp; 18,000,000</p>
<p>C2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 755,000</p>
<p>C3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 130,000</p>
<p>C4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;247,000</p>
<p>C5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,000,000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in C6 put =SUM(C1:C5)&nbsp; and it will show you your 20,132,000 value</p>
<p>Now change the 247,000 entry to a negative entry and you should get 19,638,000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you just add the 18,000,000 + 755,000 + 130,000 + 1,000,000 values, then you have your desired goal of 19,883,000&nbsp; but the SUM() function is doing ((18,000,000 + 755,000 + 130,000 + 1,000,000) - 247,000) which is indeed 19,638,000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might be happier with this formula:</p>
<p>=SUMIF(C1:C5,"&gt;0",C1:C5)</p>
<p>That will give you your anticipated 19,885,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confusing isn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            That is how math works.<br />
<br />
When you change the sign of a number in the series, you don't subtract that number from the previous total; rather you subtract that number for the total less that number whose sign you reversed.<br />
<br />
Going back to your original example, and changing the sign of A5<br />
<br />
<div>A1: 100</div>
<div>A2: 100</div>
<div>A3: 100</div>
<div>A4: 100</div>
<div>A5: 100<br />
<br />
100+100+100+100 = 400<br />
400+100 = 500<br />
SUM(A1:A5) = 500<br />
<br />
<div>A1: 100</div>
<div>A2: 100</div>
<div>A3: 100</div>
<div>A4: 100</div>
<div>A5: -100<br />
<br />
100+100+100+100 = 400<br />
400-100 = 300<br />
SUM(A1:A5) = 300<br />
<br />
In your second example, you want to show 20,132,000 less 247,000.<br />
Therefore you need to subtract 247,000 from 20,132,000<br />
<br />
If you merely reverse the sign of the 247,000, the other values only add up to 19,885,000.

            The "non Commercial use" message is displayed for Office Home and Student.<br />
<br />
The "unlicensed" part is self explanatory. Apparently activation did not work.<br />
<br />
When you bought Home and Business, did you also install it? I'm guessing the answer is yes.<br />
Did you uninstall the trial? I'm guessing the answer is no.<br />
<br />
The symptoms you describe can happen when a purchased copy is installed while the factory installed trial is NOT uninstalled.&nbsp; When you try to activate the purchased copy, the pre-installed trial interferes with the activation.<br />
<br />
If that is the situation, uninstall the Trial. In programs and features it will probably be called "Microsoft Office 2010 Single Image"&nbsp; AND then repair the purchased and installed copy (to fix the Windows file associations).&nbsp; Finally activate one more time.<br />

            <p>It easy for you to sit behind a computer, click Participate and Start a Discussion and complain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you ever think about what goes into software engineering especially for a product the magnitude of Windows?</p>
<p>To write code that becomes a functional product you can use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the developers, that's hard work! They are impressed by getting something functional that installs and provides a glimpse of what they have engineered for nearly two months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took 54 days to deliver a revision of Windows 10 since build 9926 simply because Insiders started getting restless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that Microsoft has answered those calls, we are now hearing complaints that its too buggy and it should have never been released. Well Microsoft clearly said it, this is what you should expect with the delivery of faster builds and they did not set any
 other expectations. </p>
<p>
</p><p>They had to change a lot in their tooling and engineering processes to deliver faster builds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, we all lover whizz bang features, but remember, whizz bang features need to first be thought of, prototyped, coded, tested, further engineered and tested.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things I keep telling persons, any problem you encounter make sure you send the feedback in. Yes, you might experience the same bug over and over again and feel that they might not be fixing it. Sometimes its a simple case of regression occurring.
 Remember, this is a build that even a lot of developers in the company didn't get before Insiders themselves.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is it impressive? It might not be to you, but to the team behind the code, it is, to create something functional that has obviously been evidenced by the fact that it installs is impressive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about writing something in QBasic or VB and think about all that brain power that goes into writing something you can simply just install, launch a browser, sign in, click Participate and Start a discussion?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted on and off to learn programming and its so abstract and foreign to me. What amazes me is somebody, a team can sit down and write something in what looks like gibberish syntax to me that delivers a functional working product especially one
 as impressive as Windows.</p>

            <p>I have no bone to pick for the team of hard working engineers doing their best to deliver a product that satisfies the project managers at Microsoft. &nbsp;It just seems awfully tone deaf to be marketing and trumpeting - I doubt that the software engineers are
 the ones who are deciding to give these superlative names to very bad builds, and I'm sure many of them are suffering greatly through this development process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programming is difficult, and when something has millions of lines of code, it's not like building with lego - and nobody can understand all of the code, and changes mandated by a decider will have unintended consequences. &nbsp;The hard working programmers are
 there to try to meet the (unrealistic) expectations and demands of this grand vision of turning Windows into a one-size-fits-all but none very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a problem internal to Microsoft, I doubt that they are listening to their programmers and engineers - it's not them to blame, but leadership, for example the decision to fire thousands of internal quality testers. &nbsp;Uh-huh. &nbsp;Awesome. &nbsp;Impressive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've stated many times in the forums, I don't think it's a lack of talent or skill a Microsoft - it's a leadership problem. &nbsp;This project is not being led well, and giving ridiculous names to the builds is just out of touch and tone deaf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the insider program with Nadella in charge had everyone excited for a rebirth of Microsoft as a much more open company. &nbsp;It's true that they are making many huge changes, putting things in open source to assist development, etc - but it just seems
 like they're not listening, and just pretending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You yourself expressed some doubts, and I agreed with those, and you've been the most dedicated and helpful person on this forum, so please don't take it as me insulting you in any way - you've been great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was in the early builds, and I saw that "awesome" was coming, and them "impressive" I thought HMMM... they're advertising something really special coming our way. &nbsp;False advertising. &nbsp;I am disappointed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact yes and I have done so for many decades.&nbsp; However, this is not a preschool playground where you get trophies for simply showing up and trying hard.&nbsp; It is the quality of the RESULTS and ONLY the quality of the results that count.&nbsp; If
 the quality is not there, there is no trophy and no praise.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you deliver a product to a customer, the fact you showed up every day and worked really hard to create the product is irrelevant to him.&nbsp; ALL he is interested in is that the product provides value for his purpose that exceeds the cost of acquisition
 and use.&nbsp; The cost is not merely the price to purchase.&nbsp; That is only the base cost.&nbsp; The product must resolve many more problems than it causes him.&nbsp; The few new problems the product presents must be very minor compared to the many it removes.&nbsp; The cost of
 clearing those problems must be much less than the value received or the product is a failure.&nbsp; In that event, the customer has every right to complain and to demand better performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are the customers who are expected to use the product and we judge that its quality is seriously lacking.&nbsp; It fails to meet OUR standard of value because it does not meet our needs nor serve our purposes.&nbsp; It delivers to us many more problems than it
 resolves and the cost of clearing those problems greatly exceeds the value delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That you judge otherwise is totally and completely irrelevant.&nbsp; You are not the customer.&nbsp; We are!&nbsp; You are merely someone who is claiming that the fact that so many people worked so hard for so long means that we should overlook the clear and obvious deficits
 in the product you are pushing.&nbsp; It doesn't work that way in our world.</p>

            <p>I have a great idea Microsoft should tell everybody that uses the fast track, that there will be more bugs in the release, oh wait they did, well then Microsoft should have some kind of way to report said bugs, oh wait they do, wait wait I got it, so if
 somebody finds a bug they should tell Microsoft so they can fix it, wait I know if I don't like bugs I should just not use beta software and wait for the final release, then complain about the bugs,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just hope that Microsoft realizes for everybody that&nbsp;comes on here to&nbsp;complain about the bugs, there are many more of us that will just quietly report bugs we find, and just have fun testing this&nbsp;BETA!!! copy of win 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no bone to pick for the team of hard working engineers doing their best to deliver a product that satisfies the project managers at Microsoft. &nbsp;It just seems awfully tone deaf to be marketing and trumpeting - I doubt that the software engineers are
 the ones who are deciding to give these superlative names to very bad builds, and I'm sure many of them are suffering greatly through this development process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A build is not bad unless it hits the floor. Again, its easy for you to sit behind a computer and say these things without knowing what goes into building and shipping a revision of Windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The following article should give you some insight into the complexity to deliver you a build:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-server/windows-server-2003-the-road-to-gold-part-two-developing-windows-127433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winsupersite.com/article/windows-server/windows-server-2003-the-road-to-gold-part-two-developing-windows-127433</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programming is difficult, and when something has millions of lines of code, it's not like building with lego - and nobody can understand all of the code, and changes mandated by a decider will have unintended consequences. &nbsp;The hard working programmers are
 there to try to meet the (unrealistic) expectations and demands of this grand vision of turning Windows into a one-size-fits-all but none very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>One size fits all is too much visualizing and is not logical in the objective of Windows. Microsoft's interpretation of one size fits all is a common core, an API from a developers perspective. Its not about shoe horning Windows 10 desktop on Lumia.
 Windows is very componentized and its the ability the mix and match according to device, market and needs. Its a solution based platform.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a problem internal to Microsoft, I doubt that they are listening to their programmers and engineers - it's not them to blame, but leadership, for example the decision to fire thousands of internal quality testers. &nbsp;Uh-huh. &nbsp;Awesome. &nbsp;Impressive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You don't work there, so honestly, you really don't have any merit whether having thousands testers delivered a better product. They had thousands of testers and Vista still came to market. Reading stuff off rumour enthusiast websites and taking
 it as gospel is not the appropriate thing to do.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've stated many times in the forums, I don't think it's a lack of talent or skill a Microsoft - it's a leadership problem. &nbsp;This project is not being led well, and giving ridiculous names to the builds is just out of touch and tone deaf.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Who is the leadership behind Windows 10? You think Satya Nadella micromanages development teams at Microsoft? If you think that is how Microsoft works, you are way off base.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the insider program with Nadella in charge had everyone excited for a rebirth of Microsoft as a much more open company. &nbsp;It's true that they are making many huge changes, putting things in open source to assist development, etc - but it just seems
 like they're not listening, and just pretending.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>That's your problem, you are looking at this thing from the surface and not from what it takes to deliver that thing that installs that gives you the opportunity to complain about it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You yourself expressed some doubts, and I agreed with those, and you've been the most dedicated and helpful person on this forum, so please don't take it as me insulting you in any way - you've been great.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I complained about communication and lack of details and the company has responded to that:</strong></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was in the early builds, and I saw that "awesome" was coming, and them "impressive" I thought HMMM... they're advertising something really special coming our way. &nbsp;False advertising. &nbsp;I am disappointed.</p>

            Hi Ronmar
<br />
<br />On Skype you have 2 identifiers, a Skype ID, which starts with live: . . . . and your Skype Name
<br />
<br />The Skype ID, which most users call their Skype name cannot be changed, it is generated by the system and is unique to the system
<br />
<br />The other Skype Name can be changes:
<br />
<br />Log into <a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com</a>
<br />
<br />Click the 3 dots beside your Name and choose Settings
<br />
<br />Then click 'Your Profile' - Edit Profile
<br />
<br />From there you can change that name .. .

    <title>T-Mobile MDA Compact IV as external GPS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            T-Mobile MDA Compact IV as external GPS&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia E61. Now I got said MDA as a company phone, but I can´t warm up to that at all because it does not have any keys, only a few very basic ones and a touchscreen. I don´t like touchscreens, especially for writing texts.<br />
It does have one feature, though, that I would very much like to be able to use, that is, a GPS receiver. It´s very small, so it wouldn´t be too much hassle to carry the two for navigation. I know I can download some navigation software onto my E61 - or I already
 have some, at least there´s a menu icon - but I need to use an external GPS receiver.<br />
Does anyone have some experience in connecting external GPS receivers or even this particular one?<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Hi hendikoischnur<br />
<br />
I expect that you would have problems accessing the embedded chip internal GPS on the MDA by Bluetooth unfortunately. Certainly there is no way that the Texas Instruments GPS5300 NaviLink 4.0 chipset in Nokia devices can be accessed to utilize as GPS for a
 PC.<br />
<br />
Small consolation that the MDA would probably perform very well with Google maps with it's JSR-179 implementation.

    <title>How do I split an Access database programmatically&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I split an Access database programmatically&#63;</h2>
                    I want to create a back-end database programmatically.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I have been distributing a split Access database - front end and back-end as separate files.&nbsp; It is often the case that the back-end (and front) database are installed in directories that are different from which they were created.&nbsp; Thus, the links in the front-end
 database are incorrect and generate errors when first opened.&nbsp; I would like to distribute one database and, upon first execution, split the database programmatically.<br />

            <p>Ummm...</p>
<p>Don't do it that way.</p>
<p>Instead, programmatically relink it. There are tons of examples of code out there to do so. They trap the error when the database first opens, and prompt the user through the process of finding the correct location for the backend.</p>
<p>That's going to be a LOT easier than combining and splitting again.</p>

            I agree with John. You will need to have the user tell you where the back end is in any case. So it would be a lot easier to trap the error, prompt the user to enter a location, then use that to relink the tables.&nbsp;

            For development, I work with an un-split database. Just before packing it for distribution, I split it into a front-end and back-end.&nbsp; I have code to set appropriate switches/global variables for production, and I use compile switches for activating production
 logic.&nbsp; I'm just looking at eliminating one step, and it assures me that the back-end is in sync with the front-end at the target machine.<br />

            I have a separate issue in detecting a error when the application is first started in a target machine.&nbsp; Before the AutoExec macro starts for the first execution on a new target machine, the Select Data Source popup window appears.&nbsp; How do I trap this
 error?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it's because Access 2007 didn't find the back-end database as defined in the corresponding tables Connect string.&nbsp; Since it appears before the AutoExec macro starts, I cannot trap it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />

                    <span>Hello there,</span>
                    <span>Hello there,</span>
<div>I use Office 2016 for Mac. In all Office products such as Exel and PowerPoint can I choose in all print jobs in the "Print" menu Enhanced Print Settings. For this purpose, I can use "Show Details" the selection button to eg the paper size , duplex
 printing , print two pages on one sheet , etc. to choose . Only in Word that does not work , unfortunately . The selection function does not appear.</div>
<div>The printer driver is up to date and for an HP Officejet Pro X476dw MFP installed ( network ) . Printing and scanning function properly.</div>
<div>The hotline Apple has reproduced the error on a test system . Also there is only WORD menu " incomplete " appears. The hotline from Microsoft I can - to express myself cautiously - only describe as incompetent. Microsoft should say goodbye to
 this contractor ...</div>
<div>
<p>Does anyone have any advice , what can I do ? Many thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>First, the "links" you've provided are to files stored on you Mac's desktop, which nobody here can access, so I'm afraid they don't do us any good :-) You can use the
<strong>Insert Image</strong> tool <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d064824f-5d11-41ec-8705-9865e5b392b2" />in a message window's toolbar to upload the images into a message if you'd care to, but I
 don't believe that should be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each program is provided with its own version of the Print dialog window. The window's layout can vary from one program to another based on the needs of the program. The Print dialog window for Word does not include a
<strong>Hide/Show Details</strong> button despite the fact that the windows provided for Excel &amp; PowerPoint
<em>do</em> have it... That is normal. The necessary controls, however, are readily available if you open the
<strong>Copies &amp; Pages</strong> menu as John indicated. IOW, Word's Print dialog window doesn't have a
<strong>Hide/Show Details</strong> button because it doesn't need one... the details are already available to be
<em>shown</em> &amp; cannot be <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select from that menu the dialog window will update to provide the features in that category. For example,
<em>Paper Size</em>, <em>Page Order</em>, etc. are there if you select <strong>Paper Handling</strong>. You should also find a specific menu listing for
<strong>Duplex</strong> or <strong>Two Sided Printing Settings</strong> which present your printer's settings for duplex printing. Likewise, the choices for
<em>Pages per Sheet</em> &amp; for <em>Layout Direction</em> will be presented if you choose
<strong>Layout</strong> from that same menu.</p>

Thank you very much for the information. I probably don't know enough about Office 365, Outlook 2007 and Outlook.com to even ask my question correctly but I'll try. I have used previous version of MS Office for decades. I have been using Outlook 2007 since
 it came out. I have a 1.8GB .pst file that I would like to have access to on my office, home and laptop computers and even my Smartphone if possible. I would &nbsp;switch from an Android to Windows phone if this is possible. For a week I have been using a free
 trial of Office 365 and successfully moved my Outlook 2007 .pst file from my old Dell Window XP computer to my new Dell Windows 7 pro computer. All of my saved emails are readily available on my new computer in the version of Outlook that Office 365 runs.
 I thought this meant the .pst file was online but apparently it is only on my new PC hard drive so I don't think I can access it from other Windows 7 or MAC computers running Office 365. &nbsp;Is there a Microsoft solution or do I need to move everything to GMail
 and Google docs?

Thank you for getting back to us. With regard to transferring&nbsp;PST file to cloud and use in Outlook.com. Please be inform that it is not possible to import the PST files saved on the system to Outlook.com.<br />

<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below to configure the email account.</span></p>
<p><span>If Outlook Connector is not installed on the system download and install it from this
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Once you have installed the Outlook Connector follow the steps listed below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Open Outlook.<br />
2. </span><span>Click on <b>File</b>&lt; <b>Info</b>&lt; <b>Add</b> <b>Account</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select the option <b>Manually configure server settings or additional server types</b> and click<b>Next</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Choose the option <b>Other</b>, select<b>Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector</b> and click
<b>Next</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Enter your name, email address and password and click<b>Ok</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below to import the PST file in Outlook.</span></p>
