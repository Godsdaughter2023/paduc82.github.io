<h2>            Strange boxes around items &#40;NVidia NVS 3100M&#41;</h2>
                    On Windows 8 Pro, I have noticed strange extra boxes around items. I downloaded the Windows 8 version of the driver for my video card (Driver version 9.18.13.280). I have all Windows updates installed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I uploaded a screenshot, you can see this extra orange box around the "File" button in MS Outlook 2010. I notice this other places too, mainly in Office 2010 apps:</div>

            <blockquote>I'm sorry, but I don't think your seeing it. I know the "File" menu is orange, this is expected. But if you look closely, there is an EXTRA orange square outside of the orange file menu. This was never there before.&nbsp;

You know - if you put them on the Internet, you can link to them here directly.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>I do see that now.&nbsp; If you can take a screenshot - it's really there.&nbsp; It's not an illusion of your monitor nor some haziness caused by your video card.</p>
<p>Is that also present in the other Office applications?&nbsp; Word (except blue in color) and Excel (except green in color) and PowerPoint (except red in color)?&nbsp; Or is it always orange?&nbsp; And what other programs does it appear in?</p>
<p>If it is a defect in the driver - which it could be - you will have to get with nVidia.&nbsp; Their product, their software.&nbsp; I don't see it on my Windows 7 or Windows 8 machines.&nbsp; If you rollback the driver, do they disappear?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X - Scorpio Edition - Damaged When Sent For Repair&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p><p><br /></p><p>So I sent my Xbox One X - Scorpio Edition off to be repaired as it was not operating through a HD cable. You were able to stream to a PC and see that the console was working, but it would not display on multi TV's/Monitors. </p><p><br /></p><p>I sent the console off to be repaired, and to my frustration 2 weeks later it comes back with a letter saying that it will not be covered by warranty as the console has been tampered with and has not been repaired. To top this off, the back of the console has been damaged. Looks like something has been dropped onto it/been dropped. So, I now have a console that not only doesn't work, but Microsfot are not willing to fix under warranty because of damage that was 110% not there when I sent the console.&nbsp;<br />I packed the console in such a manner that where it was damaged would be nearly impossible to be damaged in transit. Additionally, someone has touched the console as the screws on the rear are loose/showing witn

            My story is similar but not as bad. My xbox one x was overheating, shutting off, no wifi, no recognition of external hard drive, all randomly. It sits on an open shelf under my tv about 10 inches from the wall. I sent it in for repair in bubble wrap and
 styrofoam. They sent it back to me saying there was nothing wrong and the OS was updated. THEY ALSO PUT A BIG DENT IN THE XBOX LIKE IT WAS HIT WITH A PIECE OF IRON OR DROPPED FROM 10 FEET HIGH ONTO A CROWBAR.&nbsp; So I did the smart thing and traded it to a game
 store and got a PS4 PRO. I have since bought a new X from amazon and a AC INFINITY USB FAN,new One X has been fine.

<h2>            Windows 10 only uses around 1.5 gb out of 4 gb ram</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having issues after updating to windows 10 for a while now. I have a Lenovo Ideapad with 4 gb of ram. After upgrading to Windows 10, it seems like the disk speed and ram memory has decreased. And it is windows 10 64 bit. For example, Edge is using
 187 mb ram right now, if i convert that to percentage, it says it's around 12,5%, which means that the total amount it uses is 1500 mb.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that this was probably due to virtual memory, so i tried adjusting the size of the virtual memory, and completely disabling it. None of it worked. Then i tried reinstalling Windows 10, but that hasn't solved my issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bios recognizes 4gb of ram, windows recognizes 4gb of ram, but for some reason it only uses 1,5 gb, and disk speeds are also slow (I have a SSHD and it should be way faster). As you can see on this screenshot it's using around 13%, i think the amount was
 around 193 mb when i took the screenshot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've also tried changing battery performance modes to high performance, using both lenovos own profiles and windows versions. I've also updated all drivers from lenovo's webpage, and i have no updates available in windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>

            <p>I followed your instructions.&nbsp; I have KB2952664 installed 6/5</p>
<p>Your instructions regarding manually running are too vague.&nbsp; However, I followed that link regarding missing icon and also verified that KB3035583 was installed (it was on 5/19).</p>
<p>Tried the command script.. nothing.&nbsp; Tried the script provided in the link, and it didn't do anything, or throw any error codes.&nbsp; Being a retired mainframe sysprog, I constantly find it amazing that these products don't have any easy to find error codes
 (or throw any error codes).&nbsp; It just seems that the programmer is soooo sure that his stuff will always work, he./she doesn't bother to check any return codes from commands issued.&nbsp; Very sad...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now what do I do?&nbsp; How come this Compatability checker isn't on the MS Webside for downloading.. like we had in WIN 7?&nbsp; Some getting "cute"?</p>

            <p>I to am having the same problem{s}....</p>
<p>I have a Hp Laptop that came default with Win 8.1 and it's a little over four months old.</p>
<p>All updates installed and I still don't have the icon or anyway of checking compatability OR getting my Free Upgrade which i know I am entitled to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes me begin to wonder if MS is playing alot of us.</p>
<p>Thinking if we don't have this icon we are not eligible for the FREE UPGRADE in hopes we will go out and buy a copy of it for ourselves at a $119+ a pop.</p>
<p>I've been beating my head against the wall trying and am just about to give it up and make them real happy and just stay with 8.1......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just paid for the OS when I bought my computer so why would I want to add the cost of the supposed latest and greatest from MS.</p>
<p>But this is just my Humble Opinion....&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, I replied to the person offering assistance, then SILENCE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why oh Why did Microsoft decide to use this techniique to have CUSTOMERS check for Win 10 compatability, and not offer a much simpler download of the analysis program?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just generating a LOT of frustration with Microsoft.. and they don't need any more bad press IMHO</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how about a simple downloadable program, and bypass all this sillyness?</p>

            <p>This is ridiculous!</p>
<p>When upgrading from Vista to Win7 there was a specific link that ran a check on your computer, to show if your computer was "compatible".</p>
<p>Microsoft expects us to manually check every driver i our computer to see if it's compatible for Win10?&nbsp; That is extremely time consuming and not all people are capable of understanding or knowing how to check to see if their drivers are compatible!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They want us to use Win10 sooo bad they are willing to give it to us for free, but won't let us know if our computer will run the program first?</p>
<p>Very bad PR for Microsoft...</p>

    <title>Adding IKEv2-based VPN connection through Group Policy - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding IKEv2-based VPN connection through Group Policy</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've recently updated our VPN connection to IKEv2 and I'd like to update that through Group Policy so that it will be automatically configured for users on the domain. When I look at Group Policy, though, I don't see IKEv2 as an option. Under [User Configuration]
 &gt; [Preferences] &gt; [Control Panel Settings] &gt; [Network Options], when you create a new VPN connection, there are only the following choices under the [Networking] tab:<br />
<br />
Type of VPN:</p>
<p>- Automatic</p>
<p>- PPTP VPN<br />
- L2TP IPsec VPN</p>
<p>
</p><p>... but if you setup the connection manually, you can choose the IKEv2 connection type. Why don't I see it in Group Policy? Our Domain is at Windows 2008 R2 functionality level. Thanks for your help with this!</p>

<h2>            Webcam issue</h2>
                    I just upgraded to windows 10. My webcam turns off every time I close the Skype window. Also, I can't see the person I am video calling when I open another window. There isn't a tiny screen of the person. May I know &nbsp;how to fix these two problems so it's
 like the classic Skype?

</p><p>Skype for Desktop and Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) have two different features. Currently, the thumbnail video (tiny screen) is not available on Skype for Windows 10. You may still use the classic version of Skype, by downloading it using this link below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>So is there anyway to install onto win10 my RA2 and Yuris revenge with my disk? Or do I have to use Origin and if so how does that work with my disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the code key for the games would I need those for origin as I have an origin account?</p>

<p>Maybe ask this question . . . is there anything on that desktop that if fell into the wrongs hands could damage you in some way? Bank account information? Information that someone could steal your ID with? Etc.</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then I'd recommend Bitlocker. If there's nothing that critical then I wouldn't worry about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can just bitlocker say a single drive that contains that information. You don't have to bitlocker your whole system. If you do choose to use Bitlocker be sure to keep backups of the keys and backups of the data (to another bitlocker'd device).

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Wi-Fi signal issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomcat2222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Wi-Fi signal issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows 10 Dell XPS desktop computer bought in August 2015. About 6 weeks ago I noticed the wifi signal icon varying up and down from strong to weak. after contacting my ISP (AT&amp;T) thinking there was a router issue, we updated the router,firmware,etc...and
 restarted it thinking this would solve the problem. It didn't, still having the same issue. I have my IPhone connected to the wifi network right next to my desktop and never have any problems with the connection, my office partner has a laptop in the office
 next to me and never has any connection problems. After contacting AT&amp;T this lead me to contact Dell thinking its a problem with my computer. We did lots of trouble shooting and changing settings. After none of this worked they sent a tech out to change the
 wireless network card and the antenna cord. Waited a few days to see what happened and no luck, still having the same problem. The WIFI signal varies up and down most of the time and will randomly disconnect for 1 to 2 seconds, then reconnect. When sitting
 idle (not using the internet) the signal seems to stay really low (just one bar), if I open up a webpage the signal goes to a strong connection as I continue browsing. Anyone have any thoughts/suggestions? Dell is suggesting reinstalling the operating system
 which I really do not want to do, as this is a work computer and would require tons of reinstalling programs and data files.

            <p>1. Its not far from the router, about 40 feet I'd say, Only one door between the router and computer, the computer is in the same place as the computer I had before purchasing the new computer, I had no wifi connectivity issue with the older computer.
</p>
<p>2. The speed is fine, the connection strength jumps all over the place, its goes from strong to weak back to strong and occasionally disconnects completely for a second or two.
</p>
<p>3. He did some things in the wifi settings, changed it where windows does power down the network card to save energy and he updated the drivers.

    <title>HP Boot-up Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP Boot-up Error</h2>
                    Hello If you have read my previous questions you will know that I have Windows XP SP3 and I'm having some trouble...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Soon to be upgraded to Windows 7 (not 8), my trusty old XP laptop is getting all it's problems solved before I upgrade, so I don't have any left when I make the move to the new OS.</div>
<div>My problem here is that when I boot into any user I receive an error which states:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You have uninstalled your HP Photo and Imaging Software. If you would like to use the software you will need to re-install it. To re-install the software, insert your HP Photo and Imaging device installation CD in your CD-ROM drive and follow the onscreen
 prompts to re-install the software.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am given OK and the red X to close I can click Either of these and it won't do anything to affect my pc but it comes on every time I boot on anyone's user and is getting kind of annoying.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also If I didn't say I deliberately meant to uninstall the HP software (It's for HP Image Zone and an old printer, scanner, copier if that helps) &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            I ended up going into msconfig/system configuration utility and removing the HP processes on startup, it needed cleaning anyway it would probably be there if I enabled it again (I'm not planning to) also on this topic there are a lot of times I type something
 in run and it will not work, e.g. I type in msconfig or msconfig.exe and I get an error message saying it can't be found, this maybe because I haven't indexed thee system files or whatever is this possible. The same problem goes for msinfo and others. Is it
 as simple as indexing the files or is something wrong with the pc again?
<div>I found msconfig in the system files if you wanted to know how I ended up getting it.</div>

            Indexing has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; And if you want your system to reward you with increased performance, you should consider disabling the Indexing Service on your system if it is not already and uninstalling the troublesome Windows Desktop Search if
 you are using it (unless somebody can tell us a good reason why not to do so).<br />
<br />
When you type in a command, XP first looks in the Registry here under the '<b>App Paths</b>' key to see if it can find it there:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>App Paths</b><br />

If it is not listed there in the Registry, then XP uses your PATH variable to try to find it (it does not look in the PATH variable first).<br />
<br />
The msconfig.exe is usually located here assuming XP is installed in the Windows folder on your C drive:<br />
<br />
<b>C:\WINDOWS\pchealth\helpctr\binaries</b><br />
<br />
The msinfo32.exe (not misinfo) is usually located here assuming XP is installed in the Windows folder on your C drive:<br />
<br />
<b>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSInfo</b><br />
<br />
If you were to look in your Registry under 'App Paths' for those two programs, that is where those two should be pointing.&nbsp; If things are set up properly, neither of those folders should be or need to be in your PATH statement.<br />
<br />
Why don't you take a look and see if those files are where they are supposed to be and if not, search your system for the files and copy/paste them in the right place and then see how things work.&nbsp; Both should work all of the time and not just some of the time.<br />
<br />
Since they are some of the 3498 files that are looked after with Windows File Protection, look for good working copies of the files here (there may be old copies on your system somewhere):<br />
<b><br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache</b><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work and you don't feel like figuring it out, a workaround would be when you find the two files, copy/paste them into this folder which should certainly be in your PATH:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\window\system32</b><br />
<br />
You mentioned msconfig and msinfo32 as not working and then '<i>others</i>'.&nbsp; What others?<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thanks for that information on the IS will disable ASAP
<div>Also thanks for the registry place I was looking for those but the registry is just extensive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did know where to find them and yes I found them both in their correct folders. Dunno if it does help but I did recently do an sfc/scannow or whatever it is(i've heard that doesn't really help with anything) I just thought that might fix it; obviously
 not.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>The two things are not there only wmp, chrome, XPS viewer and AcroRD32 (not sure if that's good or bad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't see why replacing them would help I can open them in the my computer folder maybe I should just put up with that. &nbsp;(I usually access system info through all programs anyway.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not exactly sure what others, I think I remember trying to open something else with run. It may have been 1 or 2 things or none(I may be delusional)</div>
<div><br />
<div>p.s. how often do you change your picture, like every 1.5 months?</div>

            If you are running SP3 and you ran sfc /scannow to completion without it complaining (a lot) does that mean that you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD with SP3 on it?&nbsp; Otherwise SFC would complain - a lot.<br />
<br />
Suggesting sfc /scannow is akin to saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".<br />
<br />
When sfc /scannow runs successfully, you will only see a starting and complete message in the Event Viewer System log.
<br />
<br />
It can take a long time to run and slow your system down.&nbsp; When it starts and stops successfully you only will see events like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
There is no information about what it did or what it didn't do.<br />
<br />
Even if sfc /scannow finds something to do, you will not know about it, but you will have wasted your time and still have your original problem.<br />
<br />
That makes trying it even more of a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?&nbsp; If so, I would uninstall that too.<br />
<br />
WMP and Chrome should be in the 'App Paths' registry (at least for me).&nbsp; If they are not working from the shortcuts that got created when they were installed or from your Start, Programs you need to right click them, Properties and look at the 'Target' statement
 to see where they is going.&nbsp; They should either work or not work all of the time - and not work just 'some of the time'.<br />
<br />
You will <i>not </i>get things like Chrome, WMP or your PDF viewers to work from something like a Command Prompt or from something like
<b>Start, Run</b> - that is not what Start, Run is for so if that is what is happening and what you are seeing, things are working as designed but maybe not as desired.&nbsp; They will (generally) only work from a shortcut.<br />
<br />
If you were to add those to your PATH or if you were to copy/paste those executables into your system32 folder,
<i>then </i>they will work from Start, Run but that seems unnatural to me.<br />
<br />
I keep stuff like that in my Quick Launch area (immediately to the right of the Start button) and then those things I use often are just one click away.&nbsp; Much easier than Start, Run...&nbsp; If you are not using the Quick Launch, you might Google something like
 'XP quick launch' and read up on it and exploit it.<br />
<br />
Before tinkering with your registry, you should back it up first (and make a manual Restore Point if you feel like it):<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a backup of the registry first.
<br />
<br />
There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit so if you make a mistake, that's it.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to a popular registry backup tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Before doing any more troubleshooting, I would do this:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time) and remove any threats:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
Do a full scan once in a while when you have more time (perhaps hours).<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
When the scans run clean, reboot and then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
I change my picture exactly every 42.76 days.&nbsp; Not really...&nbsp; I just change it on a whim and to try to keep things lively.<br />

<h2>            .NET Framework 1.0 updates install every day</h2>
                    <p>I have run reliability monitor, and it appears that every day since October 22, 2015, I get the following update messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft .Net Native Framework Package 1.0<br />
Microsoft .Net Native Runtime Package 1.0<br />
</p>
<p>There are several entries of each, and they all occur at the same time daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to be in some sort of infinite update loop. Is there a solution to finalize this update and stop the loop?</p>

            <p>I also am experiencing the same problem.&nbsp;To rectify it until Microsoft is able to resolve this situation I have deselected automatic update in the Microsoft Store. Open store and click on your picture and under settings you can deselect auto update. You
 can then still choose to update manually but be advised it will still install the Net Framework in multiple entries but at least it is not every day.</p>

            <p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Windows Troubleshooter could find no problems with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> There are only check boxes for .NET 3.5 Framework. 1.0 is not even mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another reply seems to indicate that this may be a problem with the Store. I'm going to try
<strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and see if that does anything. I'll let y'all know tomorrow if the apps keep updating after a Store reset.</p>

            Interesting. I checked Event Viewer and Windows Update found zero updates on its last check. This was before I reset the Store. Maybe Microsoft fixed this issue.<br />

            Nope. After I manually ran a Windows Update check, 10 updates were found, just like before. This after resetting the Store. The .NET updates are still propagating.<br />

                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u><strong>: My W7 desktop keeps reconfiguring</strong></p>
<p>I have a problem in that I keep getting a different desktop to the one I have set up.&nbsp; Sometimes the desktop is quite different, almost a default one with only a few icons, sometimes it shows all my icons but in a different layout.</p>
<p>I do not have autoarrange or the sort by options ticked, and no-one else uses my machine.&nbsp; Sometimes it happens if I have switched off and then logged in again a couple of hours later, sometimes it is OK for a few days and then it happens.</p>
<p>I also get the user profile failed the logon message sometimes.</p>
<p>I have an alternative user name set up which has been OK for 5 or 6 days, and everything was OK when I started up today with it.&nbsp; However, just now&nbsp;I accepted a McAfee update that did a restart, and as it restarted, I got the 'configuring your desktop' message
 again and it gave me&nbsp;the desktop I had set up but with the icons all rearranged - so annoying.</p>
<p>I have done the registry substitution that has been mentioned in the past, but still this keeps happening.</p>
<p>Can someone help me with this please?</p>

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Since I posted the question, I restored to a few days ago when the desktop was OK and it was OK when I started again, but without the update of course.</p>
<p>I was then offered the McAfee update again, which I accepted again, and my desktop remained OK this time.</p>
<p>I have read through my notes and see that after the first McAfee update, I got the default desktop, and I had also installed a Flash Player update that I was automatically advised about, and it was after this that my desktop was mine but with re-arranged
 icons.</p>
<p>I will advise what happens after I install the Flash Player update again but I have not had it advised to me again yet.</p>
<p>Usually though,&nbsp;I get the problem without having installed any updates.</p>
<p>You will note that I had already used a different user account and still got the problem, but I might have&nbsp;copied the desktop files from one user to make the second one.</p>
<p>I also use Malwarebytes occasionally and it&nbsp;has reported all clear recently&nbsp;but will try the one you suggest.</p>
<p>I will let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>Very many thanks for now.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>Just an update.</p>
<p>I ran the Microsoft safety scanner on quick scan last night.&nbsp; It checked almost 2 million files over about 40 minutes and reported no viruses, no spyware and no potentially unwanted software.</p>
<p>Laptop was OK just now when turned on but will keep you informed.&nbsp; Have not yet had the flash player update notification again.</p>
<p>Just for completeness, one of the messages I get, as well as the 'reconfiguring&nbsp;your desktop' when I have the trouble says&nbsp;'Location is unavailable.&nbsp; C:\Windows\sysatem32\config\systemprofile\Desktop refers to a location that is unavailable etc....'.&nbsp; I
 also sometimes get 'The user profile service failed the logon, user profile cannot be loaded.&nbsp; I've also had 'You have been logged on with a temporary profile.&nbsp; You cannot access your files - to fix this log off and try logging on again later.&nbsp; Please see
 the event log for details.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read kb/2255099 but:</p>
<p>a) my Dell laptop came with W7 (which they have since re-installed for me because I kept getting an inconsistent configuration message when I ran the Dell wireless utility, but it made no difference as I still get this error message sometimes) and so I have
 no Windows DVD.</p>
<p>b) I do not yet have an external drive to back up all my data.</p>
<p>c) I have my laptop set to receive auto updates for W7 and am up to date - how will I re-install all the updates - will it happen automatically (some have been a problem and I have had to do a manual download and local install) - or is there a service pack
 to apply that has all the updates rolled in to one update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have only had one recurrence (2 days ago) since my last message, when I got a 'configuring your desktop.&nbsp; You have been logged on with a temporary profile.'&nbsp; But I logged off and tried again and it was OK the second time.&nbsp; This I could live with but the
 real nuisance is when it re-arranges the icons on the desktop I have set up.&nbsp; Would it be possible, and how, to save a duplicate of my desktop that I can copy in when the active one becomes altered? Would it be a matter of just giving the appropriate file
 a .bak extension or an alternative name that I could then copy in as the working file?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello MalcGB,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say that they reinstalled Windows, did they do a clean install?</p>
<p>&lt;Did you have to reinstall all of your programs?&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, we may want to be running some hardware diagnostics here as we should not see the same behavior right after doing a clean install- and intermittently at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am going to move this thread to the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7">

            <p>Hello Matthew</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was back on 23.7.2010 when Dell re-installed W7 for me.&nbsp; Used F12 tapping on switch on to get the boot menu, tapped return until got 'Windows loading files', Custom Advanced, deleted 3 partitions and re-installed.&nbsp; They did it remotely but&nbsp;I cannot recollect
 how they did it exactly but it resulted in me losing their factory image etc after reformatting the hard disc and having a new installation that said 'Setup is preparing your computer for first use.'&nbsp; I hope this answers your question of whether it was a clean
 install.</p>
<p>Dell then arranged for Microsoft to send me Office Basic Home version&nbsp;and I received a product key and installed it on 19.8.2010.</p>
<p>All of this was quite involved as I had problems getting Office activated beyond a 60 day trial even though I had entered the valid product key, I had problems getting e-mail clients running correctly, and now, even though Office seems to be downloaded to
 my machine it still seems to take about 10 seconds to start up the first time in each session as it seems to connect to the virtual system - I sometimes come across a Q drive.</p>
<p>One day in September 2010 I got a loud buzzing and no cursor when I switched on, and when I re-started I got a message 'You cannot open a click to run application while you are repairing or removi ng a click to run application.&nbsp; Complete the existing action
 and then try again.'</p>
<p>Having said and done all this, I don't think I started getting the start up desktop issues until 14.9.2011.&nbsp; The only event that I recollect just prior to this was that on 23.8.2011, there was a BT network fault and I lost the blue light on my BT router
 and my connection.&nbsp; There was also a period around this time that my BT Yahoo toolbar icons kept disappearing, whether I was logged in to it or not, but they were present if I opened the next tab.&nbsp; I had the 'Security Shield' virus on 23.6.2011 but had it
 dealt with by Dell remotely.</p>
<p>Twice, I think, in the last 18 months my machine would not close and I had to force it by using the off switch.</p>
<p>Finally, something slightly different today when I logged in - my desktop background appeared and then it took about 15 seconds before my desktop icons all appeared (correctly) but the internet wouldn't start, I remained with the small circle going round
 and round, and 'control alt delete' wouldn't work either, so I had to switch off.&nbsp; I started up again, and after a delay of 10 seconds my desktop appeared and things were OK.</p>
<p>There is a scheduled Dell hardware test that runs every so often and that reports all OK.</p>
<p>Sorry to have so much to report but it may all be relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            Hello MalcGB, <br />
<br />
Usually you get logged on with a temporary profile when a handle to software program is not released at logoff and is not closing handles that keep the registry open.
<br />
<br />
It has gotten better over the years as Windows now includes UPHClean utility with the operating system.
<br />
<br />
Go to the Event viewer and see if you can find any errors there related to your profile.
<br />
<br />
<span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the <span>Start</span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>System and Security</span>, clicking
<span>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-clicking <span>
Event Viewer</span>.</span>‌ <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Then check system and application logs for any errors. <br />
<br />
Please reply back with an update on your profile issue. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Marilyn</span>

            <p>Hello Marilyn and thank you for your input.</p>
<p>I hadn't realised that I'd had a reply as I think I missed ticking the notification box.</p>
<p>I was going to advise the forum that I've not had any re-arranging of my desktop recently - the only change I've made is that I've set my system to show hidden files, folders and drives using tools in 'Computer'.&nbsp; Can't think why this should make a difference,
 suspect it's a coincidence but it's a huge coincidence.&nbsp; I haven't dared to change it back yet to check in case things go wrong again!</p>
<p>I still get the unable to load profile message occasionally, but so far I've just clicked OK (or whatever the button is that appears with it) and re-logged in and its been OK the second time.</p>
<p>I have had a load of Internet Explorer stopped working messages, and times when its suddenly decided to keep re-opening multiple versions all by itself, but a reset and then a restore seems to have settled it down for now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've had a look at Event Viewer and tried what you advised.</p>
<p>I found 'Event Viewer' directly in administrative tools of control panel, not 'security', perhaps you were thinking of Vista rather than W7?</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have found among the thousands of events, loads of errors in various places.</p>
<p>I found system and application logs under Windows logs - </p>
<p>In<strong> application</strong> there are <strong>warnings</strong>, a few of which are
</p>
<p>The winlogon notification subscriber &lt;Profiles&gt; failed a notification event.</p>
<p>and <strong>errors</strong> that include </p>
<p>Windows was unable to load the registry. This problem is often caused by insufficient memory or insufficient security rights.
</p>
<p>DETAIL - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</p>
<p>for C:\Users\Malcolm\ntuser.dat.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most of the errors are about CAP12 or VSS.</p>
<p>In<strong> system</strong>, most of the <strong>errors</strong> are Service Control Manager or PNRPSvc.&nbsp; There are a few DistributedCom's, also.&nbsp; There are loads of warnings also as well as errors.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of errors in <strong>Custom Views Administrative Events</strong>, including ServiceControlManager giving

<p>The Peer Networking Grouping service depends on the Peer Name Resolution Protocol service which failed to start because of the following error:

<p>Hope this makes sense and helps.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble with your mic still playing audio but no longer picking up that you're talking. Are you able to talk on the same headset through another device such
 as a smartphone or PC? Take a look at this helpful support article regarding how this could [possibly be network related. Try some of the steps listed here:

<p>In your settings under power and start up use the option of "full shutdown" it should fix the issue. This isn't the same as the hold the button to reset this actually will properly shut down the console.</p>

<h2>            32 player chat </h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased an xbox one back in Febuary and noticed a cool feature where I could have 32 people in a party chat. now a few months later that feature was taken away and I havnt heard why. can anyone help me with this?</p>

            <p>You could never have 32 people in chat. You could have 32 people in the party but only 8 of them could be in chat. I don't know why the feature was removed, but in one of the console updates the maximum party size was reduced to 8 - all of whom could also be in chat. That is the way it works at present.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change windows&#39; size in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10. It worked fine in my desktop Linovo at the beginning. After a few days I noticed all the windows I opened went to the full size. With the cursors on the top right I can only minimize or close the window.&nbsp;No vertical or horizontal
 cursors appeared to adjust the size. Meanwhile, the shortcuts on the desktop disappeared. Whenever I close a window, it goes to the start window with tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran sfc.exe as suggested in a discussion with same problem. It did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the "sync" in the setting, my Dell notebook got the same problem.</p>

</p><p>Method 1 did not work. Method 2 worked in my Dell notebook (under both new user and the original user the window's size was adjustable) bud did not work in my Lenovo desktop. When I tried to convert back to Win 8, The system did not provide the choise, even
 though the windows.old file was still there. I called the tech support in MS and was told because I created the second user account, I lost the possibility to recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I have to reinstall the win 8.</p>

<p>First you need to select the text you want to cut or copy (by highlighting it by scrolling over it with the left mouse held down).&nbsp; When you do that the cut and copy options should become available (or you can hit CTRL-X to cut or CTRL-C to copy).&nbsp; Then
 go where you want it and put the cursor there and paste the text (or use CTRL-V).</p>

<h2>            Need Driver for Windows 7 on a Dell Dimension 4600 w&#47; integrated video</h2>
                    I have been searching for a video driver for Windows 7 with no luck.&nbsp; The computer I need it for is a Dell Dimension 4600 with integrated video.&nbsp; When I tried the Dell website, they only show a driver for XP, because I'm assuming that was the only OS the
 4600 could run with it's standard hardware.&nbsp; The RAM has been upgraded to 1.75 GB, so 7 will run on it with no problems, but the only screen resolution that works is 640x480.&nbsp; I've tried going into the advanced settings, list all modes screen, but when I select
 a higher resolution, the minimize, maximize and close buttons go black and parts of the screen become blurry.&nbsp; I have tried two different monitors, so I'm pretty sure I just need a driver.&nbsp; I just can't find the right one.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

<div>Call Dell and ask whether the driver you need exists. If they tell you</div>
<div>they haven't created it, you're out of luck.</div>

A couple weeks ago i factory reseted an acer laptop (<span style="color: rgba(23, 23, 23, 1)">Acer&nbsp;Aspire E1-571G-53234G50Maks)&nbsp;<strong>and then proceeded to dowmload fortnite and launched the game, however mid launch the power cable caught
 on the table and since i was playing without the battery in the laptop the laptop shut and when i rebooted i was met with the automatic repair loop.</strong></span></p>

<p>But i have tried the first option which was to access the acer recovery partition but it still directs me to the windows automatic repair page where refresh and reset do not work. And as for the second option I am confused as to how to use the bootable disk
 to repair the computer.</p>

    <title>Which gaming monitor best for a Surface Book 2 15 inch i7, please&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjjmaples  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which gaming monitor best for a Surface Book 2 15 inch i7, please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I read on this forum that people are having monitor connection issues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to connect mine to a modest HP monitor with no joy at all. Research online lead me to check that the drivers were up to date - and they were.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when looking at reviews of gaming monitors I read that their own performance depends on the compatibility and capacity of the GPU of the Surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that, as the Surface is sold in anticipation of being used with external monitors, Microsoft must have tried it out with one or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft support for the Surface - with which it is sold - is, shall we say, elusive. The supplied phone numbers are not answered and emails to the sales team are not answered by the technical people.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi CJ, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We don't have recommended monitors for your Surface Book 2. However, we have a list of monitors that can be compatible with the Surface Book 2, provided you would also use a Surface Dock with it. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023468/surface-troubleshoot-surface-dock-and-docking-stations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to see the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we suggest that to use active display adapters if you're going to use high resolution monitors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable top speak to support through phone, you can visit any <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong> and talk to our personnel.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please to this thread if you have additional question. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p><span>Thanks very much Mark. Very prompt and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>I did try the Microsoft Store which I bought the Book 2 from but they could not raise tech support either.</span></p>
<p><span>Your solution involves using Surface Dock. Unfortunately I do not have that as I read that it was designed for Book 1 and was underpowered for Book 2. I enquired of the Store whether they were going to produce a new one but they couldn’t tell me. As
 I needed to get on and acquire a wired network connection I bought an Anker dock instead. Should that pose problems? My son uses it to connect his Surface Pro 3 to the HP monitor ok. But I cannot?
</span></p>
<p><span>You suggest I use an “active display adapter”. <span>&nbsp;</span>Please, what do you mean. I am using an HDMI cable. My son uses it as well.</span></p>
<p><span>The list of ok monitors you have pointed me to is, I see, over 18 months old and the market has moved on. I could not see any of gaming monitors currently recommended by Techradar. The article says earlier that “</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We’re
 working with the manufacturers to resolve these issues and will update this page when new information is available.</span><span>” Presumably some progress has been made in that time?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks</span></p>
<p>Julian</p>

<p>Hi Mark, I did a google search for "which gaming monitors work with the Surface Book 2" and came up with a very useful article at&nbsp;https://www.windowscentral.com/best-external-monitors-surface-book</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top recommendation is the&nbsp;</p>
<span>Dell S2716DG 27 Inch TN Gaming Monitor (Black) (1 ms Response Time, QHD 2560 x 1440 at 144 Hz, Nvidia G-Sync HDMI/DP/USB)</span>
<p>
