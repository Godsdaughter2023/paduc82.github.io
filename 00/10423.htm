<h2>            Indirect formula with a Date</h2>
                    I am using an Indirect formula to pull data from another sheet that is titled with a date and time frame (ex: 2-26-16 Nights). I keep getting a "Ref" error because the date is converting over to the serial format in the formula and thus can not find the
 appropriate sheet to pull the data from. How do I get the formatted date to be in the formula instead of the serial format?

            Hi Vladimir
<br />
<br />It is best to totally remove the previous version form your system, if needs be, in the future, you can always re-install that version from Office.com . . .
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of the previous Office Installation:

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error is occurring because the Adobe PDF Creator plug-in that you have installed on your Mac is incompatible with the version of Office 2016. Typically, there's a platform mismatch (e.g. your Office apps are 64-bit, but the plug-in is 32-bit or vice
 versa).</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following article for resolving this issue -&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-messages-after-updating-to-Office-for-Mac-64-bit-b62d842c-b099-434f-af65-96cb03c03242</p>

            <p>OK, general observation first :-) You're probably having difficulty in Excel because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You actually have 5 separate "tables" (based on your screen shot)</li><li>Each table differs not just in column widths but also number of columns</li><li>You're trying to 'stack' all the tables one below the other as you would in Word</li></ul>
<p>You're right -- that's virtually impossible to do in Excel without merging cells -- but merging cells is something I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. However, if you put each table on a separate worksheet you can do whatever you want with each one.
 Alternatively, they could be arranged side-by-side on the same sheet which would allow for variation of column widths but would then impose the consideration for variation of row heights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate -- although I respect my friend Jimmy's ongoing campaign to promote a flat file data storage program as a suitable substitute for a relational data management system :-) -- I truly believe it's more than you need or want to get involved with.
 It not only involves using Mail Merge in "a very advanced way" it involves using Excel in a very advanced way before the mail merge can even be done. If you are an Excel poweruser &amp; are looking to automate the actual scheduling [?] process it may well be worth
 pursuing that alternative, although there is 'ready made' software that might serve the purpose :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're just looking to have individual cells in the Word table linked to specific cells in the Excel document;</p>
<ol>
<li>In Excel copy the source cell</li><li>In Word, click in the destination cell</li><li>Go to <strong>Edit&gt; Paste Special</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Paste Link</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Unformatted Text</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li><li>Repeat as required for each additional cell.</li></ol>

<h2>            Will I be Charged if I buy bundle to a movie I already own&#63;</h2>
                    Okay so here's the problem. I will go into Microsoft Movies and TV on any device I own and see that I have Inside Out in my movie collection. I have had a great time watching the movie, but realize that it has no bonus content. I thought that this is because
 Disney didn't put any, but I looked at the store just to be sure. When I looked at the store, I saw Inside Out (plus Bonus content), but the only problem is that it is 20 dollars. Now I am wondering if this is some glitch or something because if I looked at
 what's included in the bundle it says Inside Out (the movie by itself) and a separate preorder bonus, but it says Inside Out already in collection. So my question is will I actually be charged 20 dollars if I buy this bundle even though I already own Inside
 Out?

    <title>Nokia 515 locked after replacement and software restore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 515 locked after replacement and software restore</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;<em>If my question is not posted in the right section please move it to the right one. The issue is somehow software related and connected to setting up a new phone via internet by Nokia at global level.&nbsp; I have tried to solve this issue with local Nokia
 service, but with no success, as the problem seems to be international. Hopefully someone from Nokia global support can help me.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 2014 I purchased a Nokia 515 phone in German online store (ejoker.de). The phone had no “SIM lock” and worked in Slovenia as well. I got an official invoice and written warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between March and July 2014 the phone was taken to local Nokia service in Slovenia three times due to different malfunctions: display stopped working properly, volume key malefaction, not charging. As the phone was manufactured for EU market it was no problem
 with the warranty in Slovenia (meaning the phone was repaired in Slovenia, despite bought in Germany). On last malefaction (no charging) the phone was replaced with the new one with a new IMEI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new phone given back to me by local Nokia service in Slovenia had a “SIM lock”! My objection that the (<span>malfunctioned</span>) phone given to authorized service was “SIM-lock free” and that now I got back I locked phone was not successful. &nbsp;As I
 was told, it is the Nokia policy, that the new replaced phone must be from a software and settings point of view exaclly the same as it was the original phone when it left the Nokia factory. This is done by a special software used by local Nokia service, that
 reports the phone IMEI number to "Nokia central" database and based that, it&nbsp;uploads the setings and restrictions to the new phone.&nbsp;In my case – a “SIM-lock” was applied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As already described above when I bought a phone without a “sim lock”. The local Nokia service refused to unlock it and doesn't provide me with information to which operator it is locked. Taking in consideration the phone was bought in Germany&nbsp;I contacted
 German mobile network providers and found out, that my first phone was locked to Vodafone Germany network.&nbsp;How it was unlocked and got to ejoker.de online shop, I have no clue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When given the IME number of my first (malfunctioned) &nbsp;to Vodafone Germany, they provided me with an unlock code. However the code didn’t work on my new phone with another IMEI. This however proves that my first phone was really once locked to that operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After two months of writing with Vodafone Germany they discovered that in their Winlock program (an application by Nokia for operators to unlock the phone) there is no IMEI number of my new phone. They suggest I turn to Nokia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to sum it up: due to serious malefactions of my Nokia phone, the local Nokia service in Slovenia gave me a new one with new IMEI and with a “SIM-lock”. They claim it is the same "sim-lock" as the first phone had and that it can be unlocked by the same
 operator. This wasn't true. The operator was only able to unlock the old phone, but not the new one.&nbsp;Maybe it was mistakenly locked to some third operator?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I can only presume, that when my phone was replaced by Nokia local service in Slovenia, the new IMEI number wasn’t reported to "Nokia central" or "Nokia central" service didn’t provide Vodafone Germany with an unlock key for that new phone.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For privacy reasons I didn’t post both of the IMEI numbers here. I have all the invoices, service reports, replies from local Nokia service and Vodafone Germany if needed. I can post them here or via e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ask you for your help, as I seem to be stuck between local Nokia service and mobile operator. If nothing else, I am a legal owner of the phone and I ask you to check to which operator it is locked to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance to anyone from Nokia who can look up into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patricia</p>

<p>&nbsp;is the same code printed on the back&nbsp;beneath the battery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a&nbsp;public database, firmware variant 059T0K8 was designated&nbsp;for Poland, and should be SIM-Lock free. In Germany, there was only one provider with SIM-Lock: Vodafone. You are able to
<a href="http://www.vodafone.de/privat/hilfe-support/callya-handy-entsperren.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
test via this form</a>, whether&nbsp;your phone was locked by them. I double-check here, because entering the SIM-Lock code in Nokia Series 40 is complicated – at least I&nbsp;do it the wrong way so often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, when you insert your SIM – which network operator do you use anyway? – when you insert your SIM, which error message do you get?</p>

<p>The IME on the back of (new) phone is the same as on the warranty statement and the same as sent do Vodafone Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the link you provided. If I enter the IMEI of the old phone, a code is generated. So the old phone was obviously locked to Vodafone Germany, otherwise they wouldn’t have a code, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I enter the IME of the new (replaced) phone, no code is generated. It says</p>
<p>»<em>Zu Ihrer IMEI-Nummer&nbsp;__ k</em><span><em>onnten wir leider keinen Entsperrcode ermitteln</em>.<span>«
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So, it seems the new phone is not locked to Vodafone Germany or maybe they just don’t have the code for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I enter my SIM card (from operator called BOB, which uses Vodafone Slovenia network) I only get:</p>
<p>“<em>Enter access control code</em>”</p>

<p>Yes, that is the message word for word. The phone is set to English. Before that, it says "Phone restricted". Maybe that is the error code message you are looking for.&nbsp;See here (sorry for poor quallity):</p>

<p>Please, try that old IMEI with that Vodafone Germany webpage. That is my last idea. I have really no idea what this Nokia Care Centre is about. Only they know what they did. If they do not know … puh …&nbsp;how should we. Very confusing. I thought, I could help

<p>The local Nokia care centre seems to have taken an unlocked SIM-free unit intended for another market and flashed it with a VF-Germany firmware variant also locking the handset. As this has not been processed by VF Germany, it is normal that they know nothing
 about this handset and it is not in their database, so they cannot provide an unlock code. The idiots in the local care centre need to undo what they have done.</p>

<p>You cannot that easily lock a phone. If you go for that Vodafone Germany, Vodafone CallYa&nbsp;firmware variant, the SIM-Lock state of the phone does not change. For me, it sounds like – pure guess – they used a replacement (swap) board which was SIM locked and
 changed it over to Patricia’s&nbsp;firmware variant (Poland). Perhaps the Nokia Care Centre got so confused about repairing a polish&nbsp;Nokia 515 with a german bill in Slovenia, they do not even consider to have made a mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_network_operators_of_Europe#Poland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
operator in Poland</a>&nbsp;which does SIM locking – and I am not aware of.</p>

<h2>            HELP - Lost all information on my outlook account</h2>
                    I had a problem sending emails, I was advised that I need to do an update, when doing this I ticked the following 1 - Reset my shortcuts while repairing and 2 - discard my customized settings and restore default settings. I now know this is not the correct
 thing to do as I have lost all my emails, contacts calendar etc. is there any way I can get these back.&nbsp; any help would be greatly received David

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Before starting the troubleshooting steps just a few quick questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which is the version of Outlook installed on the system (2003/2007/2010)?</span>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the type of email account configured in Outlook (POP, IMAP, MAPI or Exchange)?</span>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the operating system installed on the computer (XP/Vista/Win7/Win8)?</span>
</li><li><span>What do you see when you open Outlook? Is the email account still configured in Outlook?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you know the location where the PST file is saved?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>Search for the PST file on the system open it in Outlook and check if you are able to view all the data in Outlook.</p>
<p>Also search the file with the file name:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-search</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: You may search for the PST file with search string as

            Hi Avian,<br />
<br />
You’re right, 10 GB is the size limit for each file to be synced with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client (onedrive.exe). We can find the information from the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restrictions and limitations when you sync OneDrive for Business libraries through OneDrive for Business</a><br />

<h2>            Defect Alert - The Send button is missing in Office 365 Mail using Chrome browser</h2>
                    
<p>I am using the Chrome browser (Version 48.0.2564.92) to access Office 365 Mail. Upon clicking New Email Message, or Reply to an email message, no send button appears. I understand work-arounds exist, e.g., keyboard shortcut CTRL-ENTER enables mail to be
 sent. I found a thread on this forum that described this same problem, but for the Firefox browser +1 year ago. It is now occurring in the Chrome browser.</p>

<p>hi billstetson,</p>
<p>to look into the issue, we need to collect some information below:</p>
<p>1. a screenshot about the symptom “no send button appears”. to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;the
<b>use rich formatting </b>button in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<b>insert /edit media</b> like the picture shows below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=91b36d78-8b3e-49bc-914a-4097f26d0190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d91b36d78-8b3e-49bc-914a-4097f26d0190" /></a></p>
<p>2. are you an admin in your office 365 organization? please let us know if any other users in your organization encounter the same scenario.</p>
<p>3. i notice the latest chrome version is 48.0.2564.109, does the issue persists if you update the chrome browser? also, does the issue occur in different web browsers and network environments?</p>
<p>4. can you see the send button in owa (outlook web app) light version: <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/?layout=light" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.office.com/owa/?layout=light</a> ?</p>
<p>we will investigate the issue further after receiving the information above.</p>

<p>i am experiencing this same issue. chrome v. 48.0.2564.109 (64-bit)</p>
<p>as you can see there is just a big blue bar where you'd expect the buttons to be.</p>

<p>Hi Leslie,</p>
<p>I did a test on my side using the same Chrome version as yours, and it works fine. To confirm the issue is related to browser or Office 365 back end, i wonder if the issue occurs to other browsers.</p>

<p>Hey Toby,</p>
<p>I opened up Safari - and I could see the buttons. I'm using a Mac computer ... wonder if it's a conflict between Chrome and Mac OS X?</p>
<p>I don't have FF loaded on this machine - and don't really want to take the trouble to do so.

<p>hi leslie,</p>
<p>thanks for your information.</p>
<p>if you can see the button in safari, it means the feature works well for your account. based on my experience, the issue should be related to chrome browsers and os. may i know what your version of the os? i will try using the same os version to do some
 further tests.</p>
<p>meantime, can you let us know your owa version? here are the steps:</p>
<p>log into the <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">owa</a> (outlook web app) -&gt; right-click the owa page-&gt;view page source-&gt; you will see the page like the screenshot shows below.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>Thanks for providing the version number . We have done the same tests in our lab with a lower version, all goes fine. So I’d like to confirm with our relevant team for this issue. During that time, I’d suggest you use another browser as the workaround.</p>

<p>You are probably using the Greek keyboard to type your English text.<br />
<br />
Changing the proofing language in Word is not enough to change the keyboard as well. So to type that whole line you would need to type the Greek part first with the Greek language and keyboard enabled (e.g. click on the language icon at the bottom right of
 the Windows screen, which should show&nbsp;ΕΛ when you have the Greek language/keyboard enabled, then select English from the drop down list and conintue typing "(long tail events)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are constantly switching between Greek and English you should be able to use shortcut keys to switch to each one (e.g. go to Windows Settings-&gt;Time and Language-&gt;Region and language-&gt;Additional date, time &amp; regional settings-&gt;Change input methods-&gt;Advanced
 Settings-&gt;Change language bar hot keys. (Sorry, it isn't really much easier to reach these options any other way).</p>

<p>Peter thank you so much for the fast response but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no doing that! I am use Word for 15 years now and I am familiar with keyboard changing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem happens like this</strong>, when I try to type eg "<strong>My name in Greek is Περικλής Γκόγκας</strong>" as I type it looks fine
<strong>but when I press space</strong> after the last character Word automatically changes it to "<strong>μυ ναμε ισ Periklhw Gkogkas</strong>"!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>All characters</strong> are changed<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> from English to Greek and from Greek to English</span>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always use Greek and English at the same documents with no problem at all and I switch between the two languages using Alt+Shift. In the so many years I use Word this happened to me only in Word 2016 2 times: this yesterday and about a year earlier. The
 first time I changes something in the Word settings that I found on the internet and it was solved. I do not remember though what I did...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please help to find a solution!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to the setting as you described I have this as always:</p>

<p>Sorry, I wondered if that was what you actually meant. Unfortunately, I cannot replicate this and do not know what causes it or how to stop it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can see in the settings that looks anything like relevant is an Autocorrect setting titled "Correct keyboard setting" (in File-&gt;Options-&gt;Proofing-&gt;Autocorrect Options...-&gt;Autocorrect) but changing that does not appear to make any difference
 here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked up Help for autocorrect, Microsoft's picture of the dialog box did not show this setting. But the programming article at&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/office/microsoft.office.interop.word.autocorrect.correctkeyboardsetting(v=office.15)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/office/microsoft.office.interop.word.autocorrect.correctkeyboardsetting(v=office.15)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>describes it and mentions that CheckLanguage also has to be set to make it work. That's actually the setting called "Detect language automatically" in the Review-&gt;Language-&gt;Set language... dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, I suspect I would</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. restart Windows</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. go through the Office repair process</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. change a few other potentially relevant settings in Windows and/or Word and changing them back again (e.g. perhaps go as far as delete one of the languages/keyboards in Windows then re-install it).</p>

    <title>Zune on HTC WP7 freezes between songs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> islehopper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune on HTC WP7 freezes between songs</h2>
                    <p>1. Phone Manufacturer: HTC<br />
2. Phone Model: HD7 (hardware version 0002) Original 16Gb Storage (not user modified)<br />
3. Mobile Operator (Taiwan GSM)<br />
4. Phone Operating System version (Mango 7720 upgraded by HTC Taiwan 9/16/2011)<br />
5. Zune software version: 4.8.2345.0<br />
6. Computer Operating System version: Win7 Ultimate SP1</p>
<p>Problem: during playback connected via 3.5mm jack to car audio system, Sonos box, wire or wireless headphones&nbsp;randomly locks up between songs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Occurs during playback of both drm-protected&nbsp;Zune Pass media and drm-free mp3's.</p>
<p>Work-around: Must remove/replace battery to restart Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Problem is not new to the 7720 Mango ROM. Have had problem since first purchased HD7 phone in February. Zune Pass started March 2011.
</p>
<p>Problem has been frequently reported on HTC, Samsung and Dell devices. (google search: wp7 freeze zune playback)</p>
<p>If running a 2nd program in background (like "marathon" app), I can listen to Zune for at least 1 hour with no problems. Marathon is a GPS tracker that allows Zune to play while recording GPS data. Without Marathon running, Zune appears to go into a deep
 sleep mode that prevents Zune from checking DRM and locks up the phone. </p>
<p>Extremely annoying and ruins&nbsp;user experince. Zune is a fantastic product -- Zune on PC + Zune on WP7 is an extremely attractive&nbsp;alternative to iPhone/iTunes.</p>
<p>Like many others experiencing same problem,if not resolved&nbsp;soon, will see significant attrition in 1-year Zune Pass&nbsp;subscriptions, including myself.</p>
<p>Let me know if any further&nbsp;information needed&nbsp;to address problem.</p>
<p>** One additional Note: AC connection prevents the problem. This is reproducable ***</p>
<p>25-NOV-2011 Follow-up: HTC firmware update pushed out end of October did not fix the problem. With Zune Pass content, continue to receive the random freeze, but less frequent now than before the firmware update. Removing ALL Zune Pass content from HD7 leaving
 only mp3's solves the problem. Note: after HTC firmware pushed, hard reset device, immediately removed HTC Sound Enhancer (never used). I have 2 wifi AP's (one at office, one at home) and carrier is Taiwan Mobile.
</p>
<p>Updated Firmware pushed OTA by HTC: 2250.21.50001.707</p>
<p>4-Weeks later, I can confirm the HTC firmware update 2250.21.50002.707 fixed the problem. Therefore, it's fair to say Microsoft and Zune did not cause the problem but rather HTC. Appreciate all the comments and suggestions up to this point. This problem
 may now be considered answered and closed.</p>

            <p>In order to achiieve this, divide your document into sections. This means that instead of placing a page break between chapter 1 and 2 etc. - Place a section break there instead.
<br />
<br />
Section breaks will allow Word to change information that normally applys to the entire document (like header/footer, margins, orientation etc.).<br />
<br />
You will find section breaks in the Page Layout tab and the Breaks button. <br />
If you do not have special neeeds the Section Break Next Page option is usually the easiest.<br />
</p>
<p>After dividing the document into sections then enter the header footer area and jump between the sections with the "next" and "previous" buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The important thing to notice is that if of want a section to be unique you will have to unselect the "Link to previous" button in the header/footer tab.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jump through all your sections and unselect the link to previous. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this is done, add the desired information in the header/footer and each section may now have it's unique content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Malin had a good response.&nbsp; These are the notes I put together to remind myself how I did it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">Go to Insert &gt; Header<span>&nbsp;
</span>and select a format for typing in the Header Content.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Then place the cursor at the point where the page numbers should go and
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Press Alt+Shift+P<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This will start page numbering.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the drop down box under Page Number to go to format page numbers and start at a certain section or go consecutively if that doesn’t happen automatically.<span>&nbsp;
</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can also use the drop down box under Header to remove a Header and start over if you need to.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>To make Section Breaks go to Page Layout – Breaks – then drop down and select Next if you want to start a section on a new page.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Use Insert&gt;Header to bring up the current Header view and then select Edit Header from the Header drop down box (near the bottom)<font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>to make changes – including separating Headers from one Section to another by highlighting or unhighlighting the Link to Previous (section) icon that will appear on the ribbon across the top.<span>&nbsp;
</span></font>In the Header View you will see a Same as Previous tab attached to the Header if the same Header carries over from one section to another.
</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Hope that makes it easier for you - it certainly did for me when I put it all together.</span></font></p>

    <title>Office &#34;Save as&#34; goes to wrong folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neal36456  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office &#34;Save as&#34; goes to wrong folder</h2>
                    <p>25 June 2018.&nbsp; Running Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft pushed out an update about 10 days ago.&nbsp; Now, when I use the "Save as" function, the offered folder location is always the first folder I opened in the instance of the Microsoft application (Word, Excel, etc) that I have open.&nbsp; It does not offer
 the folder that the file actually resides in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open a file located in a different folder, that folder is not offered, and I have to navigate to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely inconvenient, and making me angrier even day I have to deal with it.&nbsp; In the last iteration of this issue, I edited and save a Word file, then then saved the final product, a PDF.&nbsp; It took 10 minutes to find where Word had been pointing,
 so that I could disseminate the PDF. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that DON'T work:</p>
<p>• Office repair does not correct the problem.</p>
<p>• Check the box for "Don't show the Backstage when opening or saving files."&nbsp; Even though this version is Word 2010, this option does not show.</p>
<p>• Use F12 to get the Save as window.&nbsp; And before anyone disputes that F12 Save could not possibly fail to work (like in another thread), yes, a Save as window does open.&nbsp; It points at the same location as when I use the drop-down, or a toolbar button for
 Save as.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IT support says to go to the initial installer (the one from 4 years ago), and re-install.&nbsp; Somehow, I think that is just not going to work out well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would prefer not to go to latest instance of Office, as I do not care for how it interacts with the user, or to have to basically learn a new application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise how to resolve the Save as problem?&nbsp; There seems to some discussions about Save as issues, but everyone just says to select Don't show the Backstage, which 1) I can't do, and 2) don't know if that would actually solve this anyway, since
 what is offered is not Backstage, just an earlier folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Second question first.</strong></p>
<p>By "a document <strong>that has been saved to disk</strong>," I presume you mean a file saved to the harddrive?&nbsp;&nbsp; Your response is contrary to the statement of the problem, because that is the problem.&nbsp; F12 for a file located in a folder on the harddrive
 DOES NOT offer that folder location for F12 /&nbsp; Save as folder.&nbsp; This is the entire issue.&nbsp; Word
<strong>should, but does not</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Default folder was not revised at the time the problem appeared, or since.&nbsp; I don't recall ever even needed to specify this location. &nbsp; Default folder is&nbsp;C:\Users\xxxxxx\Documents\SharePoint Drafts\.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the fact that this is not SharePoint is somewhat
 moot, as I never save files to this or any other default location.&nbsp; In addition, in my normal work processes, I do not recall ever being offered this location, or a similar default location, in either my office or personal PC.&nbsp; But that might just be the way
 I handle and develop new files.&nbsp; This should have nothing to do with no remembering where a file resides when it is time to save that file.&nbsp; It just creates a new version elsewhere.&nbsp; This wrecks havoc if I don't notice, because then my folder for the project
 does not actually have the current file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a new file, I direct it to the folder I want it in.&nbsp; BUt usually I create a blank file in the location I want the file in (Clink into folder, then rIght click, then New Word document).&nbsp; Historically (before 10 days ago), Word would then offer
 that file location to me as the save destination.&nbsp; But now, Office only remembers the first location since the Word/Excel application was opened.&nbsp; I can change this location by closing every file, and opening another file in another location.&nbsp; Then that will
 be the new location that Office (usually) directs to.&nbsp; Note also that this seems be to somewhat erratic.&nbsp; Sometimes Office actually knows what folder the file comes from.&nbsp; I have not been able to identify a pattern as to when it remembers and when it doesn't.&nbsp;
 Sometimes, when multiple files are open, it remembers some of the files, but not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not usually create new documents from within the application.&nbsp; I used to create new documents by right-clicking in the folder, and creating a new Word document in the folder it is supposed to be in when I eventually save it.&nbsp; This no longer works (I
 just tested it).&nbsp; Word is offering this morning's folder, an unrelated project that I have not saved a document to today, only opened the first Word document today from that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem appears in Excel also, which is why I identify it as an Office problem, and not necessarily with Word or Excel.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems independent of the application version of the document, eg, 97-2003.doc files vs docx files.&nbsp;

<p>Yes, I'm referring to files saved on the local hard drive. From within Word, when I press F12 with a saved document A, Word always suggests the path for the folder where document A resides. This happens without exception. However, I guess it is possible
 that files saved to OneDrive (or some other cloud storage) behave differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing F12 with the insertion point inside an unsaved file, called "Document1," "Document2," etc. redirects to the folder defined by the File Locations dialog box (pressing Ctrl+S will do the same thing in this particular case). Again, I haven't tested
 the behavior for documents saved to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have been using the Windows shortcut New | Microsoft Word Document, you are explicitly creating a document with a path. That same folder will be suggested if you later resave with F12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you are using some sort of add-in with Word that could be affecting the suggested storage location. See what happens for a session started in Safe mode (see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued attention to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am failing to make myself understood.&nbsp; I have not done anything to my computer other than allow a push update from Microsoft about 11 days ago (note this is day before problem occurred).&nbsp; Files are saved to the harddrive, NOT OneDrive or anywhere
 else, or even a local server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you say as happening "without exception" is exactly what does not happen.&nbsp; "<span>From within Word, when I press F12 with a saved document A, Word &lt;&lt;&lt;DOES NOT&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest the path for the
 folder where document A resides." </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, please understand that I said that I do not usually create new documents.&nbsp; I only referred to this in reference to the discussion.&nbsp; The affected documents are either 1)&nbsp; documents that have resided in my document set, in their same location, for extended
 periods, or 2) existing documents from others that I place in specific folders, that I have not had in my machine before.&nbsp; Nonetheless, Office fails to remember the filepath for a Save As of existing documents.</p>

<p>I don't think either Stefan or I misunderstood what you wrote, despite the side issues. What Stefan described, and what you had until something changed, is the way Office is supposed to work and the way it still works for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my update history, a series of Office 2010 security updates was delivered here on June 12. The update numbers are KB4022199, KB3115197, and KB3115248 for Office in general, and KB4022209 for Excel (plus one for Outlook and one for Publisher).
 You may want to uninstall those updates to test whether the Save As behavior returns to usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you posted in the "Windows other" part of the forum, I gather that you're running Windows 7. The last update I see for that was on May 23, so I think a general Windows problem can be ruled out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stefan's suggestion of checking the add-ins may be worthwhile, but it would imply separate but similar add-ins in Word and in Excel.</p>

<p>I don't think either Stefan or I misunderstood what you wrote, despite the side issues. What Stefan described, and what you had until something changed, is the way Office is supposed to work and the way it still works for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my update history, a series of Office 2010 security updates was delivered here on June 12. The update numbers are KB4022199, KB3115197, and KB3115248 for Office in general, and KB4022209 for Excel (plus one for Outlook and one for Publisher).
 You may want to uninstall those updates to test whether the Save As behavior returns to usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you posted in the "Windows other" part of the forum, I gather that you're running Windows 7. The last update I see for that was on May 23, so I think a general Windows problem can be ruled out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stefan's suggestion of checking the add-ins may be worthwhile, but it would imply separate but similar add-ins in Word and in Excel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you, Jay.&nbsp; Yes, until about 10 days ago, Office was working correctly in this regard.&nbsp; Now it doesn't.&nbsp; I know an update was pushed, because I was prompted to allow a restart (end-of-day), and the issue was noted the next morning. The challenge is
 that I need to make progress, and cut through the discussion about the way Office is supposed to work, and get to the part about what I can do about the fact that it does not work that way for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On more than one occasion with technical issues, the information I need is hijacked by those that need to discuss the way its supposed to work, rather than what to do when it doesn't.&nbsp; Past experience with some of these experts has been they don't believe
 the user (ie, me) is reporting the problem correctly/accurately, because "that's not the way its supposed to work" and&nbsp;"that's not the way it works for me."&nbsp; This tendency has not been solely restricted to IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very hopeful that your specific guidance&nbsp;about&nbsp;<span>Office updates&nbsp;</span><span>KB4022199, KB3115197, and KB3115248 will productive.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow-up when back in the office about these updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>I suspect these over the updates specific to E</span><span>xcel, Outlook and Publisher</span><span>,
 as the common problem has been observed both Word and Excel.&nbsp; Although I work mostly in Word, I actually first noted it for an Excel file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you provide guidance about uninstalling specific updates?&nbsp; This was pushed to me automatically, and I don't know what my image restore point status is.&nbsp; In looking at my home system, I do not see any "update uninstall"
 feature.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Based on the other contributors to this thread, the add-ins I would like to trouble shoot are Office updates KB4022199, KB3115197, and KB3115248, which were pushed to my computer and implemented by re-start just before this problem occurred.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to uninstall these updates.&nbsp; It is my understanding the uninstalling pushed updates is not really possible, and it is up to the user to resolve the problem when the update causes the machine to fail in some way?&nbsp; And that the way to resolve
 bad updates is to reset to a restore point? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I also correct in understanding that when Microsoft pushes updates to users, it is up to the user to block the update process, set a restore point, and then return to the update and allow it to proceed? &nbsp; And that reason that the end user needs to do
 this is because Microsoft does not feel it worthwhile to trigger restore points, so that is why it is not included in the push?

<h2>            Embed email in Word for Macs</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to save an email on my new iMac, then drag it to a word document - or embed it in the Word for Macs documents any other way. We can insert photos and videos and a few other things, but not email. Windows does it easily but I converted to Mac
 because it's supposed to be so much easier/better. When I try, I get this message.</p>

<p>You're being provided misinformation. It makes no difference how you start your Mac or how many sacrifices you make to the computer gods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is that <em>Object Linking &amp; Embedding</em> [OLE] is a Windows technology which never has been fully implemented on the Mac operating system. Only Word &amp; Excel support OLE at all &amp; only their respective object types are embeddable/linkable. (<em>Pictures</em>
 are a different issue not handled in the same way.)</p>

<h2>            Excel Macro to Open files, Calculate, Saveas CSV, Save &#38; Close</h2>
                    <p>I have projects set up with identical folder structures. &nbsp;In these folders I have input files for another program all with the same name, so I keep them separated in the different folders. &nbsp;He is an example of the folder and file structure</p>
<p>
</p><p>Y:\project name\Synchro\</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AM\Volume.xls</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PM\Volume.xls</p>

<p><br />
I need to open, calculate, Saveas CSV, save and close the volume.xls files in a loop to get all of them updated. &nbsp;I have a macro that does the save as csv, save and close, but I have to manually open each file first. &nbsp;I would like to automate that process in
 a macro, but have no idea how to get the open routine to work with the folder structure. &nbsp;What should I do? &nbsp;There can be more files in various folders, but I can figure that out if someone can get me started.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use Windows 10 and Office 2013 (Surface Pro 3). </p>
<p>What I want to do is to use OneNote completely locally, i e storing everything on my own hard disk and not do any back up to OneDrive and also if necessary&nbsp; use Onenote without being connected to internet at all. That does not seem to be possible as when
 I try to open OneNote I am asked to log on to my Microsoft account or I cannot continue.
</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate a solution.</p>
