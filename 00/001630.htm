    <title>Windows 8.1 Phone Dialer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidmeads  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Phone Dialer</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the days of the old Nokia phones you most phones have allowed the typing of a persons name in the dialer to find the person in your contacts list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost every dialer app for windows 8 does this, but the default dialer doesn't</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not? Seems like a basic thing to miss off and is ruining an otherwise excellent phone experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, using an app isn't an option as you have to click through to the main dialer and you don't get history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoped that it would get added in 8.1, but no, so now because of this I may more away from MS phones. A real shame</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>Yes, I know that, but it's hardly convenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it may seem minor, but since the&nbsp;nokia 6310 in 2002, it was possible to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting there though people requires no end of key presses, often on a keyboard rather than a phone touch pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems a poor argument that the reason this easy to implement bit of technology that people clearly want isn't done is because there is another way that isn't as good!</p>

    <title>External Caller unable to ring Hosted Voicemail UM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevincoates7748  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Caller unable to ring Hosted Voicemail UM</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have on-premises Lync but have Hosted Voicemail UM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I'm having is that when I call the Subscriber number (Direct LIne number) from an internal Lync client, I get the Welcome message. &nbsp;However, when I ring from a mobile, I can see the call connects but I just get silence. It hangs up the call after
 about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>So this also happens if I call a user who diverted their Lync to Voicemail, I just get silence.</p>
<p>If an internal user rings another internal user within Lync, they can hear the greeting so the main issue I think is the UM number is not accessible to external callers.</p>
<p>I've checked OCS Logger and can't see anything untoward (I'm not the best and may have missed something though). I can see the call coming in and then going through to exap.um.outlook.com. &nbsp;I then&nbsp;just see a BYE message when the call hangs up.</p>
<p>Just looking for some guidance from someone who may have had this problem as I'm not sure if problem relates to the SBC (AudioCodes), OnPremises Lync or the Exchange UM Dial Plan I've setup through Office 365.
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

    <title>deleting notebooks from onenote online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loriwegman  say:</h3>
<h2>            deleting notebooks from onenote online</h2>
                    
<p>I am a teacher. My district has an institutional 365 account. &nbsp;I am playing around with OneNote and class notebooks and have&nbsp;created a few test notebooks. I would now like to delete the test notebooks. I have deleted them from Onedrive. However, all the
 notebooks still remain as "ghosts" when I click on the "Onenote Online" tab on the apps page. I read a post from another teacher experiencing this same phenomena. &nbsp;The reply was asking if they had a "manage and delete" feature in OneNote online? &nbsp;I do not
 have this feature. &nbsp; Can you please advise as to how I can clean up my OneNote online so that it is not cluttered with obsolete notebooks?</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Lori Wegman</p>

<p>hi lori,</p>
<p>we cannot delete a notebook in onenote online, generally, we just delete the notebook from where we create it. from your description, i’d like to confirm whether you can open those notebooks when you click them in onenote online.
<br />
if you cannot open them, you can hover over those notebooks icons and click the x to remove them as below. then reload the page to see the outcome. generally, the notebooks icons will show in onenote online page for easier access if we opened those notebooks
 recently. after we delete the notebooks, the icons may not disappear so soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12872d8e-2c90-4674-8dfe-35bab5cf9db4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12872d8e-2c90-4674-8dfe-35bab5cf9db4" /></a><br />
if you can still open them, you may not delete them successfully and i suggest you double check it. if you create those notebooks via onenote class notebook creator app in sharepoint online, an eduonenoteappdocuments library would be created to store the notebooks
 you created. you can find the library by going to onedrive from your office 365 account&gt;clicking
<strong>settings</strong> icon on the upper-right of the page&gt; clicking <strong>site contents</strong>&gt;searching for
<strong>eduonenoteappdocument</strong> library and deleting the test notebooks in it. if they are normal notebooks, you may need to delete them from where you created them.</p>
<p>for anything unclear, feel free to post back when you have time. you can upload related screenshots by clicking
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then clicking the icon of <strong>
insert media</strong>.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>No, when I click on them from this location I get the 404 File Not Found message. &nbsp;So I know I deleted them, this is just a ghost icon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately none of those options are available to me. &nbsp;When I hover over, there is no X. &nbsp;When I go into site contents, there is no EduOneNoteAppDocument library. &nbsp;I was able to finally get some of them to go away in this list by going into my desktop
 version of OneNote and "closing the notebook". &nbsp;However, I still have quite a list - some of which were shared with me by other folks and I cannot get rid of - much like in the "shared with me" folder in my One Drive. &nbsp;At least there I have a search tool to
 weed through all the obsolete files folks have shared with me as they are playing in the system and learning. &nbsp;I have absolutely no way to organize or manage the notebooks that show up in my OneNote online. &nbsp;Could this be a setting by my district administrators?
 &nbsp;Would Microsoft consider building in a search feature, or allowing users to organize/manage the shared content more?</p>

<p>Hi Harrison,</p>
<p>For the files without the X option, they are not deleted successfully. And there is a default file named Username@Work which could not be deleted.<br />
For the files shared with us by other users, we can still remove them by clicking the X in OneNote Online though the files are not feasible to remove from Shared with Me folder in OneDrive for Business.<br />
According to my test, if we delete the files successfully but the icons still show up in OneNote Online after we reload the page, we need to clear the
<strong>Recent Notebook</strong> list in local OneNote application by going to OneNote&gt;<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Open</strong>&gt;<strong>Open from other locations</strong>&gt;<strong>Recent Notebook</strong>&gt;Right-click the obsolete notebooks&gt;<strong>Remove
 from list</strong>. If this is the case, could you try to clear the Recent Notebook list to see the outcome?</p>
<p>If you still have trouble to remove those icons, the issue may be an unique one and we would like to confirm more details for further troubleshooting.<br />
1. Do those files have something in common? Are they stored in the same place? Are they shared with you by other members?<br />
2. Have you ever opened them in local OneNote application?<br />
3. Have you ever opened them on other machines?<br />
4. Do other people have the same issue?</p>
<p>For any updates, feel free to post back when you have time.</p>
<p>Thanks, <br />

            Thanks for reading and responding to my measly two cents. Yes, maybe there are some decent free apps out there for such tasks. Free apps? Hmmm. I'm concerned about what these "free" apps may be doing in the background, not to mention the annoying ads.
 Maybe it's a false sense of security but I feel much safer using the apps included and developed by the OS manufacturers, especially as most of my documents contain sensitive customer and personal information. I literally run my business through my phone these
 days. Apple is looking to be the most complete, stable, secure and cost effective solution. I haven't given up all hope yet but getting close.&nbsp;

<p>First time posting here, but I just had to reply...</p>

</p><p>I'm in the same boat as you, sorta.&nbsp; I started a&nbsp;bit earlier on than 95 though and I do it professionally, freelance, for about 3 dozen companies in my area.&nbsp; I really don't understand your gripes here...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never known of MS to give their spreadsheet app away for free, not even on Macs, and most business Mac users do buy Office for Mac.&nbsp; So this to me is a non-issue.&nbsp; Myself and my clients pay for it without gripe about what can be had for free or with
 ads or over the cloud or&nbsp;whatever else may come along.&nbsp; When it's used to make money, the cost isn't significant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact visual voicemail is an extra cost for you tells me you use likely use Verizon as a carrier.&nbsp; They are known for always charging for anything anyone really wants.&nbsp; If they had a way of removing callerID output to cell phones they would charge you
 for that service as well...&nbsp; For this&nbsp;the only&nbsp;advise there is would be to&nbsp;switch to AT&amp;T or another carrier that does provide the service for free.&nbsp; It won't matter what brand device you use...</p>

            I use full Excel and Word on my iPhone for free. Why does MS give it away to Apple users and not to their own? I don't expect MS to provide it free to all devices but would it hurt to let us have it on our phones? Especially with the renowned scarcity
 of good apps in the MS Store. Got to win folks over somehow. Why not by providing the same free products others are including? Apple's spreadsheet app called Pages functions just as well and it's free. Now, about the Visual Voicemail, or lack there of. Apple
 pays for and provides the service for Verizon iPhone users. Pretty nice coming from a company I've always considered to be greedy. Maybe it should be free and provided by Verizon but Apple covered it. What's MS doing to please and win over mobile phone users?
 I believe more and more of us are using our phones more than any other device we own. Therefore when shopping for other devices such as laptops, tablets and desktops the brands chosen will likely be centered around the phones we own. I kn

            <p>I've never seen a Windows Phone without Excel and Word and never seen any associated cost.&nbsp; Where are you getting information that they will have some sort of associated cost?&nbsp; In fact, with the new phones and Continuum, you'll be able to use the free/included
 MSOffice apps in a more traditional desktop format if you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether Apple is paying Verizon out of the profits on the phone you bought, or you are paying them for the service directly, it's still something that is being charged for by the carrier.&nbsp; If anyone is greedy, it is Verizon...&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;has nothing to do with
 MS, I'd complain about it being a pay service that comes out of your pocket either way no matter what phone I used.&nbsp; Verizon stands alone in charging for&nbsp;VV as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your complaints have zero validity...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What MS is doing to win over customers: producing a secure platform with most of the more common functionality built-in; functions&nbsp;that other platforms require additional apps&nbsp;to perform.&nbsp; How many different flashlight apps do Android and iPhone have in
 their stores anyway?&nbsp;&nbsp;7 and 8 had quite a few starting to fill their stores, which is silly.&nbsp; MS built it into 8.1 &amp; 10 as a basic feature in their notification/action dropdown...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has created a long hard road for themselves with what they've been trying to accomplish, and the vision has undergone some radical changes over time, but it seems to finally be coming all together.&nbsp; Last thing they need is folk spewing incorrect information.&nbsp;
 I don't care if someone feels the need to "kick them while they're down" on something legitimate, but your complaints are not.</p>

            <p>You may be the only one prompted, your initial post didn't explain anything.&nbsp; It seemed like random baseless complaints.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of quirks in the latest builds on the older phones.&nbsp; The few I have running 10 it seems like with&nbsp;nearly every&nbsp;new build I&nbsp;need to use the device recovery tool to take them back to the original 8 and 8.1 installations, then enroll in the
 Insider app and go through all the updates, and once the latest build of 10 is in, reset it to get rid of leftover 8 and 8.1 stuff that doesn't seem to upgrade properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes they seem to work ok without a reset, but you'll notice little features&nbsp;not
 working or things sending you back to&nbsp;the Start screen often.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen some pretty wild&nbsp;issues in the upgrades within the insider program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes various features like Glance and the Call/SMS filters won't work.&nbsp; Sometimes you'll have random unlabeled Store app updates.&nbsp; One had two "Settings" listed in the all
 apps view where one takes ya to the old 8.1 style settings list and the other takes you to the newer nested 10 style settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another (which I think may relate to your issue) somewhere along the line downloaded a "Get Office" app from the store and ended up with it set as default for Office files.&nbsp; It didn't work in that particular instance, but from what I've seen of the desktop
 "Get Office" app, it directs you to get Office 365 (even if you have the full Office Professional installed).&nbsp; Perhaps you ended up with a working instance of it?</p>

            Okay, I'll gladly give it a whirl. Had no idea it could be a glitch. I'll be sure to edit my comments on this subject if all goes well with resetting and/or restoring back to 8.1 and starting over. Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp;

 Please help.<br />

            <p>Hi Hayatur Rashid,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; The Windows phone will provide access to browse the internet using the built in Internet Explorer app, as well as the ability to install apps which have been published in the Windows Phone marketplace.&nbsp; If Bangla News has a website, this should provide
 access through the Internet browser but please keep in mind that Flash and Java are not supported.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; You may consider contacting the developers of Operamini to check in and see if they have pans on releasing a version for the Windows Phone.&nbsp; Untill the app is released for the Windows Phone platform, it will not be able to be installed on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
&nbsp;Greg<br />

<h2>            Need Assistance Creating Custom Filter Formula - MSP 2010 Professional</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to create a filter in the Filter Definition Dialog Box which looks something like this:</p>
<p><em><br />
Start | is greater than or equal to | Date1</em></p>
<p><em>AND </em><em>Start | is less than or equal to | Date2</em></p>
<p><br />
Here is where I'm having my problem. I created a custom date field in the Gantt Chart view and chose
<strong>Date1</strong>. I then entered today's date, so I typed <strong>[Current Date]</strong> directly into a cell within the column.
</p>
<p>MS Project came back with the following error: <em>"Invalid Date. This is not a valid date, or it is outside the range for dates, which is January 1, 1984 through December 31, 2049. Type the date in the correct format: for example 6/15/00 or June 15, 2000."
</em></p>
<p>Did I type the formula wrong?</p>
<p><br />
I also created a second date field chose <strong>Date2</strong>. I need Project to calculate a day 14 calendar days from the current date, so in the Date2 field, I typed
<strong>DateAdd("d", 14,[Current Date])</strong>. I received the same error: <em>
"Invalid Date. This is not a valid date, or it is outside the range for dates, which is January 1, 1984 through December 31, 2049. Type the date in the correct format: for example 6/15/00 or June 15, 2000."
</em></p>
<p><br />
I do not know what I am doing wrong. Can you please help?</p>
<p><br />
V/r,</p>
<p>Megan </p>

            <p>Ok, so the good news is, I figured out how to enter a formula in a custom field. I went to Project &gt; Custom Fields and I selected the two dates fields I wanted to use: Date1 and Date2.<br />
<br />
Now there is a problem with my filter. This is what I'm trying to say:<br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>Start | is greater than or equal to | Today</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>AND Start | is less than or equal to | 14 calendar days from Today</strong></em></p>
<p><br />
To achieve the above, I typed this, but it did not work.&nbsp; Project stated "The entry is not valid.&nbsp; The test value cannot be used with the field for the data you want to find or filter for."<br />
<br />
<strong>Start | is greater than or equal to | [Date1]</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND Start | is less than or equal to | [Date2]</strong></p>
<p><br />
I also tried:<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Start | is great than or equal to | "Please Enter Date"?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND Start | is less than or equal to | [Date2]</strong></p>
<p><br />
That did not work; Project came back with the same error message as above.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You do not put these formulas in a cell like in Excel but in the formula window of a custom field.</p>
<p>Right-click on the Date1 or Date2 header, custom fields, Formula. In that form the formula will go. OK twice and there you are.</p>

<p>Ridiculous it is, but in Project 2010 and 2013 Start is a text field not a date field. Use Scheduked Start and it will work.</p>

            <p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using "<em>Scheduled Start</em>" worked when I used the following custom filter:<br />
<br />
<strong>Scheduled Start | is greater than or equal to | [Date1]</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scheduled Start | is less than or equal to | [Date2]<br />
</strong><br />
[Date1]= <strong>Date()</strong></p>
<p>[Date2]= <strong>DateAdd("d", 14,[Current Date])<br />
</strong><br />
but now I am trying to use an interactive filter and I'm having problems.&nbsp; I think there is something wrong with the info in my [Date2] formula,&nbsp;<strong>DateAdd("d", 14,[Current Date])</strong>, because it is written to add 14 days to the
<em>current date,</em> and not a random date&nbsp;the user enter's in the first condition.&nbsp; What function do I need to replace [Current Date] with in my [Date2] formula&nbsp;so that it will add 14 calendar days&nbsp;based on the date the user enters?</p>
<p><br />
If I fix [Date2]'s formula, is this written properly to give me the correct results?<br />
<br />
<em>Scheduled Start | is greater than or equal to | "Please Enter Date"?</em></p>
<p><em>AND</em></p>
<p><em>Scheduled Start | is less than or equal to | [Date2]</em></p>
<p><br />
Thanks,</p>

    <title>Can I switch off Bing Image Search suggestions via Group policy , or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> realitydysfunction  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I switch off Bing Image Search suggestions via Group policy , or at all.</h2>
                    <p>I have some users using Bing.com as a search engine but I have problems when they use image search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open image search it default searches for UK landscape and this shows up in our internet filtering software, however all the suggested searches&nbsp;also show up as being done at the same time in our software.</p>
<p>This becomes an issue when users start trying to get around image filtering by looking at for instance selfies or swimsuits, even with strict filtering some of the suggestions border on pornography and would be blocked if you actually clocked on them, these
 also show up as being searched for in our filtering software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically I want to switch off this suggestions&nbsp;function if possible, or we may have to remove Bing access for our 30,000 users.</p>
<p>Ideally I would want to disable this via Group Policy but if there is some other way I could probably implement it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Tony,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I am not 100% sure and I will let someone else confirm this, but I believe FSO.CopyFolder will only copy the folder itself along with any of its subfolders.<span>&nbsp;</span>I
 would think you could then follow this command with the FSO.CopyFile command like you have done in order to copy the files.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>As far as your FSO.CopyFile code, I used code similar to the following and it worked as expected:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>FSO.CopyFile "C:\test.accdb", "C:\Temp\test.accdb", True</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you sure the file is not being overwritten?<span>&nbsp;</span>To test this, open up the database you copied into your destination folder and make
 a change to it.<span>&nbsp;</span>Then run your code and open up the database in the destination folder again.<span>&nbsp;</span>When I did this, the change I just made to the database was back to the way it was in the original file.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Binding to scroll event in IE11 and IE10 doesn&#39;t work on horizontal scroll bar</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a strange issue in Internet Explorer 11 and 10 when I am trying to bind to a horizontal scroll bar using jQuery. The scroll event is fired when dragging the scroll bar but when clicking the horizontal left and right arrows the event isn't fired.
 The event fires as expected when the are clicked on the vertical scroll bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a JS Fiddle to demonstrate the issue: <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lkb91xtq/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://jsfiddle.net/Lkb91xtq/1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The above will work on Edge, Chrome, Firefox etc. but not IE 10 or IE 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an issue with IE? Is there a workaround for the issue?</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Nokia messaging does not work with a bluewin.ch account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I would like to setup my bluewin e-mail account on my Nokia 6700 classic. I think the only way to do this is via Nokia messaging and to select "Other...". At least I have not found any other E-mail application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does work like that for my gmx.net account, but NOT for my bluewin.ch account which I would definitely prefer. I persistently get "Communication error" after entering E-mail address &amp; password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Since you mention the "3 pc limit" I assume you have the "Retail" edition of Home and Student.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Simply use the disk and product key to install and activate on the new computer. If internet activation does not work, then you will have to do phone activation. When you phone in, don't enter any infornation until it offers you the option of talking to
 a live service rep. Then explain to them tha you are transferring the intallation from a broken computer. They should enable the activation system to allow you to finish your activation.</p>

How product activation works
<p><span>Product activation is a simple, straightforward process that is completely software based. In most cases, the only information that
 is needed to activate a product is an installation ID, which is created by the software itself.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The activation tool collects info about the hardware and software environment, then generates a unique hash value so that MS cannot identify specific elements on the computer to uniquely identify you.</span></p>

            I'm not at my computer at the moment. I can try that when I get back but I don't think that will help a lot. Like I mentioned I also tried it on android, mac and a linux machine and I got the same error. On the Android phone I even tried it using wifi
 and the phone's internet. Maybe it's somehow linked to my region?

    <title>Migration of Outlook 2007 data to new computer with new installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djv1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migration of Outlook 2007 data to new computer with new installation of retail Office 2010 Professional</h2>
                    
<p>Have Dell XPS 410 running WIN7 Home Prem. (upgraded a year ago from Vista) with Office Professional 2007. I have used Outlook 2007 and want to have my Outlook 2007 personal folders and archive .pst info used on my new computer (HP HPE-450t) (slso Win7 Home
 P) where I will install a new retail version of&nbsp; Office Pro. 2010.</p>
<p>I have viewed many conflicting answers on how <strong>best</strong> to do this. Most say to move the pst file to the new pc and before starting the new outlook to&nbsp;set the&nbsp;Outlook 2007 .pst file as the default (from control panel&gt;mail.) &nbsp;&nbsp;I also note answers
 saying to export/import, but responses that this takes more steps and can loose data. Then, I note a microsoft article about the pst format in 2010 having a larger file size limit and that to convert to it to export the 2007 pst to the 2010 pst.</p>
<p>So, what is it? I don't particularly want to experiment, but want to pick up on my new computer with my old data intact.</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The simplest way to achieve your aim is to install Office 2010 on the new PC.<br />
Run Outlook to create a new profile.<br />
Copy your PST file from the 2007 PC to the 2010 PC.<br />
Open the 2007 PST from the Outlook File menu.<br />
Also from the File menu &gt; Data Management. Set the old file as the default data source.<br />
Close the 'new' empty file.<br />
You are in business.</p>

<br />
According to the above, there are indeed differences in the unicode .pst file of 2010 from the unicode .pst file in 2007. So my questions still stand.</p>

<p>Thanks to all for the help. I followed Graham's advice by:</p>
<p>(Had both computers on Win7 Home Group).</p>
<p>Copied outlook.pst from old PC location C:\users\xxx\AppData\local\microsoft\Outlook\ to location on new PC C:\users\xxx\Documents\Outlook Files. Pop up says file already exists (had not set up any emails yet), do I want to replace. Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>I also copied over my existing archive. There was a default archive created by the new Outlook, which I kept.</p>
<p>Under email account options (after adding the emails (which also sets up a separate pst file for each email)) I set them to all open in the outlook.pst inbox.</p>
<p>I now have all my calendars, journal entries, tasks, emails, old archives (static) and new archives (from time forward).</p>

    <title>News Web Part Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edneim  say:</h3>
<h2>            News Web Part Bug</h2>
                    <p>We have a bug with the News web part in SharePoint Online. When it is configured to display the current site news (NewSource = 1). The "See All" link is no longer displayed. The feeling that it is being displayed intermittently because as soon as the editing
 of the properties of the web part is finished OR we return to the page via browsing history of the browser, the link is displayed. But when we refresh the page (F5) it is hidden again. Really an inconvenient behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, when visible, the link redirects to the NEWS.ASPX page. And that page only lists, under these conditions, only the first 50 news. No paging option is displayed and no more items load during scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have identified that the navigation problem does not occur if the news source is the HUB as a whole (NewSource = 2) or pre-determined sites (NewSource = 3). That way, we modified the link to call the NEWS.aspx page with the parameters for a pre-determined
 site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any predictions for correcting this behavior? I've tested on other tenants and the behavior is the same.</p>

<p>Hi EDNEIM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your detailed information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "See all" link disappearing, I would suggest you try another browser and clear cache in the original browser to monitor if "See all" link displays intermittently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the page only displays 50 news via See all, it's a normal behavior. We could click Manage posts in /news.aspx page. Then enter Site Page (Not Site Page &gt;User name) and we could see all news.aspx created by all people.

<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs in more than one browser and on different workstations. Even in a newly installed.&nbsp;Apparently it's some problem with the News Web Part and the Site HUB.&nbsp;I will simulate in another environment and forward to you,</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but that does not make sense. IF I select in the News Web Part the option HUB or 'Selected Site' the page lists ALL the news. That is well over 50. The 50 news behavior only occurs when the option
 selected is 'This Site'. Please test. It does not make sense that the 'See All' feature only shows ALL in 2/3 of the scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi EDNEIM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updated information and test content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, "See all" can display when the items are more than 4 items. To narrow down the issue, you could also try other accounts in different computers to see if the issue is related to account or computers. We would
<span>gladly </span>like to know the test result you mentioned in another environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the view number, per my test, it's consistent with your test results. It displays 50 items when we select "This Site". As a workaround, we could choose "Selected Site" with current site, which display all items via See all. To address your concerns,
 I would still suggest and encourage you deliver a new idea regarding this in<span>

<h2>            Recover Office 2010 Professional license from crashed computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have Office 2010 professional and have used all 3 of my licenses. They are used on&nbsp;two desktops and&nbsp;one laptop. One of my desktop computers just crashed and burned due to a power surge. Can I recover the license off the crashed computer and use on a
 new computer? If so, how can I do this? My old computer does not even start now.

<p>I don't believe you can delete the calendar or clear entries&nbsp;on the my phone site. You can however unselect it on your phone in the My Phone application under Menu-&gt;&nbsp;Sync Options&nbsp;and it will no longer synch with My Phone, this may clear it of all the current
 entries. (I can't test it because I am using an Exchange server and&nbsp;the option&nbsp;is greyed out because the calendar is backed up on the Exchange Server)</p>
<p>Note: you can also free up space by archive items.</p>

<p>Pretty sure google mobile is not a pay service. That is one way to sync contacts/calendar. See here:<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/winmo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/mobile/winmo/</a><br />
<br />
Another way to sync contacts/calendar is MyPhone service:<br />

<br />
Here is another way to get contacts to the phone:<br />

<br />
You can also sync contacts only with Mobile Live on device and Windows Live client on PC:<br />

<p>Greetings mcwl!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that you check out your network settings to ensure that you are not setup incorrectly.&nbsp; Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Connections (icon) &gt; Advanced (tab) &gt; Select Networks (button).&nbsp; Based on your problem description,
 I'm going to guess that you find the top (internet) and bottom (private network) settings both set to "My Work Network".&nbsp; In order to use your data-plan, you need to redirect traffic back to "The Internet" or "Data Plan" (depending on what your Dataplan profile
 is called).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can go to Configure Network Adapters (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Connections (icon) &gt; Advanced (tab) &gt; Network Card (button)) to make sure that your cards (WiFi radio and PCS Dataplan radio) are set to use separate networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know how this works...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Online journaling</h2>
                    
<p>We have O365 educations for student and education for staff licenses.&nbsp; We are using on-prem journaling, but I wonder if there is online journaling available. We'd like to have journaling for legal matter.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
