<h2>            All my Outlook email groups have disappeared this morning</h2>
                    <p>All of my outlook email "groups" have disappeared. My "contacts" are all still there, but the "groups" I created are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a number of others are having similar issues but no one from outlook has provided an answer, they keep asking the same questions: 1. Tell us how you check your email, 2. Have you made in recent changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recipients respond, they never hear back from the moderators again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my email "groups" nearly ever day. However, when I woke up this morning, I found all my "groups" had disappeared from my account. (I check my email through outlook.com via the web browser, I also have the outlook app on my android phone and kindle
 tablet. No...I haven't made in recent changes to my account in the last year.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My groups are very important. Please let us know why they have magically disappeared for no reason. If this keeps up...Gmail here I come!</p>

            <p>The link you sent me to wasn't helpful. It basically made the suggestion that if I scroll down through my contacts that my groups would still be there. They're not. I wouldn't be contacting you if they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your second suggestion was to log into people.live.com and check whether they have returned. Did you do something within the last hour that would make them return?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked: They are still gone.</p>

            <p>This is not helpful at all. &nbsp;It deals with a very old version - back in 2013, and does not answer the question.</p>
<p>I have the same problem as Michael - this morning I find in outlook that my groups have disappeared from my contact list in People. &nbsp;I use outlook.com (used to be hotmail) with chrome browser, but the same appears in internet explorer. &nbsp;I use this for all
 the direct mailings in our business and this entire process is thus stuffed. &nbsp;Please get it sorted</p>

            <p>No. What I've seen is the same international guy comes on after someone makes a comment, he gives you a single Unhelpful response, as if that solves everything, and then you never hear from him again. I've never seen anyone get more than one single Unhelpful
 response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to rebuild my groups. If this happens again I'm pulling everything out of outlook and moving to gmail. I hate that since I've been using Hotmail over 15 years.</p>
<p>

            Thanks, thats how it appeared to me. &nbsp;Alot of folk seem to have got their groups back after a few days tho &nbsp;- like Msoft were migrating something and the process wasnt complete or didnt work properly. &nbsp;How long ago was your initial post? &nbsp;I feel the same
 way about dumping Msoft but have struggled to get on with the way gmail handle conversations and replies, but now I feel like I cannot trust hotmail - what else is likely to disappear? &nbsp;I do keep a read across with gmail so I have another copy of all received
 mails, but not what I send. &nbsp;How long has this problem been going on as you've researched it (this time round, I see stuff from back in 2013, which must be an older version problem)?

<p>Same problem here. As of&nbsp;two days ago I noticed contacts missing from my groups which I constructed over the years and would be a very long (almost impossible) task to try re-creating them. Per other users experience, I'm hoping (as yourself) that the groups
 will be restore soon. How long it will take? Am I going to be fortunate as the others that went thru the same&nbsp;issue to have mine restored too? Just hoping for the best ...</p>
<p>I noticed other people associate this problem with a new version called "Preview" but I don't have that yet. Also, I noticed that in my remaining contacts in my groups there are Skype contacts (probably of the people that are actually my email (Outlook)
 contacts. I've never used their Skype contacts but somehow now they are in my groups but I never had them before or put them there. Meantime, most of my email contacts disappeared from groups.</p>
<p>Just for clarification: it seems all individual contacts are still in place but just missing from groups.</p>
<p>I'm following a few threads dealing with the same problem as it seems that though we experience the same major problem of having our groups messed up (contacts missing or groups disappearing completely) everyone's experience may be a little different. Just
 trying to learn if anyone comes upon any explanation or fix for this. Thanks everyone for reading. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Wasnt sure I could locate the process again! &nbsp;But I think this is it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your gMail account select Settings (cog on the rhs); Accounts and Import; (scroll down some)&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Check email from other accounts (using POP3):&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1); font-weight: bold">Add
 a POP3 mail account that you own.</span></p>
<p>Follow the instructions, I cant remember if there were any glitches for a Msoft account, but I dont think so.
 &nbsp;The help is pretty good on this, with recommended settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I do remember is that I also tried something in Outlook, sort of in reverse. &nbsp;This set up a sort of perpetual loop between the two accounts, which I had to disable before the account blew up! &nbsp;So dont try it! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never quite worked out how to get a copy of my outgoing Sent mails. &nbsp;If you tracked down a way to do this, I'd like to have it.</p>

<p>hi dale,</p>
<p><span>sometimes, it needs up to 24 hours for exchange online to provision the mailbox. and there is no measure to speed the progress up. so i suggest you wait for a little longer after assigning the license to the user.
 thanks for your patience and understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>if this mailbox is not prepared after 24 hours, please send us this affected user’s email address in private message via
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations. and please send us a screenshot of the license has been assigned to this user as below:</span><br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>EDIT: The problem seems to be solved.</p>
<p>I seem to have the same problem, a user mailbox has been stuck with that status since creation. I tried deleting and recreating the user after the initial 24 hour wait but still the same.</p>
<p>Its on a federated setup.</p>
<p>I checked the service health status and there seem to be some problems with delegating mailbox permissions and restoring deleted mailboxes. incident EX44184. Could that also affect mailbox creations?</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>This issue was posted to the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident EX44184 starting at March 5, 2016 08:00:00 AM. The user experience of this incident is: Affected users are unable to use the "Undo-SoftDeletedMailbox" command in PowerShell. If you recently
 deleted a mailbox within your organization and are attempting to restore it, users will be unable to access that mailbox until the deployment of the code fix is complete. Please note that no mailbox data has been lost. Tenant administrators can view current
 information and updates on SHD at the link here &lt;<a href="https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#@/ServiceStatus/ServiceStatusHistory.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#@/ServiceStatus/ServiceStatusHistory.aspx</a>&gt;</p>
<p>If you are experiencing a similar issue and do not see an SHD post, please let us know by sharing your tenant information via Private Message (PM) below as this may indicate either a scoping issue or an independent problem.<br />

<p>That is true , it is affecting all customers as per Microsoft. But there should be a workaround till it resolved. As you can imagine the user who needs his/her mailbox can't use it until a new mailbox created.
</p>
<p>We have created a temp mailbox due to this case and waiting ... when it will resolve we can disable the new mailbox and import all new emails to old mailbox when it re-connect..</p>

<p>HI DaleFindlater,</p>
<p>Is your issue resolved ? If not, please check if that softdeleted mailbox is having NetID attribute null.</p>
<p>get-mailbox "alias" -inactivemailboxOnly | fl name,NetID</p>
<p>If so, then you need to check with Microsoft to restore the NetID from backend.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to set default tab stops for all new documents&#63;</h2>
                    I would like every new document I open to have my preferred tab stops of .25. I can change it in one document, but saving as default saves all my other settings (font, line spacing, etc.) but not the tab stops.

<p>If you want to change the setting for default tab stops, you have to do that in your template. Open the template as a document, make the change, save and close the template file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not using a specific template, your documents make use of the default Normal.dotm template which you can open quickly by using the following macro "trick": Press Alt+F11 to display the Visual Basic Editor. (Depending on your keyboard, you may
 have to press Alt+FN+F11 or Alt+F-LOCK+F11 to make the function keys work.) In the Editor, click View | Immediate window. Type in
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument</p>
<p>
</p><p>and press Enter. The Normal template opens in a different window (and you should now close the Visual Basic Editor). Make the desired changes, save and close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new settings for default tab stops apply to future documents that you create.</p>

                    <p>I've installed Windows 10 on a Dell Venue 10 and I hate that the modern apps open in windows. For a touch interface it doesn't feel right. This now feels like Windows 8 with broken touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway of defaulting the Modern apps to open full screen, instead of having to tap the small icon in the top left, then touch full screen, also rotation doesnt work well if its full screen, it tries to jump out of fullscreen mode, but fails to and
 causes issues.</p>

            Try swiping in from the left, it'll take you to task view or whatever its called which shows all your opened windows and there you can click the X on that app. Kinda like the old swipe left from 8.1. I'm having this issue too, I can't wait until they update
 the build with more touch friendly stuff. This is the kind of stuff we should be reporting to them to improve on.

            This is more of a Windows question for this forum: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/performance<br />
<br />
You have tell your video driver to rotate the display.&nbsp; If you have an addin video card, you will almost certainly have a custom tool to handle this for you.&nbsp; My HP has an ATI / Radeon card, it uses a program called "Catalyst Control Center"<br />
<br />
On my Vista machine, If I right click on the desktop I see an entry for "catalyst control center".&nbsp; Otherwise you will have to use the "Personalize" option in that context menu (I think it is slightly different in XP). In the Display Settings dialog, click
 on the "Advanced Settings" button.&nbsp; You will have to click around to find the option to rotate the screen.<br />

<p>We?&nbsp; Did I miss the announcement of when and how the collective group "we" was formed?&nbsp;&nbsp;"We" implies anyone&nbsp;who posts an&nbsp;answer here.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;are&nbsp;speaking for yourself&nbsp;and perhaps a few others but you are certainly&nbsp;not speaking for me!<br />
<br />
Personally I&nbsp;think pointing out the&nbsp;"Mark it" and "Helpful" buttons or lobbying for&nbsp;recognition/votes/points in any manner&nbsp;is downright&nbsp;silly.&nbsp; I mean come on, is a gold star by your name really that important?&nbsp; People coming here for answers don't have to
 pay anyone or anything.&nbsp; Of course you are going to continue to do&nbsp;as you please, but I for one wish that you would leave it up to the forum owner/moderators to formulate what "we" want&nbsp;or what "we" appreaciate and only post what you want or&nbsp;would appreciate.</p>

            Ouch. &lt;grin&gt;<br />
<br />
How about a "royal we" ... no ...&nbsp; OK, I tweaked it and removed the "offensive" "we" ...<br />
<br />
No, I don't particularly care about the gold star or the brownie points. I do care the "quality" of replies that are marked as answers because I use them to answer similar questions.&nbsp; It seems the "average" user, someone here once or twice, isn't figuring out
 the "intuitive" confirmation process of "Mark" or "Yes". Why do I say that? Because most of the answers I see have been marked by Moderators. But unless the original poster has put in a "thank you" reply, how can the moderators possibly know if the poster
 has fixed their problem, or that they even found the final&nbsp; answer that worked at this forum and not somewhere else.<br />

<p><br />
I didn't mean to offend you or&nbsp;sound pompous.&nbsp; I just don't think you should speak for the group in that manner.
</p>
<p><br />
I see nothing wrong with the moderators marking questions answered.&nbsp; Lets face it, the answer to 1 + 1 = 2 regardless if the person asking the question marked it answered, found the answer helpful, or even saw the answer for that matter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the average user thinks the inutitive "Was this helpful" and and "Mark it" is just&nbsp;as silly as I do?&nbsp;I think people come here looking&nbsp;for answers and have&nbsp;little interest in feeding Microsoft metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they want to vote a post helpful, fine.&nbsp; If
 they want to mark an&nbsp;answer, fine.&nbsp; If they don't want to do either, that is fine too.&nbsp; It isn't really important if they do or don't.&nbsp; If you could&nbsp;draw a circle around the "Yes" and draw and arrow&nbsp;pointing&nbsp;it out, would you?&nbsp; Where do you stop?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hey greg.<br />
<br />
No problem at all. I did say I was &lt;grin&gt;ing. This channel is so narrow to easy to misinterpret.<br />
<br />
I though your point about my (mis-)use of the "royal we" was reasonable so I made some changes to me tag line.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't think asking a happy (they got FREE help resolving their problem !) poster to take a second and mark replies as helpful or answer is too much.&nbsp; I certainly don't see it as metric hunting. It is simply asking for confirmation which
 reply was on the point of their problem.&nbsp; I disagree, at times if you (mis)use Excel or Windows calculator 2+2=3.9999. Given the vague nature of many of the question from simple, non-technologically-oriented users there are many possible answers. Just because
 a reply is "reasonable" (by definition when we reply we think they all are, aren't they?) does not mean it is the right answer for this person, because they haven't formulated the question clearly.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think that moderators marking replies as an answer is presumptuous, AND that I do see as useless metric hunting. Who gives a flying ...ck if a moderator thinks a reply is a reasonable answer. Frankly, on this specific point I think their opinion
 is irrelevant (yes strong words, but not intended as offensive). So what if a question remains unanswered? Will the site cease to function?<br />
<br />
A question marked answer by the poster is positive confirmation that the reply(s) worked.<br />
A question marked answer by a moderator is just an opinion with no basis in the reality of the QUESTION. It is based on their experience and while it may be the right answer, but it is still just a guess.<br />
<br />
Too often, I see replies I posted that consist entirely of requests for clarification from the poster are marked as ANSWER by a moderator.&nbsp; I usually report it as an abuse (which I'm told is an abuse in itself, &lt;grin&gt; ). Most of the time it is clear that the
 poster was floundering and there is no way that my questions prompted them to find the solution. Apparently they either gave up on us as not being helpful and / or got help elsewhere.&nbsp; So why should a moderator mark that non-answer as "The Answer". The discussion
 has simply been abandoned without resolution.<br />
<br />
In a separate discussion at the Feedback forum I suggest a couple of site changes.&nbsp; I suggested that rather than immediately marking "random" replies as answer the moderator should post a "form-letter" reply asking the poster if the question has been answered
 and if the discussion may be closed.&nbsp; I also suggested the addition of a new status "Closed" or "Abandoned" for the moderators to use to terminate a discussion that has gone stale without an answer marked by the poster.<br />
<br />
The reason I started posting the tag line is to encourage posters to take a moment to make the effort to mark helpful and answers.&nbsp; They are benefiting from previous marked answers.&nbsp; I try to briefly explain why it is to their benefit to "Pay it Forward" by
 marking their answers. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for removing the "we."&nbsp; We (you and I) will just&nbsp; have to agree to disagree regarding encouraging users to use the MS metrics tools anymore than the fact they are there to use if a user chooses.</p>

    <title>Word 2016 becomes excruciatingly SLOW when tracking changes is ON - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2016 becomes excruciatingly SLOW when tracking changes is ON</h2>
                    Word 2016 becomes excruciatingly SLOW when tracking changes is ON.<br />
<br />
Word 2016 version 15.26.0 (160910) becomes excruciatingly slow (taking seconds to show each keystroke typed) even on small and simple documents (eg., nine pages with text using a single Arial font size 12 and just three figures inside) when tracking changes
 is ON.<br />
<br />
No problem when such document is saved as DOC from the DOCX and then used in Word 2004 v11.6.5.<br />
<br />
Using Mac OS X 10.11.6 (15G1004) El Capitan on Mac mini 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 cores; 8 threads; model identifier Macmini6,2 late 2012) 16 GB RAM, booting from internal Apple Fusion Drive 1 TB.<br />
<br />
Is this a Word 2016 bug?

            <p>No bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent Mac OS(X) versions support&nbsp;a security feature called "Sandboxing." Office 2016 is the first&nbsp;Microsoft application to use 100% of Apple Code which uses "Sandboxing." Files written to the system are placed within "Containers" (Containers and Group Containers).
 How Sandboxing works is that the system&nbsp;when components are placed within theses containers, they are scanned, and anything within that container(s), are frozen and prevented from affecting any files and applications remaining. This procedure&nbsp;prevents any
 Malware from affecting the operation of the computer, by Malware. The very nature of this slows down the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently&nbsp;Microsoft came out with 64-bit applications, and that is supposed to help.&nbsp;However, the biggest help would be to go to Solid state hard drives (or SSDs). &nbsp;Also regardless of what people or articles tell you, you need a minimum of 16 Gb of Ram or
 maybe even more (32 Gb maybe even 64 Gb), for fast operation so that this Sandboxing can be done all inside the Processor and System RAM instead of the scratch disk available on the Hard Drive.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. The mac mini has 16 GB RAM (maximum allowed in such model) and shoud use SSD (apple Fusion Drive) for currently used files and applications</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is plenty of free memory (RAM) all the time, as shown below (MenuMeters for El Capitan), so the problem does not seem of the Mac hardware, but rather of Word 2016 itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the numbers after rebooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used RAM: 6,337 MB</p>
<p>Free RAM: 10,034 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>After opening Word 2016 (no file open and no other application open):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used RAM: 6,827 MB<br />
Free RAM: 9,552 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>After opening document (no other application open):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used RAM: 6,997 MB<br />
Free RAM: 9,379 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>After eding document for an hour (no other application open):</p>
<p>
Used RAM: 7,071 MB<br />
Free RAM: 9,305 MB<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>If I edit a word, it takes about three seconds to show. If I move a word from one place to before or after adjacent word, it takes about five seconds to show. Likewise, if I try to vertically scroll the document, it takes seconds to respond. The spinning
 color wheel shows also after different actions, and I must wait about ten seconds for it to finish before showing result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I is really frustrating how slow Word 2016 is in this scenario with Tracking Changes active. This is a huge productivity issue.</p>

            I need track changes. It is a document that I am editing. They are not two documents but one being edited by different authors in a sequential way (the document passes from one author to the next to include editing from all and generate final version).

<p>Thanks for the reply, all the track changes options are standard default, the problem is that it wont recognize that the&nbsp; changes that I have made are in fact changes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.e. the document thinks that the I have formatted the document in that way (i.e. strikethrough, underline etc)</p>

            Hmmmm.&nbsp; So, are you saying that you made the changes with tracked changes turned on, but, now, the changes are just formatting (not track changes revisions)?
<br />
<br />
If someone else made the changes, they may have marked up the insertions and deletions manually.&nbsp; If that's the case, then , yes you'll have to manually delete the struck out text and delete the underlines from the insertions.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Do you receive any error message?<br />
3. Which Microsoft fix have you tried?<br />
4. Dose this issue occur only when you type in Internet explorer?<br />
5. How is the keyboard connected?<br />
6. Who is the manufacturer of the keyboard?</p>
<div><strong><br />
Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may try typing in the notepad and check if the issue occur.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may check if the issue occur with a different keyboard.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to use the On-Screen keyboard and check if it works. You can refer the links<br />

<div><br />
<strong>Method 4:<br />
</strong>You may also need to update the keyboard software and driver from the computer manufacturer's website.&nbsp;
<br />

            <p>Hi Ayra</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made no changes to the computer prior to this issue.</p>
<p>The issue does not occur in internet explorer search, google search, ms office eg: word,excel etc and only occurs on certain websites such as ebay.
</p>
<p>I have tried resetting internet explorer settings and on MS FIX IT CENTRE- It has a "windows search does not work or is slower" fix, Which i have applied.&nbsp;Also:</p>
<p>Improve performance,safety and security in IE - applied this fix&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common system maintenance tasks - applied this fix</p>
<p>Hardware devices not detected or not working - i applied this fix</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no erreor messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used the on-screen keyboard as you suggested and it works fine using the on-screen keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Equium L350-10 PSLD2E-003003KS (has a built in keyboard) I've checked the keyboard drivers and windows update states there is no problems with the keyboard drivers. I have a standard/PS2 Keyboard plugged in to keyboard port (this is what
 is says on the info for keyboard properties)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked Windows Updates and applied all available updates and still the problem occurs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming as it only occurs with certain sites it's not actually a keyboard problem? But i still have no idea why it's doing it??? Arghhhh!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Structure of Workbook - Resolution Issues</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the process of designing an automatic score sheet for our fantasy football league.&nbsp; I have an Acer 27" All-in-One computer with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It seems that other members of our group are unable to view a lot of the content in my workbook.&nbsp; How can
 I set it up to be compatible with different resolution monitors?&nbsp; Possibly an automatic "Zoom to Seection". Can I add a button control on the worksheet for manual zoom as well?&nbsp; Thank you for the help</p>
                </div>

            <p>You can certainly set up buttons on the worksheet to allow the user to easily adjust the zoom.&nbsp; In VBA the zoom can be from 10% to 400% and those are expressed as integers as you'll see in the code, so 10% zoom =10 and 100% zoom =100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code below is from an actual project where we did exactly that - we used 2 shapes: a big PLUS symbol and a proportionately sized rectangle and 'attached' these macros to them.&nbsp; These change the zoom factor by
<p>
</p><p>'limits for zooming in Excel are from 10% to 400%<br />

&nbsp; If currentZoom + 10 &gt; 400 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currentZoom = 400<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currentZoom = currentZoom + 10<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; ActiveWindow.Zoom = currentZoom<br />
&nbsp; sheetZoom = currentZoom<br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Protect Password:=worksheetPW, DrawingObjects:=False, Contents:=True, Scenarios:=True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub ZoomOut()<br />
&nbsp; 'reduce enlargement in 10% steps to minimum of 10%<br />
&nbsp; Dim currentZoom As Variant<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Unprotect Password:=worksheetPW<br />
&nbsp; currentZoom = ActiveWindow.Zoom<br />
&nbsp; If currentZoom - 10 &lt; 10 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currentZoom = 10<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currentZoom = currentZoom - 10<br />

            <p>Now to the question of automatic zooming.&nbsp; You may be able to add this to your ThisWorkbook event handler to get it to work.&nbsp; It basically looks at what cells actually have data in them and zooms the view of that sheet so that everything from A1 to that
 cell is squeezed onto the screen.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Workbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First, I'll answer your second question:</p>
<p>If you want to use a password on the sheet, then just change the password:= portion of those statements to read</p>
<p>password:="1234"</p>
<p>If you don't want to use a password, just leave that out of it completely as:</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Unprotect</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Protect&nbsp; DrawingObjects:=False, Contents:=True, Scenarios:=True</p>
<p>actually, you can pretty much get away with just</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Protect</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Protect password:="1234"</p>
<p>The other parameters will automatically set back to what they are/were when you first protected the sheet.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to the fact that it is a := after a parameter name like password, and not just an equal symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, how to get the routines into your workbook:&nbsp; The quick down and dirty of it can be found at this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#videoreg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#videoreg</a></p>
<p>Right below the video section there are simple written instructions also.&nbsp; That is for the
<strong>ZoomIn</strong> and <strong>ZoomOut</strong> macros.&nbsp; The Workbook_Open() code is placed differently</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Workbook_Open() macro, follow the instructions here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Workbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Workbook</a></p>
<p>since that code goes into the ThisWorkbook code module, not a regular code module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the code is in a 'Regular' code module the next step is to assign it to a 'button' or shape on the sheet so that when that is clicked the code will run.&nbsp; You can use command buttons from the FORMS section of the [Developer] tab, but I generally prefer
 to use a shape such as the Text Box (found on the [Insert] tab).&nbsp; But you can use shapes from the Shapes group on that same tab when a 'visual' clue is enough without words.&nbsp; You can format them up nicely and with more 'spice' than with simple command buttons.&nbsp;
 Let's use the big plus symbol from Shapes to set up for the 'zoom in' function:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edb679e8-c4e2-4952-8798-d709b71b89d2" /></p>
<p>Draw the shape on your worksheet somewhere.</p>
<p>With the shape selected, RIGHT-click on it and you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2766440e-0364-4be8-896a-1db15fb3ee4b" /></p>
<p>You can use the Format Shape options to assign a color to it, including fading shades and to assign 3D effects to make it look more like a button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5f1b325-ac64-4524-ab75-70bf8d4f6acf" /></p>
<p>With it all formatted up you can continue on to assigning a macro to run when it is clicked (you can do these steps in either order:&nbsp; format/assign or assign/format).</p>
<p>If the shape gets unselected, you can get back to the set options stage by right clicking on it at the very edge of it, get it selected and move the cursor towards the lower right edge until it becomes a small + symbol then right-click to get the options
 list up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> in the code examples above, they all start with the words</p>
<p>Private Sub</p>
<p>for this step, the word Private needs to be removed - if you don't, then the macro will not appear in the list of available macros to assign to anything.&nbsp; Edit them to remove the word Private - editing within the VBA editor is just like working in a simple
 text editor like Notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you get the options list up and choose Assign Macro... you'll get a dialog like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39d2c3c5-c77d-4283-bdcf-a1ce6b1d2d6e" /></p>
<p>Notice that it offers you a default macro name, ignore that and instead choose the one you want</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bee50a8a-6356-483c-beb2-51f03f2efc85" /></p>
<p>and click the [OK] button.&nbsp; The dialog will close and you're good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, at this point you can go back into the VBA Editor and put the word Private back in front of the word Sub at the start of the assigned macros.&nbsp; What this achieves is to remove the macro from the list of macros available to be assigned to shapes but more
 importantly, it removes it/them from the list of macros that the user can choose to run from either the [View] or [Developer] tab.&nbsp; So they can't choose a macro to run when the wrong sheet is in use - it can only be executed by clicking the button which presumably
 is on the page that needs to be in use when the macro gets used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps - if I was unclear at any point, just ask for more detail and I'll do my best.</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp;All of that stuff worked really well.&nbsp; Another question that is similar.&nbsp; How to I add a photo or link to take me to another one of the sheets within the workbook?&nbsp; The tie-breaker rules in this league are kind of strange.&nbsp; I need to setup a
 separate sheet to do just the tie-break scoring.&nbsp; Also, how do I add a photo to a cell with a hyperlink to a website?&nbsp; The 4th tie-breaker is actually a coin flip.&nbsp; I thought about adding the actual coin flip to the sheet but that's seems like to much work.&nbsp;
 Instead I'll just have a link to take you to the website. Thanks again for your time.

            <p>To add a photo onto a sheet, go to the [Insert] tab and choose the picture icon which will bring up a browse dialog - browse to the picture and double-click it.&nbsp; You can move the picture around and resize it if needed.&nbsp; The picture actually floats above
 the sheet and isn't part of the sheet or a cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the picture and one option is 'Hyperlink' and you can then enter a hyperlink to a website page.&nbsp; There are several starting point choices in the left side of the dialog "web site" and "place in this document" being 2 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the website, you can choose that option then just type the full URL into the appropriate area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to do it with text in a cell, it's much the same: type in the text, right-click the cell and choose "Hyperlink" again.&nbsp; There is also the =HYPERLINK() worksheet function as an option.&nbsp; I'll let you explore its possibilities.</p>

            <p>I don't think that can be done.&nbsp; You might ask the question as a new question and see if someone else has thoughts on it.</p>
<p>One way might be to write "worksheet" event code that triggers on Worksheet_Change() so that when a choice from the list was made that began with the word "*BYE*" it would be ignored - perhaps a message would come up saying "*BYE* Jove" has been selected
 already and then make the cell empty.</p>
<p>That would be if the drop-downs were created using Data Validation from a list in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That code would look like this (very generic, could be made better/more selective)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; If Left(UCase(Trim(Target.Value)), 5) = "*BYE*" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Target.Value &amp; " cannot be used at this time."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.ClearContents ' "erase" the entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Select ' put them back in the cell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />

<h2>            Controlling 3D Maps with VBA</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a project where I have created a 3D map. &nbsp;I would like to use VBA to open the "tour" or map, refresh the map, and then copy and paste into a worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to record a macro and everything was recorded except using the 3D mapping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that can be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Sync Problems</h2>
                    
<p>i've been having onedrive sync issues with an online team site document library to my desktop. here are steps that i've taken to try and rectify the issue:</p>
<p>1. tried to repair onedrive from the onedrive app on my desktop.</p>
<p>2. tried to synch that library manually by logging into office 365 online.</p>
<p>3.. removed the folder in that particular document library and tried to re-sync.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; removed the entire document library from my desktop and tried to re-sync from both my onedrive desktop app and online.</p>
<p>5. uninstalled office 365 from my desktop completely and reinstalled.</p>
<p>6. confirmed i had the latest version of the onedrive app.</p>

<p>this is the error i receive when trying to sync that document library from online:</p>

<p>i've made multiple attempts to correct this over these last few days and have failed every time. so frustrating.</p>

<h3> richard gurney  say:</h3>
<h2>            xlvalue for Max &#38; Min in x axis &#40;using dates&#41; Excel 2003</h2>
                    Is it possible to use the VBA Code Xlvalue to give a dynamic range to the X axis of a chart based on the TODAY() value and where the axis is of date values
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd like to be able to set the minimum value to the Sunday prior to the date in question and the Maximum to be a Saturday perhaps 13 weeks into the future. I have a previous use of WEEKDAY() in similar circumstances so can do that part. Will I be able
 to put the TODAY() &amp; WEEKDAY() expression directly into the VBA or is it better to use it as a cell value and just put the Ref in the VBA</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do I also need to set the unit value in the VBA or will this set itself to Auto if not specifically mentioned</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is the VBA better in the Chart or in the Workbook as a whole?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            It is better to do it all in VBA, IMHO. With a chart object &nbsp;chtObj: &nbsp;How you fire the code is up to you - the calculate event, the change event, the sheet activate event, pressing a button.....

            I had to do a little adjustment with the sheet name as I was getting an out of range error but realised it was due to the spaces so changed the sheet name for something very much more simple "TWO" and got rid of that
<div><br />
<div>I still however get the same runtime error at the same chtObj.Axes line.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did a quick look at the Office Dev Centre web page and that seems to suggest this method is only applicable to Office 2010 &amp; 2013 or is that just M/Soft wanting everyone to only use the latest versions?</div>

            No - but it depends on the type of chart.&nbsp;

            Wasn't sure about that Dim objCht line so thanks for the confirmation
<div>It gives me a 13 week chart starting on 17th Nov right through to Feb so it's a case of checking it to see that it doesn't change till we go past Sun 1st Dec</div>
<div>I'd reset the value in the Application weekday line so as to give the whole week prior to the one of the current date&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for your assistance</div>

<h2>            Macro could not be found - I know, I deleted the file, why am I still getting this message everytime I open Excel&#63;</h2>
                    Running Excel for Mac 2011 - I downloaded a file and ran it with enabled macros (maybe not the smartest thing, but it seemed legit). &nbsp;I deleted the file, but now every time I open Excel I get a message saying the macro "could not be found" check the location,
 etc. The macro isn't listed under Tools&gt;Macros, nor does it appear in the VBA editor. &nbsp;How do I disable this message, and why is excel looking for a macro from a file I deleted? &nbsp;Also, is there a security issue as this was a downloaded file that keeps recurring
 despite being deleted? &nbsp;Thanks

With out that information, you are at an impasse. You options from what I can see is to really try to find that information so you can do it or hard reset your device and setup a new account (not an&nbsp;optimal choice but the only way I can think of to get around
 it)<br />

<h3> manager &#40;women&#39;s cottage&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Tenant&#39;s administrator password and username does not work</h2>
                    <p>We have recently purchased new non-profit licenses for Office 365.&nbsp; We were provided with temporary passwords for our users.&nbsp; However, the administrator user (with the xxx.onmicrosoft.com name) is not able to log in or access any admin functions.&nbsp; An attempt
 to reset the password at Office.com gave us an error message that the user did not exist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing problems.&nbsp; We need to purchase more licenses and assign them to users, but unless we have an administrator, we can not do this.</p>
<p>We have all the relevant information regarding the tenant.&nbsp; Please contact us as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Hi Manager,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question in our forum. Based on your description, the administrator user cannot sign in Office 365 portal. Many reasons may lead to this issue, first of all, please make sure to enter the correct user ID (like
<span>jsmith@contoso.com or jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com)</span>&nbsp;and password when you login&nbsp;<a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please refer to following article to see if it can help to reset the password for the admin user:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2606983/a-user-or-an-administrator-forgot-his-or-her-password-in-office-365-az" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">A
 user or an administrator forgot his or her password in Office 365, Azure, or Intune</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the method provide in above article doesn't help you fix this issue, please send us screenshots of the error message when you try to sign in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/</a>. Also, please confirm
 with other users in your organization to see if they have encounter the same issue when signing in Office 365 portal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<p>I have no problem logging in with my normal, non-admin, user name and password, nor does anyone else in the organisation.&nbsp; It is only the admin user (name and password supplied by Microsoft on setting up the Tenant) that has the problem.</p>

<p>You gave me two links:&nbsp; The "contact us: button mentioned in the second link gave me this result:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdab01bc-46e5-45d9-8e7b-00388723bde1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdab01bc-46e5-45d9-8e7b-00388723bde1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so clever, considering the problem we are discussing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second link, the&nbsp; phone number, got me to choose a selection, then an automated voice said "I'm sorry there is no answer.&nbsp; This call will be terminated."&nbsp; And cut me off.&nbsp; I am now getting more than a little annoyed with the waste of time this is causing.&nbsp;
 I had tried both these options before I contacted you, but tried them again.&nbsp; I am trying to purchase more licenses and and being prevented by being provided with no help in getting an admin user set up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where do I go next?&nbsp;

<h2>            Cannot switch from Inbox to Calendar in new Outlook on web</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook on the web ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://outlook.office.com/mail/inbox/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a button with the new Outlook "look" that I can toggle at the top right corner. I can toggle to the new look, and I very much like it, but then I cannot change the view from Inbox to Calendar when I click on the button down left, as per attached
 picture. This button works in the previous version, too bad.</p>

<p>Hello HuguesLaliberte</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience this issue has caused. Since I failed to reproduce it on my side, regarding your scenario, I suggest you may use a different browser to test it(IE, Edge, or
 Chrome). Clear caches of browser and reload Outlook Web App page again If convenient, please use a different network to see if it can make any difference. May I confirm whether you can access Calendar app through Office launcher?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guys, this build is a wreak! First time in years I have to revert to previous version but this time around I had to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It completely breaks outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I though I did something wrong but after a whole day messing with mail profiles, windows account and even reinstalling the whole computer. Outlook is still crashing as soon as I had an account to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reverting to FRDC 1705 fixed the problem in seconds!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So stay away from this build if you can or revert to a previous version if you experiment the same problem I did.</p>

                    Because of an issue with Skydrive I had to create a new user account on my computer/ a new Microsoft ID.
<div>I was able to fix the problem with Skydrive and deleted the old user account and closed the Microsoft account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However my new Microsoft account is on a school email address and I would really like to use the email I originally had. But when I try to create a new alias or sign up for a new Microsoft account it says that the email is already in use.</div>

<h2>            Merging Skype and Microsoft Accounts</h2>
                    I am trying to merge my old (pre-Microsoft) Skype account with my new (Microsoft auto-generated) Skype account. When I try to add my email address to the old Skype account, I get a message saying that my email is already associated with a Microsoft account.
 Is there a way to merge the two? I do not want two Skype accounts.

            Hi MealsOnWheels.
<br />
<br />The issue is that you are merging two Microsoft accounts, this is not possible (now).
<br />
<br />If you would like to keep your old Skype login that you can add a new  alias.
<br />
<br />If you would like to use your email address name as alias (new Skype), that it should be deleted before as Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />Notice, Hotmail name cannot be added as an alias.
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />Mark

<br />
<span>If you would like to keep your old Skype login that you can add a new alias.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you would like to use your email address name as alias (new Skype), that it should be deleted before as Microsoft account.&nbsp;</span><br />

<span>Notice, Hotmail name cannot be added as an alias.&nbsp;</span><br />
