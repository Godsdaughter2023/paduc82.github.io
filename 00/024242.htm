            <p>Hi Ori_Artman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you give us more details? You don't get the SMS at all or you just get a general message tell you you have a text? Is it possible when your phone receives SMS texts, your band is not in the proximity of the phone? Have you tried removing the message
 tile from the band, re-adding it back, and restarting both devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please reply back and let us know. </p>
<p>

    <title>Incorrect printing margins - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nitramafve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect printing margins</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem related to printing from Internet Explorer, using different printers. I get the problem both in IE7 and IE8.</p>
<p>Problem:<br />
The problem symptom is that the margin (on the actual paper) used during printing is not correct. Sometimes it's bigger than it needs to be, and other times it's too small (leading to cropped output).</p>
<p>The cause seems to be that if the margins entered in the "Page setup" dialog is smaller than the margin actually supported by the printer, the margin is reset to the minimum supported. If the margin is Larger, nothing happens. When I change default printer
 in Windows, or print using another printer in Internet Explorer, the margin is not reset. So if switch often between different printers with different minimal margins, the wrong margins will be used unless I manually edit the page setup after every time I
 switch.</p>
<p>To reproduce:<br />
1) Configure Windows to use a printer (PrinterA) with minimal margins Top=20, Left=20*<br />
2) Open up Internet Explorer and "Page Setup".<br />
3) onfirm that the margin is correct.<br />
4) Close the "Page setup"-dialog and print a paper.<br />
5) Configure Windows to use another printer (printer B) with minimal margins Top=30, Left=30*<br />
6) Open up the Page Setup dialog in Internet Explorer<br />
Now the margins for Printer A is still shown (which aren't actually supported on this printer).<br />
7) Click OK<br />
8) Open up the Page Setup dialog again.<br />
Now the margins for Printer B is shown. When you clicked OK, the margin was reset to the minimal supported by the current printer.<br />
9) Reconfigure Windows to use Printer A again (the one with the smaller margins)<br />
10) Open up the Page setup dialog again.<br />
Now the margins for Printer B is shown even though you changed to Printer A.<br />
11) Click OK<br />
12) Open up the Page Setup dialog again<br />
Now the margins for Printer B is still shown, despite the fact that you're using Printer A.</p>
<p>* The actual values aren't relevant. As long as the margins on Printer B are larger than the ones on printer A the problem will occur.</p>
<p>Expected behavior:<br />
Whenever I change printer in Windows, the page margins stored by Internet Explorer should be reset to the minimum margins supported by the printer. Since Internet Explorer detects the minium supported margins anyway when I change the page setup, I don't see
 why it couldn't do this every time I change printer. (The downside of this would be that the page setup is changed whenever the printer is changed (which may be confusing to some) but I believe it would be much less confusing than the current behavior.)</p>
<p>Could someone please confirm that the behavior I'm seeing in Internet Explorer is as-designed?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It could be that one of your add-ons is overwriting your printer properties. Try running IE with no add-ons, here’s how you do it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the (Start) Orb &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to change your printer settings and see if that fixed your issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it did, open up your internet explorer and click on Tools &gt; Manage Add-ons &gt; to find out which one is causing the problem by elimination process.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope that helps, please post back and let us know if that worked for you.

<p>You can go to File&gt;Account&gt;Switch Account&gt;check if your account is the Current Account. If not, click your account under Other Accounts to set it as Current Account.</p>

    <title>Inserting values into Excel cells based on formulas in another cell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the old puter man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting values into Excel cells based on formulas in another cell</h2>
                    <p>I have a situation where, based on the results of a test in one cell, the need to insert values in two following cells. I can not seem to find a way to do that without some convoluted formulas,&nbsp;or if it is at all possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of what I need to do. It depends on the value in column A going blank for the first time. At that point, I need to insert a constant, and totals, on that row AND the two following rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula that is used to insert the constant in the first blank row is shown in the screenshot. The part that determines the need for the constant is at the very end of the formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF(SINGLE(Control_Category)="","Income Totals","")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on that constant the other formulas recognize that they need to calculate totals. There, as shown, are three totals. 1) Income, 2) Expense and 3) Net.</p>

<h2>            Accessing Office on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Just got a new computer with Windows 8.1. Have an Office Home and Student 2007. Installed it. How do I start accessing? The only place I see to do this is from the start page. When I click on the Microsoft Office Tile, it wants the product key for Office
 2010. I also am going to want to install Outlook 2007, and I suspect I will have the same problem.

            I find it unusual that a Win 8.1 computer would have an Office 2010 trial factory installed. But I suppose it is possible.&nbsp; What you need to do is uninstall the 2010 trial using the "fix it " in this tip:<br />
<br />
Question: Does the tile say "2010" or "2007"?<br />
<br />
<div><b>KB 290301 Uninstall Office 2010 </b></div>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a></p><span>&nbsp;

</b>(make copy of your NORMAL.DOTM, EXCEL.XLSM, and for 2010 QAT: Excel.officeui and Word.officeui if you have done any customization).<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
<br />
<p><b>NOTE</b>: 2 people have said that the Fix It in method 2 would not run in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the “normal” uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 1 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete everything. It leaves
 configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These “carry-overs” may contain corruption that is causing your problem.</p>
<p>Method 1: Uninstall from Control Panel</p>
<p>Method 2: Uninstall using Fix it 9737366</p>
<p>Method 3: Uninstall with the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter </p>
<p>Method 4: Remove manually</p>

After doing these 2 processes, you'll probably find that you can no longer find your Office 2007 on the&nbsp; start screen. That is not a problem, just a symptom of the new game of "hide and seek" Windows 8.1 imposes on users.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions that will hopefully help you find the "missing" tiles and located them in a more user friendly place:<br />
<div><b><br />

</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
I suspect your problem is simply understanding how the <i>"new &amp; improved"</i> Win 8/8.1
<i>"Start Scream"</i> &lt;sic&gt; "<i>works"</i>&nbsp; (wow, that's a lot of air quotes). <br />

                    <p>For the last three builds, Cortana has been consistently broken on my device. When I give it a query (search works fine, but everything else is broken), whether by voice, text or Hey Cortana, Cortana stalls. No "Listening..." in the search bar, it just sits
 there forever. If I'm lucky, it crashes. I'm a developer, who is implementing Cortana in his apps, so I can't test the functionality (as I have one device, running the preview).

<h2>            T-Mobile Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>So what's the real story? MS and T-Mobile are giving very different answers as to why T-Mobile won't be getting the 950 or 950XL. T-Mobile's CEO said unmistakable that MS' story that T-Mobile didn't want to carry the device is "Bulls**t" (his word, not mine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know now we're told the device can be purchased unlocked. But, will we get WiFi calling on T-Mobile? Will it work with T-Mobile Band 12? VoLTE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Old MS, I could see why they'd want AT&amp;T. New MS, they should be with the innovative and fastest growing carrier, T-Mobile. Yea, I get it, I want it because it I use T-Mobile, but so do a lot of others.</p>

            <p>That's one carrier in Europe too. I'm glad they're selling unlocked in the stores but without carriers on board it won't be a good experience.&nbsp;We all know Verizon makes it difficult, if not impossible to bring your own phone. T-Mobile won't allow phones
 they don't sell to use wifi calling and are restricting Band 12 to phones then meet their network requirements. I guess we'll have to see what happens but AT&amp;T exclusive, what incentive is there for T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint to spent resources to make this

            <p>I understand what you are saying, lets be honest... we are all here on this forum because we love Microsoft, and like all love affairs it has had its share of ups and downs, heartbreak and misery.... but, in my opinion, with the recent launch event Microsoft
 more than paid back it's loyal fan base...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a big mistake for them to tie the Lumia 950/Xl to any one network, for obvious reasons...but as the subject of you initial post was T-Mobile I thought I'd share the news... Deutsche Telekom own T-mobile, (so that's good news! I am on T-Mobile)
 and along with Orange S.A they make up the company EE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I believe I saw a Vodafone Ad in a paper, listing the 950 as "Coming Soon" but basically it's currently a wait and see...</p>

            <p>DT owns a stake in T-Mobile, ~65%, but I don't that will make a difference as they selected a single vendor for the EU launch too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As more details about MS' launch of the phone have been in the press, it is disappointing to read that MS was behind the single service provider, AT&amp;T, release even though they initially blamed the carriers. It's like the person in charge of&nbsp;launching this
 product&nbsp;isn't on the same page as the rest&nbsp;of the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping like the initial Xbox One launch, MS sees what users wants and adjusts its business strategy accordingly.</p>

My Lumina 925 with WP 10 is working perfectly on T-Mobile LTE in Miami.&nbsp; The local store is optimistic that they will get both 950 versions.&nbsp; Don't give up hope yet!

            <p>Jon,</p>
<p>The reason the 925 works perfectly with T-Mobile is because it was a T-Mobile sold and supported phone. If you purchased it unlocked, you wouldn't have WiFi calling. Band 12 and VoLTE need to meet T-Mobile's network requirements or the phone won't work with
 B12. the Nexus 6 is the only non-T-Mobile phone&nbsp;that supported both wifi calling and B12. Not sure T-Mobile would be so willing to do the same as MS is only supporting AT&amp;T with the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not giving up hope but like the Xbox One, users need to make their voices heard so MS will change it's position on this. The guys at the local store seemed optimistic but the T-Mobile CEO didn't have such optimism in his message.</p>

            <p>I just want to throw my voice in the mix here too.&nbsp; Microsoft and Microsoft phone non-AT&amp;T members doesn't have the US following to draw people from other carriers to AT&amp;T.&nbsp; There hasn't been a non carrier specific flagship Microsoft phone in a few years
 and my 925 is on it's last legs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am shocked that Microsoft isn't doing everything they can to move people to their platform -- which I feel is far superior over iOS and Andriod due to it's fluidity and live tiles -- now add continuum to the mix with hello&nbsp;and added cloud functionality
 and it's a clear winner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really angers me that if I want all the functionality to work on the new 950, I am going to have to wait probably another year or so which by that time, my 925 will certainly be dead just giving me another reason to move to iOS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>US carriers won't support, sell or even allow a phone on their networks unless it is 'their' model. The maintain a choke hold on manufacturers and the only one really benefiting here is Apple as they seem to be the only one able to dictate and work on their
 own terms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the system in the US changes and carriers are forced to give up the control they basically extort from manufacturers nothing will change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The US market is basically shut tight unless you do as the carriers say, in some regions of the world that would be reason for anti trust investigations and possibly suspicion of kartel forming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm going to take a chance that it will work out with an unlocked 950XL at T-Mobile.</p>
<p>The specs show that&nbsp;the 950XL&nbsp;supports Wi-Fi calling and Band 12 700mHz (Thanks for the tip, Michael G.).</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 contacts losing their company name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieldearing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 contacts losing their company name</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Outlook 2013 Professional&nbsp;Plus&nbsp;to manage my contacts. All my contacts are stored in the contacts folder associated with my outlook.com exchange account so that I can synchronise them onto my iPhone6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently migrated to the full outlook.com account (from the old ActiveSync account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have spent several hours entering new contacts - manually entering the details from information in emails. I now find, after a whole morning, that some (maybe all) of the contacts I entered seem to be missing their "Company" field information. I
 am 100% confident that I entered this information correctly and saved each contact properly and now the information is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result of the "Company" field being empty is that all these contacts now appear in the "none" group when I sort by company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please tell me why this happens. It's so frustrating!</p>
<p>This is just one of many problems I've had with Outlook 2013 - it's got to be the flakiest piece of software I've ever encountered and I'm starting to get desperate now as I have about 5000 contacts and I just constantly have to maintain them because they
 keep randomly changing!</p>

            <p>Are you actually serious?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response that you refer to seems to be suggesting that the solution is to simply go back to the contacts that have lost their company names and edit them AGAIN to re-add the company names that have mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to ask, on what planet do you think that would be considered an acceptable response to the situation I described?</p>
<p>
</p><p>before writing my post I spent 4 hours of my very precious time entering FULL contact information for multiple contacts. I then found that some of that contact information inexplicably disappeared. Of course I know that I can go back and edit the contacts
 again to re-add the company name, but that's NOT THE POINT. The point is, I shouldn't have to do that. Why did it happen in the first place and how do I stop it happening again. Please answer those two questions or don't bother responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response you have referred to is NOT ACCEPTABLE. I do not expect to have to enter contact information twice every time I create a new contact. I expect to enter information once and for that information NOT to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am literally at my wit's end with Microsoft Outlook and I am seriously considering scrapping Microsoft Office altogether and migrating everything to Google. I have WASTED SO MUCH TIME on Outlook and its MANY bugs and I'm fed-up. This kind of lazy unhelpful
 response does nothing to help that frustration.<br />

            <p>Does anyone from Microsoft support ever look at these forums and provide answers? I have searched various forums and have found other people describing the same problem. What I haven't seen is anyone from Microsoft officially acknowledging that the problem
 exists or offering any sensible&nbsp;advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a problem with Microsoft Outlook.com servers corrupting data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as an update on the above description, I went back into all of the contacts that had lost their company names and added the names back in. I then found, within just a few days, that some of these contacts had lost their company names AGAIN. There were
 also some new contacts with no company name. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems no matter how many times I edit these contacts, they just keep losing their company names. There doesn't seem to be a reliable&nbsp;pattern to predict when and which contacts will be affected (but the contacts that have lost their names are all contacts
 that I have interacted with in some way in the last week or so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no help from Microsoft</p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is a bug and it has been submitted for a fix in a future update.&nbsp; The issue is specific to the Company field and is caused when the contact is synced from Outlook 2016 to&nbsp;Outlook.com. &nbsp;The issue did not happen when the mailboxes were on Hotmail
 backend and connecting via EAS.&nbsp; Its a new problem specific to Exchange connectivity.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp;good workaround at this point and EAS is not an option because it is currently in the process of being blocked for new connections.&nbsp; I'll post&nbsp;back when I&nbsp;know
 it will be fixed.&nbsp; Its not immediately scheduled yet but I am going to&nbsp;request a higher priority for it.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for that answer. It's the first sensible answer I've seen anywhere!</p>
<p>I'll eagerly anticipate an update and news of a fix for this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, when I wrote my last update on Friday 13th Jan 2017 there were 25 contacts that had lost their company names. I painstakingly re-entered all the companies on Friday. I have just checked my contacts again and now (Sunday 15th Jan 2017) there
 are <strong>242 </strong><strong>contacts </strong>missing their company names. That's a massive 217 contacts that have lost their contact names in 2 days. I will have to re-enter all those companies again and some of them I might not even remember what the
 company is. I literally could cry with frustration and anger at the prospect of having to re-enter all those companies, knowing full well that they might all disappear AGAIN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM ASAP. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO SAVE MY CONTACTS ELSEWHERE!</p>

            Yes, definitely a server/backend problem. Nothing to do with Outlook. I use Outlook 2010 on my PC and the default mail app on my Samsung Galaxy S5. I see contacts being disassociated from the Company Name all the time. If all you have in the contact is
 a phone number and Company Name, the contact appears at the top of the contact list on my phone because the contacts are machine sorted and the numbers show up first. If you add other information in the contact, that will stay, but the company names drop out
 intermittently. This has been happening for the better part of the last year or so. Really hope this gets fixed. Annoying, frustrating, exasperating, all of that. You go through all sorts of trouble to keep you contacts straight, the Microsoft breaks them
 on you. Nice.

            <p>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, or ALAH or whoever your favourite deity is, PLEASE , someone at Microsoft take this issue seriously and fix it. It's ruining my life!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the double problem that companies keep losing their company name AND contacts seem to be randomly duplicated several times. I have had to install a piece of freeware that scans my contacts and removes duplicates. It's just removed nearly 500 randomly
 created duplicates! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Outlook.com is like like having someone with dementia look after all your contacts!</p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had originally filed the bug with the company name being lost on contacts and at that time we had an internal repro.&nbsp; By the time I got the bug in triage for a fix we lost the repro and now I cannot get the problem to reoccur.&nbsp; Are you seeing this problem
 on demand or is it intermittent?&nbsp; When you notice the problem can you correlate it to any other changes you made?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the duplicate contact issue the Outlook.com Team has identified the root cause and they will be fixing it in the next month.&nbsp; Until that fix is deployed it will be best to avoid doing imports from Outlook or OWA if it includes existing contacts.&nbsp; That
 is one thing we know that causes the duplicate problem. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Gabriel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to identify any particular pattern. I will monitor a little more closely. Trouble is, I don't really know what to watch for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I can tell you:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have several accounts set up in&nbsp;outlook.</li><li>I have a&nbsp;gmail&nbsp;account set up, an IMAP account and an MS exchange account. They all seem to work ok.</li><li>I also have an Outlook.com account set up - the account in which I keep all my contacts&nbsp;<br />
</li><li>I have over 4500 contacts</li><li>The reason I put all my contacts in my Outlook.com account is so that they will get synchronised onto my iPhone</li><li>When I look at the People tab in office I find it very confusing because I sometimes have several versions of a contact - there's the main outlook contact, the skype contact, and, until I managed to disconnect outlook from google, there was the google contact.</li><li>If I click on the specific contact folder in my Outlook.com account I see I have a folder labelled "Company: (none)" in which there are 141 contacts that have no company name (I'm pretty sure there were about 5 contacts in this folder last time I looked
 so that's about 136 contacts that have lost their company name sometime in the last week.</li><li>I then have another folder labelled "Company: (none)" with 632 items in it. These are contacts for which I have never added a company name.</li><li>I've wondered if it could be anything to do with syncing with the iPhone but my instinct tells me that the problem is most likely caused by the Outlook.com server</li></ol>

 kept as a closely guarded trade secret to both retain a competitive edge in the marketplace and to avoid unscrupulous SEO tactics specifically tailored to exploit possible loopholes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you are interested in improving your ranking within Bing, there are legitimate avenues where SEO tactics have been disclosed about how your site is ranked by the Bing algorithm. Have a look at the
 following article by Duane Forrester published last summer (July 2013) in the Webmaster Blog section of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.bing.com/blogs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bing Blogs</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>

    <title>can i insert section titles in page numbering in powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> opus wr sel  say:</h3>
<h2>            can i insert section titles in page numbering in powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>I have a relatively large powerpoint file and I want to print out the slides. In order to minimise reprints as versions alter, I would like&nbsp;to find out if it is possible to have chapter references in the footer then page numbers from the start of the chapter.
 I have set up the file with sections (i.e. the relevant chapters) but I can't find out how to go from there. Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Windows 7 won&#39;t recognise my Office 2003 upgrade installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pnwheeler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t recognise my Office 2003 upgrade installation</h2>
                    
<p>I've got MS Office Professional 2003, which I've installed with no problem on my Windows XP sp2.0 PC. It's an upgrade version, on the basis that I had Works 7.0 installed on my PC. I've used it successfully since I purchased it in 2005.<br />
<br />
I've just bought a new Dell inspiron running Windows 7. It originally had Works 9.0 and a trial version of MS Office 2007 home/student edition installed. I wanted to install my MS Office 2003 Professional as I needed to keep using Outlook and Access, and saw
 no reason why I should have to buy a new version of Office when 2003 suited me just fine.<br />
<br />
However, when I ran the Office 2003 setup program (remember, this is an upgrade), after asking me my product ID key, it told me it couldn't complete the installation without a valid previous version of Office being there already. It did not mention Works. This,
 despite confirming on the MS Office website that having a previous copy of Works makes you elibible for using the upgrade copy of MS Office 2003 (or later).<br />
<br />
I've repeated the set up procedure several times, and after deinstalling the existing copies of MSOffice 2007 and Works 9.0, and installing instead my old copy of Works 7.0. To no avail, it always asks to see an installation of Office 2000 or XP before continuing.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? It seems to me that the validation part of the old set up program doesn't work under Win 7.<br />
<br />
I realise Office 2003 is now an old version, and that in an ideal world we should all be ugrading to the most recent versions ov any program. But given that even the upgrade version of Office 2003 Professional cost a significant amount of money at the time,
 and that it's perfectly fine for my needs, why should I be forced to buying a more recent version just because there's an apparent clash with Windows 7?</p>

            OK, I'm feeling really dumb now. Tried the install again, this time when I got the error that it couldn't find a valid version of Office 97,2000 or XP&nbsp; I just put the Works installation disk in the CD drive and it recognised it instantly and allowed me
 to continue the MS Office 2003 install. This, despite the fact that Works was already installed on the PC and that setup was not accepting it, and demanded a valid install of a previous Office version. Should have tried that to begin with but... sometimes
 you just miss the obvious stuff. Thanks for all your help, everyone.

    <title>Word reverting to an old version &#8211; Word 2016 on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratbaty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word reverting to an old version &#8211; Word 2016 on Mac</h2>
                    <p>This problem is extremely serious because it means we can’t trust Word to do the most basic of functions: keep save the words we type into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Word documents are reverting back</strong></p>
<p>My wife tells me that some of her documents randomly revert back to old versions of themselves for no reason she can see. I have just investigated a case and I think she is right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Test case just lost 5 days!</strong></p>
<p>My test case document is a To Do list that gets updated all the time. &nbsp;Suspicious that this was happening, she started writing the date as the first line in the file. This data stamp on the file is currently 16<sup>th</sup> June (today is the 21<sup>st</sup>
 June). The first line in the file is 16<sup>th</sup>. So the file has lost 5 days of changes out of the blue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We have Time Machine Backups</strong></p>
<p>I have in place a Time Machine backup to backup everything on the computer every hour. I pointed it at a Drobo with a lot of big drives and assigned it unlimited storage, so it would keep all the old versions from the start of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the versions in Time Machine have a date stamp of the 16<sup>th</sup>. I cannot revert to how the document was yesterday. I suspect the 16th may have been the last time the document was opened and it has remained open since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Autosave is on</strong></p>
<p>Autosave is switched on in Word to save every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have rummaged around in the hidden directory where autosave stores its files, but the most recent files in there are from January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nothing in Trash</strong></p>
<p>I looked for the file in Trash, nothing found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Latest version of Microsoft Office</strong></p>
<p>I am always careful to install all updates from Microsoft, did the latest batch last week (15.35.0).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Latest version of Sierra</strong></p>
<p>Same with the OS, always kept up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I think is happening</strong></p>
<p>We rarely turn that computer off, as we drop in to use it all throughout the day. Same with the files, they are rarely closed, because they are in near constant use. I’m assuming that Time Machine cannot backup an open Word file. Further, that for some reason
 unknown, Word must have crashed and reverted to the copy of the file when it was last opened, because autosave is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please fix it now! This is awful</strong></p>
<p>Please give this matter priority. Right now we are in crisis because we do not know what to trust in Word, any document could be the correct version or some random old version from last week. Unless this can be fixed we will have to bin Word and get used
 to Pages whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>Hi Ratbaty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Automatically-save-and-recover-files-in-Office-for-Mac-6c6425b1-6559-4bbf-8f80-4f038402ff02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>, do not use <strong>AutoSave</strong> as a substitute for regularly saving your files by clicking
<strong>Save</strong> button. Saving your files using <strong>Save</strong> button frequently is the best way to preserve your work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the version information. 15.36 is the current update (could be 15.37 by the time you read this), but I don't think that's the issue. Just the same, go to the Help menu in Word and check for updates and get that little detail handled before going
 on to the next troubleshooting step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, whenever someone has reported a problem like this, it turned out they accidentally saved the file in two different file locations, and wound up with two different versions of the same file. Use Spotlight to search your Mac for the file name
 and see if perhaps you might have two or more copies of the file in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is that Word saved a copy online in your OneDrive or Sharepoint "cloud" directory. Be sure to check your cloud locations for duplicates as well as your local drive.<br />

Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to sync my items from Outlook 2010 to my Hotmail and/or Microsoft Server Account(s), it however will not sync the items on my calendar except for birthdays and anniversaries. All of my other events and appointments will not sync to the calendar.
 When I use my Windows phone I can see my synced Contacts, Tasks &amp; Emails but not events and appointments on my calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>John T. Fields</p>

            <p><span>Hi Linda,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, Office 365 customers on our premium Enterprise, Government and Education plans will receive OneDrive for Business unlimited storage.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.By default, every user has a 1 TB storage of OneDrive for Business.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.However, SharePoint global administrator can use SharePoint Online management shell to give a user a maximum storage of 5TB. Refer to:
</span></p>

<p><span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-SG/library/fp161394.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set-SPOSite</a>.
</span></p>
<p><span>Here are screenshots for your reference. I give one user 4TB.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.If you need more than 5 Tb storage, you need to request it via contacting Microsoft support.

<h2>            Mail Merge on Mac not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am trying to send out an email blast using the Mail Merge function on my Mac. Apparently, Word doesn't work with Mac Mail so I installed Outlook for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in Word, "Merge to Email" is grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook works and is running but I'm having trouble selecting Outlook as my default email reader — I've followed the instructions for how to do it but the "Preferenced —&gt; General" box does NOT include any option to select default email reader. All I see
 in General is "Folder list" and "Personalize". I even went in to Mac Mail and set Outlook as default email reader, but still not able to select "Merge to Email" in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips?</p>
<p>

<p>So, No fix for this ? I have the same issue and I done all possible ways out from different forums and no luck. Whatever I created as drafts in outlook.com via web browser won't showup in my Moto X Pureview outlook app. I am fed up resetting and trying the

            <p>I have exactly the same issue. Drafts stored on Exchange servers are not synchronized with Android Outlook made by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>all drafts, stored on the device, are not synchronized with the server. Bad and weird.
</p>
<p>Also Microsoft Outlook has no option to select folders to be synchronized.&nbsp; Reset accounts doesn't help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I contacted Outlook support and I received back:</p>
<p>"At the moment, we do not support draft syncing. We hope to add this in a future release.<br />

            I do not need anyone to tell me what I want to receive. It worked perfectly well with Hotmail, whatever I did not want to see went to my junk mail. Simple. Now I always have to be worried I am missing something important (that was not deemed important
 by me) and that sucks. Too much extra work. Please stop. Many of us are moving their accounts. I know I am in the process.<br />

<p>Just be aware, if you decide to move to Google, they too are doing a beta right now and will be changing their front end as well in the near future.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid change I'd highly recommend a desktop or mobile app that you don't have to update.</p>

<p>It's so so so so terrible, why did they do it? I don't understand.<br />
Who on earth designed it and why? Why would you design something that is so frustrating and worse in EVERY way from what there was before?<br />
My Hotmail email account has now been 'Outlooked' for years and I still don't get it, I haven't got used to it, it hasn't got any better - it's utterly bizarre.<br />
For instance, one small example - I used to be able to go into&nbsp; Hotmail from my phone and just click an email and it opened but not now - ohhh no! It was too simple you see, too user-friendly, it just had to be changed.<br />
Just about every view, every process - doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I. HATE. OUTLOOK. CHANGE IT BACK TO HOTMAIL. PLEASE. CHANGE IT BACK TO HOTMAIL.</p>
