            Hi <span>swwh,<br />
<br />
To have more insight regarding this issue, please answer the following:<br />
<br />
1. How are you attaching/forwarding the pictures?<br />
2. What is the file size?<br />
3. What is the file type? Is it embedded?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            1. I'm using the "Forward" button in the Windows Live 2011&nbsp;respond bar<br />
2. The pictures are in&nbsp;e-mails I've received from others, the file size for the entire message can vary from 168kb, to over&nbsp;2mb depending on the number of pictures included in the message<br />
3. Not sure. Yes they are embedded pictures with associated text. I would be happy to forward an example e-mail to you using forward as attachment. I don't usually&nbsp;like to do this because I can't edit out the e-mail addresses of previous recipients.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can provide.<br />

To further assist you with your concern, please provide us more information:<br />
<ul>
<li>What happens when you forward these emails with pictures? </li><li>Do the recipients not get these emails or do they receive the emails but cannot view the pictures?</li></ul>

            I get the message "One or more pictures in this message cannot be found. When you send this message these pictures will not be included...." The recipient of the message gets an&nbsp;e-mail with a square box with an x in the upper right corner where the pictures
 were supposed to be. The pictures however are included in a slide show attached. I suggest you Google - "Windows Live Mail 2011 Picture Forwarding Problem" to see many, many others with the same problem. Most replies to the posts are not helpful. Various posts
 in the Windows Live Solution Center suggest this is a known problem and is being worked on. My question is when can we expect a fix?<br />
Thanks for your help.

<br />
To determine the possible cause of the issue, please answer the given questions below:<br />
<ul>
<li>Can you confirm if you are signed in to your account&nbsp;when viewing the picture in Live Mail?&nbsp;
</li><li>When forwarding the email, did you copy and paste the image to body of the message?</li></ul>

            I am not signed into my account because it's POP mail that is downloaded to Live Mail 2011.<br />
I am forwarding a picture that was received in an e-mail.<br />
90% of the e-mails I receive with pictures included have this problem.<br />
The problem clearly relates to Windows Live Mail 2011 trying to put the pictures in a slideshow. If only this "feature" could be turned off, since the pictures almost always have associated text, a slideshow is NOT a desired feature.<br />
Thanks for any help you can provide.

 just got majorly banned on Dec 25-26 and have no clue why. Cant launch any game... My reputation is high and im always a respectful gamer. BUT, my question for everyone is...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a reporting system that is not always accurate or players reporting people just to report, Do you think Christmas bans should continue? Or postpone them until the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Updated: I did none of those violations on the bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your ban may be from behavior several days ago, investigations take time. I'd recommend checking out the
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Code of Conduct</a> and see if anything jogs your memory. Major bans don't get handed out without supporting evidence, so while yes, there are frivolous comm bans submitted they aren't issued without some evidence.&nbsp;</p>

            That's about all the details you will get. They will never disclose the exact communication content, as this could trigger reprisals both on Xbox and real world. Best advice would be to read the code of conduct and also have a read of all the other information
 within the enforcement site.

<p>The problem with being more "accurate" would be it could provide clues as to who has reported &amp; lead to unsavoury responses to that.&nbsp; Frustrating as it can be to be out of action, particularly on the holidays, it's a 24/7 service, the timing of suspensions
 can fall within holiday periods, for any system like that to hold any weight there can't really be loopholes like that.&nbsp; Sorry that you've found yourself there but at least you'll be back in a relatively short timescale.</p>

                    <p>Another week and Microsoft releases another update which won't install again. Instead, it gives us headache. Like many users I have had issues installing these updates in the past:&nbsp;KB3194798 and&nbsp;KB3197954 and had even created threads. They have done it again.
 Released another update:&nbsp;KB3200970 &nbsp;which won't install. Tried so many times and it still won't install.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Finally got all the updates to install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to install these updates is to download Windows media creation tool:&nbsp;http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/F/9/CF9862F9-3D22-4811-99E7-68CE3327DAE6/MediaCreationTool.exe and then choose upgrade this PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's gonna reinstall Windows 10 but your files and settings will be intact. It took a couple of hours to download and install. Then I checked for updates and tried to install. To my surprise those two updates installed. I was really shocked and now all the
 updates are installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Samsung 850 Evo 1 TB SSD's total bytes written went from 0.86 to 0.92 Total bytes written. It's gonna hammer your SSD though.

            It will reinstall Windows 10 but like I said your files and settings will be intact. It's not that you have to reinstall all the programs again. My laptop was working w/o any problem so there was no such thing as OS malfunction. I had no issues with any
 other programs. In fact I had installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 Pro just a couple of months back. &nbsp;The problem is with the update. This is the only solution that worked for me and to others too.

    <title>Voice Channel Control Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynehixson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Voice Channel Control Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I think the XBOX One voice control of the system is generally excellent, far better than my Sammy Smart TV, but I have 2 issues (at least) with it.</p>

<p>When will we get the ability to change channel by number? "XBOX, Watch Channel 104" for example. And</p>

<p>How can we get voice access to ALL the channels by name? Seems XBOX remembers only a set number (25??). And when you want to go to a channel other than one it 'knows' by voice, how do you do that so as to add it to the list of remembered channels??</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Followed up with another support person who confirmed my results that indeed you cannot change channels by number using your voice. I went to xbox.uservoice.com and found that over 900 people also had this desire. Hopefully it will be in the next update
 or two</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />When you have Windows Automatic Repair loop issue please follow these recommendations:
<br />
<br />1) Refresh PC
<br />
<br />Press-and-hold Power button 3 times to forcefully shut down the machine. The system will enter boot repair page after 2-3 times of reboot, choose Troubleshoot, then go on to Refresh PC.
<br />
<br />2) Disable early launch anti-malware protection
<br />
<br />You can do it using Command Prompt in Windows Boot Options menu which will appears after your computer restarts several times. Choose Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings. Your computer should now restart and give you a list of options, here choose "Disable early launch anti-malware protection". Restart your PC and check if the issue has been resolved.
<br />
<br />3) Delete the problematic file
<br />
<br />- In Windows Boot Options menu, choose "Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt".
<br />- In the command line, type: C: cd Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt. SrtTrail.txt and press Enter button. 
<br />
<br />Here, if you see something like this: Boot critical file c:\windows\system32\drivers\vsock.sys is corrupt, navigate to the specified location using the Command Prompt and enter Del command to delete the problematic file. 
<br />
<br />4) Manually repair MBR and rebuild the BCD
<br />
<br />In the Windows Boot Options menu, choose Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt. When Command Prompt appears, enter the following lines and press Enter after each line in order to run it: 
<br />
<br />bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd
<br />bootrec.exe /fixmbr
<br />bootrec.exe /fixboot
<br />
<br />5) Perform a system restore or reset
<br />
<br /> in Windows Boot Options menu, choose Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; System Restore. Follow the Wizard instruction and choose the appropriate restore point. Finally, click Finish to restore the system.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need more help

            Hi Shiana.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Shiana, 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            Method 1 didnt find any problems. In method 2 I couldnt change the refresh rate from 60 hz, but I did change the color to 16 instead of 32 and that helped a little. Now I can use regular windows 7 themes plus dwm.exe is running in the background.&nbsp;
<div>But the problem is not fix completly, the screen still goes blank &nbsp;in some parts.
<div><br />
<div>Now answering you questions:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Didnt make any changes before.</div>
<div>2. There is not an actual error. The screen just goes crazy like in the picture</div>

<h2>            Plugged in not charging</h2>
                    <p>When I got this update I got the error, plugged in not charging. My laptop battery and charger both worked fine before hand. I have tried the usually method of uninstalling the battery drivers then shutting down and powering up my laptop but nothing seems
 to be working, and at this point I dare not to unplug my laptop from the charger in fear of my battery running out fully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any other solutions or ideas I would be open to them</p>

    </ul>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<p>Can anyone tell me if the IntelliType Pro 7.1 software has the wireless tab available to see the current state of the battery. The software advises that it should be available for wireless keyboard but is not. I have tried re-installing the software but
 still no luck.</p>
<p>The strange thing is the wireless tab is available for the mouse.</p>

<p><span>Hi morrisr1,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases uninstalling the IntelliType Pro software completely from the computer and later reinstalling it have fixed the
 issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you uninstall the IntelliType Pro software using the control panel and later reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you install the latest version i.e.: IntelliType Pro 8.0 software using the below link and check.</span></p>

<p>I use the family pack myself, and I ran across this before. You'll have to delete and recover the gamertag from your console, and then you'll need to try to add it again. Worked for me. I think it is due to a communicaton error while downloading the account
 to the console.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 updates, failures, &#38; blue screens - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 updates, failures, &#38; blue screens</h2>
                    https://youtu.be/kyBrjDpsXGc<br />
<br />
I'm wanted to perform something such as in the video above.&nbsp; I can't find anything like this for Windows 10.&nbsp; As you can see, that was windows 8.&nbsp; If anyone can help me solve this we will be the first *so far as I can see anyway*<br />
<br />
Need an expert!&nbsp; Have tried every basic step I can find.&nbsp; Many people right now are struggling with Windows 10 updates, let's be the first to understand why this is happening.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU so much in advanced if you'd like to embark on this journey with me! :)<br />
Here's a list of things done so far &amp; the errors that accompany them.&nbsp; *in order of appearance and what I've tried:<br />
<br />
Blue Screen<br />
Error code: 0xc0000185<br />
Windows Boot Manager boot failed<br />
<br />
(Restore)<br />
<br />
Blue screen (same error)<br />
<br />
(Restore)<br />
<br />
Blue screen (same error)<br />
<br />
So I tried<br />
Chkdsk:<br />
-error in uppercase file<br />
-Failed to transfer logged messages to the event log with status 50<br />
-Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected<br />
<br />
Then I tried<br />
Sfc /scannow:<br />
Windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation <br />
<br />
Then I tried<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth:<br />
-error: 50<br />
-DISM does not support servicing Windows PE with the /online option<br />
<br />
(Restore)<br />
<br />
Blue screen *except this time error was:<br />
Critical_Process_Died<br />
<br />
Blue screen again *except this time error was:<br />
Unmountable Boot Volume<br />
<br />
Then I tried<br />
Startup Repair couldn't repair<br />
&amp;<br />
Reset this PC - the drive where windows in installed is locked. Unlock the drive &amp; try again.<br />
<br />
*NOTE* where I wrote (recovery) That is when OneKey Recovery automatically ran and successfully restored.&nbsp; And I don't know why it won't now, but as you can see, I'm in a blue screen loop anyway.<br />
<br />
**some additional information**<br />
I have Microsoft Windows&nbsp; [Version 10.0.10240<br />
I have a Lenovo ideapad 500-15ACZ<br />
Which uses HDD and bios now shows Hard Disk as Not Detected.<br />
I bought this pc 6 days ago and this all started only a few hours after turning it on for the very first time!!<br />
<br />
My thoughts:<br />
1. Is this all happening because of Windows 10 updates?<br />
2.&nbsp; Am I in a race to successfully run these updates before another Blue Screen?<br />
3. If this is windows 10 causing all this, then would any Windows 10 pc do this? 4. Is anyone at all running Windows 10 smoothly??? Lol<br />
5. CAN THIS BE SOLVED WITHOUT RECOVERY MEDIA?

            <p>Thank you very much Ryan for your response. &nbsp;I believe it is the updates or just windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried anything that I haven't or seen any other errors that I haven't listed?</p>
<p>And have you tried any restore/recovery media cd or usb?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how the Product Key works for 8/8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reinstall it will pick up the Product Key and activate the system&nbsp;automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not, follow these steps:</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live keeps asking me to upgrade to a gold membership, but I already have one...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for the last two days I have been trying to play a couple different games online on the xbox one. Whenever I try to join or start a party, download any content, or just play online I am taken to the upgrade to gold page and cannot
 do much after that.</p>
<p>I renewed my subscription around 10/25/14 and according to my account on Microsoft my subscription is good through 9/25/15. Is it possible that my account is suspended or something?</p>
<p>I have tried cold rebooting, removing my account from my xbox and then downloading it again, I have even tried using a two day free trail to see if I could get on, but xbox live told me I already had gold...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have combed through a couple forum threads and have been unable to find anything that really helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do at this point and am quite frustrated. Any replies would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Headset Switching to Headphone mode during a call. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doc2197  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Headset Switching to Headphone mode during a call.</h2>
                    <p>I'm using some bluetooth headphones with my Windows 10 machine. They create two separate playback devices in the Sound list, Headphones and Headset. Headphones is Stereo audio and set to Default device. Headset includes microphone recording audio as well
 and is set to default communications device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is when I'm in a call, non call audio (e.g. system notifications, program alerts, internet video) will play and switch my headphones from headset mode to headphone mode, and I lose my call audio. Obviously setting headset to default device and
 not just default communications device solves this issue, but I'm looking for a more automatic solution. I've tried setting Mute all other sounds in the Communications tab, but that hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a way to automatically either disable the default device or mute all non call sounds to all playback devices when in a call?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional notes, that may or may not matter:</p>
<p>Headphones are Jabra Elite Active 65t (optimized for phone usage, not laptop usage)</p>
<p>Calling program is Skype for Business</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>Appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you aware of any changes made to the PC prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Is the issue specific to Skype for Business?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Does this issue occur with a different headset and while using a different calling program?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the situation must be difficult for you when things doesn't work as it should.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, I would like to let you know that as per the information available on the Jabra website, the Jabra Elite Active 65t device is optimized to
 be used with smartphones/mobile phones. It’s not specifically optimized to be used directly with a computer. You can check out the compatibility guide:
<a href="http://www.jabra.in/compatibilityguide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.jabra.in/compatibilityguide/</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Also refer to the section ‘Can I pair my Jabra device with a computer?’ from this article to know more:
<a href="https://www.jabra.com/supportpages/jabra-elite-active-65t#/#100-99010000-02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>Note: Since the websites are not hosted by Microsoft, the links may change without notice. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy of this information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Pairing your Jabra device with a computer may work for audio streaming, but not for call control which is not supported by many computers. When connected
 to a computer, audio quality may vary because Bluetooth is not optimized for audio streaming on many computers. However, this is highly dependent on the specific model of the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps and let us know how it goes.</span></p>

<h2>            Surround Sound via HDMI&#63;</h2>
                    Does the Surface support surround sound output via HDMI?<br />
<br />
I know it can output video (including audio) to HDMI devices, but has anyone connected that HDMI output to a surround sound receiver (5.1 or 6.1) and heard it utilize all channels?<br />

<p>I have played 5.1 channel WMA Lossless via HDMI to my A/V receiver. It even supports 96 kHz 24 bit (and probably all the way up to 192 kHz, but the WMA Lossless format&nbsp;doesn't support that).</p>

<div>
Hi, after re-installing my Windows 7 64bit operating system my Bluetooth no longer works. I'm connecting with a Palm Centro.
<div>When I plug in the USB dongle Windows begins to load drivers, and fails on some of them.</div>
<div>My Centro Bluetooth device is recognised by Windows and added as a device, but communication is not possible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Failures:</div>
<div>------------------</div>
<div>Bluetooth Peripheral Device - No driver found.</div>
<div>Bluetooth Hands Free Audio - failed.</div>
<div>Bluetooth L2CAP interface - failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Device Manager under Network Adaptors</div>
<div>Bluetooth Device (personal Area Network) shows yellow mark - Windows cannot load drivers required for this device. (Code 31)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Device Manger under Other Devices, several&nbsp;entries&nbsp;for</div>
<div>Bluetooth Peripheral Device marked yellow, The drivers for this device are not installed (Code 28)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Device Manager under Sound</div>
<div>Bluetooth Hands free Audio, marked yellow. This device cannot start (code 10)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No amount of reinstalling helps.</div>
<div>Before my re-install all was well, so I assume that there is no basic problem with my dongles.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help gratefully received. Thank You.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Display Adapter Connection Problem</h2>
                    <p>I just received a new Microsoft Wireless TV Display Adpater.&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought it to connect to my Samsung Smart TV to my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; My computer is a Dell XPS12 running the latest version of 8.1.&nbsp; I upgraded to 8.1 last year as the computer came with Windows 8.0
 originally.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe I have all the latest drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unable to connect to the MWDA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer see it, but when I try to connect I get an error message saying "that didn't work".&nbsp;&nbsp; The MWDA then disappears from the device list and I cannot see
 it again unless I restart the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone advise if perhaps the MWDA is not compatible with my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very odd behavior.</p>

 surface 3 detects the adapter, I tap to connect and then it says, "that didn't work".&nbsp; Both adapters produce the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing and holding the little button on the MWDA resets it, but this has no effect no the final result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest firmware, etc updates are installed on the pro 3.</p>

            <p>After suffering through this problem, I took it to the MS Store near me and replicated it for the 'tech' there.&nbsp; No solution was found an it was suggested to refresh the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updates were installed and everything else had been working fine, so I was doubtful and called the MS tech support line.&nbsp; The answer after some tests was also to refresh.</p>
<p>I eventually did this, and lo-and-behold, I can now connect to my adapter without a problem.&nbsp; While it was a pain in the butt to refresh as I had to newly install all my software - some 20+ programs specific for my work, it did resolve the issue and I can
 now watch my movies in hotels without problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this may be necessary for all those having this problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and let us know how/if it works for you.</p>

            We have discovered that the problems with the MS WIDI adapter (and others) are pretty much always driver related.&nbsp; I would recommend using the WiFi and display drivers from Intel, not any vendor-supplied drivers.

<h2>            Cannot remove Security Update 2823324</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>KB2823324 was installed on April 10th on our family laptop (Win 7). No problems noticed then. KB2840149 installed on April 24th. On May 5th, laptop extremely slow on statup and wouldn't connect to Internet (unless in Protected Mode with Network). System
 retore (3 days in a row, as same network connection problem re-occured) seemed to cure the problem. 10 days later: same issue. So, after searching on forums, I thought uninstalling KB2823324 might help. I can't restore to before fix was installed. So tried
 manual uninstall as per Article ID: 2839011. Only options seems to be from DOS prompt. bue getting error as described below:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am following the instructions in Scenario A&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Recovery steps for computers that have installed security update 2823324 and are now failing to start</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On option 3 (Uninstalling at Command Prompt), step 5 (<span style="font-weight: bold">dism /image:C:\ /get-packages)</span>, I get the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error 2</div>

            Replying to myself... in case someone has similar issue.
<div>Since our laptop could occasionally startup (albeit very slowly), I eventually managed to go to Control Panel/ System and Security/ Windows Update/ View Installed Update, select KB2823324 and Uninstall. Next re-boot after that took 10sec (used to take
 up to 1mn- when it would load at all!).</div>

            <p>Hi Colin, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't remove an update, your computer might be connected to a network where updates are managed by Group Policy. In other cases, you might not be able to remove an update because it applies to a security-related area of the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check the link mentioned below and see if it works.

            <p>Thanks for the reply, Andre. After I posted my question, I continued to do more online research. I came across some information dealing with the Dell Storage Manager Driver and Vista and XP2. It mentioned a Dell install (afamgt.sys). and its location (Windows\Program
 Files(x86)\XP\XP2\I386). I checked my File Explorer and found it. I renamed it afamgtold.sys. I shut down, rebooted and did the install again. It worked with no problems. I don't know when this file was ever installed since the computer came with Win 7 Pro
 installed. Thanks for your help.</p>

            It is not a Microsoft nor a Windows "module" that will show the ink levels.&nbsp; The ink level "window" was a module that came with the printer's drivers.&nbsp; You need to install the correct Windows 7 version of the printer drivers in order to get this "ink level"
 window.<br />

<h2>            Windows Explorer keeps on crashing</h2>
                    Windows explorer crashes when I attempt to rename or play an avi file. Doesn't happen every time, when it does crash it won't crash again for another half hour or something. Also the Dr Watson Postmortem Debugger crashes sometimes when it does as well.

<p>What isyour system make and model?</p>
<p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>What does crashing mean to you?</p>
<p>If you are seeing some kind of error message, it would help to know exactly what it says. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course Explorer should not be crashing and chances are somebody has already seen your type of failure condition and knows exactly how to fix it.</p>
<p>When Explorer does crash, do you have to reboot your system to get it going again and if not, what to you do after a crash?</p>
<p>If you are renaming of playing an AVI file are you right clicking it to do so and is that when then this crash occurs (when right clicking a file)/</p>
<p>Please provide additional information about your system:</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm,&nbsp;PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<div>If it is Windows Explorer that is malfunctioning, suspect a non Microsoft&nbsp;Explorer Shell Extension. Shell Extensions help make up the Right Click menu for files you see in Explorer.</div>
<p>You can download ShellExView from here to see which ones you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
When you launch it, the non MS extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and
 right.<br />
<br />
Sort the display by clicking the Microsoft column so all the "No"s are at the top and easy to see.</p>
<p>The "No"s in the list would be things you or applications you have installed have added to your system (the non Microsoft ones).<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.&nbsp; Disabling an extension does not
 uninstall anything.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those. The Extensions are not uninstalled, just temporaruly disabled.<br />
<br />
You could also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the condition.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one Extension that causes the error and then you can figure out what to do about it - usually you need to get an update from the maker of the extension from their WWW page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the Extension is immediately disabled, so disabling one does not seem to require a reboot but if you find the problem, I would reboot anyway to really be sure.<br />
<br />
If you find the extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so i can add it to my&nbsp;list.</p>

<p>I have Windows XP Home Edition Version 2002 SP3 on a dell dimension 9150</p>
<p>I have McAfee Security Center and my subscription is fully paid up.</p>
<p>When windows explorer crashes, a message pops up saying windows explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close, so I send an error to microsoft and then my toolbar disappears and windows explorer restarts, so no need to reboot my system. Sometimes
 when it happens dr watson postmortem debugger also crashes, the same message pops up but my system then freezes, so I have to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, find the drwtsn.exe file and manually close it and that reboots windows explorer.</p>
<p>I have disabled all non microsoft extensions and I will wait and see if that has fixed it. I will do what you suggested and try the malware detection programs</p>
<p>thank you, I will let you know how I get on</p>

<p>Good job.</p>
<p>Do not get your hopes up about getting any kind of response back from Microsoft when you choose to send them those information requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes folks find feel that request for information is an invasion of their privacy, so you can configure XP to stop doing that part, but that will not fix the problem of explorer crashing... The explorer.exe should not be crashing so it is better to
 just figure it out and fix it.</p>
<p>You will figure it out.</p>

            Would changing those settings on the shellexview cause windows to completely freeze on startup? Woke up this moring and booted up my system and my desktop completely froze, I'd double click on my documents and it would open like 5 minutes later, then it
 would freeze again, I eventually got it to unfreeze by opening mcafee and starting a virus scan but now it keeps on freezing, I tried undoing the things I did on shellexview and that didn't work.

<p>You implemented ShellExView to figure out if a non Microsoft shell extension was causing Explorer to crash.&nbsp; If Explorer is no longer crashing with the non MS extesnions disabled, that would be good prgoress.</p>
<p>You could now have some other problem to figure out because your system should not be hanging.&nbsp; You are zeroing in on it.</p>
<p>Once things got going, did everything work okay and you only have the problem when you first start up and is it repeatable?</p>
<p>I would be more inclined to look at McAfee since it is known to be a system resource hog - and I don't remember what it does when it starts up (scan the whole system, update itself, etc.).&nbsp; I am not going to install it to experiment with it anymore either.&nbsp;
 I just stay away from it.</p>
<p>Did you buy, download or get your McAfee free from your Internet Service Provider and when you installed it, did you have something in place before McAfee (like Norton)?&nbsp; If you had something else and did not uninstall the old stuff properly before installing
 McAfee, that can cause problems via conflicts.&nbsp; Do you have anything else installed with McAfee?&nbsp; It is possible to have too much protection installed and some tools don't like the other tools.</p>
<p>I would do some more shutdown/restart testing and try to see if the hanging happens again and is repeatable (maybe you have to do it 10 times).&nbsp; If it is repeatable and that is your only clue, that would be good and you will have to isolate the fault by
 starting to eliminating "extra" things one at a time.</p>
<p>I would disable McAfee completely, or temporarily uninstall it (if that is not too much burden) and see if your repeatable slow restart/hanging issue is resolved when McAfee is not in the picture.&nbsp; How do things work if there is no McAfee (there are "better"
 alternatives to McAfee IMHO, but some folks adore it).&nbsp; I am not sure what all you would have to do to just temporarily disable McAfee using something like MSCONFIG.</p>
<p>Many AV tools have gotten so complicated that uninstalling them from Add/Remove Programs is no longer sufficient.&nbsp; Some now have their own cleanup tools and so does McAfee.&nbsp; Here is a comprehensive list of AV uninstalling tools (McAfee is in there).</p>

<p>If your new issue goes away with no McAfee, you could reinstall a fresh copy of McAfee if you are compelled to use it and see if the issue comes back and/or then look at some alternatives.</p>
<p>If XP keeps freezing, there is a way to figure that out too, but I would squint at McAfee first.&nbsp; Other folks may have some other ideas too.</p>

<p>It did keep repeating, I could click on any icons or the start button so I had to press and hold the power button to shut it off that way. When McAfee starts up it just checks for updates. I had mcafee with the system when I bought it and I have continued
 to renew it every year. I have never used another anti virus program on my system. I have uninstalled and installed it again and it seems to have done the trick. I did a full system scan for any viruses or spyware and it came up with nothing.</p>
<p>After reinstalling mcafee that seems to have done the trick, the system isn't freezing anymore. After all this should I redo what I did at first and disable all non microsoft shell extensions? Windows has crashed once since all this happened with mcafee</p>

<p>It sounds like you are making good progress.</p>
<p>Explorer should not be crashing and if it is, I would work isolating it to one of the non MS shell extensions to figure it out (like you are doing).&nbsp; If it still crashes with just legitimate Microsoft extensions, we need to look someplace else.&nbsp; When you
 find the extension that you think is the problem, I wish you would let us know (I have a list).</p>
<p>Just because McAfee didn't find anything, doesn't mean there is no malicious software.&nbsp; It just means that McAfee didn't find any malicious software that it knows about.&nbsp; No single scanning program knows about everything so it is wise to use more than one
 but it is usually unwise to have more than one that uses some kind of real time protection (one that runs all the time in the background) since they will sometimes collide with each other and your system performance will be impaired.</p>
<p>You can certainly keep your McAfee, but I would also recommend doing updated scans with MBAM and SAS once in a while (as indicated above) to see if they will find things that McAfee might have missed.&nbsp; The free MBAM and SAS only run on demand.&nbsp; After you
 run MBAM, then run SAS, SAS will usually just find a bunch of tracking cookies, but that combination of the two works pretty good for me and I surf dangerously (on purpose of course).&nbsp; If you don't like MBAM and SAS, just uninstall them.</p>

            Windows explorer just crashed again so I made a note of the version number of the program that is causing the problem, it's version 6.0.2900.5512 and the only shell extensions with that version numbers are all microsoft ones. There are approx 40 of them
