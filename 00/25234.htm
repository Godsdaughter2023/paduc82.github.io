<h2>            &#34;Sorry there was a problem trying to connect to your account &#40;Error code&#58;0x80072f17&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    I saw a number of threads and comments over some years with this error code. I have been using MS-Office for 4 years now with a license purchased at my old University. About 4 weeks ago
 Word, Excel, PPT, etc stopped working and directed me to "Activate Office on my computer". I could not find a product key and when I tried to sign in I got "Sorry there was a problem trying to connect to your account (Error code:0x80072f17)". I contacted the
 University Help Desk and other IT personnel but they insist they cannot find my account/purchase so that is a dead end. I am hoping that the solution is something with my computer that was somehow disabled/enabled, because it literally stopped working one
 day out of the blue. Same old computer, same software,....

    <title>How to conditional format a cell based on another cell&#39;s formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eyeyayyay  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to conditional format a cell based on another cell&#39;s formula result</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to color code rows based on the formula <u>result</u> of another cell. By the way, the formula results are text, not numbers. Essentially, if A2's formula result is "John", I'd like cells A25 through J25 to highlight green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems there is a complication in getting the formula result to trigger the formatting, instead of the formula itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<h3> stephanie ghi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving emails with having multiple accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have two hotmail email accounts. The first account is a send and receive: set up to send and receive email. And the second account is a send only: set up with email forwarding to deliver to the first account. The second account is also the default send
 address of the first account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not getting certain emails that are being sent to the second account. My friends and family are getting bounce-back delivery status notifications that indicates "Delivery to the following recipients failed" and it lists the first account even though
 the email was addressed to the second account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And these fiends and family are not on any junk filtering or blocked sender lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I am having issues with the details on the second account.&nbsp; I've been trying to get rid of the "on behalf of" in the from address. The instructions are:</p>
<p>To send email from this account without "on behalf of", update your SMTP settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This account is not set up to receive email in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>However, both accounts are outlook accounts, so I'm not sure why I'm experiencing these issues.</p>

    <title>PPT 2013 slideshow and audio get out of sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fdw1203  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPT 2013 slideshow and audio get out of sync</h2>
                    I recorded the audio of a presentation I did recently (in MP3 file format), and just create a 20-slide PPT 2013 file to go with it.&nbsp; The first six PPT slides have just text (with "fly in animations), the later slides include text as well as graphics and
 other inserts which I have "appear" or "fly in" using animations.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I inserted the MP3 file into the PPT file.&nbsp; Then I used PPT's Slide Show-Record Slide Show to record the whole thing, using mouse-clicks to get the timing of animations and transitions entered. The slide show plays back perfectly until slide 7, but from there
 on, the sound gets increasingly out of sync with the slides:&nbsp; by slide 10 or 11, the slides have advanced about 3 seconds ahead of the audio track, and by the end of the presentation, the slides are about 8 seconds ahead of the audio.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Clearly, something is out of whack, but I can't figure out what it is.&nbsp; (PS: I found a workaround by manually changing the "Advance Slide" timing in the Transitions view, but that is an enormous hassle, and rather imprecise).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions you may have.<br />

    <title>Send and Receive from another MS account email. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrysmith10000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send and Receive from another MS account email.</h2>
                    I've sent in several requests over the last month to fix an obvious bug.<br />
<br />
In June, Outlook.com discontinued linked accounts (which were stupid anyway, you shouldn't have to switch between accounts to check a different email.)&nbsp; However, this made Outlook.com completely unusable for people with Microsoft Accounts with custom domains
 with live.domains.com<br />
<br />
I -- and I am sure many others who just gave up and moved back to gmail, who does this seamlessly -- would like to "send and receive" email from multiple email address (I own several businesses, and websites, and thus, I need to answer to many email addresses).<br />
<br />
Here is the problem.&nbsp; While Outlook.com allows users to send and receive email from third party email accounts using pop3 and 3rd party smtp servers (e.g. pop3.gmail.com), it does not allow users to set up "send and receive" from its own pop and smtp servers
 (pop3.live.com and smtp.live.com).<br />
<br />
As an alternative, Outlook.com includes "email aliases".&nbsp; However, this option is only good for @hotmail.com, @live.com, and @outlook.com.&nbsp; It does not work with custom domains setup on live.domains.com.<br />
<br />
The most hilarious thing, is that when I try to set up "send and receive email from another account", by putting in my email settings for my custom domains email addresses that are setup and managed with live.domains.com (pop3.live.com and smtp.live.com), I
 get a message that says,<br />

<br />
MICROSOFT DISCONTINUED LINKED ACCOUNTS 3 MONTHS AGO!!!.&nbsp; THAT IS A WHOLE FINANCIAL QUARTER!!!&nbsp; THAT RECOMMENDED LINK ABOVE HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY ZERO FOR THREE MONTHS!!!<br />
<br />
Since this was not resolved, had a choice, switch all of my clients back to gmail, or find a solution within microsoft.&nbsp; I tried to set up a custom domain with Office 365 Business as a test, and found that if you point your domain's mx record to office 365,
 you can't manage mail server settings like a normal mail server.&nbsp; The only way to set up additional email address on your custom domain is to purchase an entire user account for $16 per month.&nbsp; Are you high? Nobody is going to pay $16/mo for an email address.<br />
<br />
So, the Office 365 option was out. <br />
<br />
Therefore, my only option is to point my domains' mx records to someone other than live.domains.com (e.g. POP.GMAIL.COM), then I can happily receive email in a single Outlook.com account from as many addresses as I want, by routing it through their competitor.&nbsp;
 However, in order to do so, I have to change my primary Microsoft Account email, because it is on the same domain as some other emails that I want to check (e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, etc), so, I'll have to setup an @outlook.com
 email, just to use Outlook.com and Office 365 and my Microsoft Account, in order to check multiple email addresses at my custom domain.<br />
<br />
This will, however, make me have to wait for syncing via pop, in order to receive mail, and given the war between Microsoft, Google, and Apple, I doubt Google will point mx records to Microsoft for much longer.<br />
<br />
Additionally, setting up that @outlook.com email as my Microsoft Account primary email messes up all my microsoft services.&nbsp; My mail apps on windows8, surface, and phone8 will then sync with an email address that I don't even use (the @outlook.com email).<br />
<br />
So, this begs the question.&nbsp; Why would I go through all this trouble in order to use Outlook.com or Office 365 or any other Microsoft Service?<br />
<br />
I don't think I will.<br />
<br />
I've sent in a request to fix this issue several times to multiple departments.&nbsp; I've even found a phone number for microsoft (which is a major task), but the people who answered in Malaysia don't seem to have much pull with the Microsoft's decision makers
 or its shareholders.<br />
<br />
Apparently, end users don't have any pull either (at least, that's what Microsoft seems to erroneously think)<br />
<br />
Prove me wrong.&nbsp; Respond to this thread with action on this issue.<br />
<br />
If not, I am moving all of my clients back to Google services, and will have to apologize to all of them for making the stupid mistake of recommending Microsoft products 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Boy it was a hassle giving Microsoft a second chance.&nbsp; There will be no third.<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply Rumah,<br />
<br />
Using send only, and forwarding worked as a worked around worked.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; However, as a permanent solution, it is not ideal to have my clients and employees have to learn and go through this process for each domain they manage is not reasonable.&nbsp; And,
 it seems strange that the most difficult multi-email account setup process would be the configuration that uses solely microsoft hardware, software, and services.<br />
<br />
You should recognize by the thorough nature of my posts that I am extremely patient.&nbsp; Ninty-nine percent of people trying a complete switch from google, yahoo, apple, etc. would have given up long ago.&nbsp; In fact, I am an ergonomics and usability tester, so it
 is probably more like 99.9% that would have jumped ship long ago without a word.<br />
<br />
So, let's see if we can work out some simple usability issues that would help microsoft convert and retain new users.<br />
<br />
First, the message in the screenshot below (circled in red up top) should be temporarily updated to explain the forwarding work around you mentioned.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b61fc45c-de02-463d-abc3-ac52b727f73a" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this screenshot (above) is the 'advanced' setup screen, which still didn't work.&nbsp; You would think that setting up a Microsoft mail client (outlook.com and Outlook 2013) to work with a Microsoft mail server (smtp.live.com), and a Microsoft
 managed custom domain record (domains.live.com) wouldn't require difficult manual settings that are extremely difficult for non-technical users to find, and not be possible anyway.<br />
<br />
The screenshot below is the message I got when using the 'easy' setup.&nbsp; Note, that my gmail, comcast, and yahoo emails work here seamlessly.&nbsp; odd.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31200377-3270-48b8-8cec-0114bab7fd2b" /><br />
<br />
It would require about 10 lines of code to check if the domain of the email, in the form above, points to a microsoft mail server.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;In fact, it would take a good developer only a few days to run the check, and develop a system response with a message like,<br />
<br />
"Sweet, that's a live/outlook.com managed email too! Would you like us to put email sent to that address in your inbox and/or mark it as "&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;?"<br />
<br />
if the user responds yes, ask for the other account's uname and password, set it up automatically, and it's done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, since i bought office 365, i might as well try to use outlook 2013.&nbsp; The problem is, that doesn't work that well either.&nbsp; When outlook 2013 couldn't figure out that my domain points at a custom live domain (microsoft), I tried the 'advanced' settings.&nbsp;
 After a GOOGLE search, I found on answers.YAHOO.com that the Exchange Active Synch settings for outlook.com accounts are m.hotmail.com with ssl/tls.&nbsp; I tried these settings, and they didn't work.&nbsp; So, I did another GOOGLE search, and found the following 2
 YEAR OLD DEAD THREAD ON ANSWERS.MICROSOFT.COM:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/sync/activesync-custom-domain/adccff39-0c7a-4ac6-8893-f8b438622a07<br />
<br />
Not only was the moderator rude in the end, but the thread was closed unresolved, and the robots.txt file associated with the thread was updates to detour search engine crawlers.<br />
<br />
Despite legitimate new users expressing a deal breaking concern exactly the same as the one I am having now, here we are 2 years later, and 1000+ users lost over this preventable issue (remember, I'm not the 99.9% that just gives up and leaves silently).&nbsp; That
 is a major CRM failure microsoft.<br />
<br />
Rumah,<br />
<br />
i've sent you, in a private message, the information necessary to troubleshoot and report this issue to whomever you feel has the power to come up with a solution to the two major issues i have described here, one of which was described two years ago on this
 forum, and lost.&nbsp; I have sent books worth of feedback and reports on major usability flaws to several of microsoft's dead end CRMs.&nbsp; Not once, have I seen the issues addressed.<br />
<br />
You are the avenue that Microsoft has given its client's to be heard, and to make informed usability changes.&nbsp; Can you make these changes happen?&nbsp; Do they give you enough power to report these issues to the people that can fix the issues?<br />
<br />
I give it 3 months, which in the agile development world is an eternity.&nbsp; If it gets fixed, I've got another 100 or so issues that need work.&nbsp; If it doesn't, I'll move straight back to google and linux, and so will another 1000+ silent users.</p>

            I'm not quite sure why Rumah and you (Serg) keep answering my question in private.&nbsp; The whole purpose of "community forum" is to share "answers" to questions with others.&nbsp; However, I suspect that these answers are not something Microsoft would be proud
 of.<br />
<br />
For those who couldn't figure out how to click Rumah's link above, Serg conveniently cut and pasted the instructions from the page Rumah linked to.&nbsp; He sent it in a private message to me, so if you need it, it is pasted (BELOW).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I appreciate the "escalated' reiteration of Rumah's response, but it is a bit patronizing.<br />
<br />
I think you both have answered my questions.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;- You do not have the power to escalate usability issues to the MS development team.<br />
&nbsp;- Since all support and feedback channels (including phone) lead to here, I guess Microsoft doesn't use customer feedback for product development.<br />
&nbsp;- There are no plans to fix the issues I, and others for years before me, have mentioned.<br />
&nbsp;- There are no plans to report these issues to development teams for review<br />
&nbsp;- Microsoft has taught you to down play issues like this, rather than address them, by using private messaging.<br />
<br />
I thought, with the new unified UI, Microsoft had departed its long standing tradition of just copying others products, but after I reinstalled Ubuntu, I realized Windows 8 looks an awful lot like it.<br />
<br />
I'll still leave my office with MS products, and honor the 3 months I gave in my previous post.&nbsp; I'll even make it easier.&nbsp; Prove you can get the message on Outlook.com, which is a COMPLETE ERROR, fixed in the next 3 months, and I'll know you've done something.<br />

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. As what I understand, you created this post because you want to have the capability to send and receive emails for two different Microsoft accounts (custom domains for that matter) however, you were prompted with an error
 asking you to link the accounts, which is not right because the feature has been discontinued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;instructions that Serg gave&nbsp;you, which was to set up an email forwarding option in your secondary accounts to your primary Microsoft account (custom domain or not), is the only alternative to be able to receive the emails since they are both using Microsoft
 servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be best to voice out your thoughts and ideas&nbsp;in our <a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            You are correct. Recommending discontinued products is ridiculous. It is worse than an error, because the user doesn't know there is an error, and ends up wasting time going on a wild goose chase, which in turn makes customers hate microsoft.<br />
<br />
I am aware of the feedback page, I've sent 100s of bugs, usability errors, etc. there. The Outlook.com feedback page is the first place I reported the misinformation dialog notification about linked accounts, right after I received the mass email from the Outlook.com
 team informing clients that linked accounts would be discontinued. I sent the feedback proactively prior to the discontinuation, because I knew that with my setup (and many others), it was going to be an issue. That was 4 months ago, and the message informing
 people to link their accounts is still there. So, the "feedback page" is a big blackhole. Nobody reads it. It is just there to make customers feel like they are being heard.
<br />
<br />
Also, the feedback page has a very restricted character limit. You guys are very responsive, but it is clear that you don't have any influence over product development, since you are referring me back to the "Feedback page" black hole.
<br />
<br />
With regard to email forwarding. That is not a solution, it is a work around. And, it makes no sense that users can't pull email directly from non-microsoft mail servers to their email client, but not from microsoft mail servers. Furthermore, it is ridiculous
 that the work around is not mentioned anywhere within the Outlook.com application. It is instead on a guide on windows.microsoft.com.
<br />
<br />
Prove to me that customers are listened to, and fix or find the person who can fix the misinformation on Outlook.com. I bet you can't.&nbsp; I've already exhausted all other avenues of customer relations in all other departments about this issue. They all refer
 to answers.microsoft.com or the outlook.com team. So, if you can't do it, nobody can. And, I will have just demonstrated that Microsoft does not listen to, or value customer feedback or concerns. All the Feedback and forum **** is just a facade.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that Microsoft increasingly found out that linked accounts are less robust, and less secure than using aliases.&nbsp;As a result, the Linked Accounts feature is being deactivated. For more information about this, please refer to the article
 provided below: </p>

            The misinformation given in Outlook.com "send and receive mail" setup has been fixed (see screenshot bottom.&nbsp; Nice work.&nbsp; Hopefully next time it won't take 3 months and 20 customer services reps to update things that truly benefit Microsoft in the end.<br />
<br />
Thanks for passing along the info about why linked accounts were removed (security reasons).&nbsp; I learned that a long time ago from several other reps.&nbsp; However, that is not what I have requested an answer for (although many others, all over the Microsoft blog/forum
 space, wonder why you don't leave security choices up to the user, and instead Microsoft give a strong warning against linking accounts).<br />
<br />
What I asked, is why can't users of multiple Microsoft email accounts pull their email into the same mail client, in this case Outlook.com.&nbsp; This has nothing to do with Microsoft account linking; it is only related to email.&nbsp; Again, this is possible to do this
 with non-Microsoft accounts as "send and receive".&nbsp; Pulling email from multiple accounts is different than forwarding email.&nbsp; There are several reasons for this.&nbsp; Firstly, the email forwarding is tracked in the email header.&nbsp; For SECURITY reasons, clients
 may not want mail sent to an email address to be associated with another email address that they own.&nbsp; Secondly, the different email addresses are treated as if they are the same account.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Sent mail all ends up in the same place.<br />
&nbsp;- You can't define different SPAM settings for different accounts (a very important reason).<br />
&nbsp;- You can't forward email sent to a specific account.<br />
&nbsp;- You can't (easily) specify auto reply from a specific send account for email to that account<br />
&nbsp;- You can't specify unique settings like "Signatures" etc.<br />
&nbsp;- There is no easy way to ensure that replying to and email is always sent from the same account that the email was received to.&nbsp; This means the user has to select the "from" field every time they reply and want to reply from the same account that mail was
 received at.&nbsp; The user will inevitably slip up and reply from the wrong email address, which is very confusing for the person they are replying to.&nbsp; Or, worse, that person never received the reply because of email filtering.<br />
<br />
There are hundreds of other reasons why email forwarding is no the same as pulling email from mail servers.<br />
<br />
So, WHY?&nbsp; Why do you provide a service to non-microsoft accounts that you do NOT provide to microsoft accounts (i.e. send &amp; RECEIVE).&nbsp; That seems so stupid.&nbsp; Not only that, this differential treatment required extra work on Microsoft's part to restrict the
 functionality in the case of its own mail accounts.&nbsp; Why has Microsoft go out of its way to restrict functionality from its clients?<br />
<br />
It is NOT because you are trying to get us to upgrade to a paid service, because I signed up for Office 365, and that email client is even more restrictive, and worse.<br />
<br />
WHY?<br />

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">LarrySmith10000</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank for posting back here and for your patience on this issue. I understand that you wanted to know why the Send and Receive feature does not allow other Microsoft accounts but only for 3rd party accounts. Please be informed that it by system design that
 this feature is not allowed for&nbsp;other Microsoft accounts and we assure you&nbsp;that Microsoft has a good reason for this. As what the previous moderator informed you, if you feel there is a need for this feature, you may send a feedback to the link given on the
 previous post. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be advised as well that linking accounts feature was discontinued because Microsoft knows it will provide more security for users and will add more protection to the customer's privacy. We normally suggest customers who wanted this feature to use
 mail clients like Windows Live Mail as an alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to using Office 365, we would like to know by what you mean about it being more restrictive. This may help us isolate your issue about using Office 365 and may provide necessary resolution in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding is much appreciated. If you have other questions, feel free to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

<h2>            remove sweet packs virus</h2>
                    A few days ago I noticed small pop-up ads &amp; full-screen ads appearing while using Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Some of the time I'm able to "x" out of the page but other times I have to close down Internet Explorer &amp; start over.&nbsp; I've seen the name "sweetpacks.com"
 appear on the tab name.&nbsp; I think this may be a virus.&nbsp; Currently, I'm running Microsoft Security Essentials as my anti-virus software with live updates.&nbsp; I checked that page &amp; it does not show any viruses as being detected.&nbsp; How can I get rid of "sweet packs"?

<h2>            One Drive for Business 2016 woes.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I couldn't stand OneDrive 2013 and 2016 is no better. </p>

<p>Firstly our we had issues syncing our customers O365 OneDrive account for all users. Turns out there are a few things you need to set before it will do this...</p>
<p>Poke a hole through the Windows firewall for OneDrive, Add to trusted sites *.sharepoint.com, reset IE setting to default, whitelist *.sharepoint.com in the AV, start webclient service and change it to start automatically and finally stop all OneDrive programs
 IE msOsync groove.exe etc then re-sync before OneDrive for Business 2016 would actually sync. &lt; I hope someone finds this useful?</p>

<p>Now onto my next problem. </p>
<p>PC that had Office Business Premium (2013) upgraded to 2016 (went normally). </p>
<p>Went through the above to connect OneDrive for Business and when I click Sync from the OneDrive web portal it loads up a new IE Window asking me to install the correct version of OneDrive for Business but yet only offers me 2013 (which won't work because
 I have 2016 installed and you cannot remove part of Office365). Says it's connected and everythings up to date, but once you add a file .xlsx .docx or pdf it says it's syncing but doesn't actually sync ever. Doesn't matter if you upload it or sync from the
 folder on the PC just doesn't sync. </p>
<p>Tried repairing Office. Tried uninstalling rebooting and reinstalling Office.</p>
<p>Stopped syncing the library, Stopped all services, Removed the Office cache. Resync library.</p>
<p>Removed all Office 365 creds from Windows</p>
<p>Tried everything suggested here..</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/410554</p>
<p>Removed identities from the registry. </p>

<p>This would have to be the senior managers laptop too. </p>
<p>Any suggestions other than Microsoft re-writing OneDrive and trying to get it right!</p>

<p>Justin</p>

<p>hi justin,</p>
<p>could you capture the logs of onedrive for business to help us look into the issue? i have sent you a private message to provide the steps to capture the logs, you can access the private message via the
<strong>your details</strong> section on the right &gt; <strong>private messages</strong>.</p>
<p>besides, could you provide a screenshot of the error you encountered when trying to sync onedrive for business from web? also, do you see any error in the onedrive for business sync client? to upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then click the icon of <strong>
insert media</strong>.<br />

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>I'll take a look shortly at your private message. No error was displayed just that it would constantly show it syncing changes, but nothing would download.
</p>
<p>When I did a repair it would stop syncing but not restart the syncing process again. IE had nothing sync'd.
</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi Justin,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience caused.<br />
<br />
We have received your updates and screenshots. May there’s something wrong with the workspace due to the update and maintenance, so you didn’t see the uploaded zip file. To help you solve this issue, I have created a new workspace including the corresponding
 PowerShell script, you can use it to capture the logs and upload it to the new workspace.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and effort again.<br />
<br />
Kerwin<br />

            How many Microsoft accounts are set up on your phone? By your description, it sounds like you've set the same account up twice on the phone - you've set up the hotmail account up as your Microsoft account and then you've set it up a second time as an Outlook
 account. If you did that you are syncing the contacts, appointments, and tasks to your phone twice. Go remove the Outlook account to remove this duplication on the phone.

<h2>            MS Outlook 2013 Sent items show as 0 bytes</h2>
                    <p>I have an IMAP account set up in Outlook 2013. For each of them, when I send emails from Outlook they appear in the Sent Items as 0 bytes. They are received properly. I can check the message properties under File -&gt; Properties and the correct size is reported
 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that emails sent from that account but from other computers or devices show the correct message size in the Sent Items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many other people report this issue but have not seen any resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes - I have the option selected to save sent items in the Sent Items folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Here we are in late 2017 - I just upgraded from Office 2010&nbsp;to 2016 and this problem appeared. I deleted&nbsp;the offending IMAP account and reinstalled it, and all of the SENT items had the size and info .....BUT...... anything new that was sent showed as 0
 bytes. If I forwarded it it would show up as the right size but the copy in the SENT folder would have 0 bytes. I installed Office 2016 on my new portable at the same time and it has no problems. It sees the same SENT folder with the correct byte size.</p>
<p>

<p>No, I have the same problem with a newly installed 2016 - using 2010 two days ago the problem did not exist. When 2016 was installed it it got all updates immediately. This also happens for two IMAP accounts I have.

            Where did you buy the phone then? You need to contact the seller regardless if they had indicated there is water damage there must be they also should provide you with a report of the faults found.

I was already charged for this month even though I though I already canceled.<br />

I can send the screenshot if needed. <br />

            <p><span>Hello MSvedova, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Usually you are only given that option when you have already cancelled the subscription. It is important to note that the subscription has a life cycle so if your subscription renews on the 23rd of each month and you cancelled on the 24th or even the
 23rd of a given month, then the subscription for the coming month would have been already renewed and you would be cancelling the subscription on its consecutive renewal.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please do the following; </span></p>
<p><span>Open the Zune software and login with your account (if you were already logged in then log out and then log back in), then&nbsp;go to Settings &gt; Account and check under Zune music pass what the status of your&nbsp;Zune pass is. If the status is "Renews on&nbsp;A
 Date" then there might be an issue with your account and you might have to contact support. Else, if&nbsp;the status is&nbsp;"Expires on A Date" then you have already cancelled the subscription.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Zune pass subscription fee is usually not applied on the date of the renewal but a few days later, and that might be why you see a charge on this month after having cancelled the subscription (if you did). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you think you have been overcharged or your Zune Music Pass was not cancelled then I would suggest you contact support. You can follow the link below to do so;</span></p>

 As far as I can tell I am not running any Zune player or streaming on my devices.&nbsp; When I try to access content on the phone it takes me through account creation and always fails with error 8016ABA4.&nbsp; How do I verify if I have an account associated with my
 Windows Live ID or get past these errors.

<p>The error code you describe is one that we have been getting lately with new account creations. At this time it is a known issue that we are working on resolving. The best advice I can give you would be to initiate a chat with one of our support professionals
 so that we can try some troubleshooting steps and provide further service. You can initiate a chat on

<h2>            outlook.com address does not exist, but I&#39;m unable to add it as an alias</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as an alias for my primary account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to create the alias I get a message that "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** isn't available"; however, when I try to sign in with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (or hotmail or live) I get a message "That Microsoft account doesn't exist." and emails to
 those addresses are failed with "mailbox unavailable"</p>
<p>
Does anyone know what's going on here?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply Divya,</p>
<p>I did a search through the forum before I posted and didn't find anything similar to my problem.</p>
<p>I don't believe this address is being used as someone's alias because emails get kicked back (I believe they'd go through if it was an alias) and I've been trying, on &amp; off, for well over a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not&nbsp; a huge deal, but I would like to find out what is going on.</p>

            <p>Thanks ZigZag, I apologize for taking so long to get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem isn't with my account being frozen or anything like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a particular alias that I would like to use, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>Every couple of months, for well over a year, I've attempted to add that alias, but have been told that it is not available.</p>
<p>Emails to that address get kicked back as no such address and using "forgot password" at the outlook.com login tells me that there is no such account. When I try to create a new account I'm told that address isn't available (for outlook or hotmail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out what's going on with that particular name since it appeasr that it has not been in use for over a year, actually since not long after aliases were started for hotmail/outlook.</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Calendar Issues with Recurring Events</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to create on 'On Call Schedule' for our technicians for this calendar year.&nbsp; However, when I make the appointment a recurring&nbsp;event it takes away the dates and changes it to a one day event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our on call 'term' is from Friday to Friday, and should
 recur every 3 weeks.&nbsp; The only solution I found was to open each individual event and change it that way.&nbsp; Hoping someone on here can point me in the direction of an easy, QUICKER fix.....TIA</p>

            Hi Muneebalikiyani,<br />
<br />
Have you just updated to the latest firmware available for your phone, through Nokia Suite? If you are having problems, then you can try re-installing the current firmware via Nokia Suite and if that is still not working, then try Restoring your phone to factory
 settings.<br />
<br />
If that does not solve your issue, then you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to inspect.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>You can get a nicer effect by having a folder of Word or Excel files, PDFs etc., then place a picture in your presentation and use it to hyperlink to the file you want to open. But this is not the all-in-one solution you prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have access to a web server, you can place the files there that you want to open in the presentation. The user will get at least one warning dialog, so you would have to inform them that this is normal:</p>

</p><p>Just tried to log in, said my password was incorrect. Sorted out that issue. Now accepts my password but goes to a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot get into any of my files - Please advise what I should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been reading some of the forum responses but can't even type in the suggested fixes to try to move forward. Don't know how to find what release it was that I upgraded to.!!!!</p>

<p>Can you provide a few more details -</p>
<p>1&nbsp; Are you running Insiders Builds or did you just move the HP from a prior o/s such as W7 or W8.1 to public release W10</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any control at all?&nbsp; If you have some control, then more options are available</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried the basic fix attempt of just forcing the HP to shut down.&nbsp; This often cures many ills</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of months back, I came across a&nbsp; looped and stuck W7 so I basically had a PC with no o/s.&nbsp; The short version of the story is that I was able to use the Media Creation Tool from MS to create a bootable USB stick, changed BIOS to load from the stick
 and installed W10 that way.&nbsp; This novice PC user had no backup of his data so I got a little $10 cable for his 2 1/2 drive and was able to dump his data to another HP laptop I had sitting around.&nbsp; Happy ending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give more details.&nbsp; Lots of helpful folk on this site.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Kathleen,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have received your NDR and message header in PM, according to the NDR, it seems that the server of the recipient cannot be reached, so that you received the "Undeliverable message". And from your
 description, you have removed the unknown email address that set under </span><span>Settings/Options/Accounts/Forwarding</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>so
 may I know if you still receive the "</span>Undeliverable message<span>"?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>For the unknown email address, please check if you give anyone permission who can access your mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Iry</span></p>

    <title>OneDrive Business and Macro buttons in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tanya groft  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive Business and Macro buttons in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I believe there was an issue several years ago regarding excel files with Active X buttons with macros not working from OneDrive. &nbsp; Has this bene fixed. &nbsp; As a business we are moving users items to Onedrive.&nbsp; We have an issue with some excel sheets that
 have macros in them where the macro button works once, then you have to close the excel book down and reopen to use the button again. &nbsp; I have searched all the security settings in the file etc and everything is enabled and working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Tanya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check whether this issue is related to file location, please move some issue related workbooks out of OneDrive to see the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, to check whether this issue happens to all files or only old files, please crearte a new workbook with same macro as the issue related ones and put it in both in OneDrive and computer local folder to see if you can use run it normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. The version number of your OS(Windows: Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK, Mac: Apple menu&gt;About this Mac&nbsp;), Excel (Windows:File&gt;Account&gt;Product info, Mac: Excel&gt;About Microsoft Excel)and OneDrive(Windows: Click the cloud button&gt;Click Three points&gt;Click Settings&gt;About,
 Mac: Finder&gt;Applications).</p>
<p>2. The detailed steps about how do you create this macro.</p>
<p>3. What have you changed before this issue happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>
