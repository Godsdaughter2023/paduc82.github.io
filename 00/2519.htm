<p>Hi Megan,</p>
<p>I’ve run a test from my side with my Outlook for Mac 2016 client. Below are the detailed steps:</p>
<p>Mac OS version: 10.10.5</p>
<p>Outlook for Mac client version: 15.18&nbsp;(160109)</p>
<p>When I shared my contact folder to someone inside the organization, gave the user the Owner permission of my contact folder. But when the user received the emails that asked for sharing contact folder, the user didn’t see an “accept” button. Finally, I referred
 to the following article that opened my contact folder successfully from the Outlook for Mac 2016 client.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Open-a-shared-Mail-Calendar-or-People-folder-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-035749d1-097f-4ab5-8d6a-ac397f508b17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Open-a-shared-Mail-Calendar-or-People-folder-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-035749d1-097f-4ab5-8d6a-ac397f508b17</a></p>
<p>So, are you referring to the above article to open the shared contact folder? If not, please refer to the above article to open the contact folder.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

I would like to mark my word document as final, i.e. it will be indicated as such when the document is opened and editing is restricted until the final mark is removed.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I know how this works using Word on a Windows computer&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-GB/article/prevent-changes-to-a-final-version-of-a-document-37281a8d-3c15-41f3-9a75-e6463acdf04f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">(see
 here)</a>. However, I am using Word on a Mac OS X (Word version 15.33) and cannot find the function there.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Is it possible that the "mark as final" function is not available in the Word version for Mac?</p>

            As the article you refer to indicates, it pertains to Office 2007 which is a Windows version. That specific capability never has been made available in Mac Office. Overall, document protection features in Mac Office are significantly limited compared to
 what the Windows versions offer.<br />

<h3> michael waters iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Notebook will not sync in certain sections on Samsung Galaxy S9&#43;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneNote religiously for years now.</p>
<p>I got a new phone (Samsung Galaxy S9+) and it has been working fine as well up until recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the sudden, I noticed that my primary OneNote notebook on my phone and PC were out of sync in certain sections.</p>
<p>Some sections seem to sync fine, while others do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not get any error messages, but the Syncing Circle icon remains on the notebook on the OneNote app on the phone and never "completes" it seems.</p>
<p>I thought it might be related to one particular section, so I made a new section and copied all the notes from that section over to the new section and then removed the old section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted everything and the sections synced upon opening, but then I tried to make another change and resync, and it is hanging again without syncing.</p>
<p>Just shows the circle icon over the notebook on the phone and will not sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions / thoughts on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot function very well without OneNote, honestly... I use it to record everything in my business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>thanks</p>

                    <p>Hello - I just downloaded OneNote for Mac to organize notes for my different classes. I have a Student 365 account through my University. Checked my subscription and I have the Office 365 A3 for Students.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can login to OneNote on my Mac, but it stalls when I try to actually create a notebook - the loading circle spins endlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to open OneNote online and create a notebook that way, but when I hit "Open in OneNote" it tells me:&nbsp;<strong>We couldn't open that location.&nbsp; It might not exist or you might not have permission to open it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been told to finish setting up my account like other users. Every time I try to do anything within the OneNote application, it keeps having me enter my username and password.</p>

<p>Hi Claire,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the symptom that OneNote keeps having you enter the username and password, I would suggest you try the following steps to clear your Office credentials for MacOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.

<h2>            ctrl f no longer goes to or highlights searched words or phrases.</h2>
                    I've noticed that when I search for words and phrases in Onenote it will show what page those words and phrases are on but it no longer takes me to the word or highlights it... Was there an update that broke this? I want to search my notes for certain
 topics and I can't now, it's really frustrating. Does anyone have a fix for this or know why it's happening?

<p>Hi&nbsp;MJewell,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>I tried replicating your concern using the OneNote 2016. After searching for words/ phrases, the application takes me to the word and highlights it. Here's a short clip:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55e75bc7-d9b0-477b-a1bd-50027412f9ce?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55e75bc7-d9b0-477b-a1bd-50027412f9ce?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also replicated your concern using the OneNote for Windows 10, and the same thing happened. Here's a screenshot:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5469b5c-5f05-4d53-a5ec-8a5a5639dc9a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5469b5c-5f05-4d53-a5ec-8a5a5639dc9a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To further isolate your concern, in opening your notebooks, are you using the OneNote 2016 or the OneNote app for Windows 10? To check the difference between the two, here's an article:&nbsp;</span><em><span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-the-difference-between-onenote-and-onenote-2016-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>What's
 the difference between OneNote and OneNote 2016</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">?</span></strong></span></span></span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f55c7a36b-e852-4799-863f-74895f2a3e52.jpg" /></span></span></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>Also, m<span>ay we know the version of OneNote that you're using? To check the version of your OneNote 2016, you may refer to this article:&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">About

<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, here's how to check the version of your OneNote for Windows 10:</p>

            this issue seems intermittent.&nbsp; I've had it work and not work today. I'm thinking I'm maybe doing something wrong. using ctrl-e and ctrl-f seems to make it work if I randomly use some keyboard commands.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail and outlook are just the domain of the email address assigned to your Microsoft account&nbsp;as @Hotmail.com or @outlook.com. Outlook.com is the new domain provided to Microsoft email addresses, hence, when we say
<strong>Outlook.com</strong> or <strong>Hotmail.com</strong> we are referring to your Microsoft email account. I suspect that this issue is&nbsp;due to your built in mail app, Could you&nbsp;remove your&nbsp;Hotmail account&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Mail app on your IPhone and add it back
 again. </p>
<p>You may click on the link below, scroll down&nbsp;and refer the section: <strong>iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch &gt;

<h2>            Mirror margin starts on even page</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am trying to make a book using Word 2013. I now set the margin to mirror and it works fine. The problem is I want to start every chapter on the right page. With the mirror margin, the wider left margin start on the odd page and alternates through the
 document. How do I make the first page of chapter 2 which is page 26 to have a wider margin on the left?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am sorry if anyone has asked this before, I have been trying to search for the answers but failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are creating the wider margin by using a gutter, return that to 0 and add the amount to the Outside margin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the wider margin was achieved by increasing the Inside margin, swap the settings between the Inside and Outside margins.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 won&#39;t run</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday Excel started showing a message at startup saying there was an error that had to be repaired with a restart. Nothing fixed it, including the diagnostic tool but it kept running.</p>
<p>After running the Microsoft diagnostic tool, I get the same message with Outlook but it will not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution? Or should I uninstall and reinstall office?</p>

            Hi HowardLowery ,
<br />
<br />I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation. That should fix it. 
<br />
<br />Please click Windows Start
<br />Choose Settings
<br />Click Apps
<br />Find Microsoft Office in the list
<br />Click Modify
<br />Choose Online Repair
<br />
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:

            This actually made things worse. It ran all night on "Step 1 of 4." When i couldn't stop the process,even with Task Manager" I rebooted. Now all of Office 365 is gone. On the one hand it answered the question of whether to remove and reinstall Office.
 On the other hand it raises the question of whether to continue to use Ofgice 365 as i have experienced various problems since i subscribed.

            I suggest you reinstall Office, but don't uninstall Office from the control panel, in that case you should uninstall office with the following tool: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>

<br />Task Manager does list outlook on the startup tab. 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />To be perfectly honest, not sure how Outlook got on the Task manager StartUp list - not something I've ever seen or have ever encountered with any version of Office/Outlook.
<br />
<br />With that, if you right-click on Outlook in the Task Manager Start list --&gt; select &lt;Disable&gt; - that should resolve the issue of Outlook starting at system boot-up
<br />

<p>Thats the end of Skype for me then. I have trialled every version through Beta and Preview and the last one that worked was 5.5. I have reported my 8.x bugs throughout and been ignored. Microsoft have done nothing to help us in this preview process like
 trapping errors to log or giving us the info we need to run a debug on it.</p>

<p>Creo que es poco profesional abolir una versión estable por una versión aún en pruebas que apenas espera el feedback del público... mal hecho, ¿cuántas personas/empresas han dejado al aire haciendo esto?, uds deberían emitir anuncios previos con cierta antelación
 para que sus clientes tomen las medidas y vayan probando esa nueva versión a lo largo de unas 2 o 4semanas. Particularmente en mi equipo (Debian 8.5 on AMD64) la aplicación inicia y pocos segundos después aborta. Ahora tengo que ingeniármelas para mantener
 el contacto con las otras empresas y el personal de la mía, pero esto me ha enseñado que tengo que buscar alternativas al Skype urgentemente a la vez de urgir a mis socios y mis clientes en lo mismo. Tengan un buen día.</p>

I guess it's time to drop it for good ... 8.x is just too much crap, uses over 500MB of ram (wtf?), can't disable sounds, can't disable link previews .... just ... lame

<p><strong>Bootloader version: 13.08.14.16</strong></p>

<p>I would like to know if after the official update to WP 8.1 Samsung will release a new firmware, like Nokia which will release the Lumia Cyan update.</p>

    <title>MS PowerPoint-- Sharepoint re-adding deleted content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bartek c  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS PowerPoint-- Sharepoint re-adding deleted content</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My manager and I have been editing powerpoints together by uploading the powerpoints to Onedrive and editing in Sharepoint. Oftentimes when we edit, content that we deleted (such as text boxes, lines, etc) re-appears. It's gotten to the point where we've
 both deleted the same text boxes about ten times, but they re-appear. This is a problem- if we use the Sharepoint edition to present, we do not want the deleted objects re-appearing, but if we do not use the Sharepoint edition, then we cannot edit the same
 Powerpoint at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only me and him editing the document at the same time, we are not editing the same slides, and we are both using sharepoint's "edit in Microsoft Powerpoint" feature. We just want Sharepoint to be as reliable as google slides, where if a change is made
 it doesn't have to be re-made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bartek</p>

            It seems that the co-worker and you are editing PowerPoint files in PowerPoint Online at the same time. If yes, does the issue happen in&nbsp; a specific file, a specific site library or a specific site？ Try a new browser or clear the browser cache to do a
 test to see the result. You can also open PowerPoint 2016 at the same time to see if the issue occurs.

</p><p>To clarify, we're both opening the Powerpoint file at the same time in Powerpoint (I believe 2019, or whatever is the latest version), not in a browser. This issue has ALSO occurred in browser, and with multiple different files and site libraries. All of

            Could you upload a full screenshot of the Account page in the PowerPoint application you are using? Just click on File&gt;Account. If you are the administrator and do a test in a newly created site, what's the outcome?

<h2>            About Windows Defender Malware Detections&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope your well?.</p>
<p>I have used Windows&nbsp;Defender in my Windows 10 and after downloading a music file in zip format and&nbsp;then opening it no warnings was shown on screen and no warnings&nbsp;either after doing a custom scan of that music file.After switching over to Kaspersky free
 and doing a copycat situation the music file was immediately blocked and&nbsp;a warning appeared on screen of that music file containg malware and no access&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;be made of that music file.I switched off Kaspersky and opened the music file till all the extras
 come out and then switched Kaspersky back on and scanned the video icon and it was removed by Kasperky.I then switched over to Panda&nbsp;Dome&nbsp;free antivirus and re run the&nbsp;scenario again and it also blocked full access of that music file by showing up an alert
 on screen.I ran a full scan with Windows Defender and with the MRT Tool and neither detected anything after the full scan was completed?.I sent that music zip&nbsp;file to VirusTotal and let them&nbsp;scan it and after the scan was done onlya few listed antiviruses
 showed this music file to be full of malware and the other antiviruses showed it to be clean including Windows Defender.I sent a sample to Microsoft and no reply yet?.Microsoft claims that they&nbsp;have improved Windows Defender so it catches up to its rivals
 and gets a&nbsp;better comment&nbsp;by the AV-Comparatives website?,and it seems that Microsoft gave everybody&nbsp;Windows Defender for free when it wasnt properly fully tested against malware and&nbsp;even videos are showing Windows Defender in Windows 10 to not detect some
 of the badest malware after scaning the malware folder&nbsp;and the computer didnt survive.How can Microsoft just assume&nbsp;Windows Defender was properly tested against malware and this hapened to me?.I thought Windows Defender was properly tested out before it was
 freely given out and what a mess Microsoft is in after making such claims?.Malware is one of the worst things to get in the computer when it bypassed Windows Defender or M.S.E as i had such experiences when i used Windows Defender in my Windows&nbsp;7 X.P and lost
 the lot.Only A.V.G 9.0 free antivirus&nbsp;saved my computer,when it came across malware and it properly did the job to not allow it to go in and wreck my computer,as i checked in the box of what was detected after a full scan was completed and was amazed at how
 effective A.V.G&nbsp; 9.0 really was..None of the websites i went&nbsp;to shows Windows Defender detection rates as high as 95% as its true detection rate in 2018 but still remains at 80% and lower..?</p>

<p>Windows Defender is significantly better than it was at the beginning. However, there is no AV program that catches everything and Windows Defender is still, based on most testing, no comparison to some of the best AV programs like Bitdefender, Kaspersky,
 and Panda. Windows Defender has been properly tested against malware and is decent for AV protection. Since you said the VirusTotal scan showed only a few programs that caught it, many programs didn't catch it. That said, it could also be a false positive,
 meaning that the heuristic analysis/behavioral analysis thought it was infected, even if it's not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stay safe :) Windows Defender is a great default AV program, but if you'd like to stay safer, I would recommend a different primary AV program or secondary scanners like Malwarebytes, Zemana, and HitmanPro.</p>

<p><span>Not much has changed with respect to Defender’s detection rates since you last posted your inquiry; and I’m afraid that your own personal testing doesn’t really provide any grounds for dismissing the work of the mainstream AV testing labs:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/windows-defender-in-windows-10/726310ba-4017-45df-849d-2cf4023ce831"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/windows-defender-in-windows-10/726310ba-4017-45df-849d-2cf4023ce831</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But having said that; we actually do have an unexplained mystery with respect to the March AV-Comparatives Real-World Protection Test: The March test indicates that Defender is still capable of detecting and blocking all of the malware samples, but
 is now indicating that this depends on the user’s choice to either block or allow the detected threats. This result really has me stumped, and I’d like to see some further clarification of this “user-dependent” protection category.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://chart.av-comparatives.org/chart1.php#</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is the explanation provided in the most recent summary:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>If a user interaction is required and it is up to the user to decide if something is malicious, and in the case of the worst user decision the system gets compromised, we rate this as “user-dependent”. Because of this, the yellow bars in the results
 graph can be interpreted either as protected or not protected (it’s up to each individual user to decide what he/she would probably do in that situation).</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/avc_prot_2017b_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/avc_prot_2017b_en.pdf</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This seems to suggest that Windows Defender has this “issue” because it presents users with an opportunity to “allow” malware, where other AV apps don’t
</span><span>normally </span><span>do this. But as I’ve pointed out previously, Windows Defender defaults to
<em>Automatic Remediation</em> for real-time malware detections, and its users always complain about not having the opportunity to choose anything other than the default action. I guess it’s possible that
<em>Automatic Remediation</em> might not be applied for low and moderate level threats, but I’m certainly not convinced that this is the explanation – and I think someone from Microsoft should probably be asking for a clarification, especially since this "issue"
 wasn't observed in the previous run of the test. In any event, if you just refrain from allowing any malware, then you shouldn’t have to worry about Defender’s
<em>user-dependent</em> segment in the Real-World Protection test.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once again, all I’m trying to do here is set the record straight, since you seem to be citing some very outdated facts and figures – I’m certainly not trying to convince you that Defender is the “best” AV solution out there. And contrary to your claims,
 the Windows Defender team has never claimed or assumed anything to that effect; although they sometimes do get a little “carried away” with all of the technological advances that they’ve made lately:

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope your well?,</p>
<p>Id like to add that if you read into what the Kaspersky boss has said about Windows Defender&nbsp;when used in a Windows 10 computer from his website,&nbsp;may actually be true,as I have noticed the difference between Kaspersky free and Windows Defender and who knows
 what&nbsp;other risks I'm taking by just using Windows Defender.I honestly thought after accidently downloading a program or music in zip format that had hidden malware/s or some kind of a virus?, it&nbsp;would be detected by Windows Defender immediately&nbsp;before I had
 a chance to&nbsp;unzip the program or music file . I always test my newer installed free antivirus with Eicar test files from the&nbsp;Eicar website and through the A.M.T.S.O desktop test files to make sure&nbsp;I haven't wasted my time with&nbsp;installing another free antivirus&nbsp;and
 see what happens after on purpose downloading and opening test files and one such case with another one of&nbsp;my free installed&nbsp;antivirus it allowed me to download and run all&nbsp;Eicars in zip format and no warnings appeared on screen , which I wasn't happy about
 and i&nbsp;simply uninstalled it. Kaspersky free&nbsp;didn't give me a chance to download and even run Eicar test files and the same went for Panda Dome free antivirus&nbsp;as a popup warning on screen was seen by both of these free antivirus when either one was used&nbsp;. I
 want to investigate YouTube videos about Windows Defender for Windows 10 and you will see for yourself and compare it with Kaspersky free. You will see that in comparison Windows Defender allowed undetectable malware and the Windows 10 computer didn't survive
 after that . Kaspersky free and Panda free and a few other free antiviruses caught each malware as shown on the screen and it prevented the malware from going into the Windows 10 computer to cause who knows what damage ?. I have taken that risk by using&nbsp;Windows
 Defender and or M.S.E&nbsp;and did&nbsp;end up having to reinstall my Windows back in after i lost the lot,&nbsp;as the Kaspersky boss said it will happen&nbsp; in both Windows versions Windows 7 X.P and in Windows 10.Also id like to mention that Avast free doesn't like my installed
 WOT Toolbar and lists this as spyware from the pop ups on screen and should immediately uninstall it,&nbsp;and Windows Defender doesn't mind i have the WOT toolbar&nbsp;installed while doing a full scan or custom scan of the WOT Tool . I checked out the WOT Toolbar
 website and its not in anyway bogus as Avast claims it to be and even sent my WOT Toolbar program to be scanned by Virus Total and after the scan it was safe to use . I even gave Microsoft Live One Care for 3 months trial version a go when i had Windows 7
 X.P,&nbsp;and would you believe it did a better job than W.D and M.S.E put together ? . So i don't know how the owners of Windows Defender has made claims in their website of an improved Windows Defender for Windows 10 after the famous M.S.E came out . ? ,I can
 tell you also that as soon i insert a dvd&nbsp;that might of contained programs with a virus or malware its immediately blocked&nbsp;by having Kaspersky free installed and Windows&nbsp;Defender has no idea any bad programs exist from my inserted dvd. When i get an alert
 from Kaspersky free after inserting a dvd ,i&nbsp;just switch off the protection mode to then be able to obtain whatever program i want from the dvd&nbsp;.I will only go back to W.D&nbsp;when&nbsp;such good claims about it&nbsp;have been&nbsp;proven whether in 2018 or later on ?. So far
 i have taken the Kaspersky boss words in being true , as his free antivirus certainly does the job , and Microsoft needs to retest Windows Defender as to why it doesn't detect much more&nbsp;malware before making that copy available for all . Kaspersky free antivirus
 to start with hasn't failed and that's the way it should of been with Windows Defender from the start&nbsp;. Even Panda Dome free antivirus of 2018&nbsp;has shown improvements and it also detects malware much more that what i can say about Windows Defender ? . Its just
 no good to create a free antivirus that&nbsp;isn't up to date in detecting every kind of&nbsp;malware new and old,&nbsp;as i have noticed before the damage that malware has done to my computer&nbsp;as it didn't look good and i couldn't use my computer at all after being denied
 access to my programs , and by that stage i simply decided to start again by reinstalling a fresh copy of Windows .. I am using Panda Dome&nbsp;free antivirus and my computer is malware free as none were able to get in and cause the damage whatever it was well
 known for ? , so in my view Windows Defender has a lot of catching up to do before it gets my nod of approval . I certain hope W.D one day becomes a free antivirus with a 100%&nbsp; virus detection rate and able to detect all&nbsp;bad URLS ,PUP'S , and low risk&nbsp;which
 still can cause some kind of damage? , and even knew about Trojans as well . . bye for now&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately, comparing AV apps on the basis of personal experience just doesn’t work – because long term comparisons involve comparing rough impressions of an older version of one app with rough impressions of a newer version of another app; and
 because the performance of these apps is also being compared across completely different threat landscapes, and software environments; not to mention differences in a host of other time-dependent extraneous variables. And consequently, all of this timebound,
 incongruous, and fuzzy information that gets stashed away in your <em>personal experience</em> is quickly rendered irrelevant by ongoing changes in the apps themselves and in their environment – so your personal experience really needs to be tossed out the
 window if you want to get a clear picture of what’s happening in the here and now.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the other hand, if you compare several current AV apps in quick succession, this introduces both smaller scale time-dependent discrepancies in the apps and their environment, and also many sequential artifacts, including an increasingly cluttered
 environment, improper installation or configuration of the AV apps, missed malware or incomplete remediation with a previous app, incomplete removal of the previous app’s components, and so on.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So the information gleaned in home-based sequential AV testing is always both highly impressionistic and degenerate in nature – and the only valid methodology for evaluating AV apps involves parallel testing in an AV lab with periodic side-by-side
 comparisons: The latest version of each AV app has to be installed on a fresh copy of Windows 10 with a properly controlled and configured third-party software environment that equalizes all of the potentially confounding environmental variables – and then
 all of these AV apps need to be pitted against exactly the same set of real-world threats (live URLs). The malware
<em>sample set</em> also needs to be carefully selected in order to make sure that it’s highly-representative of the threat landscape that's currently being encountered by Windows 10 users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The AV-Comparatives Real-World Protection Test uses this classical methodology of
<em>controlled observation</em> in a realistic and representative environment in order to provide us with a good benchmark for comparing AV apps. And this combination of testing design elements also allows us to do some essential fact-checking with respect
 to the claims made by AV marketing departments and self-styled “security experts” – and let’s face it, the internet is quickly devolving into one giant hoopla machine, scammer's paradise, and boo-boo blogosphere – where it’s difficult, if not impossible, to
 come up with any trustable information on AV apps. So while this AV-Comparatives benchmark test might never be as completely accurate and up-to-date as we would like it to be, it is like a breath of fresh air in an online world that seems to be increasingly
 polluted with the fog of misinformation. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of course no AV solution can indefinitely sustain a 100% protection rate in this real-world testing, and even when an app scores 100% on this test, it’s still very likely that it’s actually susceptible to some of the new variants or zero-day threats
 out there that weren’t included in the test’s malware <em>sample set</em> – so a 100% protection rate isn’t actually achievable for any AV solution. If you follow this Real-World Protection Test, you’ll also see that Kaspersky Internet Security (which is more
 powerful than the free version) frequently misses samples (as it did in the March test cited above), and would undoubtedly miss other emergent threats if we increased the malware sample size sufficiently – so your assumption that Kaspersky offers 100% protection
 clashes with plenty of evidence to the contrary. Also, as I stated in my reply to your previous version of this discussion, there are several important Defender protection features that are disabled by default, including PUA Protection. This PUA Protection
 feature, in particular, would need to be enabled in order to test Windows Defender’s actual detection rate, or to accurately determine its effectiveness as a standalone AV solution:</span></p>

            <p>I'm also having this issue. I've disabled the upload centre and have checked the second&nbsp;link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted a link on StackOverflow (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34138554/webdav-microsoft-excel-2016-not-able-to-save-back-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel WebDAV issue</a>) that show the prompt you get. When you click to keep my version
 it works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I noticed this was an Excel 2016 issue only. Excel 2013 works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p><span>Hello Joseemorin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to disable “use SSL 3.0” through Internet Options.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. On the <strong>Tools </strong>menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>. If you can't see the
<strong>Tools </strong>menu, press <strong>Alt </strong>button to </span><span>display the menus.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. On the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, under Security, <strong>uncheck
</strong>the check box<strong> </strong>against <strong>“Use SSL 3.0”</strong> and then click
</span><span><strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to change the Security level through Internet Options and check if it helps.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information refer to the link and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental

</p><p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your Skype contacts and Skype Credits should sync on your Skype app or any other platforms whenever you sign in to it.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your case, most likely you’re signed in to a different Skype account. Probably the one linked to your original Skype account registered email
 address. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you’re going to do:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check the correct Skype account details like the
<strong><em>Skype Name</em></strong>, <strong><em>registered email address </em></strong>and your
<strong><em>sign in credentials</em></strong>. (If your Skype account has a unique or
<strong><em>personalized Skype Name</em></strong>, always sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address).
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Signing in to Skype using the
<strong><em>Microsoft email address</em></strong> will route you to a Microsoft Skype account. Technically, this account is created using the Microsoft account and is using your Microsoft details for Skype. As we all know, Skype is now part of Microsoft. Your
 username will be your Microsoft email address. </span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you encountered any sign in issues, specifically the “Incorrect password” error, please reset your Skype account password on this
<a href="https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a>. Make sure to enter the correct Skype username.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.
