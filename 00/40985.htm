    <title>Google Chrome and Skype open and appear in task manager, but will not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhall3n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Chrome and Skype open and appear in task manager, but will not appear in task view and the window won&#39;t open when the app is clicked on.</h2>
                    Both applications were working until last night. I'm not sure if Windows 10 has anything to do with it. I have tried reinstalling both programs with no success. These programs ARE running and even appear in task manager. However, when I try to actually
 open the window, nothing happens. Neither of the apps appear in task view when running either. Any and all help is appreciated!

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Not to worry, we’re here to help you out.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is there any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>This issue could have occurred due to conflict between third party applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>As an initial step, I suggest you to disable antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to start your computer in safe mode with Networking and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode with Networking place the computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit
 program running in the background creating this error. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3: </strong><strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know the status, we are glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a home computer which is linked to my Microsoft Account when I sign in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used my Microsoft login on a work computer and was recently let go from that position.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now someone else is using that computer and I am now getting a folder with His name on it on my home computer, In addition, this person keeps changing the theme on&nbsp;my old work computer&nbsp;to a "Batman" theme, so it also changes on my home computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I "un sync" that computer?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As
 per the description, I understand that you used your Microsoft account login credential on your work credential and both your home and work computer settings got synced. Now you do not use the work computer any more but the settings are still synced. The desktop
 theme changed by the other person at the work computer also changes the desktop theme on your home computer because of account sync.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>When you sign in with a Microsoft account, your PC is connected to Microsoft servers online, or "the cloud".
 This means that your personal settings and preferences are stored in OneDrive, and are synchronised to any PC that you sign in to. Your Start screen layout, chosen colours, themes, language preferences, browser history and favourites, and Windows Store app
 settings are synchronised between PCs.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can remove all these sync settings by removing OneDrive Synchronisation between computers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps in the section “<strong>To stop synchronizing all settings</strong>” in the article below:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Yoga Studio app on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am interested in installing Yoga Studio on my ASUS T300 Chi 2-in-1 tablet and mobile dock. It's running 64-bit Windows 10 Home with an x64 processor, 4 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD. Following the link on Yoga Studio's page which says the app is available for
 Windows 10, Yoga Studio's page in the Windows Store says "This app does not work on your device," even though my device meets all the minimum requirements listed on the linked "What does this work on?" page.</p>

            <p>SujataMoktan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot download the app from the Microsoft Store - "Get the app" is grayed out, above the message "This app does not work on your device." I've done a search and the link from Yoga Studio is the only way to find the app in the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've sent a message to Yoga Studio and am pending reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to mention that I posted this comment to the Community from my iPhone 5S and it didn't appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more time: My ASUSTek 300T Chi is a tablet running Windows 10 Home which meets all the stated qualification to run the Yoga Studio app. Why is the Store automatically rejecting this device and blocking access to the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer my specific questions in your next reply. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Force-fed windows 8.1 and need to get rid if ASAP before it fully installs</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Had my computer running in the other room unattended and when I came back windows 8.1 has said it has downloaded and is trying to install.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made the decision as an adult that I did not want 8.1 "upgrade" but I guess you know better than me and are
 forcing it upon me.&nbsp; How do I delete this before it installs? I have a few hours to figure it out before my computer is ruined for good and I really don't want to sell it I just bought it brand new 6 months ago.&nbsp; I have my computer set so nothing can ever
 install without my say so. Why is this happening? Why does Microsoft insist on doing things to my computer without my authorization? I need to stop this quick I can't afford to junk something that cost me close to $1000.

            <p>I just ran into this myself. &nbsp;I haven't upgraded to Windows 8.1 because I'm afraid of incompatibility issues with games that were made after Windows 8 was released but before Windows 8.1. &nbsp;My guess is that most of them will work fine but I'm not willing
 to risk it since Windows 8.1 adds nothing that I really need considering I refuse to use the metro start page or apps. &nbsp;Its been annoying me for quite awhile asking me to install it and I always tell it no, but today it only gave me options to install now
 or in 1-4 hours and no way to cancel or refuse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I told it to wait 4 hours for now, but to try to prevent its installation I went into the "Scheduled Tasks' and disabled one in the "Setup" folder called "8.1 auto install" and ran Windows Update and set all updates to manual instead of automatic for now.
 &nbsp;After that I&nbsp;shut down and restarted the machine to make sure nothing was left running in the memory that might install it.&nbsp; I don't know if these steps&nbsp;will stop it, but its worth trying.</p>

            I couldn't stop it. It got to the point where it just reset my computer and finished installation itself. It actually ruined the video game I was playing cause it just reset my computer in the middle of playing force me to&nbsp;loose&nbsp;everything. After the install
 I had to delete every app it installed. Change back every setting it changed. Had to delete countless things and I am still fixing settings. It put its BS search engine on my computer and even added things to my favorites bar (unforgiveable). At this point
 in my life I am done with Microsoft for good. This computer is going to be sold very shortly and very unimpressed by this violation of my computer. No means no.&nbsp; I know they were dropping support to people who didn't "upgrade" but I made that decision that
 I wasn't going to "upgrade" and was no longer going to get support.&nbsp; They lost a customer for life and I play on living another 70 years.

            <p>I failed to stop it too. &nbsp;Even though I turned off that stuff it had already downloaded and scheduled the Windows 8.1 update and it started updating when I turned off my machine late last night. &nbsp;I wasn't having any of that so I shut off the power, twice.
 &nbsp;That cancelled the update but left my Windows 8 in a non-functional state where it was complaining about NTLDR missing and giving error code 0xc000000f. &nbsp;The Windows 8 automatic system repair on my DVD wouldn't fix it because it thought it was now a different
 operating system I think. &nbsp;The refresh option would not work on it either. &nbsp;To make things extra annoying Microsoft thought it would be a good idea to erase all system restore checkpoints before doing the Windows 8.1 update, so there was no way to get anything
 back with that either. &nbsp;For anyone without considerable technical know-how I'm guessing there would have been no option other than a complete fresh Windows install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to recover my broken system after several hours of effort only due to experimentation and considerable previous computer experience by using bootsect, bootrec, and bcdboot from the command prompt to reinstall the Windows 8 boot environment to
 convince Windows that it was actually a Windows 8 installation then I was able to run the Automatic System Recovery that didn't work before to get it into a bootable state. &nbsp;I then used sfc to make sure all the Windows files were proper versions then ran Windows
 update to install updates that were missing to my recovered files. &nbsp;There was one update that didn't work (Visual Studio 2010 update for Office or something like that) so I ended up having to fix that by installing Visual Studio 2010 SP1, which failed to install
 but in failing fixed the files that wouldn't allow the other update to work. &nbsp;After all this I used dism to verify and update the system image. &nbsp;The day was wasted, but I still have Windows 8 and my many dozens of programs installed in it and everything seems
 to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really steamed about this. &nbsp;The whole way the Windows 8.1 update works rubs me the wrong way. &nbsp;The Windows 8.1 update should have had an obvious way to disable it and answer "Never offer me this again" when it tried to get me to installed and it didn't.
 &nbsp;It annoyed me constantly trying to get me to install it even though I chose cancel at least 8 times when offered it. &nbsp;When it runs it should do a lot more to prevent your system from catastrophic failure if it has a power loss during install. &nbsp;When it made
 the final installation request there should not have been only install now and install in 1-4 hours as options. &nbsp;It should have had a cancel option as well. &nbsp;It shouldn't just take control of my computer when it decides to update and give me no way to pause
 it to resume later in case I need to turn my computer off due to battery or time concerns. &nbsp;Finally there should have been some way to uninstall the update if it was installed accidentally. &nbsp;Everything about the way it works is disrespectful to me as the end
 user just as WIndows 8 itself was as an "upgrade" to Windows XP or Windows 7.</p>

            <p>I have been reading all your comments and I am just as ANGRY about this as all of you. I also feel my computer has been hijacked and there was no way I could have stopped it.
</p>
<p>I cannot believe the company takes the liberty to really do this to users.... Already I was forced to use Windows 8, which I didn't want from the get-go and now am being force-fed 8.1?????? without my permission????? On a day I ABSOLUTELY needed to work
 on my computer and it was taken over by computer dictators for over an hour? No one from Microsoft will make sure that all my apps work, or that my Internet connection is fine, or that&nbsp;all of my software would work (which they do not!!!!!).&nbsp;They will send
 me a polite answer with a link that supposedly should help me but that will do F-all.</p>
<p>Thank you for your lack of respect, for forcing yourself upon my computer life, and you can bet I will be looking for other O/S options (but I am sure you just don't care).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little late for most of you, but I thought I would post what I discovered yesterday....</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Update KB2973544 triggers Win 8.1 to automatically install.
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2973544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2973544</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, KB3008273 appeared in Nov. 2014, which is also related to the automatic installation of Win 8.1... It actually replaces KB2973544.
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3008273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3008273</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Update KB2871389 makes Win 8.1 available in the Store, and is a prerequisite for KB2973544 and\or KB3008273. You might uninstall it also.
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871389/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871389/en-us</span></span></a></p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that the installation of KB2973544 and\or KB3008273 create Scheduled Tasks in Task Scheduler under *** Microsoft \ Windows \Setup***</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are... ** 8.1 Auto Install Ping** and **8.1 Auto Install V2**. They are scheduled for 8pm Daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on both and selected "RUN", as I didn't want to wait several hours to see what happened... A download started immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the download started, there were two more Scheduled Tasks added to the same location.... **Windows AutoUpdate Setup Resume Task**... which was running, and&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>**Windows AutoUpdate Setup Store Resume Task**... which is *Ready*, but has NEVER run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't try stopping the process because it took so long to download, and I wanted to see what would happen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that disabling or deleting all of the four Scheduled Tasks would stop the installation. In particular, the **Windows AutoUpdate Setup Resume Task**...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling the KB's might prevent the download in the first place, but once the scheduled tasks are established, I'm not sure if that would be enough...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved an image of the OS before the installation started, so if I get a chance I will see what can be done to stop it...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a little more checking....</p>
<p>
<span><span>
</span></span></p><p>I have found that the only way to stop the installation of Win 8.1 once the Scheculed Task ....&nbsp;&nbsp; **Windows AutoUpdate Setup Resume Task** is indicating "At Logon" for it's Trigger, is to end all the tasks showing, starting with that one, and then the **
 8.1 Auto Install Ping** and **8.1 Auto Install V2**.</p>
<p>After Ending the tasks Delete them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the Tasks, I had to go to C:\ $Windows.~BT, which is a Hidden File, and delete anything that has a recent date... especially the .esd file (Install.esd) of 2.67GB..
</p>
<p>I deleted anything that was newer than one week. You could probably delete everything inside the *Sources*, *Support*, and *Drivers* folders...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also uninstall the mentioned KB's, starting with the newest, and doing the KB2871389 last, as it requires a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any attempt to reboot the machine before doing this results in the installation of Win 8.1 starting...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to End the tasks and disable or delete them while the **Windows AutoUpdate Setup Store Resume Task** is still showing a Date and Time for it's trigger, deleting the $Windows.~BT files may not be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest issue with this process is that you may be denied access to the $Windows.~BT folder. If that is the case, you will need to take Ownership of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO...</p>
<p>If you disable and delete the Scheduled Tasks, and uninstall the previously mentioned KB's shortly after selecting *Remind Me Later* THE FIRST TIME, the process will be stopped, and it won't be necessary to delete anything in the $Windows.~BT folder.</p>
<p>You should have about 24 hours to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling the KB's and deleting the scheduled tasks, a new scheduled task has appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is *Pre-Staged GDR Notification*, and is scheduled to run at&nbsp; *8PM of Every Thursday of Every Week*. My guess was that this is to remind you to install the Win 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually causes another task to be created... *Windows Upgrade Notification Task*... It runs at the *Log On of Any User*</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't get this task to show a notification. The task ran when I did it manually, but generated an error message in the log...
</p>
<p>*Specified Module Could Not Be Found&nbsp; (0x8007007E)&nbsp; Windows Upgrade Notification*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is most likely because the KB's have been uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure they can be disabled as well, if you want to stop\prevent the reminders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that once Win 8.1 Update actually installs, those scheduled tasks no longer exist. In fact, the entire SETUP folder disappears.

<h2>            SIS Mirage 3 Graphics driver for Clevo laptop</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 has turned off the driver for the SIS Mirage 3 Graphics chip on my laptop because it says it has a problem, yet it insists that the correct driver is already installed if I try to put in another.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What shall I do. &nbsp;Can I get a refund on Windows 8 (downloaded) if I restore Windows 7, which was working fine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm answering my own question. &nbsp;Fortunately Windows 8 has repaired itself. &nbsp;It seems to be after I initiated a Windows Update. &nbsp;The SIS Mirage 3 Graphics driver is now shown as working and I'm getting full screen resolution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well, my time has not been wasted installing Windows 8 and I don't dislike it so much as my first encounter. &nbsp;I can see that the new interface might appeal to a 3 year old.</p>

<h2>            Realtek Pcie GBE Family Controller</h2>
                    I just got a Cisco wireless N router which I have connected to my system via a LAN cable. My previous Linksys wireless G router worked fine that way. This one freezes on YouTube and any file download of more than about 5 MB. I previously tried a NetGear
 wireless N router and had the same problem. The LAN card appears to be working and I get good numbers (&gt; 5 MB/sec DL &amp; 0.41 MB/sec UL) on tests of my DSL connection. Other computers on my LAN are wireless and seem to work fine. I have the latest drivers and
 I tried rolling back the driver with no benefit. Any thoughts?<br />

            With a gigabit (GBE) network adapter can have problems with the different Ethernet RJ-45 port speeds.&nbsp; With gigabit, the speeds can be 10 - 100 - 1000 (1.0GB)&nbsp; If the router's port can only do 10 / 100 speeds, you can set the Realtek controller to not
 go past 100 (aka Fast Ethernet.)<br />
<br />
Also, you can consider replacing the Ethernet cable with a CAT 6 grade one.<br />

    <title>Webcam for Mixer, Skype &#38; Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustin schultz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Webcam for Mixer, Skype &#38; Cortana</h2>
                    <p>Why doesn't the Xbox One S support native USB webcams? Or create a native USB Kinect device? I very much want to use my Xbox with Mixer, Skype &amp; Cortana, but can't. I don't own a Kinect, and am not willing to pay extra for an adapter that creates a very messy setup. As a first time Xbox owner, I didn't qualify for a free adapter. The Xbox has such great potential, but the number one thing holding it back is no webcam support. I can't use so many of the features it has because of this. This is something Microsoft needs to address.</p>

I am not willing to pay extra to have a worse environment. As the Xbox One S was my first ever Xbox, I did not qualify for the free adapter. They really need to have a native USB Kinect/Webcam for people who are new to Xbox. I am missing out on the functionality of Cortana and Skype because of poor product decisions. This isn't the way to get new customers into Xbox by cutting them off from using Kinect.</p>

<p>I would also have to agree with the previous posts about the M16. If you want to really rack up the points go for that gun. I've used that gun on Kino der toten, Ascension and Call of the dead as my wall gun. In the later rounds you obviously need to pack
 a punch it and buying ammo off the wall is a plus. AK74U, MP40 and MP5K are also great guns to tryout as well, not to mention great mobility with the submachine guns!</p>

<p>The M16 is more than convenient in Kino Der Toten because of its location on the stage. &nbsp;On the other hand, I prefer the AK74u in Call of the Dead for its location at the bottom of the lighthouse. &nbsp;It really depends on what area you're running. &nbsp;If you prefer
 to run laps around the map, you could always conserve your ammo and hit the mystery box occasionally. &nbsp;

<h2>            Impossible Minesweeper</h2>
                    So, I was going about my day as usual, when I decided to play a game of minesweeper, intermediate difficulty. I was doing pretty good, until I hit this one cluster of blocks. In this cluster, a paradox arose. There were two blocks- and either one could
 be a mine. This game was thus rendered impossible in accordance with Murphy's law. So, I guess, my question is: why? Why would Microsoft do this to me?

 I found out the win. 7 was not activated, and I have to re-activate it again. Would anyone tell me why&nbsp;and how do I prevent re-activation in the future if I need to re-ghost image to the same computer? I did the same way on win. xp and runs perfectly. Thanks!

<h2>            Poor Sound Clarity - windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a VAIO PC now with Windows 10. I made an upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Later I upgraded it to Windows 10 and it was working&nbsp;absolutely fine. I don't know how it has developed&nbsp;such Sound related problem. When I play a song I find faint&nbsp;sound
 coming out from my PC. Even at the highest&nbsp;level it&nbsp;gives&nbsp;blurred or faint sound.&nbsp;The sound&nbsp;is of very&nbsp;poor clarity&nbsp;. In all&nbsp;previous versions of Windows, sound was okay. Some time back I had to RESTORE it. Could that be&nbsp;a reason as since then Sound clarity
 has diminished/deteriorated? I tried to do it myself by going to SETTINGS and then typing SOUND, but nothing I could do. So please help.</p>

 that I'm using now may be of some help. In the mean time I thank you very much and please let me know if you find any thing more to solve my problem.</p>

<h2>            Bamboo Ink Stylus not pairing with Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone!,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a brnad new Bamboo ink Stylus for my surface Pro 2017. The stylus works fine, I can write and everything in my tablet, but the thing that I haven't been able to pull is to connect it with my bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. BT drivers update</p>
<p>2. BT Support service from Manual to Auto</p>
<p>3. Fresh Start for windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>And obviously the old on/off workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when I try to connect it is that the Stylus light stops blinking and i get this screen</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12027832-6102-4d36-87a0-1e8949ed5762?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12027832-6102-4d36-87a0-1e8949ed5762?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically it seems that (somehow...) the stylus stops being discoverable or sth like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd very much appreciate some help on this, because I'd like to pull the most out of my purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Michelle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Here my answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The stylus has two different "working sections", to say it somehow. The first one is the Stylus itself, which connects through WPP or Wacoom protocol (in this case WPP) and the other one are the buttons, which connect through BT. The second part is the
 one that I'm not being able to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No changes to my systems prior the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I'm able to connect other devices (i.e: I clever BT Keyboard, Microsoft Sculp Mouse), but I've had this same issue with another device (my JBL BT Headphones).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope my answers are useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanksfor your kind help!,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alejandro,&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate your update, Alejandro. Since you've mentioned that the <span>Bamboo Ink Stylus works on Wacom AES protocol, it seems that there is no problem with it at all.
</span><span>Note that it needs to be set to the right protocol to enjoy the full functionality for your device. Bamboo Ink is preset for the Wacom AES protocol.

<p>Hi Michelle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting me to that thread. Thing is that I already knew the common protocol mistake, And that is why I can write and use the stylus (as a pencil) but the buttons are inoperative due to not being able to connect it to the BT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the guys said in the thread that he identified a problem with the Bluetooth Low Energy Drivers... Could that be my problem as well?... I'm thinking of ti beacause I also have the same connection issue with my BT earphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help me a lil more on this, I'd very much like to take the full potential of my purchase and also fall in love again with my surface pro...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice one!,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michelle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran into a BT LE explorer app that could helps us in figuring out this situation. Here I attach the screen shot on the parameters that I was able to get from the Bamboo Ink:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d66c8cb-5ecf-404a-baf2-9beb53066aa7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d66c8cb-5ecf-404a-baf2-9beb53066aa7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually trying to figure out the root couse of the HID AccessDenied problem, that might be causing the BT to be unable to communicate with the Stylus...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefuly sth will come out of my investigation,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Or if like my Netscape router have more than 1 network and all be secured with a separate password for each network.

<p>The issue really is not that there is a duplicate IP address.&nbsp; That's a transient issue that should be automatically resolved in a short time.&nbsp; If it does not clear up on its own, turning your computer off and back on should fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more worrisome issue is connecting to an unsecured network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you just connecting to a wi-fi signal emanating from a device that is not under your personal control?&nbsp; If so, you should treat this situation in the same way you would treat connecting to the Internet while in a coffee shop, airport lounge, or similar
 public space.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, your situation is probably more dangerous than the typical public wi-fi hotspot because commercial enterprises usually take steps to isolate individual users from each other.&nbsp; Depending on how many units are in your condo building(s), the person in
 charge may be using just a consumer-level device and not bother to isolate users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least, you should go to the Network and Sharing Center (click the network icon in the Taskbar next to the time display) and ensure that the network shown under "Active Networks" is described as a "Public network."</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You also should seriously consider using a VPN to connect to the Internet.&nbsp; Here are a few articles to read:</p>
