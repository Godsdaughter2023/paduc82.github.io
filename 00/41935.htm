<h2>            Unable to undo system restore</h2>
                    <p>Tried to do a system restore earlier because I accidentally erased some important files, but it took a long time (over an hour), so I restarted my PC and tried the restore again. When I went to choose the restore point, the only option I was given was the
 previous unsuccessful restore from an hour before. I then decided to "undo system restore", but a message appeared saying "System restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed." It also said to try an advanced
 recovery method, which I did try. &nbsp;I turned off my Windows Firewall and tried these steps:</p>
<p>
1) Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Start Menu</strong>&nbsp;and hold the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;button while pressing the&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>
2) Upon restart, you will enter the advanced startup menu. From there you should choose&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</p>
<p>
I then clicked on "Advanced Options" and did a system restore that way. This time, I was given the option to go back to the time before I deleted the files. But this system restore was also unsuccessful. I would so appreciate any advice, at all. Thanks!!</p>

<p>Hi IMHO the restore to a earlier time is really dogie Windows feature. You did the right thing. Unfortunately if that doesn't work, and you have not made any back ups, your files are probably gone.</p>
<p>There's a program called 'Recuva'<a href="http://filehippo.com/download_recuva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_recuva/</a> that might recover your files. Let me know how things go for you.</p>

            I tried Recuva but unfortunately since I deleted a couple folders filled with dozens and dozens of files, there's no way to know which folder each file goes in. It seemed to recover at least most of my files. Luckily for me, though, I remembered that I
 had recently backed up everything onto my ext. harddrive so I was able to recover my files anyway. Thank you so much for the advice!! :)

<p>Hi You are very welcome. I'm glad you got your issue solved. I have never had the need to use&nbsp; Recuva. I always have a resent back up image created by Macrium Reflect. Good thing for you that you had everything on a ext. hard drive.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply!</p>

<p>I've reinstalled my laptop with win 10, and automatically got 2017-06 Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4022405). But now I can not type Vietnamese on Microsoft edge, on the others (ex: word, excel, explorer, run... ) still ok.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>To ensure your looking at correct partition. I would suggest you to open computer and check if the ipad partition is displayed. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Start.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then click on <b>computer</b> and check if partition for ipad.</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>You may follow the steps to mount or unmount drive instead of third party software. Follow the steps in the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Mount-or-dismount-a-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Mount-or-dismount-a-drive</a></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails connect the ipad to different computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>if the issue still persists I would suggest you to contact apple support for further assistance.</p>

 is no longer an option to cast to xbox one, I'll try and reinstall and power cycle my xbox tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and could not find a definitive answer if that feature was removed in the most recent system update, but it may also be a functionality that was removed by Samsung as you had to go through the Samsung music app to get it to cast to the
 Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to do some more research, but let us know the results when you're are able to try them out!</p>

            I have tried to revert the samsung music app back to the last version I knew it worked on, and it just can't find the xbox to cast to, so it is definitely something to do with the xbox as I can still pick up other devices in the house to connect to easily,
 also my brother has an xbox one which used to appear when I tried to find mine which it no longer does??, I can only assume they removed this feature for some reason.

            Hi I have just tried the soft reset using manual settings to no avail, my phone still does not pick up either of the xbox consoles on the samsung smart view app, even though it says I am connected to the xbox in the xbox mobile app, not too bothered I
 just think it's a shame you can't play your own music anymore while driving on forza.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a73e3cb-bdc5-4c07-9297-c392e65c493d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a73e3cb-bdc5-4c07-9297-c392e65c493d?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a294598d-c742-4812-ab22-f592a9194659?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a294598d-c742-4812-ab22-f592a9194659?upload=true" /></a>

            I have been trying to cast my films from my Samsung pad to the Xbox one. Was working fine for ages but seems to have stopped in the last couple of weeks. I can't seem to see the Xbox when I search for it.&nbsp; I got it to work once but I had to reset the Xbox
 completely and now it's back to not working again.&nbsp; Anybody she'd some light on a fix would be great

    <title>Refund, Calling, Chatting. Why all the problems&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Refund, Calling, Chatting. Why all the problems&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I received an email yesterday informing me that my Skype telephone number had renewed for $39.00.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did not use it during the past year, I would like to cancel my subscription for the coming year and receive a refund if possible.</span></p>
<p><span>On another note, I had your customer service phone number from last year: 65*******. On my bank statement, the same number appeared next to the debit charge. When I called, I had a fax signal reverberate in my ear. Needless to say, I was annoyed. Could
 please have someone correct this problem?</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, I tried chat three times. Each time I followed the instructions and I clicked on “Start Chat.” The popup window came up with the following URL:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/form/51/skype/chat/?context=%5B%7B%22name%22:%22username%22,%22value%22:%22Gerald%22%7D,%7B%22name%22:%22email%22,%22value%22:___@___.___%22%7D%5D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/form/51/skype/chat/?context=%5B%7B%22name%22:%22username%22,%22value%22:%22Gerald%22%7D,%7B%22name%22:%22email%22,%22value%22:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***%22%7D%5D</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>I waited and waited, at least 10 minutes, each time, with no response. What due you mean by, “An agent will be with you shortly?”
</span></p>
<p><span>Should I see if my bank can get ahold of you tomorrow?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you, JerryFZ </span></p>

<h2>            All .exe files go to download manager and ask if you want to run or save</h2>
                    My win 7 pc suddenly cannot run .exe files. &nbsp;When it starts up I get multiple windows asking me if I want to run or save each of the startup files. &nbsp;When I click an icon for an application I get the same thing. &nbsp;If I click e.g a Word document file, Word
 opens it fine, but I cannot get any .exe files to run directly. &nbsp;Same if I go into task manager and click "new task" and try and invoke e.g notepad - "do you want to run or save"... &nbsp;Same if I go to control panel and ask to find and fix problems - "do you
 want to run or save rundll32.exe"..... Same for chkdsk, and same for any antivirus or malware scanners. &nbsp;All the solutions I can find here seem to involve somehow running a .exe programme to diagnose / fix and that is exactly what I cannot do. &nbsp;If you click
 "run" in the download dialogue there is an attempt to open a window, and then you are straight back to "do you want to run or save" the same .exe program. &nbsp;The programmes that save files all st

<p>-&gt; A more effective and less painful method would go like this:</p>
<p>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Select an admin account, then enter its password.<br />
4. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
5. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />

<h2>            Email address showing as username</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm running a Windows 10 Single Language x64, which I updated from a Windows 8.1 x64 on launch, but since install my email is showing as username instead of the name configured on my Microsoft account (I've double checked it, all is fine). I'm out of
 ideas, any tips on how I can fix this?</p>

            <div>I have the same problem too. To fix it I would go to settings and then sign out/use a local account then resign in with my Microsoft account and it should be fixed. The only issue is, that the email address will come back soon. Maybe it might work for
 you! :)</div>

<h2>            Skype App SUCKS, I want Skype for Desktop&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I was able to download the desktop install for Skype 8.17.0.2 but every time I try to install it, I get a message that prompts me to install the App from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: it doesn't auto-start when Windows starts, it doesn't log me in when I do start it, and when I finally log in, it doesn't run in the background when I close my window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this issue, but it has rendered the Skype App INEFFECTIVE. I do see a lot of people asking for Skype Classic, but I'm pretty certain they're just asking for the Desktop program versus the App version.</p>

</p><p>I get that we want to be able to install apps, they take less space and connect your devices, yada yada yada. I use IoT and IFTTT, I'm all about connecting services to make life easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key word: EASIER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm at work, as the HR Director, it does NOT make my life easier when I don't get my Skype messages through the App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, with that in mind, I have three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you're going to insist that we use the app from the Windows Store, why offer a desktop version and tease us like that?</li><li>Why isn't the App mirroring the functionality of the desktop program?</li><li>How do I get Skype to work for me so that it logs me in automatically when Windows starts and I receive notifications and see my messages when I get them?</li></ol>

<p>I solved my own problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the install file using the compatibility troubleshooter, it recommended running it in compatibility mode for Windows 8, so I did and it worked.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Congratulations on finding a work-around that got you going again.&nbsp; What buttons did you push to get the install file to run at all?&nbsp; I can't seem to get even that far.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that's because Skype was deleted altogether from my machine? Did you have a "live"

<p>I have spent hours trying to get Skype to work. I could not completely wipe it off, somehow always something seemed to stick to the registry and machine. The app never worked with my mike. It is a disgrace, what Microsoft has made of a working software.

            Did You follow Raquel's advice really? Download the latest Skype-********.exe file for Windows desktop. In Windows explorer go over the file name. Right click mouse. In the forth(?) line of the context menu there must be something pointing towards "compatibility
 problems" (my Windows is not in English), and then it should be self explanatory. Should be configured to run in Windows 8 mode. Good Luck!

<p>OOoohh I didn't even think about that, that's genius!&nbsp; My current problem is a little different: Skype keeps uninstalling itself--as in it completely removes the contents of the Skype folder, and removes the shortcut icons.&nbsp; I don't understand why it does
 that.&nbsp; Maybe MS is trying to force me to use the Skype app, but I don't like the app either and would rather keep reinstalling Skype for Desktop than deal with the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time it uninstalls I'm going to try running it in compatibility mode for Win 8 to see if that makes a difference.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for sharing your solution!</p>

<h2>            Screen Time Settings Preventing PC Log In</h2>
                    <p>My son's PC is set up to use only his Microsoft account (as the administrator), but his account is linked to mine as a Family account with Screen Time limits set. His PC is now saying that screen time limits have expired and I cannot login to his PC at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning off the screen time limits to free up his PC, but it is not taking effect. This has left me unable to access his PC at all, effectively I am locked out of his computer.</p>

<h3> jackt ukhiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Code 43</h2>
                    Okay so I have a huge problem and a short fuse so I'll keep this simple without raging. I installed Microsofts shiny new Windows about the same time everyone else did and when I did my NVIDIA driver all of a sudden had a code 43 (Windows has stopped this
 driver because it reported problems or whatever). I'm not that tech savy and I'd prefer not to take my computer apart. so I figured it would be fine. Wrong. Nothing works the way it should and I have no idea why it keeps saying that Windows has a problem with
 this driver. Can someone please help me figure this out before I go egg some nearby Microsoft store?

            <p>Um...</p>
<p>I like to build computers for fun, and I've a fair amount of experience. I rebuild one that I've built previously when I become bored sometimes. So, I'll make an effort to respond with what I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything that I've ever built has always been around those temperatures, and hotter. For example, I've an old Core 2 Quad Q6600 @2.4GHz that idles at 50 - 60c, and hits upwards of 80c+ when I'm playing MineCraft, or watching videos in high resolutions.
 ...But this is because I don't use Thermal Paste. I never have performance issues, so I don't see the importance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, 60c is a very nice temperature to max out at, and I honestly believe that you needn't worry about it. I've hit 90+ before when attempting to multitask whilst playing MineCraft with SEUS shaders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>However; if you really wish to lower those temps even further, you could try using a higher grade of Thermal Paste (Arctic Silver), or maybe try changing the case to one with better air-flow. I've heard that proper Wire Management also tends to help with
 temperatures, although I'm inclined to disagree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just don't go taking apart your PC if you've never built one before. It's easy enough to do, but it's also easy to goof things up if you're not careful, and you've no practise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another thing to note... You didn't actually give us the name of your CPU. Yes, you said it was an 'Extreme Edition' clocked at 3.4GHz, but that matches numerous CPU models from over the years. Like, it could be an old Pentium D, or an i5. You ought to name
 the hardware properly that you're asking for advice on next time, as it might help aid those in aiding you.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Err.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that would have much effect on heat, unless your PSU wasn't powerful enough to supply proper power to your entire system. My current build uses two Xeons, a GTX 560, and 16GB of Ram. That's a lot of power drain, but my 750watt PSU is more than
 capable of feeding it all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've never been over 70c with this build.</p>
<p>Regardless, I hope that you've solved your problem.</p>

            <p>btw the Thermal Paste is <strong>priority N1</strong> to avoid the CPU to overheating</p>
<p>if you don't know to how do it or how much you need to use it</p>
<p>plz check in YouTube ,there are plenty of videos can explain that very well</p>

<p>Windows XP, Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>In addition</p>
<p>The DEP error window pops up as various times, it's hard to pinpoint or know the cause.....sometimes when scrolling through My Documents or video media folders, or during internet browsing. I use IE8.</p>
<p>In addition, sometimes everything just locks up and freezes. I can't End Task programs anymore...I have to End task them in Task Manager, then go to processes, and End Process the program or End Process&nbsp; a dumpreg.exe....and then everything goes back to
 normal....but that may be a seperate matter</p>

<p>You should not have any Microsoft programs listed in the box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft programs should not be causing DEP errors.</p>
<p>I offer these ideas to resolve your DEP issue.&nbsp; There is a lot to read, but it covers Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer DEP errors and some of the stuff you may have already done.&nbsp; When you get done, you will know how DEP is supposed to work, why you
 should not have anything in the box and then how to figure out and resolve your issue.<br />
<br />
Data Execution Prevention (DEP) messages mean that Windows feels threatened by some program running on your computer, so it shuts it down.&nbsp; This is actually a good thing since Windows recognizes the threat and is trying to prevent further damage.<br />
<br />
DEP errors usually seem to be reported either from either Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer.&nbsp; A DEP error is usually not going to be actually caused by Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer -&nbsp; it is going to be caused by something that was added to them
 through a third party program or download.<br />
<br />
If the DEP error does not tell you the name of the application or program that is generating the error, you will have to figure it out yourself.<br />
<br />
If the DEP error does tell you the name of the application, you need to report that and not just say you are getting some kind of Data Execution Prevention<br />
error message.&nbsp; If you have more details, provide them to there is no guessing about what you are seeing.<br />
<br />
XP should not feel threatened by Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
If the DEP error is coming from Internet Explorer, the error or threat is usually coming from some third party IE add-on that has been added to IE by a third party browser extension or some other add-on either with your consent or without your consent.<br />
<br />
<br />
XP should not feel threatened by Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
If the DEP error is coming from Windows Explorer, the error or threat is usually coming from some third party Explorer extension or add-on that has been added to Explorer either with your consent or without your consent.<br />
<br />
If you can narrow down the DEP errors to a certain activity and reproduce it anytime you want, like visiting a certain web site always give me a DEP error or right clicking on this file this folder and doing this thing always gives me a DEP error, that will
 help you narrow it down.<br />
<br />
You do not have to be "exploring" to have Windows Explorer DEP issues.&nbsp; Windows Explorer is always running on your system so if you are not browsing the Internet with Internet Explorer and you just see a DEP error for no apparent reason, it is usually going
 to be Windows Explorer where you need to start<br />
looking for problems.<br />
<br />
If somebody can't figure out what the problem is and fix it properly, a popular idea will either be to just disable DEP completely or make a DEP exception for the application or program that is complaining (or as many DEP exceptions as it takes) so XP will
 just stop complaining about the threat.<br />
<br />
That is a quick and easy "solution" but it is not really a solution at all.&nbsp; Something is threatening your system and you have not fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you just change your DEP settings without a valid reason to do so, you would have fixed the symptom of the problem (the DEP errors) but you would not<br />
have actually fixed the problem and what is causing it in the first place.&nbsp; Somehow that is okay for some folks, but it is not okay for me.<br />
<br />
There is a big difference between fixing a problem and fixing the symptom of a problem.&nbsp; Hopefully you want to fix the problem and not just the symptom.&nbsp; Adjusting your system settings so you no longer see an error message does not fix your system.<br />
<br />
It is also just plain not good advice since doing so would leave your system in a compromised and sloppy state and potentially subject to outside<br />
attack (but it is quick and easy).<br />
<br />
It also does not make sense to just completely disable DEP since Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer should not be threatening their own other Microsoft products - they are of course all a big happy family and should get along together.<br />
<br />
DEP has a purpose which is to protect your computer and if you are having DEP errors, XP feels somehow threatened so it is best to figure out what the problem is and fix it.<br />
<br />
You should first run some scans for malicious software and see if that will correct the problem and then troubleshoot any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malware protection, download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
After running the scans, be sure to reboot and then test.<br />
<br />
If Internet Explorer is complaining, launch Internet Explorer with no Add-ons and see if you still have the problem.<br />
<br />
If Internet Explorer then runs okay with no add-ons, you can figure out which add-on is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Windows has a built in option to run Internet Explorer with no Add-ons (imagine that).<br />
<br />
To launch Internet Explorer with no Add-ons, click Start, Programs, System Tools and choose:<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)<br />
<br />
If you can't find that, click Start, Run and in the box enter (or copy/past the following line):<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"&nbsp; -extoff<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch IE with no Add-ons.<br />
<br />
IE will launch with a message reminding you it is running with no add-ons and ask you to click the Home button (do it) and then you can visit some web pages where you might think you would get a DEP error.&nbsp; The pages may look different, but you want to see
 if you still get the DEP error message or not.<br />
<br />
If you have added any IE add-ons lately, suspect them first of course.<br />
<br />
If you then have no DEP errors, you can eliminate the add-ons one at a time or add them back in one at a time until IE generates the DEP error again and then you will know the add-on that is causing the error.&nbsp; When you find the add-on that causes the error,
 the next thing to do it uninstall it, reboot and test again to be sure. If you still need the add-on, visit the web site of the add-on manufacturer and get their latest version of the add-on or program you need.&nbsp; If they have a technical support page, look
 in there for clues regarding DEP errors.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
my-suspicious-add-on&nbsp; XP DEP error&nbsp; (you have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving, start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added sometimes without your knowledge.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.&nbsp; If you can make it happen anytime you want, make and adjustment and
 then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed not and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
When you launch it, the non Microsoft extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll
 left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header for Microsoft to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column) so all the "No"s are at the top and easy to see.<br />
<br />
The "No"s would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
my-suspicious-add-on&nbsp; XP DEP error&nbsp; (you have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the condition.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the error and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you find the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be sure the
 problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list of extensions to suspect first.</p>
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>

Regarding spyware or malware, etc, as I mentioned before.......</p>
<p>I've ran Norton 360 2011, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Microsoft Forefront, Ccleaner, Cleanup,....and now, just in case, SuperAntiSpyware. Nothing was detected.</p>
<p>My concern, because I'm not familiar with DEP, is whether there really is malicious code on my computer, ex, a virus or trojan that all these protection programs can't pick up and can cause damage down the line.....or there is just a rogue piece of code
 that isn't of concern as far as damaging my files or system from a program that is causing the DEP pop ups???</p>
<p>The DEP window and it's contents and information, which I put in the first post, hasn't changed anytime that it comes up and only displays this:</p>
<p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Data Execution Prevention - Microsoft Windows</p>
<p>To help protect your computer, Windows has closed&nbsp;this program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name: Windows Explorer<br />
Publisher: Microsoft Corporation<br />

</span><span>P9 : 00000008<br />
</span>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>1. As of right now.....the DEP window pops up,&nbsp;when I'm in the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;In Internet Options when I'm deleting my history and temp files (the window doesn't come up&nbsp;every time)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - On the internet (haven't pinpointed yet&nbsp;what and where it is causing the DEP window to pop up)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - On one&nbsp;occasion, not doing anything the DEP Window&nbsp;comes up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Going through My Documents or when I come across a video folder that is in thumbnail mode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - At times when watching an AVI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll see if anything else comes up or prompts the pop up window, but whether I was able to disable an add-on or not.....</p>
<p>I did run the ShellExView and saw lots of options including those&nbsp;listed in pink that came up. It was difficult to determine where to start or what the problem could be, if it's an add-on or whatever.</p>
<p>The main point I have is:</p>
<p>I've done scans with all those security&nbsp;programs and even though the DEP issue pops up from time to time, I was wondering where it's safe to move files over to my external drives to save, etc, or not, until the issue is resolved?&nbsp;&nbsp; ....In an attempt to save
 my files, I don't want to corrupt anything that I would have on my externals, unless it wouldn't be an issue regarding this problem.</p>

<p>My post is an edited transcription of a conversation regarding general troubleshooting methods for DEP errors and encompasses several concepts.</p>
<p>I cannot see any problem with you copying your files to an external device - that is not the problem with your system, except that in the process of copying the files, you may continue to get DEP errors.&nbsp; The DEP problem is not in your files - it is in your
 add-ons and/or extensions.</p>
<p>If ShellExView shows lots of add-ons or extensions and you have set the options to mark the Non-Microsoft Extensions in pink, you can post a list and someone may be able to spot one they recognize as a troublemaker.&nbsp; That is easy for me, since I generally
 don't use IE and only have 12 Explorer extensions, but I have seen systems where there are several dozens so posting a list is not always practical but you can still figure it out.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 100 extensions...&nbsp; Doing them one at a time is a pain, so disable 50% of them, reboot and test.&nbsp; If you still have a problem. of the 50 you have left over that are still enabled the problem is in that group, so disable 50% more (the next
 25) until you can zero in on the one that is causing the problem.&nbsp; If the problem goes away, start reenabling them in smaller chunks until you can spot the one that causes the problem.&nbsp; The process of elimination.&nbsp; You can always find the problem with certainty.</p>
<p>Have you looked in the Event View immediately after the DEP error to see if there are additional clues?&nbsp; Sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't.</p>
<p>Your DEP problem is most likely with an Internet Explorer add-on and/or Windows Explorer shell extensions (or both).&nbsp; IE and Explorer by themselves should not be causing DEP errors.&nbsp; If you want to find the cause of the DEP error and fix it, you have the
 means to do so.</p>
<p>Look in the Event Viewer for clues around the time of the incident.<br />
<br />
Here is a method to post the specific information about individual events.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc /s<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If you enable the logging for them the
 logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.&nbsp; Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp;
 Try to find just the events at the date<br />
and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp;
 Remove any personal information from your information<br />
after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />

Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />

<br />
To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered), then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the events that are happening when you have
 your issue.<br />
<br />
You can look up events on the following World Wide Web site:</p>

<p>I disabled some of the add-ons in IE and at least in regards to running Internet Explorer and the DEP error coming up....that stopped.</p>
<p>It had been a couple days and wanted to make sure that the issue was gone for good,&nbsp;not only for running IE, but also Windows, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it wasn't till I played a video file today&nbsp;that I've had for years, that the DEP issue came up again.</p>
<p>I noticed, as I mentioned before that the DEP issue came up through&nbsp;different manners, but it would come up a lot&nbsp;when running a media file.</p>
<p>It doesn't affect mp3s&nbsp;or any audio file, nor does it affect running a mov/quicktime file. It's centered around Windows Media player files like mpg and primarily avi, but those encoded with divx or other codecs. I have DIVX plus&nbsp;for editing, but did an&nbsp;uninstall
 and re-install&nbsp;thinking it was that codec issue and hoped to fix it doing that, but the DEP problem still now at this point persists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing followed by Watchdog Violation Blue Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing followed by Watchdog Violation Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>I've been having some major issues with my custom built pc recently.<br />
Specs:<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit<br />
Motherboard: Asus X99-E WS/USB 3.1<br />
CPU: Intel i7 5960X overclocked (stable) @4.3GHz<br />
RAM: 64GB 2400MHz, I think it was HyperX<br />
GPUs: 2 Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X (Pascal)'s in SLI<br />
Main C: Drive is a Samsung 960 Evo 500GB NVMe SSD<br />
<br />
So, I'll just be doing normal, every day type things like web browsing, watching videos, or launching programs, and then the whole screen freezes in place, the screen doesn't turn black, and then after about 30 seconds to a minute, I get the blue screen of
 death and the infamous "DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION" error.<br />
I'll reboot and one time it didn't even get past the sign in screen before it froze and crashed again.<br />
<br />
The Minidump file that I uploaded to OSR Online's Instant Online Crash Analysis said this:<br />

I tried reinstalling graphics drivers countless times, and trying older drivers but nothing has worked.<br />
<br />
I also have been constantly seeing errors in the event viewer that say:<br />
"Event 10016, DistributedCOM"<br />
"The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />
{D63B10C5-BB46-4990-A94F-E40B9D520160}<br />

 tool."<br />
<br />
And also this very similar one I got 8 times in a row all within a few seconds:<br />
"Event 10016, DistributedCOM"<br />
"The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Some more errors:<br />
"Event 10016, DistributedCOM"<br />
"The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />

 tool."<br />
<br />
"Event 10005, DistrubutedCOM"<br />
"DCOM got error "1084" attempting to start the service ShellHWDetection with arguments "Unavailable" in order to run the server:<br />
{DD522ACC-F821-461A-A407-50B198B896DC}"<br />

<br />
I searched that online and went through this process of going into the DCOM Cfg and changing the permissions on the CLSID&nbsp; and the APPID which appears to be "RuntimeBroker", I didn't really know what I was doing and I don't know if it helped but I did that,
 restarted, and the problem went away for a little while. Then I was just doing more normal activities , I even played some GPU intensive games, and then while in Google Chrome, it froze and crashed again.</p>
<p><br />
I'm sure that reinstalling Windows would be a solution, unless my GPU is dying, but I REALLY don't want to go through with that again. I've reinstalled Windows about 3 times on this machine now, once because I upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 and it broke a bunch
 of things, and another time it was because of Windows update. I also updated my BIOS for my motherboard to see if it would fix this but it didn't. This PC is my MAIN workstation, it was over $7000 and I need it to be up and running error-free again ASAP.<br />

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

            Hi Jonamac, well, the dump above indicates your Nvidia graphics device driver as the culprit. This does not indicate your GPU needs replacing, it just indicates an incompatibility with that device driver . . 
<br />
<br />Please try this first:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running
<br />
<br />
<br />If the above does not stop the system crashes, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Jonamac
<br />
<br />Yes, the minidump files also indicate a problem with your Nvidia graphics device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Did you try rolling back and/or updating that driver?

            In the post yeah I did mention that I tried reinstalling Nvidia GPU drivers several times with 4 different driver versions. I tried the latest one which is 416.34, I also did 3 of the ones before that, 416.16, 411.70, and 411.63. I used DDU and then did
 both express and clean driver installs, nothing has worked so far.

<br />DRIVERS
<br />Driver Name: nvlddmkm - nVidia driver 
<br />Driver Date: 16-Sep-2018 (This is a fairly new driver)
<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some nVidia graphics driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that (Don't install now)
<br />Use DDU to uninstall current graphics driver completely and restart your computer

<br />Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

            Seems you have already removed nVidia by DDU and reinstalled. 
<br />
<br />Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

            Enabled Driver Verifier, selected all non Microsoft drivers, including the "<span>nvlddmkm.sys" one as well. Restarted the PC and after about 2 and a half minutes, it froze and crashed with the same watchdog violation error,
 restarted again and turned off Driver Verifier. Here's the new Minidump:&nbsp;</span>

<h3> tmbatts33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer &#40;taskbar&#41; freezes when Windows Media Player is installed and file sharing is turned on</h2>
                    
<p>Operating factory-installed Windows 7 home premium x64.&nbsp; Recently purchased a new laptop with similar specs.&nbsp; Since then I have been having problems with the taskbar freezing whenever Windows Media Player was open.&nbsp; It has continuously gotten worse.&nbsp; I have
 tried uninstalling and reinstalling WMP with no change.&nbsp; Through the process of elimination I have determined that it only seems to happen when WMP is installed and file-sharing in the homegroup is activated.&nbsp; I disabled all file-sharing and ran WMP with no
 problem.&nbsp; I then uninstalled WMP and am currently running file share of all libraries with WMP installed and again no problems.&nbsp; But if I activate both my taskbar freezes within minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas for a fix?</p>

<p>Well, I think I finally found the problem, and it wasn't the explorer or WMP. It was the WMP Network Sharing service... actually it was Windows Firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Norton 360 installed, and have ever since I purchased this machine.&nbsp; I turned Windows Firewall
 off at that time so they wouldn't conflict, but somehow Windows Firewall got reactivated, and my guess is the Sharing service activating triggered a conflict between the two firewall programs. (This makes sense because the problem started when I first bought
 my new laptop and setup file share to stream music and pics to the laptop, rather than filling the hard drive of the laptop with duplicates).</p>
<p>I have been running WMP for the last 15 minutes with no hang.&nbsp; Not only that, but I'm "overloading" the streaming service by taking a file on my PC, streaming it to the laptop, and then using the "play to" feature to play it back on the PC
<em>and</em> streaming another song at the same time and playing on my laptop.&nbsp; No hang, no freeze, no CPU overload.</p>

<p>Why there's no print icon/button/selection in Windows 10 calendar? I thought that was only a temporary problem in Onedrive but it seems Microsoft didn't bother to fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS1: ctrl + p is not working</p>
<p>PS2:&nbsp;print screen the calendar and then open it, is an amateur solution. I want&nbsp;to know if there's an official possibility provided by Microsoft and whether it is going to be fixed in future updates or not.

            <p>This is really frustrating (not being able to print the outlook calendar!!!! I found that if I went to the 3 dots on the upper right corner a window drops down with "Open with internet explorer" once I have done this I can then right click and get my normal
 screen for printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is nuts to have to have a work around for a new release of software!!</p>

            Something so simple. Anyone would think the windows calendar app would have a print option! Idiots don't think of such a thing but they sure can make a lame attempt at an app! An option to merge would be a big plus. Yes WORTHLESS.

            <p>I was getting frustrated with this, tried many workarounds, different settings etc but could never get an entire month, with all of my appointments, to print on a single page- it always seemed to cut off the last couple of days of the week&nbsp;and/or the last
 week of the month. Finally, I have found the most cumbersome workaround imaginable- but it does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-bring up&nbsp;Internet Explorer (tried Firefox and Edge and they&nbsp;don't seem to work as well)</p>
<p>-log into your account at www.live.com and go to your calendar</p>
<p>-find the 'Page' dropdown menu (top left of the screen) and set zoom to 100%</p>
<p>-click on each week of your calendar ('3 more', '2 more', etc) to expand all&nbsp;of your&nbsp;events</p>
<p>-make sure the entire month is showing (if not you could reduce the zoom further, but the font will be tiny)</p>
<p>-take a screen shot (on a Surface tablet, that's the Windows key&nbsp;+ the volume-down button)</p>
<p>-find your screen shot (mine are set to go to a subfolder in my 'Pictures' folder)</p>
<p>-click on the pencil icon to crop out the toolbars etc (which will make the tiny font slightly larger)</p>
<p>-CTRL-P</p>
<p>-select 'landscape', then 'print'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe that this is the best&nbsp;way to accomplish such a simple function, but it's the best one I've found so far :(</p>

    <title>Unable to install audio drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to install audio drivers</h2>
                    I have bought a gaming headset and when I plug in the USB, there is no sound coming from the headset. I went to my computer model's website and tried to install the audio driver from there but it did not install. The headset's website had a driver but
 again it could not be installed. I used troubleshoot,it found the missing drivers for the headset and the audio driver for my computer but the troubleshoot could not fix the problems. Now my computer has no sound and the headset and other earpieces do not
 play any sound when plugged in.<br />

<p>The newest Windows feature update is here.</p>
<p>It's ready to install - with features and apps, this one could take a little longer than other updates. You decide when to make it happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ready? Restart now. Not ready? Pick a time that works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three buttons labeled "Restart Now&lt;" "Pick a time," and "Snooze."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing is selectable on the original background window. I cannot select anything and get no response from any area of the screen</p>
<p>except these three buttons on the questionable window. There is no Microsoft identifying logo, no "x" to quit the window; nothing looks legitimate to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply powering down and restarting does not seem to bother it. After running Edge or Firefox for awhile, the blue window pops</p>
<p>up again with the same lack of response anywhere on the screen but these three buttons. It does not seem legitimate, is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is running Windows 10 and I update frequently.</p>
