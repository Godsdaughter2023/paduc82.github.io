<p>I open the feedback hub and then it asks me to sign in. &nbsp;It brings up a box with my credentials and when I press sign-in it does nothing. &nbsp;You KNOW the OS has issues when even the feedback app has issues. &nbsp;</p>

<p>January 26, 2017 </p>
<p>Just got an email from Microsoft saying that deandrehill had answered my problem, I had 5 replies, none from a deandrehill.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;of the 5 replies 4 were others with the same problem or similar, the only reply was from ThofikhAhamad. I did find a way to fix
 my problem after a month of waiting for an answer, like most of our problems MS doesn't reply except the trash like, use Windows Update, which is how we got into this mess to start with, or the old reinstall the Insider Preview version again, which means we
 usually have to reinstall everything all over again, which I have done 4 times, only to run right back into the same problem as soon as that update comes back around again. It's sort of like my problem with EDGE, another useless program, since day one my Customization
 of the page hasn't worked to keep my settings on which items I want to see when it opens, to this day it still doesn't work and no reply on the Insider Feedback either.</p>
<p>Don't bother to call MS support for problems with the Insider Preview edition either, they don't work on it or so they told me. So no help from anywhere, it seems to me if someone was doing me a favor by being my testing crew, since they got rid of their
 regular testers, I would try my best to support them, not MS. They want you information on problems with their OS and your personal information, which is one of the big reason Windows 10 is slow, but help isn't coming it cost them to much, they just fix it
 sometime on down the line.</p>
<p>As far as help on line answers, most of them are not for Windows 8 or 10, so they no help and there is so many different answers that are wrong it's not funny.&nbsp;I kept getting error codes and BSOD, sent it to MS by the Insider Feedback and got nothing from
 them, except we are working on it, the thing about it is there were many others experiencing the same codes and BSOD.&nbsp;No one at MS cared enough to help us, I finally paid a third party software firm to fix the problems and error codes. Which they said was
 because the Windows Update files was creating more problems than it fixed with the builds. Next Build came down the line, same thing again, didn't even make it a week.</p>
<p>Now to my fix, I got to thinking, what am I doing this is crazy, why am I allowing this to go on, free OS testing and free personal information that they sell for a profit as it cost them nothing to gather the info under the pretense helping the community.
 I had already had to buy Windows 10 Pro because my SSD went out, small print free, till you need a new SSD, then you need to purchase a new license, bummer, no more free OS, even for an Insider. But the kicker was when MS shut down everything to install their
 new delivery system right in the middle of all my errors and BSOD for 3 weeks I put up with it, till I could take no more of a terrible Support System. I said to heck with them, they don't want to help us I'm no longer helping them, I installed my Windows
 10 Pro and forgot about the Insider program all together.&nbsp; All went well for a while till I checked my Event Codes, what do I find, Event Code 10016 dCom 20 -30 times a day, Support Help. Only to be told, after they took over my computer to check things out,
 don't worry about it, you OK having that error event code, maybe so but I don't want to keep having an error event going on, to me something isn't right or it wouldn't be popping up, like to get it fixed.</p>
<p>I've been an MS supporter since day one of my beginning to mess with computers, which goes back to the Commodore 64 days, some of you might never of heard of one of those computers if you&nbsp;can call it that, LOL. But MS has disappointed me with Windows 10,
 to drop an Operating System on the public with more bugs than bites is so unprofessional, then expect them to do your troubleshooting for you for free and wait for them to come&nbsp;out with a fix when ever they please all the time adding more&nbsp; programs that doesn't
 work right to the mess is unethical, IMHO.</p>
<p>But I'm a nobody so why should&nbsp;my feedback&nbsp;or problems matter to them and the plain truth is we don't matter. My rant is done, atleast I was able to vent some, sorry you people had to be subject to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you should be running 4.3.215.0 (or 216 -- both are the same) your Upgrade apparently failed, so you are running a broken old version.</p>

<p>And then, to address the problem with MSE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please review the following:</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software. See this Wiki article:</p>

<p>Thank you for informing us. Since the phone is still new and you've tried performing soft reset and hard reset, it is best that you bring it to your re-seller and have it checked. Please ensure to bring the warranty of your phone, you may need it for transactions.</p>

<h2>            How can I keep a text box from disappearing on a chart</h2>
                    I have a chart with quite a bit a data in it and was needing to enter a text box on one side to correspond with some information in the data table.&nbsp; It took the information fine, but everytime I go to scroll up the page or somewhere else on the chart it
 disappears.&nbsp; When I click on the area it was in sometimes the whole text box will come back and sometimes it's part of it.&nbsp; How can I set this so it will stop disappearing?

<p>Many image editors can create transparent colors or transparency layers in a PNG file. Then import it to PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within PowerPoint, you can select and image, then choose <strong>Picture Tools Format&gt;Color&gt;Set Transparent Color</strong> to set a single transparent color. This works best with line art or graphics with areas of flat color, like logos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For photos, select the photo, then choose <strong>Picture Tools Format&gt;Remove Background</strong>. Make any corrections to the Background Removal by drawing with the
<strong>Keep</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> tools, then click on <strong>Keep Changes</strong> when you're done.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You need to fix your updating process from early Builds such as 9926 to newer Builds with respect to Bluetooth (wireless) device drivers that Bootcamp installs on Apple products. &nbsp;Currently, the process removes perfectly good and operating drivers with ones
 that either do not work or worse, the updating shuts off Bluetooth services rendering both Bluetooth keyboard and mouse unavailable. &nbsp;This process, of course, results in a completely useless Windows OS. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Its the reality of Apple hardware. I would not recommend installing Windows 10 Previews on Apple computers until the company officially supports the OS with official&nbsp;boot camp drivers. Unlike Microsoft who works with OEMs such as Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer,
 Sony, Gateway, Samsung, ASUS, MSI and many others to at least have beta drivers available during development, Apple is responsible for their own drivers and they develop them at their own pace, because they don't see&nbsp;supporting the competition as an advantage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I recommend you using Virtualbox or VMware Fusion or Parallels to safely evaluate Windows 10 Previews on Apple hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Apple, Windows remains major competition. </p>

            I understand what you are saying about competition, but I don't understand why the installation of new Builds of Windows 10 Technical Preview takes away perfectly good drivers during the installation process. &nbsp;It takes something that works and breaks it.
 &nbsp;That doesn't make much sense to me.

            <p>Well the driver model is going through some significant changes in Windows 10, so nothing is guaranteed. On my HP Elitebook, the drivers for Windows 7 do not work with Windows 10, I have to get new ones through Windows Update.

            <p>I feel for you. &nbsp;Having to get new drivers installed is a big pain, but eventually as you imply, this should soon stop when engineers finish working on the driver model. &nbsp;However, it doesn't seem so bad for you as the drivers you need appear to be available
 through Windows Update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I cannot even log in to Windows, because the mouse and the keyboard are now not connected to the OS. &nbsp;I can't do anything. &nbsp;I am a lot of typing and clicking away from getting new drivers installed or even the old ones put back by re-running
 the Bootcamp software, but even if it were just one click or the typing of just one letter, I could not do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst part is that I got to this point by following the advice of a Microsoft Support Engineer. &nbsp;He obviously did not know what he was talking about when he made his recommendation. &nbsp;The updating of the OS/installation of a new Build is for Apple hardware
 at this point a downdate or de-installation. &nbsp;I am still struck by the fact that this process futzes around with installed drivers that do work. &nbsp;Why doesn't it leave well-enough alone? &nbsp;Do the engineers even know about this behavior? &nbsp;Do they know that their
 new Builds remove Bluetooth drivers for the keyboard and mouse without replacing them or turning the Bluetooth services back on after turning them off? &nbsp;If not, I think they should be notified. &nbsp;This is my effort at educating Microsoft as I have no other avenue
 to reach the engineers, but I have to rely on you to get my information from here to them, wherever they are. &nbsp;Could you see that this discussion is disseminated to the right parties?</p>

    <title>Change name for alias e-mails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winterland_2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change name for alias e-mails</h2>
                    I wish to use a pseudonym for my primary e-mail but I want to have an&nbsp;alias for professional purposes that will show my real name.&nbsp; How can I do this?&nbsp; It seems I can only set a Microsoft account name and that name forcibly shows up on all e-mail addresses
 with no option to change it or just not use a name and have only the address display.&nbsp; This is very inconvenient and it seems like a very small thing; the ability to change your sender name is something that was already present in the old Outlook software
 but apparently doesn't exist in the new and supposedly advanced Outlook.com?

            Nope. I already know how to create the alias address, I'm saying that when u send emails from it, it still shows the same name. I want to send from a pseudonym on my main address and my real name from the alias.

<h2>            Swapping memory card&#39;s on my N73</h2>
                    I've just bought a faster 2GB memory card for my N73, but when I fit the new card and run the Restore utility (phone &amp; memory card) in PC Suite, the memory card installed applications disappear.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to switch to a new memory card without reinstalling the card stored applications?

<p><span>Hi Skyler,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like you to confirm whether you are using the Issue Tracking app in SharePoint Online.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, about “When changing the selection of a radio button it does not allow me to select anything and the drop down menu gets an error after changing the selection</span>”, could you upload
 some related screenshots? &nbsp;Could you also list the detailed reproducing steps of the issue?</p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, check if the issue happens in a specific Issue Tracking app or in a specific site. If you do a test with a new Issue Tracker app in another site or in the affected site, what’s the
 result? Are other users in your company experiencing the same issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

 not Security Essentials. Should I be worried? Would these scammers have more information than just my phone number or was this just a random scam attempt? Also, does Microsoft even make phone calls about security alerts?

    <title>Excell 2016 has multiple pages in all workbooks after installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melvyng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excell 2016 has multiple pages in all workbooks after installing creators upload in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I uploaded the Creators update in Widows 10 and find that all workbooks in Excell 2016 now have multiple pages which can't be altered.</p>
<p>All my work books had been previously set to a single page using Page break so that printing was easy.</p>
<p>Now with the multiple pages I can't print and the Page Break function now doesn't allow the cursor to move the pages (dotted lines) to create a single page.</p>
<p>The multiple pages open in every workbook even though all had been previously saved as a single page.</p>
<p>Please help!!!!&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be caused by an add-in that is not compatible with the application after getting the Creators Update or there might be a setting on your application that needs to disable. For us to be able to isolate the cause of your concern, kindly provide
 the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you encountering the issue on a specific Excel file?</li><li>Are you using any add-ins for your Office application?</li><li>Have you tried to create a new Excel file and check if you will encounter the same issue?</li><li>Are you getting any error codes or messages upon printing the file?</li></ul>

<p>HI Ma.Lau</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear I am talking about a worksheet in a workbook If there are several worksheets then all have the same issue.</p>
<p>There can be up to 9 pages separated by dotted lines which can't be moved by using Page Break. The solid lines can be moved.</p>
<p>All workbooks/worksheets have exactly the same issue even though all were saved as a single page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:-</p>
<p>All Excel files/workbooks/worksheets have the same issue.</p>
<p>No add-ins used.</p>
<p>A new file has the same issue.</p>
<p>No error codes or messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only happened after the upgrade!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a mystery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

    <title>Display actual email address when reading and sending emails. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Display actual email address when reading and sending emails.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am using my desktop.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening or sending <strong>hotmail</strong> emails all I am seeing is the circular graphic with their initials. I have no idea who they are and where the emails are coming from. Likewise when I send an email, it is difficult to see the ACTUAL email
 address or if I am using the recipients personal vs business address. I see this as a potential problem in that I may open spam emails, I also cannot copy the actual email address and use in another application (sometimes I use this as a log in to 3rd party
 applications)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how I can change or if it is something that cannot be customized</p>
<p><br />
Thank you</p>
<p />

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see that, however my frustration is that we have to go to all that effort to do that (in Yahoo &amp; Gmail it is clearly visible) and more importantly we cannot copy the address and paste in another area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not always wish to add to my personal address book b<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ut tend to use that address in other applications or databases.- Is there anyway this can be done or do we need to write it down on paper and retype in another
 application or database</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>With <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Gmail and Yahoo </span>we can clearly see the address without having to further steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8187b770-0d47-4fe9-8f27-27a86e18023c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8187b770-0d47-4fe9-8f27-27a86e18023c" height="62" width="250" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong>hotmail</strong> And if you click <strong>reply</strong> the only thing you are seeing is the same logo. (as an example)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38b7deea-ab07-4d80-865a-e3d9215aa0a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38b7deea-ab07-4d80-865a-e3d9215aa0a4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore once again the address is not visible. It is cumbersome to always drill down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is how hotmail also used to do it? If this is no longer possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the old hotmail was way easier?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your time.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your continued response and advise. The problem with right clicking on the email address is that it shows the whole name eg fred smith &lt;&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;&gt; and therefore is not suited to using as a log on to other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am finding really, really strange is that we can easily view the actual email address (and there is no large picture to the left of the name) when accessing hotmail on a cell&nbsp; phone via a browser. (I cannot download the application due to my cell
 phone being too old)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason the functionality on the cell phone would be different, or alternatively how we can remove the circular icon on our names.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks again for all your help</p>

            <p>I suspect that the engineers will eventually have the circular icon tie into Skype.</p>
<p>The person's picture will display and the circle will show if the person is online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A cell phone will never have the same functionality as a desktop or laptop.</p>
<p>Screen size, storage space, processor power, battery life, .... all contribute to a cell phone being different.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve just spent &#36;379 for Microsoft support service. Did I do the right thing or I have I been a victim of Microsoft support scare tactic&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Microsoft network security protection had expired. I had planed to buy MacAfee to protect my PC but&nbsp;before I had a&nbsp;chance to do so&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;had already picked up a Trojan virus and while I was browsing a website&nbsp;a Microsoft window popped up with the following
 number 1-855-205-6509 asking to call Microsoft support to have the virus removed. There was also a stern warning not to close the pop up window, otherwise Microsoft will be forced to shut down my PC to prevent me from losing all my information and my PC from
 causing further damage to the Microsoft network.</p>
<p>So freaked out and called the number. The charge to remove the virus $179.99. To me that is a steep price (one can buy a new laptop for that much).&nbsp;I am&nbsp;not a PC technician but I have had viruses in my&nbsp;previous computers, I would ran a full scan, identify
 the culprit and use some cleaning software to remove them. I was taken aback&nbsp;that I was not given the option of even trying to remove the virus from my PC myself. My only option was to call the above number or My PC will be shut down.
</p>
<p>I also had to buy a three year&nbsp;Microsoft network security protection for $200, after that I was told by the technician that neither Norton nor MacAfee network security software would work with windows 10. I was really mad that I had to pay so much at once
 but mostly because none of those security software would work with Windows. the later part kind of got me mad at Microsoft as a company.&nbsp; But after I was finally given to go ahead to use my PC again, I went online and type MacAfee Windows 10, I found out there
 is a MacAfee network security software for windows a nd Norton as well.</p>
<p>So my question is (about the $379 I've just spent) Did I do the right thing or I have I been a victim of Microsoft support scare tactic?</p>

            I too was scammed by a person saying they were a Microsoft Tech. &nbsp;I allowed access to my computer to which the tech said that if he could fix my computer easily there would be no charge. &nbsp;After looking at my computer he decided he was going to charge me
 to fix it. &nbsp;I said F--k you and he hung up. &nbsp;I immediately found the program that he logged into on and deleted it from my computer after fighting the program for awhile. &nbsp;The phone number he gave me was 866-326-1069. &nbsp;The website he was from was this: Citrix
 Online Launcher Citrix. &nbsp;I hope this is useful to someone else because we can all put an end to this by sharing information.&nbsp;

    <title>I can&#39;t text in Spanish on my new Windows 10 Mobile phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I can&#39;t text in Spanish on my new Windows 10 Mobile phone &#40;Lumia 950 XL&#41;. The text autocorrects to English.</h2>
                    I am bilingual but being American I set up my Lumia 950 XL during purchase as 'English'. However, I can't text my friends in Mexico in Spanish because the texting function keeps autocorrecting the Spanish words to similar appearing English words (which
 is obviously useless.) For example, words typed in Spanish like 'Hola' (Hello in Spanish) get changed to some English word like 'Hole.' This majorly sucks.

<p>
</p><p>Huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply is arrogant - as in, like I am supposed to? Where did that come from?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never heard of adding an additional language keyboard to any Windows device and I am a long term Windows user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard I am using in my reply - attached to my Win 7 Ult 64-bit workstation - will respond and post any input (into any application) that uses the same alphabet be it English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why should it be intuitive -'like you are supposed to' - just because it is a Windows 10 Mobile phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but this appears to be just another disappointing Windows 10 disconnect where the problem clearly demonstrates that Windows 10 is not the same OS (as advertised) across all platforms. (I also have Windows 10 running on a laptop and the UI is totally
 different from the Windows 10 Mobile running on my new $650 'flagship' Lumia 950 XL phone.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, keyboards should continue to follow the platform agnostic design paradigm (or whatever you want to call it) to where something as simple as a few Spanish words can be inputted via a standard QWERTY keyboard without being over ridden by software
 that repeatedly and incorrectly autocorrects (misnomer) without allowing the user clear options; an option to hold to whatever word they inputted (be it spelled wrong, different language, or whatever) or two, provide on-the-fly change of the input language
 option via a linked menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a separate Spanish language keyboard - if that is in fact the solution to this texting problem - is absurd.</p>

            <p>Because I had to ask the 'Microsoft Community' for a solution to a seemingly stupid problem is indicative of just how busted technical support and how poorly written support documentation is.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - I am an engineer (EE) and spent 10 years w/ Intel during my career: so I am not a technologically deprived idiot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - So why is technology becoming increasingly more difficult to use?&nbsp; I bought a Windows phone because I believed the promises Microsoft made concerning making Win 10 the same across all platforms. Where has the management features gone (aka Control Panel)
 and the full featured Command Prompt?</p>
<p>

<p>After changing the language, if you prefer another&nbsp;(bottom left), select the specific device. That's the manual on the web + a link to a device-independent Windows 10 Mobile manual in PDF format, which I suggest read before further comments on the quality
 of the written support documentation?</p>
<p>The specific issue is in the PDF and the en-us snippet on the web <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/product/lumia950-xl-dual-sim/smartguidance/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=B-GUID-4D821540-768E-4C6C-9C2C-9AD4107D1CF2-10_0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Management of Windows phones requires a mobile device management setup, usually in a corporate environment. That's a different manual, starting at e.g.:<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users like us are not allowed to tweak the settings in Windows phones, and we certainly don't have access to the operating system in a command shell.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description I suggest browse to TechNet at<br />

</p><p>A) If you (short) tap on a keyboard, you can disable ‘Suggest text’. That way, you need only one keyboard for both English and Spanish. If you long tap, you get an context menu to delete a keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) However, if you like the text suggestions, you have to enable both keyboards. With several keyboards while writing (having the keyboard open), the space bar shows your currently selected language. If you swipe on the space bar, you change the language.
 Or you long tap on the button 123, you are able to change the language as well (or adjust something on the fly).</p>

<p>Where has the management features gone (aka Control Panel)?</p>

<p>Windows 10 for computers has both interfaces, currently. The Windows XP styled one via Control Panel and the new Windows 10 Mobile styled one as overlay. However, when it comes keyboards and languages, the settings on a computer are more powerful than those
 on a mobile phone. Why ever. That interface was not ported to the new style, yet. Why ever.</p>

<h2>            data analysis toolpak crashes excel 2010</h2>
                    I am running Windows XP and Office 2010. After the last Microsoft update the 'data analysis toolpak' started crashing Excel every time I clicked on it. &nbsp;The 'data analysis toolpak' does not even open. &nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled the 'data analysis
 toolpak' dozens of times, restarting the computer every time. This did not fix the problem. &nbsp;I have installed all Microsoft updates, including those for Office. &nbsp;This did not fix the problem. &nbsp;I have gone into 'Add and Remove Programs -&gt; Microsoft Office 2010
 Professional Plus -&gt; Change -&gt; Repair.' This did not fix the problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;Unfortunately that solution did not work. &nbsp;Had to call Microsoft and they were actually quite helpful. &nbsp;In case anyone else has this problem here is what had to be done.
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft rep essentially did a reinstall of just Excel. This involved deleting some registry files so be careful in attempting on your own. &nbsp;Problem might have been caused by some corrupted files or perhaps the last Microsoft update did not install properly.
 Anyway, this reinstall fixed the issue. &nbsp;</div>

            <p>Presume you uninstalled your prior AV program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suggestions of Dr. Strangelove in this thread are a bit dated but are basically still applicable to this issue:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/mse-slow-startup-and-slow-pc-performance/4b168432-12a6-4e82-b9d8-c2e403698bf0">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/mse-slow-startup-and-slow-pc-performance/4b168432-12a6-4e82-b9d8-c2e403698bf0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check Startup menu...see if you have items in there you can uncheck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All AV programs interfere to some extent with startup...I've recently seen the same issue with Avast, Avira and MSE.&nbsp; And there are many variables -&nbsp;I have an "old" XP laptop on which I cannot use MSE due to performance issues...it runs best with Avast.&nbsp;
 Yet the "old" &nbsp;XP computer I'm using right now runs great with MSE although it's slow loading due to resource issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you run a full manual scan?&nbsp; Sometimes once that has been done the startup for MSE seems to "settle down" a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of computer are you using?&nbsp; What operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) It is very slow.</p>
<p>2) Always asks me for my email address and password everything I try to open it, even after only leaving it for a few seconds.</p>
<p>3) frequently chucks me out and closes down. &nbsp;Can be in middle of writing new email, replying or trying to read incoming mail.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can take me three or four attempts to send a one line reply.</p>
<p>any help, gratefully received,</p>

<br />
Latency can be caused by a few things. For us to better understand what’s causing the issue, we would like to know, do you use a web browser to access your Hotmail email or an email application (Office Outlook, Windows Mail etc.)?<br />
<br />
We look forward to your response regarding this matter.

            <div>VoIP Switch is a software platform that serves different purposes and can be used in various applications. With the use of this application the enterprises can stay connected with the remote branches and share their conversation at a cheaper call rate.
 The internet telephony providers can also take it as a base system and can offer VoIP services to end-users. It is a very simple and user-friendly system through which you can make calls anytime and anywhere at a local call rates. It also allows minimizing
 the initial investment. It is also the most preferred choice for the start ups in this rapidly growing VoIP world.</div>

                    I am trying to switch mobile service suppliers. I was given an Unblocking Code but when I enter it under " Enter Restriction Code" it says it is invalid. Do I need a different code from Nokia and if so how do I get it? Thanks. John

            the code can only come from the network operator to whom the phone was locked to.

            Thanks but I got the unblock code from the network operator but the phone is asking me for a "Restriction Code" which I am told has to come from the manufacturer ( ie Nokia / Microsoft). The local customer service contact info is most unhelpful ( all voice
 recordings referring you to the website). Any other ideas please?? John

<p>
</p><p>That is only partially true. The code does come from the manufacturer, but only the operator can request them and provide them to their customers.</p>
