<h2>            I want to freeze cells in the excel webapp just as the desktop application allows.  Is that possible&#63;</h2>
                    I have a windows live account (hotmail) and office live.&nbsp; I want to create an excel document that will allow me to freeze cells.&nbsp; Will the Webapps version allow me to do this the same as the desktop version?

<p>Hello ZawMyint1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to our forum. In general, there’s no need to back up user mailbox data, you just need to switch licenses for users in admin portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s two ways to switch subscription:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Use switch plan button:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/switch-to-a-different-plan?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Switch to a different Office 365 for business plan</a>. Admin can use this button to switch to a plan that has the same data-related services, or to a higher version, so to ensure that users don't lose data related to those services during the switch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Manually switch (if the switch button isn’t available):
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/misc/switch-plans-manually?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Switch Office 365 for business plans manually</a>, in this way, admin need to purchase the targeted subscription to current tenant, then in admin portal to manually switch user license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Anna, </p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, let me ask more question. If I also migrate the vendor US to Asia/Pacific Region, which process also do I need? I mean existing O365 licenses were purchased from Godaddy and I want to purchase from Asia Distributor for renewal because
 time different in support and some issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hello Zaw Myint,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you purchased from Godaddy, to better help you, you may need to contact Godaddy support for further information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, if you can purchase in current tenant, there’s no additional step required, as all users are still in the same tenant, just switching license is OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you are going to purchase from Asia Distribution for a new tenant, you need to perform cross tenant migration. Configure the new tenant, after done, migrate data from source tenant to target tenant:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-mailboxes-across-tenants?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fHow-to-migrate-mailboxes-from-one-Office-365-tenant-to-another-65af7d77-3e79-44d4-9173-04fd991358b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Meeting invitations auto-deleted</h2>
                    <p>Any meeting I create that includes the person for whom I am a delegate and any that I create that include me are being auto-deleted.&nbsp; The person for whom I am the delegate is not receiving his invitations in his inbox, either.&nbsp; I don't know if that's because
 my copy of his invitation is being auto-deleted at my end.&nbsp; I do know that when the delegate deletes her copy of the other's, e.g., the boss' invitation, that may remove the meeting from the other's calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already checked these options,&nbsp;and they are correctly set to leave invitations in the inbox:&nbsp;<span>Check if Auto Decline is set to your Outlook client. You can check this on (File &gt; Options &gt; Calendar &gt; under Automatic
 accept or decline &gt; Click Auto Accept/Decline &gt; Uncheck all boxes). Also uncheck this checkbox on (File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; under Send messages &gt; uncheck “Delete meeting request and notification from Inbox after responding).</span></p>
<p>Oddly enough, each meeting I've checked so far has ended up on my boss' calendar, but he, like me, receives no invitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forgive me for not being conversant with all of the terms.&nbsp; I am using the<span>&nbsp;desktop version of Outlook, Microsoft Office 10 Pro, but we have Office 365, and my account information says it's "Microsoft Exchange."&nbsp; My
 "About Outlook" window says it's "Outlook for Office 365 MSO 32 bit."&nbsp; Elsewhere, product info says it's a "Subscription Product."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't know if the account is POP or IMAP.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can't recall any changes I made prior to this starting.&nbsp; I try not to touch settings unless I have a problem.&nbsp; I only found out about the settings I referenced when I found the invites were being deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is a more complete version of my question that I drafted later:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>How to stop the auto-deletion of meeting invites?&nbsp; The delegate invites I receive for my boss and any invites directed to me as an attendee are being auto-deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I’ve found online suggests I should confirm that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) File &gt; Options &gt; Calendar &gt; Automatic accept or decline is unchecked</p>
<p>(b) File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; “Delete meeting request and notification from Inbox after responding” is unchecked</p>
<p>(c) File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; Tracking &gt; " Automatically process meeting requests and responses to meeting requests and polls" is unchecked</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve confirmed all settings (were and) are correct, and the invites continue to be auto-deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found, for OWA, that I should uncheck "automatically place new meeting requests on my calendar, marked tentative."&nbsp; I wanted to check this to confirm it's unchecked, even though it doesn't include a suggestion for auto-deletion of the invite,
 but I can't find this option in OWA's calendar settings.&nbsp; And I don't use OWA; I use Outlook desktop but thought I should check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, the meetings are being placed on my and my boss' calendars as tentative, but my delegate invites are auto-deleted.&nbsp; He is not receiving his copy of the invitations, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open to any suggestions.&nbsp; Head exploding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much, Jomel.</p>

            The issue actually is continuing.&nbsp; I just told my boss to delete me as a delegate.&nbsp; Since I no longer receive the delegate invitations, my boss' invitations are no longer being deleted.&nbsp; I told my&nbsp;boss that he could uncheck the box "delegate receives a
 copy of invitations," but that didn't allay my boss' fear.&nbsp; I can no longer add events to his calendar, though, which does not work well.

            It should be pretty straightforward - I've got to dash, so sorry if this seems hurried: -<br />
<br />
1) On you PC, make sure your wireless network can recieve connections from new devices. Make a note of the encryption type and password, if any.<br />
<br />
2) Go to menu &gt; tools &gt; settings &gt; access points and do a scan for wireless networks.<br />
<br />
3) Once found, you can test it works by connecting directly to it - use the password you saved from earlier.<br />
<br />
4) If all works well, yu can create a new access point and configure it. You shouldn't need to touch advanced settings. It should see what type of network you on and ask you for the password...<br />
<br />
Then when you connect to the net, you can use the access point you setup earlier.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!

<p>Hi Guido,</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to import contact list to Skype for Business directly.<br />
You need to add Skype or Skype for Business users one (distribution group from GAL) by one.</p>

            Hi  jabez_seib, the settings will depend on the final size you want your book to be, it is best to set all this up before you begin to type . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft has a full walk-through on how to set up a book in Word:

<p>As with most questions asked of lawyers, the answer is "It depends."</p>
<p>A big question is how much you already know about Word.</p>
<p>I recommend that everyone start here: <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/BasicConceptsWord.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Basic Concepts of Microsoft Word - from Shauna Kelly</a> </p>
<p>A book is a big project and Word can make it a lot easier to write one. On the other hand, if you treat Word like a typewriter, it is going to really mess with you. Spend some time learning to use it well and you will save time and angst as your project
 goes on.</p>

    <title>using pen to write a document in Word on Surface Pro 4 - can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane ide  say:</h3>
<h2>            using pen to write a document in Word on Surface Pro 4 - can&#39;t start a new page in the right place&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently got my first Surface Pro, and want to use the pen to handwrite notes from meetings and conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I use the pen in to write in Word, I can't move to a new page when I get to the bottom of the first one; it doesn't move automatically as it would with typewritten text, and if I 'insert page' it always puts it at the front rather than at the end
 of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my pages of handwritten notes go in reverse order!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I misunderstanding the Pro's capabilities here? &nbsp;Is there a way to resolve this? &nbsp;Or should I use something other than Word to take these notes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any useful tips.</p>

<p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the keyboard or you just&nbsp;writing with your pen when you taking notes in Word?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To start or insert a new blank page at the bottom of your contents, you need to make sure the cursor is behind your contents. Also, you can use Enter key of the touch keyboard in your Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, as per my understanding, OneNote 2016 is&nbsp;smoother than Word 2016 when taking notes and your meeting details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
William</p>

            The ringtones supplied with Nokia phones are always copy-protected and they are often not available elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The best thing to try is to look for web sites from where you can downlod ringtones and search for something similar to the ones you had in the 6230i.<br />
<br />
Sorry I wasn't a huge help there, it is a common complaint that people liked a tone on one phone and miss it when they upgrade to a new phone.

    <title>How exactly does adding new Skype contacts work these days&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zakhh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How exactly does adding new Skype contacts work these days&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I hardly use Skype anymore other than for making calls to phone numbers. Most of my former Skype contacts appear to have left Skype after Microsoft decided to force their delightful new version on us.<br />
</p>
<p>But today, one of my few remaining Skype contacts sent me a message on Whatsapp (!): "I have a new Skype account and tried to add you as a contact. Did you receive a notification? And did you receive my messages?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer on both questions was a firm 'nope'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He tried again, and we made sure he was using my correct Skype account. He was. Still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then added his new account as a contact in my Skype. Again, no notification on either end, but now his messages reach me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I understand it correctly that adding a new Skype contact these days works like this:</p>
<p>- Person A adds Person B to their contacts.</p>
<p>- Nothing happens after that. No notifications are being sent, and A and B cannot communicate via Skype.</p>
<p>- A needs to send B a message via another messenger service and ask B to add A to B's contacts as well.</p>
<p>- B adds A to their contacts.</p>
<p>- Again, nothing happens, no notifications are being sent. But now A and B are connected and can communicate via Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what I experienced today, this seems to be how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, you know... that would be a pretty stupid concept. To put it very, very mildly.</p>

            Hi ZakHH
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />When you add a contact, they will first have to accept your invitation before they can start chatting with you or start a voice or video call.
<br />
<br />If they don't see your invitation, tell them to sign into Skype for Web then try accepting the invitation there. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />Steps for adding a contact.
<br />
<br />Here is the process of accepting the invite.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fae0f4d6-08bf-4675-abd0-302f7057098b?upload=true" />

<p>Thanks Andre. If that is how it is supposed to work, then it didn't work out in this case. I didn't get any notification, neither in Skype for Desktop nor on Android., when the other guy added me as a contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only when I also added him as a contact to my Skype, we got connected. Again, without any notification on either end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be because he's using Skype for Business, and I use "normal" Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Skype for Web: I can't use that anymore, as I have only Firefox and Opera installed, and Skype for Web rejects both browsers.</p>

            Skype for Business works a little bit differently and recently there have been some issues requiring Skype contacts accepting invitations through Skype for Web.
<br />
<br />That was likely the reason why you weren't able to accept them, since Skype for Business contacts are not in the Skype directory.

<h2>            My Documents made in Word for Mac 97-2004 are messed up with Word for Mac 14.3.6...HELP</h2>
                    <b>TWO PROBLEMS</b>....
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Ordinary (words only, no special formatting) documents that fit on one page in Word for Mac 97-2004 are opening in Word for Mac 14.3.6 requiring 2 pages to print. Each one will require manual changes unless there is a software fix. Is there a patch
 to fix this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. Documents made in Word for Mac 97-2004 with extensive formatting are opening in Word for Mac 14.3.6 with all but the check-off-boxes missing. The document "information"/words are all missing. Why? Is there a fix...a patch?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If these issues are addressed elsewear, please direct me to the correct place. I can't find an answer anywhere. I use these documents every day in my work and it would be a MASSIVE UNDERTAKING to have to recreate them. Thanks in advance.</div>

            Hi Marcia:
<div><br />
<div>There are no patches (you have the latest) but there are some things you can try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are two competing issues at play here:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) &nbsp;Word 2011 displays documents differently to Word 2004. &nbsp;The difference is small, but it is intentional, it's the way it is supposed to work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) &nbsp;If a document is formatted correctly in Word 2004, you can open or print it in Word 2007/2008/2010/2011/2013 and I would defy you to pick the difference (usually, I can't either...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately the corollary of that is that there are ways of building a document that will cause it to collapse like a house of cards. &nbsp;Essentially, a Word document is not a sheet of paper. &nbsp;When it starts, it is not "blank", it is "empty". &nbsp;As you add
 content, Word stacks that content up from the top left of the document: if you will, each piece of content is "pushed down" by the content above it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A document that uses styles and paragraph properties to provide flow control will happily open anywhere and print without change. &nbsp;Sadly, as you say, it's too late to change it easily now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are two main problems:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) &nbsp;Some of the fonts have changed size</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;Word has a new rendering engine that is drawing the text a different size.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first thing we should do is make sure you are actually using the modern versions of the fonts, that are designed to avoid this problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try this:</div>
<div><a href="http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/Mac/fontweeding.html</a><br />
<div><br />
<div>With luck, that will make sure that you are using the latest versions of each font and you do not have any faulty fonts in there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's likely to solve your second problem. &nbsp;Those symptoms are characteristic of a corrupted font.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first problem is a little tougher to solve. &nbsp;There's a variety of things you could do: two of the simplest are a) &nbsp;Changing to Calibri (or Cambria) as the font; or b) By tweaking the document margins or compatibility options slightly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I suggest is that you try the Font Weeding first. &nbsp;That may bring those documents right.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then report back here and we can suggest the next steps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>
        </p>

            John is correct that new versions of fonts ship with new versions of Office. For example, the Arial font hs undergone several revisions over the years. With each revision, the amount of space used by each character varies by tiny amounts, which can add
 up enough to cause the text to spill into a new page.
<div><br />
<div>John pointed you to the Font Weeding article and suggests that you choose to activate the newer versions of your fonts. However, since your documents were made with older versions of your fonts, you might wish to use the older versions, instead.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you choose to use the newer versions of your fonts, the cure is to select all the text in a document that doesn't page the way you want, choose the new version of the font and then re-size the fonts so they fit again.</div>

            Ordinarily, I find that text in Windows versions of Word documents takes up more space than on the Mac. Thus, if a page fits on the Mac, it will surely fit in Windows, but you are experiencing the exact opposite problem. So, in addition to John's and Jim's
 comments, some aspects of Problem #1 could perhaps be fixed as follows:
<div>
<ol>
<li>In the main menu bar, select <i>Word &gt; Preferences</i></li><li>Click con <i>Compatibility</i></li><li>In the "Recommended options for" dropdown menu, selecte either <i>Microsoft Word 2007</i>&nbsp;or
<i>Microsoft Word 2000-2004 and X.</i></li><li><i>OK</i> your way back to the document and check how it looks.</li></ol>
<div>Note that the above works on a per-document basis, so you'd need to repeat that with every document you open.</div>

            John,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. I tried font weeding ... it did not change anything. The problematic form still comes up with all data/words missing and only boxes sprinkled about.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also tried a suggestion by Daniel G to alter/adjust the Compatability under Word &gt; Preferences. That did not work for either the simple spacing issue or the more complicated heavily formatted issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>NEW INFORMATION: Additionally, the following baffles me even more. When I am working with the heavily formatted document, it will NOT open properly on my iMac 17 inch Late 2006 1.83 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 2GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5
 and Microsoft Word for Mac 14.3.6. BUT the same document WILL open on my MacBook Pro 15 inch Late 2008 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3 running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 and Microsoft Word for Mac 14.3.6 (i.e. same software but different machines.) Have
 you heard of this and have any idea why that might be?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions will be appreciated.</div>

<div>Thanks for the suggestion. In that case, I am just going to eliminate empty spaces and adjust margins to get the simple document-on-two-pages to fix.</div>

            It's very likely that it's a font problem. Have you verified the font files with FontBook, as opposed to just eliminating duplicates? If FontBook does not diagnose any corrupt font file, try copying over your fonts from the other computer (do this with
 the fonts that are actually in use by the document). There are three folder locations where fonts are stored, though.

            Hello Daniel and all other reading this thread....
<div><br />
<div>I have had no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I located the two font folders on my MacBook Pro (the computer that the forms open on)</div>
<div>/Library/Fonts/Microsoft</div>
<div>/Users/&lt;my name&gt;/Library/Fonts</div>
<div>and copied each to a thumb drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then went to the iMac, being sure Microsoft Word was closed, located the two font folders.....</div>
<div>I dragged to the trash the iMac /Library/Fonts/Microsoft folder, emptied the trash, and replaced it with the /Library/Fonts/Microsoft folder from my MacBook Pro. I then restarted the iMac. I tried to open a document....NO CHANGE...not readable....no words.</div>
<div>I the repeated the same for the /User/&lt;my name&gt;/Library/Fonts folder (drag to trash, trash, install from thumb MacBook Pro copy, restart computer) .... NO CHANGE...not readable....no words.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then downloaded from support.mi9crosoft.com/kb/2398768 instructions on how to completely remove Office for Mac 2011. I followed all instructions, then restarted the computer. I then re-installed from the original CD a new install of Microsoft Office
 for Mac 2011. NO CHANGE...no words on the pages of the form I need to open.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded a copy of Font Management in OS X by Kurt Lang, last updated October 15, 2012 (includes Mt Lion). IT IS DAUNTING...I am afraid to do all the things he is suggesting, not knowing if they will really make a difference. WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lastly, I do own Microsoft Office for Mac 2008. Do you think there is any reason I should try it?....I know I would have to remove 2011 before installing, but I am becoming desperate. ANY AND ALL suggestions will be attempted and appreciated.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Expressions like A2:A1000=F5 return an array of logic values, TRUE and FALSE.&nbsp; Normally, SUMPRODUCT treats all logic values as zero.&nbsp; The double negation converts the expression to an array of numbers, 1 for TRUE and 0 for FALSE.</p>
<p>But any idempotent arithmetic operation has the same effect.&nbsp; So you could avoid the double negation in your formula by writing:</p>
<p>=INDEX(B2:B1000,SUMPRODUCT(ROW(1:999)*(A2:A1000=F5)*(C2:C1000=SUMPRODUCT(MAX((A2:A1000=F2)*C2:C1000)))))</p>
<p>The double negation before ROW(1:999) was unnecessary in any case because ROW(1:999) returns an array of numbers.</p>

    <title>Odd Word problem. Seeming random replacement of characters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drdjm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd Word problem. Seeming random replacement of characters</h2>
                    I just got a new Win 7 64bit system and have had a legal version of Office installed. &nbsp;I was just working on a document when I pressed the double quote key (Shift + ' ) and instead, nothing showed up. &nbsp;If I hit the same key combination again, I got two
 apostrophes. &nbsp;that is, the same characters as a double quotation mark, but two separate characters, which i could delete individually. &nbsp;I reiterate: this happens only after I hit the shift+' key twice. &nbsp;If I hit it only once, I get nothing. &nbsp;It reminds me
 of the process of hitting CTRL and an accent then CTRL and a letter, to get an accented letter.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have made sure my keyboard setting is to US English. &nbsp;I have made sure my language setting in Office is also to US English (this despite being in Canada). &nbsp;What seems to fix it is restarting the program. &nbsp;BTW, it does not appear to be a paragraph or
 text format issue, because I switched to another document I had open, which was using a basic courier font and a simple formatting (for copy editing documents for publication) and it also did the same single quote thing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For now, the restarting seems to fix it for a bit. &nbsp;But now I've noticed another problem. &nbsp;I hit shift+/ to get a question mark, and get the capital E with an accent grave (the accent that slants from the top right to bottom left). &nbsp;This is normally what
 happens with a French language keyboard, but my keyboard and language settings were all on English.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is a very strange situation, and a little off putting. &nbsp;I write for a living and have a lot of work to do, and can't really be closing and reopening my documents all the time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help!</div>

            Keyboards can be controlled in Office and in Windows. Which one did you check?<br />
<br />
Did you check the Windows one:&nbsp; (vista) Control Panel / Regioinal and language Options / Keyboards and Languages tab / Change Keyboards... button / Advanced Key Settings tab.&nbsp; Do you have more input language defined, maybe French Canadian, with a shortcut key
 sequence defined for it.&nbsp; I found that to be a real PITA, switching keyboards when I accidentally hit the key sequence.<br />

            Thanks.
<div>It may have been a random keyboard change, but I have tried then to select the correct keyboard, but it made no difference. &nbsp;I suspect the accented E may have been that because i deleted the French keyboard profile, but the strange quotation mark thing
 seemed to defy the standard fixes.</div>

    <title>Windows Live Messenger on Nokia 6220 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timbarrass---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Messenger on Nokia 6220</h2>
                    Hey all -- probably a naive question but is it possible to install Windows Live Messenger on a Nokia 6220? If I follow the links through My3 to install, I just get rebuffed with a "Certificate error".<br />
<br />
(On top of that, the 6220 is not on the supported list, even though the sign-up pages suggested I could run it, and skype, on it... am hoping that it's just out of sync with releases).<br />
<br />
Any advice? Anyone managed to do it?

            I'd really like to know the answer to this as well as I just got a 6220 classic. It says that messenger is compatible with the 6120 so I don't see why it couldn't work on a 6220 but I'm not sure about this stuff. If not is there some kind of messenger
 equivilant that is good?

            hi,<br />
<br />
i believe we are talking about 6220 Classic right?<br />
<br />
have you checked "Download"? have you tried to update "Download" as well, if it is not showing there?<br />
<br />
the other things is if your 6220 is network locked, you might have some restrictions on the apps availability and usage, try to ask your service provider...<br />
<br />
if certificate error is shown, try to check the "Application Manager" and see Settings and make sure "Software installation is set to ALL, and Online certificate is also "OFF"<br />

    <title>Word Online Reading View some hyperlinks not clickable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve herman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Online Reading View some hyperlinks not clickable</h2>
                    
<p>This problem is bizarre, but I could use some help. &nbsp;I have a 140 page word document. &nbsp;I edit it in word 2016, it's saved in an office365 sharepoint team site document library. &nbsp;The problem happens when i'm looking at the document in the browser in reading
 view. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many hyperlinks in this document. &nbsp;On pages 88-98, none of the hyperlinks work when in reading view in word online. &nbsp;By not work, i mean that when you hover the cursor over the link, it stays an arrow, and doesn't change into the hand/finger that
 indicates a clickable link, and if you click anyway nothing happens. Word 2016 recognizes them as links and a ctrl-click allows me to follow it. &nbsp;Edit mode in Word Online allows me to click to follow the link. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I put a hyperlink at the last character of page 87. &nbsp;That link works in reading view. &nbsp;i have a soft return (shift-enter) for the next paragraph and that just so happens to start on the next page (so no forced page or section break). &nbsp;I have the first characters
 on page 88 hyperlinked and that link does not work. &nbsp;If i do NOTHING else, but backspace over the shift-enters so that the non-working link pops back up to page 87, that link will work in Word Online reading view. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then similarly, on page 98, the last characters are a hyperlink that do not work in word online reading view. &nbsp;If I ONLY enter a page break before those characters so the pop onto page 99. &nbsp;That hyperlink will work in reading view in word online.</p>
<p>The last test, was to create a hyperlink that spanned the text from page 87 to page 88. &nbsp;So in word 2016, i highlighted the last characters on page 87, and kept dragging the highlight to the first characters on page 89. &nbsp;Made the whole thing a hyperlink.
 &nbsp;The link part on page 87 worked fine, the link part on page 88 did not link in word online reading view. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea what could be causing this, and i'm hoping someone here can help me figure it out.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
Steve</p>

<p>OK, update. &nbsp;I copied and pasted the 10 "bad" pages into a new word document, saved it in the same location, and it exhibits the same problem with the links. &nbsp;I cut out a bunch of stuff, and left a bunch of links on a single page. &nbsp;None of these links work
 in Word Online Reading View. &nbsp;Can anyone tell me why these links are perfectly fine in Word 2016, but not fine in Word Online Reading View? Here's a link to the reading view of this new document</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion on posting on the word forum. &nbsp;I have however fixed the problem with a solution just a weird as the problem. &nbsp;If I highlight an entire page that has this problem, (not just certain text or link, the ENTIRE page) and change the
 font color, then save, the links all start working in word online reading view. &nbsp;Then when i set the font color back to what it should be, they continue to work as they should. &nbsp;I'm going to leave it at that. &nbsp;Thanks for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello</h2>
                    <p>Before I installed Office265, Windows Hello was working. When I had the Office installed and I tried to sign in with my Microsoft account and use the facial recognition software I was informed that I was already signed in elsewhere and I have to sign out
 of 'there' and sign in here. I don't have Windows Hello on any other device. My thoughts are that when Office was installed the old Windows Hello sign in was not de-activated and is still 'there'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way this can be resolved?</p>

 all I have to do is go to the album under music. I have 653 albums thus now that many extra playlist, I have clicked on some to delete but they are created as fast as I delete them. I have looked and there is no way to shut off or remove auto playlist. How
 to stop this insanity that started today, as yesturday it was all fine?

<p>Hi - well this would be incredibly annoying... but I cannot find any previous references.</p>
<p>I've just googled it for good measure and that did not throw up anything similar. It's certainly not expected behaviour.
</p>
<p>Do you have any playlists you have made yourself and do you use star ratings or play count features? Also is this Windows 7 8 or 10? I'll wait for your reply and do a little more web research in the meantime... Thanks R.</p>

            Windows 10, star rating is on and I do have play list I have made. Also when I delete an album from the auto playlist then it recreates it also sometimes it puts it in the other play list&nbsp; heading that I create as well. Plus to mention it again I have
 not made any changes in settings or option in years this phenomenon started today all on it's own. Is it a bug from an update or a virus?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I was wondering about Virus/Malware - or it <em>could</em> be a software conflict. I doubt an update on its own would be responsible or reports would be flooding in! I'll keep looking (may not have a chance to get back again this evening though...)</p>
<p>I asked about star ratings etc. because some of the checks needed <em>may</em> affect those. Losing them would be the lesser of two evils presumably. If you think of anything update and I'll get back asap... Cheers, R.</p>

            Thanks. I've not added any new software in a few weeks other than updates. Too bad there is no way to turn off that feature auto playlist. If I want a playlist I make them up the way I want.&nbsp;

<p>It shouldn't really turn on in the first place (well - certainly not unless you ask it to!) I have used it - mainly for double&nbsp;CD sets&nbsp;because they have to go into the library in WMP as two albums (disc 1 and 2) which I find annoying - iTunes&nbsp;recognizes
 them as<strong> one</strong> album with Disc 1 &amp; 2 as sub-headings.</p>
<p>Never seen (or heard of) it doing what you're suffering though... Until tomorrow!</p>

<p>Hi again - had a further google around using various key words - the nearest I have come to finding a possible hidden cause is a keyboard problem ( a 'sticky' media related shortcut key causing unexpected behaviour) - there does not seem to be much likelihood
 that a virus is involved, and you would know if you had watched or downloaded media from any unusual locations.</p>
<p>I think if you are not too worried about star ratings etc. it would be a good idea for starters to try uninstalling and reinstalling WMP - &nbsp;go to
<strong>control panel - programs</strong> - <strong>turn Windows Features On/Off</strong> - when the box has populated scroll down to
<strong>Media Features</strong> - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">expand and uncheck WMP
</span>-&nbsp;click<strong> OK </strong>(accept the warning) and then <strong>restart the pc</strong>... Reverse the procedure -
        </p>

            Thanks for your time but to loose my star ratings and my playlists less of an issue I will have to live with this irritant. It would be nice if the auto playlist had a option to turn it off would be work around.

            One test you could try without altering anything is opening a new User Account from Control Panel... load a few items into WMP&nbsp; there and see if the same behaviour is exhibited... if so&nbsp;you know it is a system or hardware problem rather than UA corruption.
 - Cheers, Ric.

            Thanks for time on the issue but looking myself I have decided to start fresh with MusicBee for now to see if it will be an alternative. It at first glance looks promising but time will tell. Again thanks for your help.&nbsp;

            Strangely I've just this minute mentioned MusicBee in another post... yes let me know how you get on with that - I know it to be a well-liked alternative... R.
