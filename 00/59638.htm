<h2>            Change Windows app language WITHOUT affecting default language</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 app language problem is so painful. What I want to do are:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Set Windows 10 default language in Korean--for typing</li><li>Set Windows 10 display language (override) in English</li><li>Use Apps (Mail, Calendar, etc.) in English</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So far, what I learned from this forum is that I have to change the default language to English to use Apps in English. However, I do need to keep the default language in Korean. Display language in English did not make Apps shown in English.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it mean that the Apps are not able to set language within the individual apps?</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response! I am sorry, I should have made my question clearer--so I understand that the operating system language does not affect regular apps I installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the apps which were pre-installed on Windows 10, including Mail, Calendar, Message, Calculator, Weather, Picture, Store, Alarm and Clock and many more, are apparently changing its language according to the operating system language. Is there a way to
 control the language for those pre-installed apps without having to change the Windows default language? I would appreciate your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Nari</p>

<p>I've been without Internet for a good while. And I've played games offline. But my games started to tell me I need an Internet connection? So if I still have not connected to the Internet, but it knows I have to update. Even so why can I not skip the update
 and still play?</p>

<p>An Xbox One console can be used offline provided it is put into offline mode as described here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/using-xbox-one-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../using-xbox-one-offline</a></p>
<p>I hope you understand though that some games require an online connection such as MMORPG's like The Elder Scrolls Online and that's consistent across all platforms including PC. Not all games require this though, It's on a case by case basis and up to the
 developers. Check the game packaging for more information on if an online connection is required to play.</p>
<p>That said, you can also use many game discs offline without updating though. In fact, it's actually a troubleshooting step to install games to the console offline if someone is having an issue installing the update during the game install.</p>

<br />
When I connect my digital camera to PC, Windows uses a driver that was already installed previously when I connected camera to the PC first time. Recently I just connected camera to PC, but did not turned on camera first. When I turned on the camera, the Windows
 started installation of drivers, as if it was the first connection of a new device.<br />
Not clear, does Windows installed driver over old driver(twice), or it installed same driver under new name?
<br />
How to find this duplicated driver and remove it?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When I plug my camera to PC with usb cable, 'USB mass storage device' appears in Universal Serial Bus controllers list in Device Manager. I assume it's a Microsoft's generic USB driver? Driver is not present in Program and Features list.
<br />
<br />
It's not clear, why window show usual "Installing New Device" pops up every time I plug my camera to PC. If windows not install driver each time I plug camera, why?<br />

<h2>            Yet more evidence the Microsoft screwed up royally</h2>
                    <p>Just so people know.&nbsp; Microsoft released some new system update.&nbsp; The last time I shut down my laptop it wanted to install this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, when the system rebooted the whole dammed system was screwed up.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>All my custom settings, like the applications that I had pinned to the task bar were gone,&nbsp;
</li><li>My start menu was reset so that applications and groups that I had organized on the start menu were gone,
</li><li>The desktop was reset from the solid color that I had chosen to some Microsoft Windows image that I had gotten rid of.</li><li>My google chrome&nbsp; did not recognize me when I opened that application. I had to re login to Chrome before I could do anything.</li><li>Microsoft had reset my default browser to Edge when I had, had it set to Chrome.</li><li>My Outlook no longer connects to my mail server.&nbsp; The update wiped out all information from my Microsoft Office setup&nbsp;</li><li>I still use Microsoft Office 2010, which came with my laptop, but when I opened up Microsoft Word, it is as though security updates have been lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The Windows Update wiped out all my recent files from my office apps.&nbsp; They may still be on my computer, but the apps know nothing about them anymore.</li><li>I had three foreign language support packages installed for keyboard support, French, Czech, and German, in addition to my standard English.&nbsp; They are all gone now.</li></ul>
<p>What the hell did you do Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a disaster of a Windows Update.&nbsp; Microsoft has F---ed up my system royally and I am pissed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should fire whoever planned that update.</p>

            Hi Henry, from the symptoms you describe, most likely you are in a Temporary Profile 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around 
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times in a row, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see a user folder that look like yours? 
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.) 
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time 
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

<h2>            Windows 8.1 changed me to standard user. Can&#39;t Access Standard User Account settings. Password area grayed out.</h2>
                    <p>Somehow my Windows 8.1 computer changed me from administrator to a standard user. (Not a virus and not a corrupt file caused this.). As a result, I can't make any changes to my computer. When I try to it do anything it says access user&nbsp;account control by
 entering a password. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The password area is grayed out so there is no option to do anything. I can't just "change your account type" or "user account control settings" in manage user accounts/control panel, access command prompt: administrator, restore to a previous point, download
 anything, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Endless people have encountered this problem but there is inexplicably no solution given that I can find after hours and hours of reading. Does anybody know what I can do? Does anyone have an answer? I'm not reloading the operating system. That's not a solution.
 There must be some way&nbsp;to change this computer back to showing me as the administrator.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello I do have a possible solution or two, but it may not be the greatest and it will cost money, unless you already have the associated devices I am suggesting.</p><p>Possible Solution #1: If your monitor supports VGA you can use an HDMI to VGA converter that also supports 3.5mm audio like this one <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-hdmi-to-vga-converter?variant=20331213189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-hdmi-to-vga-converter?variant=20331213189</a> but the one draw back is there will be a downgrade in picture quality, but in my case in a different situation I feel the color spectrum and quality is actually better, but it could be I am just used to VGA as I use it with my computer quite a bit.</p><p>Possible Solution #2: You can use the digital optical out port on your Xbox One to connect a soundbar or compatible speaker system and bypass the monitor on the audio subject entirely, but the soundbar or speaker syste

    <title>Unable to migrate Xbox 360 account region - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dblouisdb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to migrate Xbox 360 account region</h2>
                    I am a Chinese Xbox One user and my Xbox 360 account region is China by default. Since Xbox 360 was never sold in China, there is no such 360&nbsp; region as China. As a result, I cannot buy backward compatible games or get free 360 games with my gold subscription.
 I tried to change my account region at 'live.xbox.com/accountmigration' but it keeps saying 'There’s a problem completing your move right now. Please check the Region Change Support Page to make sure it will work for you, and try again later.' I have contacted
 dozens of Microsoft Support in months and received different answers. Some said I have billing information in other region, some said Microsoft can detect the physical location of my console, some said I had to prove I was not a minor. In the end, none of
 these checked out and I still cannot migrate my account. Does anyone have an idea?

<p>I don't think the surface pen can be registered.</p>
<p>I also tried to register my new surface pen - the system did not accept the serial number.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Bought sketchable for windows 10 laptop - need refund</h2>
                    I was checking the cost of the&nbsp;Sketchable upgrade by going through the steps of purchase. Unfortunately my touchpad is a bit flakey and caused the buy button to be triggered. I wish this had been followed by a warning - but no, I was immediately charged.
 I have uninstalled the app and want a refund. What to do?

<h2>            NAT Question</h2>
                    
<p>So I spent about 3 hours getting my NAT open on my Xbox One to find out it was moderate on Call of Duty: Ghosts. Now, I don't play Ghosts a lot, so it's not much of a concern. But will future games, like Titanfall, have moderate NATs? Or will they be open?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; On the subject of the patch updates, since xmas i had achieved OPEN NAT with the XBO and GHOSTS simultaneously and consistantly for past months, never any change in settings therefore never any changwe in NAT on XBO or GHOSTS but since the 3GB update/patch
 on the 03/04/14 &nbsp;i can still get OPEN NAT on my BO but never any better than strict on GHOSTS. I started from beginning and cleared/reset router to Factory Defaults and did a power cycle of XBO. So i started ( All of this with a Static or rather reserved IP
 address through router DCHP) with just UPnP alone, I got OPEN NAT on XBONE but MODERATE &nbsp;on GHOSTS, i turned off UPnP and tried port forwarding the port numbers i had always achieved OPEN NAT with provided by Activision and BOX LIVE, so with just Port Forwarding,
 and power cycle, again OPEN NAT on XBONE , MODERATE NAT on GHOSTS !! &nbsp;Thirdly i tried both together , UPnP and Port Forwarding, which was my successful method and had given me OPEN NAT on both XBONE + GHOSTS since Nov/Dec ! Sadly I again got OPEN NAT on the
 XBONE but MODERATE NAT on GHOSTS, which i find the strangest part ! these exact settings had always given me OPEN NAT on both Console + Game, without a problem. But since that patch there is no way and i have tried them all, to get GHOSTS back to open well
 i lie, i'll explain in a mo- Activision insist its nothing to do with them but to me its too big a coincidence. All is well for over 13 weeks, thn minutes after the patch takes hold of the console tha NAT changes from OPEN to MODERATE without any other influencing
 factors. Hmmm :-/</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now so people trying to do this are informed i will tell the other stuff i tried, absolutely nothing, just plugged it in to a clean slate, power cycled, factory reset router, &nbsp;and of course STRICT XBONE and for some reason only MODERATE NAT on GHOSTS,
 even thought the XBONE was STRICT !! Im not a techie , this is all stuff picked up over the years trying to get my sons XBOX 360 NAT OPEN, i thought i should tell you that in case you think im some lind of tech expert, but i have footered and did this sort
 of thing lomg enough to have an idea what im doing and talking about !</p>
<p>I tried the last resort, which i have always been advised should be a last resort as it opens up the console to hackers, attackers and Squatters !! :-) &nbsp;I put the IP address of the XBONE in the DMZ(De-Militarised Zone) of the router, which opens EVERY PORT
 on the device you put in it, which means it defo should not bu used for pc's etc, anything with sensitive material or things people(hackers) would want ! &nbsp;Now it worked that way, i got OPEN NAT on both XBONE and GHOSTS but has left me feeling exposed, i had
 been warned that DMZ was a last resort etc and believe that was for a reason, while it was in there my UTorrent stopped working so i checked the UPnp box and Port Forwarded the Utorrent port no, it turns out doing DMZ along with other methods meesses its equilibrium
 and it doesnt function correct, so after addind the UPnP and Port Forw. i went to STRICT NAT on my BONE and STRICT NAT on GHOSTS.Needless to say i changed it. now im really wanting to just leave mi XBONES IP in the DMZ as it oipens NAT on GHOSTS and XBONE,
 with UPnP for UTORRENT which works as i tried that last !!, I made a back up of the router settings and have them in case i go back to itbe cause i really want the OPEN NAT on both GHOSTS and BONE, perhaps someone with more knowledge or tech savvie can advise
 how dangerous it actually is to use DMZ or advise why i get OPEN NAT on my XBONE but MODERATE NAT on GHOSTS (also OPEN NAT on other game and Find matches, head to head and lobbys very easily in FIFA14) &nbsp;As it stands i have reverted back to UPnP and Port Forwarding
 wshich gets me OPEN NAT on XBONE and other games but MODERATE NAT on GHOSTS, If i find a defo answer about why DMZ is safe i will use it to achieve the desired OPEN NAT on both XBONE and GHOSTS !!
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; SO..... XBOX, any news on this ?? Any contact from Inferior Ward, sorry, sorry, Infinity Ward or Activision about causes- ("It wasnt me") &nbsp;Fixes- ("We will have a look but as we dont think it was any of the software in our patch, we really cant seem
 to think of a fix in the near future, give us some time to have a look at it ok ? Thats great, Cheers ") &nbsp;Mibbe you could mention that ALL was FINE with 90% peoples NAT etc before the patch and now maybe 9% have a working OPEN NAT etc, even PC repair men,
 Reworkers, Programmers at my college and even Electrical engineers i know at IBM are havin trouble with this ! (Obviously on their off time ! )</p>

<p>Titanfall runs on MS Servers for xbox one - there are no xbo one as host so no NAT Problems will be there. All games running on MS Servers don´t have Problems with NAT.
</p>
<p>Forza5 and Titanfall runs on MS Servers.</p>
<p>I will only buy games who runs on MS Servers because of terrible connection like in Call of Duty or FIFA and so on.</p>
<p>I don´t know why they don´t use the MS Servers - it´s so much better for gaming.</p>

<p>Maybe its just some type of glitch with Ghosts and your Nat is open since the console shows as open. I would believe what the consoles says over the game. Try a full power cycle of the console and see what happens.</p>

<p>All Valid points from you all above and agree with most of em but the thing people just aint getting from me or Infinity Ward or Activision are choosin tio ignore is-</p>
<p>FOR 3 MONTH SINCE SANTA CAME, AFTER UPNP + PORT FORWARDING ON MY ROUTER I CONSISTENTLY , EVERY DAY, WITHOUT FAIL HAD OPEN NAT ON BOTH XBONE AND GOSTS !!! EVERY DAMN DAY, WITHOUT A PROB !!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then on 03/04/14 after the 3GB patch for GHOSTS from Infinity Ward or Activision, whoever! The menus improved, the challenges were all open at once and you could keep track of your weapon camo progress, also your NAT had went from OPEN to MODERATE !!!
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; YEESSSS !!!! (Sarcastically !!)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have contacted support, Twitter support, Infinity Ward Support and InfinityWard Twitter support, anyone , any support u can think of ive forum'd, phoned, emailed and even smoke signalled ! &nbsp;They all have the same great advice- Reboot your Router or
 XBO, Power Cycle your Router or XBO, Check the ports u are forwarding are correct ports !! BTW- THE PORTS I WAS FORWARDING WERE FROM THE ACTIVISION-HOW TO GET OPEN NAT page-<a href="http://community.callofduty.com/thread/200828342#.UvkeBPldV5LOr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">community.callofduty.com/.../200828342</a>
</p>
<p>Some of the support staff do they really Smart thing and refer me to someone else cos they dont have a clue !!</p>
<p>&nbsp; What is so hard trying to get them to understand im absolutely positive im doing it right, i had 3 month of OPEN NAT on ALL games, OPEN NAT on my XBONE and OPEN NAT on GHOSTS, only after the patch on 03/04 did i lose OPEN NAT, someone at XBOX must be i
 touch with them by now cos i know im not the only person, im fact im one of a very lage amount of people it happened to, as well as on the 22 feb it happened after &nbsp;a patch in EU to Italy, Spain, France etc and they all lost OPEN NAT and went to MODERATE NAT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As asked, has XBOX been in touch trying to get this sorted, could you imagine this stupid fkin patch did something to balls up TITANFALL's release ? &nbsp;Then i dare say all would be done to get it sorted but us mugs have already bought GHOSTS and quite a lot
 of the micro purchases so no need to push the boat out trying to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm so *** off at the fact Activision or Infinity Ward insist their patch didnt cause this when for me and so many others it was the onkly change to our set up !! No Router Settings Changed, No XBONE Console settings Changed, just the 3GB patch and that
 was it, MODERATE NAT !! But STill They Say " wasnt us !! i Have tried everything to get GHOSTS Open again, UPnpP itself, PORT FORWARDING itself, UPnP +PORT FORWARDING Together, All of which bring a combination of OPEN NAT on XBONE /MODERATE or STRICT on GHOSTS,
 MODERATE on XBONE and MODERATEW or STRICT ON GHOSTS, OPEN NAT on XBONE STREICT on GHOSTS, or i tried resetting the router and doing absolutely nothing, for that i got STRICT MODERATE on XBONE and STRICT MODERATE on GHOSTS, ater all those months of OPEN NAT
 on both XBONE and GHOSTS !! Tell me again how it wasnt your patch Infinity Ward ????? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get back to me XBOX, IW, ACTIVISION, other Gamers, Anyone when you know whats wrong ior have a fix !! &nbsp; BB

<p>The latest patch for COD Ghosts seems to have broken the NAT somehow.</p>
<p>Before the update you could get an open NAT by forwarding port 3075.</p>
<p>But now it's impossible.</p>
<p>I'm seriously fed up with the xbox ones network issues.</p>
<p>First of all there is the fact that the xbox ones UPnP support is broken. It's not fully compatible with most brands of router.</p>
<p>And it also alienates a large portion of the UK population by not being compatible with the BT Homehubs 4's and 5's</p>
<p>And to make matter worse the last update for GHosts has made it impossible to get an open NAT in that game.</p>
<p>Either the patch changed what port is required for the game or the game is just broken.</p>

<p>Just been experimenting and forwarded port 3076 and now the NAT in Ghosts is open.</p>
<p>So anyone with a moderate NAT in ghosts try forwarding port 3076 as well as port 3075 to see if the NAT opens.</p>
<p>It seems that the last patch for Ghosts might has changed the required port to 3076</p>

<p>@Malacath: This is not an Issue with xbox one. It´s an Issue withe the game Call of Duty. If they would treat Customers like Customers they would run the game sessions on MS Servers, On MS Servers (with xbox one) there are NO NAT Issues. Games like Forza
 and Titanfall run on MS Servers. The game experience is much better than all those p2p connection who have to deal with NAT - Firewall and so on.</p>
<p>Games like Call of Duty who sells so much - it´s a shame that there are no Servers even if Microsoft has Servers to use.</p>
<p>In my opinion MS is going the right way with MS Servers and Cloud computing. The companies who only wants your Money like Activision and Infinity Ward are to blame - they DON`T want to have that YOU (customer) get a good online experience. This is why they
 use p2p - it´s cheap. The same is with EA and FIFA. </p>
<p>The only thing you can do is: Buy only games who support dedicated Servers like Forza and Titanfall.

<h2>            How do I project my Surface Pro 3&#39;s screen to my Laptop PC wirelessly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to figure out how I may project my Surface Pro 3's screen to my Laptop PC wirelessly (Wi-Fi).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background info &amp; goal: I'm an elementary classroom teacher and often use OneNote so that my students can copy notes as well as send those same notes to parents for reference. Currently, my Surface Pro 3 is hooked up to my projector via USB Type B cable.
 I want to be able to walk around my classroom instead of being confined to staying stationary while taking notes in OneNote. My projector is kind of old but has an HDMI port available. My thought is that I can connect my laptop PC (that's also running Windows
 8.1) with the projector via the HDMI cable, and project my Surface Pro's screen to my laptop to achieve my goal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken so far: I have used the Charms menu -&gt; Devices -&gt; Project -&gt; Add a wireless display feature with no success. Both my Tablet and Laptop are connected via Bluetooth but I'm assuming that Bluetooth connection won't do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have tips to share?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincere thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Like&nbsp;you suggested you&nbsp;could purchase a Miracast device. There are many already on the market. The device plugs into your projectors HDMI port and uses a USB port for power. Using that method negates using the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wanted to use your laptop connected to the projector to&nbsp;mirror the view on your SP3 you could using something like Remote Desktop or TeamViewer.</p>

            <p>Thanks all for the replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did end up grabbing one yesterday morning at my local Best Buy store. It works marvelously without any issues. I put the WDA (Wireless Display Adapter) through my normal work load, which is turning off the projector various times and switching the &nbsp;projector's
 input from the overhead to the Surface Pro3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe exchanging might help?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Internet losing connection every 24 hours</h2>
                    Hello so I have an Ethernet cable connected to my pc and every 24 hours I lose internet connection and there is a tiny yellow triangle. I go into cmd every time and type "netsh winsock reset catalog" and reset my computer. Im fine with the internet for
 24 hours and this process repeats. This has happened for about a month now.&nbsp;

            Hi John, 
<br />
<br />What’s the make and model of your PC? Click start, and type “system” and open system information. Next to system model you should see the model we need.
<br />
<br />Click start, and type “Control Panel” - open it, and look for Network and Sharing. Once that is open, click “change adapter settings” on the left. Is there any chance you could send a screenshot to me? 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + PrntSc and a photo will save within a screenshot folder in your Pictures folder.
<br />
<br />I’ve had issues with that yellow triangle showing no internet, limited access, etc, and it’s been due to other network adapters, virtual ones, etc. 
<br />
<br />Let me know, and we’ll try to figure this out!
<br />- C

<span>have you checked if other devices are always connected or have the same problem?</span><br />
<span>Go to Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, select your ethernet adapter, then make sure the Power Management option is disabled. Then go to Advanced and disable any power saving option.</span>

<p>
</p><p>1) Open cmd(administrator)<br />
2) Type- net stop WuAuServ<br />
3) Now press windows+R and type %windir% <br />
4) Find the folder named SoftwareDistribution, and rename the folder to SDold<br />
5) Go to cmd again and type- net start WuAuServ<br />
6) Install net framework.<br />

<p>I hope it helps.</p>

<p>The new version (8.12) is HORRIBLE.&nbsp; It lacks the most basic of functionality.&nbsp; You can't even adjust the size of your font on it.&nbsp; Just downright terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download a previous version of skype at filehippo.com&nbsp; That's what I did.&nbsp; And remember, after you install the older version, turn OFF automatic updates, it's found under Advanced.</p>

</p><p>If I understand you correctly you are willing to remove connection bar of remote desktop connection. I would suggest you to try the step provided below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncheck the <strong>Display the connection bar when I use the full screen</strong> to get rid of the bar. You can then use
<strong>++</strong> to switch between local/remote sessions.</p>

            I've been searching and tried Fhotoroom, Fotor and Polarr. Polarr is the only one that'll open RW2 files properly, at the very least, but they're all rubbish. What else is there? There are a lot of paid apps, but I don't want to keep dropping £££ on them
 if they turn out to be as useless as those three.

I'm surprised you're suddenly seeing this error. Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. On the <em>Servers </em>tab, isn't <em>My server requires authentication</em> selected? If it is, click
<em>Settings</em>, select <em>Log on using </em>and enter your Comcast username and password.<br />
<br />
As before, remove any unsent messages from the outbox before testing.<br />

    <title>Error&#58; Setup cannot set the required Windows XP configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjolbrich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; Setup cannot set the required Windows XP configuration information while upgrading from Windows XP Home SP3  to Windows XP Pro.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: OEM Windows XP Home SP3 upgrade to XP Pro </p>
<p>Here is a compilation of posts from another forum regarding<br />
my problem:<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I'm trying to upgrade an OEM Windows XP Home Sp3 system to <br />
Windows XP Pro.(There are a couple of features in Pro <br />
that are not available in Home that I now need: (1) Offline Files and<br />
(2) a freely available add-on to Onenote 2007,Top2onenote, requires Pro).<br />
I do not want a clean install but an upgrade. I purchased a Windows XP Pro <br />
upgrade CD over Ebay which turned out to be Windows XP Pro <br />
Gold (v2002).I'm sure its genuine for the following reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was listed as an upgrade, but the CD is not labeled "Upgrade".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks very genuine with all the Microsoft holography.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It came in the standard Windows XP packaging (minus the box), <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was sealed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The volume label for the CD is WXPFPP_EN.From the Internet, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is Windows XP Pro RTM (Gold) Retail !!!!</p>
<p>Here are the things I tried initially.</p>
<p>1) I tried to upgrade to Pro from the purchased CD. It immediately <br />
refused to upgrade stating the upgrade OS (Pro) was older than the <br />
installed OS (Home)..</p>
<p>2) I read up on slipstreaming. Slipstreaming allows one to incorporate <br />
a service pack with an earlier version of an OS. I created an <br />
image of a slipstreamed upgrade XP Pro SP3 CD using Nlite (and <br />
later Autostreamer, but it made no difference) from the purchased CD <br />
and a file containing SP3. </p>
<p>After burning the CD and starting the upgrade<br />
installation (from Windows), the upgrade process <br />
proceeds through "Collecting Information", <br />
"Dynamic Update", and "Preparing Installation" with <br />
no problems. My machine rebooted and returned to <br />
"Preparing Installation". A progress bar titled "Progress" <br />
quickly filled to about 90% and the system hung <br />
at that point for about 15 minutes.<br />
Next, I received the following error:</p>
<p>Setup cannot set the required Windows XP configuration<br />
information. This indicates an internal setup error.</p>
<p>This is where I'm stuck. I had to quit Setup at this point.<br />
My hard drive was unbootable and I had to restore a backup.</p>
<p><br />
3) Just for the heck of it, I formatted my hard disk and <br />
reinstalled my original OEM XP Home SP3 OS (clean, no user files). <br />
I immediately used my slipstreamed XP Pro CD to attempt an <br />
upgrade to XP Pro and IT WORKED!!! I need to discover why the <br />
clean XP Home OS successfully upgraded to XP Pro but my preexisting <br />
(with user files,drivers, etc.) XP Home OS will not upgrade <br />
successfully to XP Pro.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>From another post:</p>
<p>Again, today I installed a fresh copy of OEM Windows XP Home Sp3.<br />
I followed that with an installation of all essential and add-on <br />
drivers (essentially all my original version drivers). Next, I <br />
configured a network connection and firewall. With this setup, <br />
I ran the XP Pro slipstreamed SP3 CD. The upgrade to XP Pro was <br />
successful (even though the upgrade did not configure my graphics <br />
card correctly). I guess my current problem is either the registry,<br />
the WINDOWS folder, or some user file or setting.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>From another post:</p>
<p>I've made a file and folder backup of the C:\Windows folder <br />
on my preexisting system (OEM XP Home Sp3). I've also made a <br />
separate backup of the "System State" on my preexisting system.<br />
These are in addition to my full image backup of the preexisting <br />
system from a month ago.</p>
<p>I've made an image backup of my minimal system (Fresh OEM XP Home <br />
SP3 with all original drivers installed plus a configured network <br />
connection, and a configured firewall). This system will upgrade <br />
successfully to XP Pro with the slipstreamed XP Pro SP3 CD.</p>
<p>Experiment 1:</p>
<p>I restored my minimal system. I then restored the C:/Windows folder <br />
and the System State from the preexisting system backup. A bootup <br />
was successful (with a minor irritant). I had to activate Windows.<br />
Next, I tried the upgrade with the slipstreamed XP Pro. It paused <br />
at the same place during the upgrade and gave the same error as before:</p>
<p>Setup cannot set the required Windows XP configuration information.<br />
This indicates an internal setup error.</p>
<p>Experiment 2:</p>
<p>I restored my minimal system. I then restored only the System State <br />
from the preexisting system backup. After bootup I was asked to <br />
activate Windows, but answering yes to the question would log me off<br />
the system. I could not get logged in to try the XP Pro upgrade.</p>
<p>Experiment 3:</p>
<p>I restored my minimal system. I then restored only the C:/Windows <br />
folder from the preexisting system backup. Again, as in Experiment 1, <br />
the upgrade failed at the same point with the same error message.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Before Experiment 3, I hoped that Experiment 3 would succeed so I <br />
could conclude I had a registry problem. I'm not so sure now. <br />
I don't know what to try next. Taking the minimal system and reinstalling <br />
my user files is not an option as my hard disk has over 200GB of<br />
programs!!! If I restore all the files and folders from my preexisting<br />
backup I would still have to restore a reliable System State (read registry).<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Sorry for the length! If anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate replies.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Problemas para ligar Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Estamos com um problemas para ligarmos o Xbox 360, a fonte original queimou devido a uma ligação inadvertida no 220v, porém já comprei 3 outras fontes (paralelas pois não encontro original), e o console liga mas em aproximadamente 3 segundos desliga.</p>
<p>Troquei o console de tomada elétrica, substitui o cabo, deixei fora da energia para "descarregar"&nbsp;e o problema persiste. Nas primeiras fontes o led ficava vermelho, nesta última fica verde e às vezes o Xbox até funciona, ficando o dia todo ligado, porém
 no outro dia não liga.</p>
<p>Qual a melhor solução para meu problema?</p>
<p>Atenciosamente.</p>

<p>Ja tentou ligar em outra tomada? pode ser sobre carga desta tomada, não sou eletricista mais ja vi casos de aparelhos não funcionarem em algumas tomadas por elas estarem "desregulada". Você pode também procurar no mercado livre, eu cheguei a achar por la
 algumas já, claro que o preço não é barato igual a paralela, mais creio que esta não te causará problema. Lembre-se de trocar de tomada para fazer o teste</p>

<p>Recomendo dar uma olhada no cooler da fonte. Ja tive um problema parecido. Tinha dia que o cooler funcionava e o console rodava ok! E em outro dia o cooler não ligava e nada do console funcionar!</p>
