<p>Perhaps you have installed the wrong version of windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10s is the new secure version that only allows Microsoft store apps installed.</p>
<p>You can if you want upgrade it to windows 10 Pro, but it will cost you unless your computer has once had pro activated - otherwise you need to freshly install the original version you had.</p>

<br />
Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.<br />
<br />
BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card<br />
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/<br />
<br />
Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/<br />
<br />
<br />
The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.<br />
<br />
Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.<br />
<br />
Click Install now<br />
<br />
Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed
 to enter it.<br />
<br />
Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.<br />
<br />
The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro<br />
<br />
Wait while setup prepares to copy files<br />
<br />
Accept the license terms then click Next<br />
<br />
Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then
 go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Select the drive then click New<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.<br />
<br />
Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK<br />
<br />
This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Wait while Windows installs<br />
<br />
When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.<br />
<br />
Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.<br />

    <title>Headphones connect &#40;with sound &#42;ding&#42;&#41; but show up for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louis p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphones connect &#40;with sound &#42;ding&#42;&#41; but show up for 0.1 seconds on the &#34;Sound&#34; menu and then disappear. How do i conect my headphones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Headphones connect (with sound *ding*) but show up for 0.1 seconds on the "Sound" menu and then disappears.</p>
<p>The first time i connected them it worked. then i clicked on another video on youtube and it just went back to the sound of my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now every time i conect the headphones they plug in, do the sound, then i select headphones ( because it asks me if it is headphones or gaming headphones with mic) and then i see it pop up for a fraction of a second on the sound menu, but just a fraction
 of a second and it disappears again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what could be causing this? i just got the pc a few days ago.</p>
<p>the headphones are super old though and are not i nteh ebst condition, but work with my laptop.</p>

    <title>How i got Windows 10 update to stop permanently. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristina-aka  say:</h3>
<h2>            How i got Windows 10 update to stop permanently.</h2>
                    <p>I read so many articles about people just wanting to stop this update from trying to update. And i think every response was either to "hide" it, (which you and i know damn well that only lasted maybe a few hours at best) OR to just go out and buy an external
 drive for more space. Insert eye roll here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a cheap laptop ONLY to watch Netflix on. That's it. Its a 2GB 64bit. And with ZERO additions and with me disabling and deleting everything that was unnecessary, the system and "reserved" took up almost every bit of space on my storage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter the windows update. Ugh. every time it kept trying to update, i would get a message saying i had to make room for the download by deleting blah blah blah. HELLO??? My entire storage space is full of this Current version of Windows 10 and it is absolutely
 functioning fine. I literally could not make the room. And i sure in hell wasn't going to go purchase an external gadget (yeah i know they're only like 40$) just to have the space to get this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter frustrated foolish, maybe ballsy but definitely stubborn semi computer literate being.&nbsp; After reading a few articles about your computers "system" and getting in there, clicking a few buttons, and wa-la, problem solved, i gave it a go. No. Didn't work.
 I decided to dig around, deep up in my computer and check out a few things. Unknowingly, i spent about 2 hours just cruising around in here. And yeah, i found some stuff, said what the hell, and just started deleting. And, IT WORKED.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&gt; Right click home &gt; Computer Management &gt; System tools &gt; Task Schedule Library &gt;Microsoft. Windows.
</p>
<p>Scroll all the way down to Windows update. And also Windows update assistant. Double click. And all of he events, scheduled and recent will be there. After the next step, go to Windows update assistant and do the same thing. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first i disabled. then i tried to delete. But after restarting my computer, the update popped up again. In the windows update folder, i disabled "triggers", Changed the conditions, and the actions. Still didn't work.&nbsp; So i DELETED the damn folders. Because
 i don't need the update. </p>
<p>And empty recycle bin. Restart Computer. And never again. Battery stays charged longer too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I hope this helps some poor soul ripping their hair out today. Good luck you crazy computer guys.
</p>

            It is possible to permanently stop automatic updates, using a scheduled task and a script. However, this will also prevent the Windows virus scanner from getting its upgraded virus definitions. I suspect you would not want this.

<p>I bought a laptop, because i didnt want a tablet. Is there some nerdy computer genius internet absolute that says that i have to ONLY buy a tablet to watch netflix? NO Mr. Bulldog. I bought what i wanted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is a way, because i found it. I bought this laptop believing that everything was already up to date. Said the information on the box, on the index cards placed perfectly next to my laptops model, the ever so helpful sales guy, and based on the
 information i read all over the internet.&nbsp; It surely isnt MY fault that Microsoft decided to to tweak Windows 10 a tad. So, why would i buy something that includes updates? I absolutely forgot that in 2018, every three moons, every single app, browser, operating
 system, ect. ect. has to update for bug fixes and performance issues. The windows 10 that i am running, is great. and if i used this laptop for more than watching netflix, i bet it still wouldnt&nbsp; REAAAALLLY need this update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it is clear that I am no computer wiz know it all, like you SIR, but i should have the option to disable these updates IF i feel like there is no real security threat, and if i feel like up until the point of the new update that i am happy and satisfied
 with the running of my laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to troll my post. I appreciate you taking the time from your day to write a sarcastic reply. I can really feel the emotion. Good job.

<p>That is not the way to do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>there is 3 ways to do this, depending on what you want to do and how to control it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling it will not do much as other tasks can trigger these tasks telling the ASSIGNED USER NAME for that task to run it anyways</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting each task is an option, not advised and another task can still trigger the assigned user name to run the task. It all depends on the types of tasks and how many different tasks are involved with a certain task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for Windows Update, The best way is to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you highlight each task and&nbsp;EXPORT the task and save it to an XML file. So you can later "IMPORT the task back if you need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then for each task as there is 4 for Windows Update, you highlight &nbsp;them, and for each task in General Tab on bottom you see what USER NAME runs the task. The first one is "Interactive User" and the next 3 are "System User"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for each one you select the Actions Tab. This is the location of the file that runs the task. If Actions does not show any file, then if it&nbsp;is a custom handler controlled by another trigger.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;you can&nbsp;disable the 4 tasks&nbsp;from the&nbsp;right&nbsp;side, but not necessary if you do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I do to assure it will not automatically run, but I can manually run it and update my system, remember the file locations I mentioned and the assigned user name that runs each task, go to C:\Windows\system32 folder.</p>
<p>Type in the file name from the actions tab for each task in search box.</p>
<p>Right click on the file and select properties&gt;&gt;security tab&gt;&gt;advanced.</p>
<p>Now take a snippet of the Owner and all users in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you select CHANGE next to OWNER.</p>
<p>Advanced&gt;&gt;Find Now&gt;&gt;Select your user account name in the list&gt;&gt;OK</p>
<p>Apply&gt;&gt;Verify OK. Now you are Owner of that file.</p>
<p>Now select disable inheritance.</p>
<p>Now select ADD&gt;&gt;Select a Principle&gt;&gt;Advanced&gt;&gt;Find Now&gt;&gt;Select your user account name in the list&gt;&gt;OK&gt;&gt;OK</p>
<p>Now select full control permissions&nbsp;box&gt;&gt;OK</p>
<p>Now you are owner and on the list with full permissions.</p>
<p>Now delete all the other users in the list&nbsp;except yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now no other user name, no matter what, can start that file to start that task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I take ownership and delete all other users, is I learned long ago that many tasks can send other tasks requests or demands to run other tasks and even if disabled and even deleted in some cases, that a disabled or deleted task does not mean that
 another task can not trigger the deleted or disabled task and run it. But if you take ownership of the file that runs the task and with full permissions and delete all other user types such as system, Users, Interactive, etc, then if they are not there in
 the list, they can not run the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can run the tasks anytime yourself manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to delete all tasks&nbsp;inside a task, I would still take ownership,&nbsp;BUT ALWAYS EXPORT EACH TASK AND SAVE IN A FOLDER BEFORE DELETING THEM TO RESTORE LATER. You can also view the exported XML files in your web browsers.</p>

</p><p>Mr Bull(y)dog, I can assure you, not that it really matters, that i am a very responsible and reasonable adult. I actually take responsibility for all outcomes of my decisions. Good and bad, i accept it, RARELY challenge my wrongs, and i learn lessons. I
 learned how to do all of these things because my parents raised my right. (thats an entirely different discussion im sure you dont want to have.) If or when my computer starts to malfunction or it tries to control me, i hereby do solemnly swear that I will
 not be blaming Microsoft. Because i know what i did, and i know that although it has solved my immediate issues, it might make other issues pop up.

<p>Where were you when i was searching endlessly for a solution to this problem weeks ago? HAHA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, there are so many forums and articles online about this very problem. Its not just me, Hundreds and probably thousands of people were in my same boat. And quite a few of them posted questions online trying to find some kind of solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i stated in my "discussion", I tried two of the two solutions that were suggested. TWO solutions. It was a little confusing because i knew there had to be other ways of getting this done. and OBVIOUSLY you have found another way, and though my way worked,
 you say it was all wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that the majority of the online Q&amp;A that i read were dated 2016 and all the way back to 2013 im certain.&nbsp; Dates dont matter, but what does matter is that this is a really big deal. and not just to me. Which some people seem to think after reading
 my "discussion" that i am the only person on the planet to have this issue and try to resolve it. sigh.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to do a system restore. I was considering it after reading your reply. Maybe that would allow me to give your way a shot? What do you think?</p>

<p>Since you've mentioned that while doing a custom install you are getting "windows can't be installed on drive" error, this can be related to the
<span>partition style<span> of the hard drive where you trying to install Windows 10.
</span></span><span>When installing Windows on UEFI-based PCs using Windows Setup, your hard drive partition style must be set up to support either UEFI mode or legacy BIOS-compatibility mode. Kindly visit this

 ms has deleted it). I used the second method --&nbsp;setting a very long popup time -- to solved the problem. The problems troubled me since I used Win7 about 4 years ago and today I finally be out of patience. Glad to see it's (almost) killed at last.</p>

<p><span>Hi Dr. Tom,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to get clarity and to assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which version of Windows are you using on the computer? Press Windows key + R and type “winver” without quotes to check.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you aware of any recent changes such as a software installation or uninstallation on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What is the complete error message? Kindly provide a

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>V0560Pin.dll error can be caused due to multiple reasons and one among it is the corruption of the file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these troubleshooting methods to resolve the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong>Try to boot the computer in </span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">safe mode</span></a><span> and check if
 you get the error. Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause.</span></p>

    <title>Movies App kills sound output after 1607 update - Realtek Optical - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_sirhc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movies App kills sound output after 1607 update - Realtek Optical Output</h2>
                    <p>This was a bug that appeared some time back that had been patched, but seems to have re-appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when Movies app content is played, the sound card output is muted. Muted for all applications. The movie still plays, just no audio.&nbsp;It remains muted until Movies app&nbsp;is closed, and the other apps are restarted. VLC for instance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I 'think' this is configuration specific but I have not done any other hardware testing.&nbsp; The PC has a standard Realtek soundcard using their Realtek HD Audio Manager, and is using specifically the Optical TOSLINK output. I believe that is the problem configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that the Realtek card driver is not compatible with 1607 in the same way. Perhaps they patched it for previous versions so that the bug seemed to go away. But&nbsp;has resurfaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows ultimately must be compatible, I hope you can use this feedback to verify the issue and take corrective actions with Realtek or whatever you did last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware Details:</p>
<p>Realtek HD Audio Manager</p>
<p>Audio Driver Version 6.0.1.7535</p>
<p>Audio Codec: ALC1150</p>
<p>using Realtek Digital Output(Optical) (Realtek High Definition Audio)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember I used some work around like, opening Movies, then playing something using VLC, then playing Movies.. some combo like that worked until one day that step was no longer needed.&nbsp; Hope that helps.</p>

    <title>Alps Pointing Device Touchpad cannot be disabled at all. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sethsloben  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alps Pointing Device Touchpad cannot be disabled at all.</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to do a system restore in order to remove a virus. Once my computer was cleaned of the virus, my Touchpad was re-enabled (it had been previously set up so that when my mouse was plugged in, the Touchpad was disabled). When I tried to disable
 the Touchpad, the tab where it can be disabled was missing in the Mouse settings. Here's a picture to show what I mean:&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/ak8kK5i.png</p>
<p>As can be seen, the Device Settings tab is missing and the Alps pointing device itself cannot be disabled.</p>
<p>I have an HP Pavilion TouchSmart 14z-n100 CTO Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR) and use Windows 8.1. This is the first time I have come across this problem.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums.<br />
Try re-installing the TouchPad drivers (get the latest). If needed check with Alps support.<br />

<br />
Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with
<br />
TouchPad entries) and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on
<br />
lower right.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on TouchPad
<br />
- Driver's Tab - Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself <br />
(all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. This does not stop the touchpad
<br />
from working.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista's is the same except
<br />
we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />

<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
This utility also helps to control the TouchPad :<br />
<br />
TouchFreeze<br />

<h2>            BitLocker Recovery</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung tablet that I am currently locked out of due to a Bitlocker issue.&nbsp; My&nbsp;Mom was fooling around with the laptop and screwed something up but doesn't know what she did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Windows login is asking for a Bitlocker recovery key.&nbsp; I do not remember ever turning on Bitlocker but apparently it somehow became engaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a Bitlocker recovery key and have had no luck finding one.&nbsp; I have tried following Microsoft's directions at the following link&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ae/help/4026181/windows-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Bitlocker
 Recovery</span></a>&nbsp;but have had no luck.&nbsp; There is no Bitlocker recovery key linked to my Microsoft account and since I never turned on Bitlocker I obviously did not save or write down the recovery key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting the computer in the "Advanced Options" section of the login screen but this does not work.&nbsp; When the computer reboots it goes right back to the screen which asks me to input my Bitlocker recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought about trying to boot from a USB stick and reinstall Windows from USB but the tablet does not have a USB slot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am really hoping someone can help me fix this as it has basically turned the laptop into a brick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to get more information for us to properly isolate the issue and provide a suitable resolution. Please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your computer's configuration prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you tried downloading another applications? If so, please check if the same issue persists.</li><li>Is your PC up to date?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Often, you might encounter issue when downloading applications from Windows Store. Resetting the Windows Store cache might fix the issue. This will reset Windows Store without changing the account settings or deleting installed applications. To do so, please
 follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>WSreset.exe</strong> and hits <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Check if it takes you to a store page which displays that the cache has been reset.</li><li>Open the Windows Store app and check.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Since after resetting the Windows Store cache and the issue still persists, let's create a new user profile on your PC. Creating a new user profile will let us isolate if the are corrupted files in the current user profile that causes the problem. To do

    <title>Microsoft Keyboard Elite for Bluetooth, windows 7 problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeygolden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Keyboard Elite for Bluetooth, windows 7 problem.</h2>
                    
<p>OK, I have read all of the post here and none of them offer or come close to a solution to my problem. Mostly because the solutions dont coinside with my problem. OK here it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed Windows 7 with the Microsoft Keyboard Elite for Bluetooth (to be referred to as MKEB). Everything went fine. Adapter was found and installed and keyboard worked fine. Although I had no control panel to access all the extra features that are offered
 with the keyboard ( volume, hot keys etc...)</p>
<p>Now I wanted to be able to controle my volume for my computer from the keyboard like I always have with this model and went online to Microsoft to find the drivers for the MKEB. Only thing that was offered to me (which I didnt see a problem with as it referred
 me to this upon product inquiry) was the Intellitype 8.0. OK so I install it and much to my surprise, didnt do or give me any access the options on the keyboard that I was looking for.</p>
<p>OK so now I am alittle pissed but hey, I am always able to get things working, so I am not worried. NOW I go into the control panel to see if there are any options to be had for the keyboard controls....nothing..ok, no biggie. I figure maybe I have to re-establish
 the connection between the keyboard and the adapter.&nbsp;I got to look for the usual "Bluetooth" icon, ya know the one.... the one that is as&nbsp;simple as seeingn the keyboard in the bluetooth device. Then just rediscovering it and BAM all is well....... WELL that
 simple icon isnt there... hmmmmm wierd ok, new OS new place for it.... I look all over and to my surprise I do not find a "Bluetooth" icon. I do find ( and upon going to a couple of forums am referred to) the "devices and printers" icon. .. Hmmm ok new OS,
 new place.... no bluetooth icon there (even though some forums had said that there would be) BUT.... I see the "add device".... SO..... i click it and Holy Cow, there is a screen similar to the "simple" bluetooth screen that I wanted. SWEET!!!!! .......still
 looking.....still looking......still.. you get the point. Well!! Now I do the thing that you would think that you would have to do and I still wasnt worried, I turn the keyboard over and hit the "make/break connection" button and wait for the discovery to
 be made. Hmmmm not a chance.... Nothing....... LAME</p>
<p>So now I have no connection to the adapter so I have no keyboard. Yay.... still not worried but a little more pissed than I was. I put another keyboard in the computer and commence looking online for a solution to the problem. Only to discover that there
 isnt one that relates to the problem that I am having specifically. So now I am worried, but I have 2 of these keyboards and something in my head says get the other one, put some batteries in it and see if it connects ( I thought this because...different device,
 maybe seperate discovery form one that I had) IT DOES!!!! I am golden I have the keyboard back (well different one) and all is well. Well I still dont have access to the options that I wanted on the keyboard but so what I can deal with that. Ill just look
 more into it and find out why.</p>
<p>So now you are prolly saying hmmmm he is still writing this cant be the end..... Your right! That was last week or 2 (time flys by around Christmas)&nbsp; Day after Christmas, enter snow. :) Yay ( that was wise... I hate snow)&nbsp;and lots of it. anyway power flickers
 here and there and finally takes a short dump. Back on I restart and quess what....... THATS RIGHT, no connection between the keyboard and adapter. Remember before when I said "I wasnt worried" a few times... well now I am worried. 1) I dont have another MKEB
 2) After all of my research I still havent found any easy way to install Bluetooth devices in Windows 7</p>
<p>Now my question(s)........<br />
&nbsp; 1) Why do I not have a "bluetooth Devices" icon in my control panel where other people seem to have one<br />
&nbsp; 2) Why doesnt the "add device" and following search not find the device<br />
&nbsp; 3) Why is it so damn difficult to sync a MICROSOFT keyboard with Windows ( I know....I know..... still had to ask)<br />
&nbsp; 4) i dont know I know I had more but came seem to think of them atm, please help me and let me know where this elusive "bluetooth devices" icon is and or why I dont have it. And any help rediscovering the keyboard would be awesome. :)</p>
<p>Look forward to some responses :)</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>Finally after scouring the internet I found a solution that worked for me.&nbsp;Update the Bluetooth driver under Bluetooth Radios in the Device manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1. Clicked Update the driver; browse the Computer, and Pick from list; Selected the&nbsp;"Microsoft Wireless Tranceiver for Bluetooth 2.0".
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Right-click new device in the Device Manager and chose "Scan for Hardware changes".&nbsp;&nbsp;Several new items including the "Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator" appear.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. At this point, you should be able to add the keyboard and mouse, if they didn't already appear Control Panel\Devices and Printers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also&nbsp;downloaded and installed both the latest&nbsp;keyboard and mouse drivers (v 8)&nbsp; from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Ok, I am trying to record with my laptop and listen to the input at the same time. The input on my laptop is a combined headphone and mic jack so I have acquired a headphone splitter. This splits left and right signals to both sockets but can I use one socket
 as an output and one as an input? Also, I am strugling to set the mic up on its own with put a splitter.</p>

    <title>Disable Windows Update Delivery Optimization through Group Policy or - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable Windows Update Delivery Optimization through Group Policy or Registry</h2>
                    <p>I manage a decent amount of computers on a domain at my workplace, so I need to disable the "great" new Delivery Optimization feature through a Group Policy or Registry setting.&nbsp; It just isn't feasible to go to each PC (especially remote ones hundreds of
 miles away) and disable it.&nbsp; Also, users cannot be trusted to disable this on their own and I can't stop them from re-enabling it for some unknown reason.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, many employees are in a data capped trap at home, so they'll be asking me why they are suddenly charged an extra $50+ overage fee a month pretty quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm sure it is secure and all (everything in an operating system always is!), in a workplace environment it is a risk to receive anything like a security related update from other users (local network or internet).</p>
