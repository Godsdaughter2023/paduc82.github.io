<h2>            Task Scheduler doesn&#39;t start some tasks after Oct&#39;10&#47;2017 Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this month's Windows Update, I noticed that the Task Scheduler didn't start some tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these tasks are configured with the trigger "At system startup". Their history log have this same entry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Category:&nbsp;Task Start Failed</p>
<p>OpCode:&nbsp;Launch Failure</p>
<p>"Task Scheduler failed to start "\Uptime" task for user. Additional Data: Error Value: 2147943726."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem persists after subsequent reboots. I had to manually start these tasks, in many computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guilherme</p>

<p>Hi Guilherme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the update that was installed on your computer affected the settings of your task scheduler. What's the update that was recently installed on your computer? Kindly provide a screenshot of your update history. To do so, just open Settings,
 then go to Update and Security. Click on Update history, and you will see the latest updates that were installed on your computer. Does the issue persist when you manually start your tasks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 wireless controller on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am trying to install my Xbox 360 wireless controller to be usable on a windows 8.1 machine but I am having issues connecting it to the receiver. What I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Plugged the receiver in to an USB2.0 slot.</li><li>Installed the windows 7 64bit drivers in win 7 compability mode.</li><li>Found the device in the device manager with a driver warning and located the "Xbox 360 Peripherals" drivers on my compter and picked the latest receivers drivers.</li><li>Tried to push the button on the reciever and on the controller but the controller is stuck at blinking and nothing happens.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have also looked in "Microsoft Xbox 360 accessories status" program and the button icon is all grey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?</p>
                </div>

            <p>I have looked into the "Xbox 360 PC Wireless Gaming Receiver" myself on YouTube and from what I can see there are plenty of videos that they will tell you how to connect it. I don't know much about the Xbox 360 PC Wireless Gaming Receiver since I don't own
 an Xbox 360 and don't have one of those products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have looked on YouTube on how to connect the gaming receiver and it still doesn't work, I would contact Microsoft, or your computer manufacturer e.g Toshiba, SAMSUNG, or you could contact Xbox (which you would probably call Microsoft for, like duh
 lol) and see what they have to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the gaming receiver you have doesn't work, buy a new receiver (see if you can get a refund from your old receiver, because you just bought&nbsp;a product which does not work)&nbsp;and see how that goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, I don't have much else to say. Good luck on connecting the receiver though, hope it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Will.</p>

            <span>Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks much for your reply. <br />
<br />
My laptop is Acer Inspire 5515, the lost connection was for wireless--I can still connect through an ethernet cable at home. The Microsoft updates were installed yesterday from few intermittent sessions 'cause I had to leave; one time battery went out--not
 sure if the cause.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Microsoft updates are the latest&nbsp;because every time&nbsp;they prompt me, I'd go ahead with installation so. &nbsp;The last time for updates from Microsoft was 'bout one month ago. &nbsp; After I lost the wireless connection, I tried to view and connect to other networks
 but a message came back saying I dont have the wireless network adapter installed.<br />
<br />
Here are few things I tried since:<br />
<ol>
<li>Downloaded the latest drivers from manufacturer, did not help.</li><li>Checked device mgr, there were 2 warless network adapter drivers; I UN-installed one that did not work, and I am still only good with LAN by using the other one.</li><li>I found a wireless network set-up flash drive from my phone company and tried to RUN it, but a message says that I dont have the wireless software on my laptop.</li><li>I checked other related posts on internet about this issue, and found the wireless internet on/off switch in the front of my laptop --but my switch is already set to wireless. So I pushed the thing back to OFF, then ON for wireless numerous times --did
 not work.</li><li>Searched the Acer users guide. Then according to instruction, popped up mobile Window on my laptop to click wireless networking icon on /off --but that icon window did not even come up as described by the user guide.</li><li>One post on website suggested to another user with similar issue to buy an mobile internet wireless flash drive for connection. That is a hardware solution; not sure mine is hardware or software. Does that sound feasible to you guys? and if yes, where to
 find one and how much cost is reasonable?</li></ol>
<br />
Thanks much!<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Update Error 0xC1900101 - 0x30018</h2>
                    <p>I've been stuck in an update install failure loop for over a month now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows forces me to update, it takes at least 20 minutes then tells me it can't install the update on this device, then takes another 5 or so minutes to revert to previous windows version. Then within a couple days it forces me to try the update again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had 2 support techs try to "fix" the issue but they just run the stupid update and get kicked out. (through screen sharing/control).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second one tried to install the new creative update for me and that gave me this error code:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"0xC1900101 - 0x30018 The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during SYSPREP operation. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really just want it to stop trying to update at this point because I assume it's something in my hardware that isn't compatible with the new windows 10 updates from here on out. My laptop is at least 5 years old and I haven't replaced anything on it so
 I'm sure Windows has had a change in it's hardware requirements that is now causing my computer to fail it's required hardware to "run" windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had this issue, and after a week I finally managed to get past it.&nbsp; First off, ignore anything you read about disabling antivirus or disabling services for a 'clean boot' etc...&nbsp; When I was finally able to find the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/resolution-procedures#0xc1900101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
tech source</a> for the error, it's clearly a <strong>DRIVER </strong>issue.&nbsp; The system hasn't even reached the point where services or software is being loaded.&nbsp; So keep your focus on the drivers.&nbsp; This will help narrow down the problem for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You went through and checked <strong>every </strong>single driver for updates? (right clicked each driver and clicked 'update driver')&nbsp; If not, it would be wise to do that first.&nbsp; I would suggest you also find a decent 'driver updater' program--<strong>not
</strong>to update your drivers--but just to see if you really have the latest drivers on your machine. Look at user reviews to make sure the program isn't a scam though.&nbsp; I don't like programs like this, but it's handy since it can help me narrow down which
 drivers might be suspect.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I suggest this is because chipset makers will often release updated drivers, but the laptop manufacturer doesn't bother to update their driver download page with the later releases.&nbsp; Since the generic chipset drivers aren't tagged for your specific
 machine, they may never show up in an update scan.&nbsp; Simple example, my built in bluetooth adapter didn't show any updates available, but I found one on the chipset manufacturer website.&nbsp; Same for the video card.&nbsp; And the network card.&nbsp; After a while computer
 manufacturers just stop updating their support pages, but don't take that to mean there aren't any updates out there.&nbsp; Use a hardware diagnostic program if you don't know what hardware you have in your machine.</p>
<br />
<p>One other step that may be helpful--which I did--was to open device manager, click on VIEW and then click "Show Hidden Devices".&nbsp; Now go through and look for device icons that are 'faded'.&nbsp; These devices are device drivers that are installed, but that the
 hardware isn't connected anymore.&nbsp; I went through and deleted any that were like that.&nbsp; Worst case is that the driver has to be redownloaded if you connect it later.&nbsp; Sometimes old drivers are left behind, so don't be afraid to remove anything that shows as
 'not connected'. (If in doubt, right click device, click 'properties' and the device status box will tell you if it's not connected.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you should go into your BIOS and disable any and all built-in hardware that isn't
<strong><em>essential </em></strong>to run your machine.&nbsp; Sound card, bluetooth adapter, even your network adapter. (once you have the update downloaded, you don't need it for the update itself.)&nbsp; Just disable as much as possible without it being essential
 hardware.&nbsp; This way you can take the driver for that piece of hardware out of the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was done all the above, I clicked 'restart', and disconnected any USB devices that I still had connected.&nbsp; It rebooted and completed the update.&nbsp; Keep your focus on the drivers...&nbsp; This error is specifically a driver issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows Updates are infuriating enough to make me want to use a Mac</h2>
                    <p>Why when Windows 10 does a major update, do things stop working on my laptop??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a constant Windows user since Windows 95&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't Microsoft update software without breaking ****!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to reinstall drivers or even worse sometimes, run SFC or get into regedit everytime Windows Windows does a major update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using a iphone for 10 years now, every update on it is quick and painless, why is this never the case with Windows??? I used tolerate going and troubleshooting when things went wrong, now I am just downright frustrated that in 2019, I have to
 waste so much time keeping my laptop running how it came out of the factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 examples</p>
<p>I have a Thinkpad x1 Carbon (priced about the same as a macbook pro) Everytime there is a major Windows update, the finger print sensor and Function F keys stop working and I need to go to Lenovos website and resinstall drivers for both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Rane Serato Hardware with Serato (DJ music software) I have to reinstall drivers and Serato for the devices that connect to my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft - you are so big, so disconnected from your customers, hardware partners - everyone - Do you listen, or you still don't get it???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make it work every time, not some of the time, I am using premium expensive hardware, I don't have the time or willpower to go and fix stuff in Windows and my software for needless and pointless updates for updates sake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cue the outrage, oh yes they say, its Lenovo's or Rane's fault - well no its not, because everything was working perfect up until that Windows Update!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted to tweak or muck around all the time fixing operating system ****, I would buy a Raspberry PI or install Linux</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respect your customers time, I use Windows to be productive.</p>

<p>Do you&nbsp;<em>really</em> want to know, or do you just feel like venting? (Venting

</p><p>Nothing made by humans will ever be perfect, but you can avoid 98% of the problems that people here blame on Microsoft. That includes the specific problems you are facing.</p>

    <title>Unable to remove orphaned shared folders Windows 7 Home Prem x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fillupt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to remove orphaned shared folders Windows 7 Home Prem x64</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a media drive, which is a separate physical drive, currently assigned to D:/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up shared folders inside it (eg "Recorded TV", "Music" etc) which is working well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had previously moved the HDD into a separate Win 7 computer, then moved it back and it was assigned a different drive letter (From F: to D:) by Windows due to the new addition of another HDD.</p>
<p>All my old shared folders (referencing 'F:/) are still present over the network, in addition to my new ones (assigned to D:/). As the folder structure has changed, it is not an option to simply delete all the D:/ shares and assign the drive through computer
 management as F:/ again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Computer Management the F:/ shares are visible, but there is no option to delete them (only command is 'Open', which results in an error of "Failed to launch explorer homed at ($selected share location)".)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried removing all references to F:/ in the registry here: H<span>KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\Shares but they still are showing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a command prompt, trying to access the invisible F drive results in "The device is not ready". Trying to force an unmount through chkdsk /f f: results in "Cannot open volume for direct access." There is no F drive in Disk management or My Computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a clean install, although the media drive was in use with Win7 beta and RC, and experienced frustrating permission issues at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>screen resolution bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoner9  say:</h3>
<h2>            screen resolution bug</h2>
                    I have a bit of a problem, sometimes after playing games on my computer, the screen resolution needs to change so that the game will play properly. But after shutting down my computer and turning it back on (usually with a gap of a day or so in between),
 the screen resolution stays the same as what the game display was, so my desktop now has a larger icons, wallpaper size increase etc. I can change the resolution back to what it's supposed to be, but is starting to become quite annoying, especially since it
 move my desktop icons around. Is there a way to permanantly fix this?

<div>
<p>Just in case people are still having an issue with this problem, pls find below a solution which worked for me..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><span><span><span>I've spent the last mth trying to solve this problem and "youemailme" (another thread herein) had the correct fix for me!! And so Simple!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>I have noticed on Blogs that this issue has been around at least since Win98 so it's not your O/S or your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The issue appear to be certain program(s) in your Start up Menu that has a different screen resolution set, thereby causing the screen resolution
 to change when you start your computer. So it's not a MicroSoft program error but rather a 'settings' issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>With me what worked were 2 things:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>(1) Perform the "clean boot process" as advised by many to determine which software program(s) was causing the problem.. and then,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>(2)&nbsp;Right-click on the 'problem' program (as discovered in above) name in Start Menu&gt;Properties&gt;Compatibility.&nbsp; For some reason, there's an option
 to "run in 640x480 screen resolution", which was checked.&nbsp; This particular program was in the startup folder, and was the cause of the problem. &nbsp;Then unchecked the resolution box.&nbsp;No more problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I see there are a huge number of people battling this exact issue. Hopefully this 2 step process can resolve their issues.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(ps, Just thinking about it now, you can perhaps not even bother with the "clean boot process" but simply go thru all your programs in your Start Menu and perform
 the 2nd stage explained above. Should work?)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Cheers</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Hello Vars,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try to reduce the hardware acceleration for your Video card and check if you still have the same issues while playing from TV.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Right-click on the Desktop and choose Personalize.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click on Display Settings.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Display Settings window, click Advanced Settings.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Switch to the Troubleshoot tab.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click Change Settings.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Reduce hardware acceleration.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the necessary options are not present for manual disabling, it could be possible that your Video card does not support reducing hardware acceleration.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this does not work, you can try to install the latest drivers for your Audio card.
</span><span>You can check out the below article that will give you information on how to update drivers:
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try to download the latest drivers from the computer or the Device manufacturers’ website and try to install it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If nothing works, I suggest that you uninstall and install the drivers for your video card.</span></span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall a device with Device Manager:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Launch Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Device Manager's left panel, open the node that represents the type of device that you want to uninstall and then right-click the device entry.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the shortcut menu, click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Confirm Device Removal dialog box, click OK to start the uninstall process.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Note:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure that you download the latest driver from the Manufacturers’ website prior to deleting the drivers from your computer. You can also create
 a System Restore point prior to uninstalling the drivers.</span></span></p>

<h2>            have to press f5 to display changes made to files </h2>
                    Everytime I make a change to a file name, delete a file etc. I have to press "F5" to display the changes made to the files. Is this a glitch or is this just a normal part of Windows 7?

    <title>Printer properties windows immediately disappears after right-clicking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alohadawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer properties windows immediately disappears after right-clicking on it.</h2>
                    <p>OS: Win7 Pro 64bit<br />
Domain: Hospitals Domain</p>
<p>Affected Printers: RICOH Aficio MP 5001 PCL 5e/RICOH Pro 907EX PCL 5e<br />
<br />
When a user tries to do a custom print within MS Office Word/Excell/Etc, the&nbsp;user cant open up printer&nbsp;properties. Everytimethe user tries to open it up, it immediatly disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting:<br />
</p>
<p>-Rebuilt Users profile</p>
<p>-Cleaned out registry</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Checked within the registry and made sure no printers were listed</p>
<p>-Restarted the print spool</p>
<p>-Reinstalled printer via IP address</p>
<p>-Reconnected users print through our domain network</p>
<p>-Driver re-installation</p>
<p>*Drivers cant be changed because PCL5 has the options to do custom prinouts(Staples/Black&amp;White/Valid Access Code)*</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has worked before after re-installing driver and renaming the printer. Now, its happening again. Any help?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Etnik,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve this issue, I would suggest you to refer to the Microsoft KB article given below and follow the troubleshooting methods given for Windows 8 Operating System from this article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>&nbsp;</span>"Failure configuring Windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer" error when you try to install Windows updates</a></span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above
 link.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important: The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and also reset the
 recently changed settings on the computer.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Roice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for sharing the details of the troubleshooting report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the troubleshooting report, it seems that the issue is caused by the corrupted Windows Update Components. It shows that the access to the location “<strong><em>C:\windows\softwaredistribution</em></strong>” has been denied and due to which the Windows
 Update is unable to store the Windows Update data. Thus, to resolve this issue, let’s try manually rebuilding the Windows Update Components and check if that resolves the issue. You may please follow these steps and share the result with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Manually Reset Windows Update Components</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and then select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from the menu.</p>
<p>b) Copy the following commands and then right click in the Command Prompt window and select “<strong><em>Paste</em></strong>” to paste all the commands in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><em>net stop wuauserv</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><em>net stop cryptSvc</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><em>net stop bits</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><em>net stop msiserver</em></strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><em>net start msiserver</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p>c) Please wait for the process to complete and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>d) Type “<strong><em>Exit</em></strong>” in the Command Prompt to close it.</p>
<p>e) Now run the Windows Update and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer Image Properties</h2>
                    In Windows Photo Viewer, I'm not able to view individual image properties. I can view the properties in the thumbnail view, but when I click on an individual image, it opens the image but blurs out the properties at the bottom. Anyone know how to fix this?
 THANKS!

<p>Seems to be a malware infestation. Scan your system with updated antimalware tool&nbsp;to make sure your system is clean.</p>
<p>It may be due to modified registry also. If that be the case go for a System Restore. Select any restore point when everything was fine.</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for opening this question for I may have seen something similar on my computer. I am familiar with this technique of doing Print Screen to the clipboard, then opening and pasting clipboard into MS Paint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technique previously always worked reliably until after someday I try the same in a variety of games. If I press Print Screen during a game, switch out of the game then launch and paste into MS Paint, then all I get is a solid Black screen. I then returned
 to the game session and tried again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes returning to the game and trying again would work, sometimes that would give me the clipboard Print Screen from the game session. Increasingly however, the technique stopped working. Nowerdays, the Print Screen &nbsp;has stopped working altogether in
 a game session, yet it still performs like intended on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered if it has anything to do with available memory? Games in particular got increasingly heavy on memory usage, so would the game have an effect on the clipboard transfer technique? Well, I upgraded my sluggish 2GB computer into a 4 GB computer, and
 Im afraid that while computer performance improved, still the Print Screen did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually lost interest in Print Screen as I gradually moved more and more of my games into Steam Cloud, and Steam provide their own Print Screen via the F12 key. Yet, I am pretty attentive to the fact that this feature used to work on the machine, when
 the operating system was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Steam account had been opened from before the point when the Print Screen technique started failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the two situations similar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I am having the same exact issue.&nbsp; Same Validity Sensor and same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the thing is that I tried to go to HP's website to download the driver for my PC and it told me that it did not have a driver for my Validity Sensor for Windows 10.&nbsp; Their website told me to obtain it from the Windows Update feature of Windows 10.&nbsp; However,
 I was able to find the driver software for Windows 7 (my HP Pavilion came with Windows 7) but when it came time for the install, my machine blocked it, saying that it couldn't recognize the software publisher.&nbsp; I have also tried the patience of one of HP's
 techs in their support forums in an effort to have them help me resolve this issue.&nbsp; (He/she won't respond to my posts anymore.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to do a manual update from the device manager.&nbsp; Furthermore, I went into my machine's registry to delete the upper and lower filters of said device.&nbsp; However, when I got there, there were no upper or lower filters to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been 'round the world and back' trying to get an answer to this.&nbsp; I am very sad since I did love using my fingerprint sensor to login to my machine.&nbsp; I hope that this information might help resolve this issue.&nbsp;

            <p>my problem got fixed as soon as I let Microsoft Windows 10 on my laptop have control over the biometric device. How? Simple. There are several ways you can log on to your computer using Windows 10: Facial recognition, password, fingerprint. Look up your
 log on options under settings and you'll see that Windows 10 has an identical platform to Validity Sensors Inc. where you can register as many fingerprints as desired. I did it and to my surprise it started readjusting as if one was downloading updates and
 a bit later, problem solved. Since I wasn't too confident of the process, I marked and registered all three log on options.</p>

<h2>            BSOD Crash Windows 10 0x00000124 ntoskernl.exe&#43;142760</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around Google and several posts in the MS community regarding this issue and have taken the advice of several users, particularly using the install.wim file form the Windows 10 system files recovery iso. I have run sfc /scannow in cmd and there
 are no integrity violations so I know it isn't a key system file that is corrupt causing this issue. I have also run a memtest and disk check and no errors returned. This BSOD doesn't occur upon startup, only when the CPU is under load after about a day or
 more running SETI@home. Here is the associated dump of the crash</p>

</p>
<p>My system specs are as follows;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 Professional 64-Bit</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i7 5930k Haswell-E</p>
<p>CPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D14</p>
<p>GPU: Asus GTX Strix 970</p>
<p>Memory: DDR4 Corsair Vengeance 16GB</p>
<p>MOBO: Asus X99 Delxue</p>
<p>PSU: Corsair CS650M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that my system is overclocked and this crash only usually occurs after 1-2 days of running Seti@Home at 100% load. However with RealTempGT the highest temps it would record would be in the high 80's which is below the TJmax specified for the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My overclock is done manually using the UEFI Bios, Ai Tweaking utility running at 1.3v 4.5ghz. Cache voltage is also 1.3v, CPU input voltage at 2.0, system agent voltage at 1.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to provide more information if it can get me closer to figuring out what is causing this error and take the appropriate actions to underclock my settings to achieve more stability. Thanks everyone.</p>

    <title>I can not reactivate Windows after a hardware change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thegman2332  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can not reactivate Windows after a hardware change</h2>
                    <p>I have followed the guides set up by Microsoft, I'm using the Activation Troubleshoot to activate Windows. So I select Troubleshoot, which does not fix it. So I click on "I recently changed hardware on this device". This opens to where I can select the device
 and then press activate. (Below the listed device it says "To Be Filled By O.E.M.). So I select the device and click activate, and it says "Unable to activate Windows" "We can't reactivate Windows on this device. Try again later".</p>
<p>The device is the one with which I used Windows 10 before the hardware change, and I have my digital license linked to my Microsoft Account, as advised in the guides on the subject. I couldn't contact custom support in my country (Germany), so I'm asking
 here. Help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Last resort is to contact support.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)

            Since you have changed your motherboard, this is a hardware change.
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />For problems in activation, you can also reach out to Microsoft Support for activation help. They can work with you on this to resolve activation issues.
<br />
<br />By Live Agent Chat - <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need to verify whether it is OEM or Retail or Volume and other details, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter

            Hi TheGman2332 
<br />
<br />Since your Windows version is retail, that doesl have transfer rights to a new morherboard or PC
<br />
<br />That troubleshooter rarely works, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support on a weekday and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10
<br />

            This is a Retail license. You can chat with MS Support to get this activated.

<p>Thank you for your help so far.</p>
<p>I have just talked with MS Support and they told me that, since I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8 on my old pc, I need that Windows 8 license. Where can I find that Windows 8 license if I lost it?</p>

            Did you let them know that you had got your Windows license linked to your MS account prior to hardware change? If you had done this, you don't require previous license.
