<h2>            Office 365 Groups - MAC &#47; OWA &#47; WIN Client</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>We got a little usability problem.<br />
<br />
Soon our Company changes to Mac Mini's.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a&nbsp;<strong>very important</strong> feature missing in two of three clients. Or I am just too stupid to see it :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But sadly, when I want to Mail FROM a Group, you can set it in the Administration. That's fine, and works too!<br />
Therefore it only works on a Windows Client version, not even in the official OWA !!! Which is really a huge failure to use the feature as a thought of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why isn't there yet an option after so long time? Or can you tell me when is that planned to work?<br />
How do I handle a Group Mail which you cannot send in the official applications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really need it <strong>NOW</strong>, else its a killer feature to go to another service like ZenDesk to organize a Mailgroup for Clients which would be not satisfying as an O365 User (who don't want third-party applications).<br />
<br />
Maybe I just oversee something?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to your answers.<br />
Greetings MOHji</p>

<p>Hello MOHji,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mentioned is send as or send on behalf of an Office 365 groups in Outlook Web App and Outlook for mac, for Outlook Web App, you may refer to this article to see if it helps:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-email-from-or-on-behalf-of-an-Office-365-group-0f4964af-aec6-484b-a65c-0434df8cdb6b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Send email from or on behalf of an Office 365 group</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for Outlook for Mac, according to my test, it is not available to send from an Office 365 group, this feature is available currently on Outlook for Windows and Outlook for Web App: &nbsp;<a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1947825-send-as-office-365-distribution-or-security-group-from-outlook-2016-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1947825-send-as-office-365-distribution-or-security-group-from-outlook-2016-mac</a>

<p>Hey Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. This indeed very helpful.<br />
</p>
<p>That in OWA works wow! :-) didn't&nbsp;think of a right-click to remove the Adress in OWA.
</p>
<p>Well, I'll hope they will add it soon also in Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got another question now for Group mailing.</p>
<p>Now when I send from a Group, the sent mail is in my personal sent emails. Because there are no sent emails in the Group of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to add a "sent mails" in the group or map the folder to some other account / folder?? Because we are a company which needs to look for sent emails often, even to drop it into the local storage for some cases.<br />
<br />
How would you do this in a shared Group?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi MOHji,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for my late response, I have tried several times, however, havenâ€™t found any efficient way to leave a copy of sent email to Group mailbox, or share this folder to other users. I think you can also submit
 this feedback on Office 365 User Voice. As a work around, you can cc or Bcc to group when you sending from this group, this messages will be received Group Inbox. Your time and understanding are highly appreciated.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

                    <p>I have lost an Outlook Local Folder Subfolder. &nbsp;I suspect it got moved into some other subfolder. &nbsp;The Move button says it is still somewhere. &nbsp;I can move current messages to it. &nbsp;I can search by date and the folder, and the message I moved, shows up in

<p>
</p><p>How do I find a folder inside a folder? &nbsp;Can I do it through Raw Query? &nbsp;I can't find the command or syntax.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, there is a folder existing in Outlook as you could move emails to the folder, but you cannot find it in Outlook as you do not know the detailed location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please right click on an email&gt; choose "move"&gt; click "Choose Folder..."&gt; in the search box, type the folder name, and the detailed location of the folder would appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e666c8a-9c23-4e5e-9744-eaade6e43e0a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e666c8a-9c23-4e5e-9744-eaade6e43e0a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please capture a screenshot of the result when you search the folder if it still could not be found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

            <p>When indents change unexpectedly in a numbered or bulleted list, you have to verify that they have been set up properly. Click in the first level 1 item of the list and then click Home tab | Multilevel List | Define New Multilevel List (although the "new"
 part is misleading). Adjust the settings in the "Position" area as desired. You may have to click the More button&nbsp;to see all options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The safest approach (but it may also be a bit time-consuming) is to carefully recreate numbering, making sure that it is attached to paragraph styles (one for each numbering level). See the article at

<p>
</p><p>Note that the article makes use of the built-in headings, but you should use other, nonheading styles for your list (unless you are creating numbered headings of course).</p>

<h2>            Outlook&#58; FileDialog object error</h2>
                    <p>Am writing a small routine in Outlook 2010 vba. Intension routine is for users&nbsp;to select the location (folder) where they want to save selected messages. To do the job I I want to use the FileDialog object. The routine looks:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public Sub ....<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fdFolder As Office.FileDialog<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set fdFolder = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)<br />
...............<br />
End Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an error on row: Set fdFolder .....</p>
<p>(Runtime error 438. Object doesn't support this property or method)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reference to Office Object Library is ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is wrong?</p>

<h2>            Saving one drive photos to micro SD card storage rather than phone storage &#40;Lumia 640XL&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 640XL with 8GB memory and a 64G Micro SD card (Sandisk Class 10). I have initially had trouble with the card and have ha dto re-set and re-format so hopefully that'll do the trick though that is not what my question is about. My issue is that
 now I wish to move photos from one drive to the micro SD card. On the phone options in settings I go to Storage Sense and choose 'store new photos on my SD card'.&nbsp; Now my issue is it seems that any photo I download is saving to both the phone and SD card,
 including one drive saved photos. This is a real issue given that the phone memory is very small and I only have just over 1G free as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I've looked around without success on this matter on how to ensure that photos are only saved on the SD card, including with the saved one drive photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Parvinder</p>

            <p>Thanks Francis96,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had re-formatted the SD card again (I did initially on the PC and the second time on the phone) and now it works fine.</p>
<p>With download I meant I had also backed up the photos to my PC HDD as I thought that'll work faster to download rather than using one drive where I do not have a 'select all' option (at least as far as the one drive on the phone is concerned). As it is I
 have rather given up on downloading my photos-It is all on the cloud anyway.</p>

<h2>            Not able to send Emails with attachment. Error message &#34;The message can&#39;t be sent right now. Try again later&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook just updated itself in the past few days. I am able to send and receive emails okay, but today I need to send an email with an attachment and it won't let me do it. (Attachment is only 141 KB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error message pops up (with a cute sounding bell sound...) saying: "Couldn't send the following message." When I click on that, it shows me my email with this message: "Error: The message can't be sent right now. Try again later." Well, I have tried again
 and again and later, and it will not send. In between time I have composed regular emails and send them without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 8.1 and Chrome as browser. Can we return to the old Outlook??? I never had issues EVER before this new design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a time-sensitive attachment that NEEDS to go out! I am tempted to shut down my hotmail and open another gmail account!!!!</p>

            <p>I figured out it is not necessarily the attachment, the issue is in the group messaging. I sent a regular email to my church group (no attachment) and there was an error with it. When
 I clicked on the group, I noticed that all the members had duplicates -- one had an email address and the duplicate did not. When I deleted the duplicates without email addresses, the message sent. I tried the same message to the band group I tried to email
 the attachment to last night, and, again, duplicate entries under the Outlook People. When I deleted the entries containing no email address, the message sent with the attachment...</p>

<h2>            how can I convert tables in PDF document to tables in Word correctly</h2>
                    
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<p>The PDF documents contain tables. I tried Adobe Acrobat Professional 9, NitroPDF, PDFZilla, PDF 2 Word 3.0, PDFZilla, BCL easyConverter Desktop 1.0 for the conversion from PDF to MS-Word, but the tables in the converted Word documents are not actual tables
 in Word, but as merged cells so if I want to insert text in them it throws the content in the following cells out of alignment.<br />
<br />
How can I convert the tables in the PDF document to actual tables in MS-Word which expand when text is inserted in the table rows?</p>
<p>Is there a way in Word 2007 I can do some sort of import of the PDF document which can achieve what I need?</p>

<p>NO.</p>
<p>Extracting contents from PDF's, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), is a very rough affair.&nbsp; Unless your data is extremely homogenous, the process of extracting and converting to Word tables is long and messy.</p>
<p>You will have to find one of the tools you mentioned, or some other, that does an acceptably accurate job of extracting the text from PDF.</p>
<p>When you have the text you will have to do some "masaging" to get the data into a form that you like. Use find/replace to get rid of some characters and some manual cut and paste. For example, if the extract tool tries to recreate the table look by inserting
 dashes for the horizontal lines, you will have to get rid of them at some point.</p>
<p>Finally, you will have to do&nbsp;Convert text to table. Actually, you'll find that you have to do it several times, back and forth before you get the data in all the right cells.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>The data in PDF is not scanned so it is not much OCR processing. It is populated by a Coldfusion/Flex system. Yes, the process is long so thought one of those tools would do it quicker, but none of them handle the tables correctly.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<b><span>Set your Junk email filtering level to Exclusive.
</span></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you set your filter to this, only messages from your contacts and safe senderâ€™s lists will be allowed to go to your Inbox,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 the rest will go to your Junk Folder</span><span>.&nbsp;Here are the&nbsp;steps to setup your junk e-mail filter in Hotmail:</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>1. Sign in to
</span><a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">https://mail.live.com</font></span></a><span> using your Microsoft account.</span></span><span><br />
2. In the upper-right corner of your Inbox, click the <strong>Cog icon</strong><font>, and then
<b>More mail settings</b>.</font><font> <br />
3. Under <b>Preventing junk email</b>, click <b>Filters and reporting</b>. <br />

</p>
<p>
<b><span>Notes</span></b><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>You should occasionally check your junk email folder to make sure that good messages are not sent there by mistake.
</span></li><li>
<span>Your Junk folder is regularly cleaned up. So you need not to delete those emails manually.</span><font>
</font></li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b><span>Create an email rule that will filter junk emails.</span></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>You can create an email rule that will either automatically delete the junk message or move to another folder. Here are the steps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>1. Sign in to </span>
<a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">https://mail.live.com</font></span></a><span> using your Microsoft account.<br />
2. In the upper-right corner of your Inbox, click the <strong>Cog icon</strong><font>, and then
<b>More mail settings</b>. <br />
3. Under <b>Customizing Hotmail</b>, click <b>Rules for sorting new messages</b>.
<br />
4. Click <b>New</b>. <br />
5. Under Step 1, select the email attribute from the drop-down list and type the email address that you want to apply the rule to.
<br />
6. Under Step 2, determine where you want the messages to be moved or what you want to do to that email (e.g. if it would be auto Deleted):</font></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><font>1.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To move the messages to an existing folder, choose
<font><b>Move to Inbox</b>, and then click the folder name </font></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><font>2.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To move the messages to a new folder, choose
<font><b>Move to a new folder</b> and type the name for the folder you want to create.
</font></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><font>3.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To delete the messages, choose
<font><b>Delete these messages</b>. </font></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><font>4.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To forward messages, select
<font><b>forward messages</b> and type the email address where you wish to forward the said emails.
</font></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span><font>5.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<font><b>Save</b>.</font></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b><span>Note</span></b><span>: In an instance where the spammer just changes the domain (sending email address), it would be better if you would
 create an email rule that will specify the <font><b>subject </b>instead of the sender's&nbsp;email address. (e.g. If the email contains the word "Viagra", delete the email).</font></span></p>

            That is truly a pathetic and lame excuse on Microsoft's part to not allow blocking of the Yahoo Domain. The issues are many, but the main one that comes to mind is Microsoft's inability to prevent viruses from disrupting Windows, and then not allowing anyone to block the major culprits? That's akin to giving a life-time failure warranty on parachutes! DOH! I am so glad I use Linux.... But I'd still like to block yahoo, just so I don't have to waste my time deleting the ****!

<p>My new Lumia 950xl with windows 10 makes a headset blue tooth connection to my car. however, I can no longer answer calls via the cars in built buttons, or see a display of the mobile signal on the cars screen. This used to be possible.</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating the phone software, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.&nbsp; Performing a soft reset is the same as pulling out the
 battery. It will not delete anything from your device.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Attachments</h2>
                    In the past few weeks I have been unable to open attachments on my Samsung Galaxy Phone. I have a Hotmail account. I do not have a problem on the computer only with the phone. I am able to send attachments and forward them to another email account to open.
 Why is is only the Hotmail account on my phone a problem?

    <title>Password Policies for Live Accounts and for life in general - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sl881  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password Policies for Live Accounts and for life in general</h2>
                    <p>Why do we have such a complex password policy? Let's think about it.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Password Complexity </strong>is created because of the traditional "dictionary" attacks. You want your password to be sufficiently complex such that it does not normally appear in an attacker's dictionary.
<ul>
<li>But let's think about that for a minute. We have existing mechanisms to prevent dictionary attacks! Account lockouts, retry blockouts, captchas and even dynamic IP address filtering to stop dictionary attacks.</li><li>Even with "complex" passwords, it is human nature to simply replaces the "a"s with "@"s, and "I"'s with 1 or ! in what is otherwise a perfectly legitimate alphabet-based word... eg: password turns into
p@$$w0rd JUST to fit in with the policy.... seriously this is NOT really hard to guess at all, and we all do it!... and all dictionary attackers knows this anyway, therefore many of these permutations are already built into the
 attack script, defeating the purpose of "complex" passwords in the first place. Which reverts to the above point to protect us!</li><li>Forcing people to have a complex password is a bit like saying "we the service provider is too lazy to implement safeguards against dictionary attacks, so we'd rather make your life more difficult to make ours easier."... My question to people who think
 like that is: Why do you have a JOB? And HOW do you even justify a salary and sleep at night?</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Password Expiry </strong>policies - Why do we have this? I suspect for the same reason why Credit Cards have an expiry date on them. But again, what does it really achieve in an online security world?
<ul>
<li>Firstly, lets assume that it is not the service provider's responsibility to insure against the user's stupidity. Let's assume for a minute that users are actually not the mindless idiots we assume them to be, and that they, can ACTUALLY understand the
 fact that they should NOT be handing out their passwords to everyone who asks for it.</li><li>A password is meant to be easy to remember. A user is meant to remember, instinctively, what the password for a particular service is. They should not have to maintain a massive list of cryptic passwords just because different providers have different expiry
 periods, or simply have different expiry dates due to the fact they were signed up at different times. More often than not, users simply append a digit to the end of their usual password to suit such a policy. Therefore
p@$$w0rd becomes p@$$w0rd1 .. and
p@$$w0rd2... and so on so forth. Now when you have a number of services with such a theme of password, and given 3 attempts to "guess" what number you're up to, the legitimate user is essentially dictionary-attacking their own
 password!</li><li>It makes FAR more sense to allow the user to nominate their own password, and stick to it! Even if it is months, or even years old! Let's face it, we all have online services everywhere. We don't always have to manually login because we tick the "Remember
 Me" box. But once in a while, when we travel or get issued with a new computer, all hell breaks loose. A password is a secret that the user remembers, and it should not be an arbitrarily forced mutation of that secret. It's a bit like asking your first pet's
 name, except it isn't...&nbsp;now lets see, it is probably somewhere between Fluffy12 and Fluffy37... but which is it? Oops I've only got 5 guesses, I've locked out my own account</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li><strong>[X] Number of Previously Used Passwords </strong>prevention - Why are we stopping people from using their previously used passwords? Actually, why would people WANT to use their previous passwords in the first place?
<ul>
<li>People go back to the password they're familiar with because it's what they WANT to use! It's what they remember!! A password is to identify a person! If that's how they want to be identified, what gives ANYONE else the right to tell them otherwise? If
 they want their password to be "password" or "abc123", SO BE IT! Let them!&nbsp;I've said this earlier - It is NOT the service provider's responsibility to insure users against their own stupidity! They know what the risks are, they know if they use easily guessable
 words like their first name it will make their account less secure, and they have made a conscious decision to USE that word. Who knows, in some kind of twisted logic, that actually makes sense! "Nah, nobody's dumb enough to put their own username as their
 password".... Could happen! It's not up to admins to impose their own mindset onto users!</li><li>In today's era of multiple mobile devices, it is very likely that a user's password to a certain service is stored on multiple places. By not allowing users to use the same password they've previously used, you are effectively forcing the user to change
 their passwords on all those devices. And yes some people will be compelled to respond with "that's EXACTLY what we want to do!". But again, each of those devices have their own password safeguard mechanism. The device themselves are security/biometrically
 locked! Plus, no self-respecting app developer will place no effort into securely storing that password, particularly when that password is used with a large cloud service such as Google or Live, the service providers themselves impose a level of security
 such as OAuth such that the passwords aren't actually stored on the device itself. In other words, admins are forcing people to change their passwords based on an unfounded, perceived breach of security which didn't exist in the first place! All you're achieving
 is pissing the users off and annoying them for no arguably logical reason! which is it? Oops I've only got 5 guesses, I've locked out my own account!</li><li>Using the same previous password despite resetting or "Forgotten" it is perfectly legitimate also! If a user has a number of commonly used passwords and they've exhausted their guesses (based on typos or incorrectly assuming the appended number to a password)
 and locked themselves out. Chances are, once given access back to their account, they will revert to one of those commonly used passwords and there's a chance that it was the same one just prior to their password reset. If it makes sense to the user, why are
 we stopping them from it? Why be evil when there is no need for it?</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li><strong>Predefined "Secret" Questions </strong>- This sounds like a good idea in theory. But when a "secret question" is pre-defined, even if there's a few to choose from, don't be surprised that it doesn't always yield the same answer
 from the same legitimate user! And definitely not when you impose a minimum character limit to some of these questions
<ul>
<li>For example.&nbsp;My mother's maiden name is 3 letters long. This is often rejected as a secret answer because most systems needs it to be at least 5 or 6 characters long. Why ask me a question when you're going to reject the answer?? So that you know, in some
 cultures it is perfectly normal to have single syllable, or even single lettered names. It could even be an unpronounceable&nbsp;symbol in the case of the artist formerly known as Prince! If you're going to ask the question, accept weird answers!</li><li>Questions like the name of my first pet - Well I had a pet at home. It wasn't *MY* first pet, it was my&nbsp;brother's pet, although he never played with it, and I spent more time with it than he ever did. I didn't have my own pet until a few years later but
 it died after 2 days and I didn't think much of it. But for all intensive purposes, I remembered my brother's pet vividly as my&nbsp;first pet so I've put that as my secret answer. Ask me the same secret&nbsp;question a few years later for password recover? - heck,
 did I put my brother's pet or my own pet? or did I put the first pet I owned with my girlfriend as my first pet?? See how easy it is to blur your own secret answer when the question itself is vague? However if I was allowed to define my own secret question:
 "The name of MY first pet which didn't come in a fishbowl" ..... with enough details for my future self to know what I've previously answered - that could work.</li><li>Or a list of questions that may not apply to a user at all - My mother's kept her maiden name, everybody knows it, so that's no secret anymore, I've never had a pet, all my friends went to the same primary school as I did, and they were all there when I
 got my first car, I've publicly talked about my first job and my boss on social media and my first girlfriend made our breakup very public on a blog&nbsp;so even people I've never heard of knows her name and mine,&nbsp;there goes the entire list of predefined secret
 questions, what else can I do? Hint: This would be a good time to let the users define a question that makes sense to them and themselves alone!</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I urge developers, admins and so-called security experts of the world, think for a moment not about what you concoct in your mind to be some kind of secure design to ease your own paranoid minds, but deal with the issue of security with a balance of probability
 and real-life practicality in the systems you create. <br />
<br />
And have mechanisms to safeguard a user's security without compromising on usability, such as alternate email addresses and password recovery/reset mechanisms, user-defined secret questions, and brute-force attack preventions. And above all, let the users choose
 the level of security they desire! Some might indeed want convoluted password policies to insure against their own stupidity. But for everyone else, at least give them the CHOICE of opting out of such convoluted systems.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Let me try arguing with you about the points that you've made, but I'm not sure if you're mostly referring to Microsoft's services, or other services.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Password Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Have you tried signing up a Microsoft Account that has p@$$w0rd&nbsp;as the password?&nbsp;I did, and was told that I need to choose a password that's harder to guess. That means that the 'common' passwords that&nbsp;are replaced by symbols&nbsp;are actually blocked, so you
 really have to type in a proper and a complex password. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you said is true, there are now multitudes of security features that prevent dictionary attacks to work. So why&nbsp;do you still need a proper and complex password? Because it can still be guessed without any hacking tools. That's the point, you don't want
 the password to be guessed by anyone else. If you use "california" for example as a password, someone will be able to guess that. But what if it's "California"? Just one capital, still easy to guess, however now there's 'two' possible options as to what your
 possible password is? Now what if you mixed it up with the characters, symbols and numbers? Cal!forn1a, californ!a, C@l!f0rn!a, c@lif0rnia, etc. That made it really&nbsp;hard for your password to be guessed, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email providers 'forcing' you to use a complex password to make it easier for them? I can understand that. They don't want to help someone whose at fault of using 'password' as their password, and getting their accounts stolen and blaming the provider due
 to lousy security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Password Expiry</strong></p>
<p>On Microsoft Accounts, there's no password expiry. You can set it up to expire though, by ticking the checkbox of "Make me change my password every 72 days". But that doesn't apply to very old accounts that doesn't meet the password requirement, thus being
 asked to change the password to meet the current requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your scenario ASSUMES that everyone's not 'stupid'. But believe&nbsp;me, try working&nbsp;in a call center industry, and you'll understand why this is needed. You'll be surprised how 'stupid' people can be.
<em>Here's a quick example, a customer wants to access his husband's&nbsp;account because she doesn't know the password. She can contact her husband for proof of ownership, just in case. So I offered to reset the password, but she freaked out, saying his husband
 will kill her if she changed his password. Ended the session. Then, why didn't she just called her husband what his password is?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand why this policy is implemented, because the more you use your password, the more 'footprints' it leaves. What this means is that, if you use a single password all the time, someone will eventually know about it. How? It just happens. From
 mistakes, example is typing in your password on the User name field,, or others, like sharing the password because your friend needs to borrow your account, logging in from another computer, etc. Somehow or another, your password will be known if you keep
 using it too many times, so it's safer to change it every now and then. Losing an email account&nbsp;is a risk that I'm not willing to take, to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do admit that I also use a&nbsp;"Remember Me" option for my&nbsp;accounts, and yes it's going to be hard when using another computer, but what I did is&nbsp;I made a list of my passwords offline and online, and I always remember my 'recovery email' for all other accounts.
 &nbsp;If my passwords didn't work, I have an option of recovering the accounts, resetting it to a new one. There's not goingbe a 'universal' password for multiple accounts, but password managers can do that for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>[X] Number of Previously Used Passwords</strong></p>
<p>The logic is that : If someone had changed the password because it was stolen, or had been borrowed, the system will make sure that you won't repeat the same password, because they still know that old one. What would be the point of 'changing' your password,
 if you're sticking with the same one? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Security IS&nbsp;the responsibility of the service provider. &nbsp;They know that users will be using this account for personal or business purposes, sensitive information is used on the account, and so on. I think you're saying that it's the user's fault for letting
 the account be hacked due to an easy password. But we're not living in a 'perfect' world that users will accept that responsibility. Humans are stubborn, in a way that they know that it's their fault, but they won't admit it, and blame someone else. And that
 someone else is the provider. They are the ones responsible for providing this service, so they will be the one who will be blamed if something happens to the account. That mindset can lead to legal actions, which costs money. Now these providers has to take
 a step to 'guide' the users, helping the provider as well as themselves for the security of the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, there's not really a way to use a unified password for all your accounts, simply because the database of all sites are not shared. But, providers are already working on ways to 'unify' it. For example, you can use your Facebook account to sign
 in to other sites, "Sign in using Facebook". So technically, you have your Facebook account as the login credentials, so you just need to remember that username and password. Microsoft has it's own version, as all Microsoft Services like Outlook, OneDrive,
 XBOX, Office, Windows, Skype, Microsoft Store, etc. uses a single Microsoft Account as the login. So accessing all these services using one username and password. They're already working on these, so we just have to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also admit that when I forgot the password and reset it, I want to use the old one that I remember when I attempted to login. However, that can 'conflict' with the primary reason why you can't use the password anymore, because you've already used it on
 the account, and someone might have already know this password. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;4. </strong><strong>Predefined "Secret" Questions </strong></p>
<p>Microsoft had such security questions before, but obviously from what you pointed out, it has already been removed on the system. The simple reason why this has been removed because : The answer may be known by your family member or your friend. They know
 you, so they may be able to answer the question, getting your account stolen. Maybe not stolen, but being used without you knowing about it. It got removed, and I completely agree that security questions shouldn't be implemented in any service at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But all in all, passwords ARE OBSOLETE in my opinion. If you read about it&nbsp;in MSN News before, the US government&nbsp;is actually looking for an alternative for passwords, because millions of dollars&nbsp;are lost due to stolen accounts. Even with advanced security
 protection, hackers can steal passwords through other means, like virus and malware&nbsp;infections, and scams, which providers can do nothing about. By replacing password protection&nbsp;with other means like biometrics, those can't be 'stolen' therefore, you have
 a fully secure way for your accounts that only you can access.</p>

 possible password is? Now what if you mixed it up with the characters, symbols and numbers? Cal!forn1a, californ!a, C@l!f0rn!a, c@lif0rnia, etc. That made it really&nbsp;hard for your password to be guessed, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email providers 'forcing' you to use a complex password to make it easier for them? I can understand that. They don't want to help someone whose at fault of using 'password' as their password, and getting their accounts stolen and blaming the provider due
 to lousy security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Password Expiry</strong></p>
<p>On Microsoft Accounts, there's no password expiry. You can set it up to expire though, by ticking the checkbox of "Make me change my password every 72 days". But that doesn't apply to very old accounts that doesn't meet the password requirement, thus being
 asked to change the password to meet the current requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your scenario ASSUMES that everyone's not 'stupid'. But believe&nbsp;me, try working&nbsp;in a call center industry, and you'll understand why this is needed. You'll be surprised how 'stupid' people can be.
<em>Here's a quick example, a customer wants to access his husband's&nbsp;account because she doesn't know the password. She can contact her husband for proof of ownership, just in case. So I offered to reset the password, but she freaked out, saying his husband
 will kill her if she changed his password. Ended the session. Then, why didn't she just called her husband what his password is?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand why this policy is implemented, because the more you use your password, the more 'footprints' it leaves. What this means is that, if you use a single password all the time, someone will eventually know about it. How? It just happens. From
 mistakes, example is typing in your password on the User name field,, or others, like sharing the password because your friend needs to borrow your account, logging in from another computer, etc. Somehow or another, your password will be known if you keep
 using it too many times, so it's safer to change it every now and then. Losing an email account&nbsp;is a risk that I'm not willing to take, to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do admit that I also use a&nbsp;"Remember Me" option for my&nbsp;accounts, and yes it's going to be hard when using another computer, but what I did is&nbsp;I made a list of my passwords offline and online, and I always remember my 'recovery email' for all other accounts.
 &nbsp;If my passwords didn't work, I have an option of recovering the accounts, resetting it to a new one. There's not goingbe a 'universal' password for multiple accounts, but password managers can do that for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>[X] Number of Previously Used Passwords</strong></p>
<p>The logic is that : If someone had changed the password because it was stolen, or had been borrowed, the system will make sure that you won't repeat the same password, because they still know that old one. What would be the point of 'changing' your password,
 if you're sticking with the same one? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Security IS&nbsp;the responsibility of the service provider. &nbsp;They know that users will be using this account for personal or business purposes, sensitive information is used on the account, and so on. I think you're saying that it's the user's fault for letting
 the account be hacked due to an easy password. But we're not living in a 'perfect' world that users will accept that responsibility. Humans are stubborn, in a way that they know that it's their fault, but they won't admit it, and blame someone else. And that
 someone else is the provider. They are the ones responsible for providing this service, so they will be the one who will be blamed if something happens to the account. That mindset can lead to legal actions, which costs money. Now these providers has to take
 a step to 'guide' the users, helping the provider as well as themselves for the security of the account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, there's not really a way to use a unified password for all your accounts, simply because the database of all sites are not shared. But, providers are already working on ways to 'unify' it. For example, you can use your Facebook account to sign
 in to other sites, "Sign in using Facebook". So technically, you have your Facebook account as the login credentials, so you just need to remember that username and password. Microsoft has it's own version, as all Microsoft Services like Outlook, OneDrive,
 XBOX, Office, Windows, Skype, Microsoft Store, etc. uses a single Microsoft Account as the login. So accessing all these services using one username and password. They're already working on these, so we just have to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also admit that when I forgot the password and reset it, I want to use the old one that I remember when I attempted to login. However, that can 'conflict' with the primary reason why you can't use the password anymore, because you've already used it on
 the account, and someone might have already know this password. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;4. </strong><strong>Predefined "Secret" Questions </strong></p>
<p>Microsoft had such security questions before, but obviously from what you pointed out, it has already been removed on the system. The simple reason why this has been removed because : The answer may be known by your family member or your friend. They know
 you, so they may be able to answer the question, getting your account stolen. Maybe not stolen, but being used without you knowing about it. It got removed, and I completely agree that security questions shouldn't be implemented in any service at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But all in all, passwords ARE OBSOLETE in my opinion. If you read about it&nbsp;in MSN News before, the US government&nbsp;is actually looking for an alternative for passwords, because millions of dollars&nbsp;are lost due to stolen accounts. Even with advanced security
 protection, hackers can steal passwords through other means, like virus and malware&nbsp;infections, and scams, which providers can do nothing about. By replacing password protection&nbsp;with other means like biometrics, those can't be 'stolen' therefore, you have
 a fully secure way for your accounts that only you can access.</p>

<p>This is a fine and civilized response, however, it still does not give me the instructions on how to get my password reset.&nbsp; I have completed the "questionnaire" twice in full, I have been caught in cyclical questions and sites, but I have not been able
 to get past the barriers and simply give myself a really comfortable and easily recalled new password that is mine alone.&nbsp; I am sure there are algorithms</p>
<p>that will discover the letters, characters and numbers in my password, so I have subscribed to changes often.</p>

            <p>The inherent problem I have with all of these, is that all the justification behind these policies are thought up from an IT developer's perspective. With little or no regard from the user's perspective, or what we call the real world.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Password Complexity </strong>- As for "Guessing" of password, it is still a dictionary attack, except it's manual. Where the assailant knows the victim, this just helps you narrow it down to some keywords like the person's name, family members, etc.
 but the word could still be ANY of those topics. The word "california" still cannot be guessed without any context! I can tell you right now, my normal password is all lower case, is a word in the English dictionary. I'll even narrow it for you, it's in the
 bible, many many times! Go on, guess my password! Where do you even begin? You can't! Even if you knew me personally, that word has nothing to do with where I live, who I know, what I do and when I was born. And oh, I'm an athiest - so looking up the bible
 wouldn't be your first guess anyway. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this scenario, you will end up essentially with a manual dictionary attack - guessing all kinds of random words that you may associate with me as a person - it's still a dictionary attack nonetheless. In which case these can be easily defeated by the
 software vendor by imposing incremental minimum time delays between each "guess". eg: guess a password wrong 5 times, you're not allow to guess the 6th one for 5 minutes. Get the 6th one wrong, you're blocked for 15 minutes. Get that wrong again, you're blocked
 out for 4 hours... etc.. After the initial few failed attempts, software responds to the attacker that an email have been sent to the victim to advise someone is attempting to access the account, alerting them to the situation. If it's a genuine access, the
 user would just ignore that email. But this generally stops the attack right there because attackers always want to work in the shadows. Once the account owner knows someone is trying to guess their password, they can then take additional steps to secure their
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Password Expiry -&nbsp;</strong>Yes users make mistakes, and I have worked in a call centre too so I know how some people can get. In your example:&nbsp;<em>a customer wants to access his husband's&nbsp;account because she doesn't know the password.
 She can contact her husband for proof of ownership, just in case. So I offered to reset the password, but she freaked out, saying his husband will kill her if she changed his password. Ended the session. Then, why didn't she just called her husband what his
 password is?&nbsp;<strong>- </strong></em>Have you considered that she freaked out not because she wasn't meant to access her husband's account, but her husband actually has NO desire to change the password because that would now create an account that he now cannot
 remember the password to? For the exact same reasons that I'm stating here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of these are legitimate requests - eg: the wife needs to deal with an insurance issue at home and the policy details were emailed to the Husband, husband is too busy at work to plough through his emails to find the policy so he delegates it to his wife,
 however he can spend a minute of his life providing proof of ownership. It's not inconceivable, and it is not up to you to judge. That said, no you're not supposed to hand out passwords, but how is any of this relevant to enforcing a password expiry? If the
 user compromised their password either by giving it out or typing it many times in front of someone, it is their responsibility to either change it, or accept the risk that someone may now use it. If their account was compromised because someone else had the
 password, how is that the software provider's problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole article is about choice. Whenever a software imposes a restriction - of ANY kind, you are effectively taking CHOICE away from the user. And that creates a negative experience. Security is the justification but security is also meant to be a CHOICE....because
 some customers choose convenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>[X] Number of Previously Used Passwords -&nbsp;</strong>See? Again, the techs have already assumed the reason behind why someone want to use a previous password. Here's a scenario: Nobody stole my password, I simply can't remember my password
 because of some stupid complexity requirement forcing me to modify my preferred password beyond recognition, now I can't remember it anymore. And the system does not email me my modified complex password, it only forces me to reset it. Eventually I get taken
 to the reset password screen where I see the complexity requirement then I remembered "oh that's how I would have to modify my password to fit that stupid requirement" - only to realise I did the exact same thing and end up with the exact same password I had
 originally forgotten because it tells me I can't reset the new password to be the same as the current one.. But now I am forced to create an even MORE abnormal password YET again, and I'll forget it
<strong>again </strong>because the system is now forcing me to venture further and further away from
<strong>**ME**</strong>.. what <strong>*I AM*</strong> and what <strong>*I USE*</strong> to identify
<strong>*MYSELF*</strong>... thereby repeating the problem the next time I login! And by the next time I have this problem, I really want to use the original modified password cos it's the only one I'll have a chance of remember, but this policy won't let me
 because I've used it 2 passwords ago. Problem repeats. Problem worsens. User is SEVERELY inconvenienced, meanwhile, NOBODY is interested in hacking my account. You do not have a security problem at all, but you now have a very pissed off customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you seeing how the software provider is now CREATING a problem and CONTINUING to worsen it by imposing restrictions based on unfounded assumptions that an IT geek somewhere thought up without any actual statistical research? or a hint of understanding
 from a user's perspective? Just because it's what they thought was a "Primary Reason" behind the policy, that doesn't mean that reason arises at all! This is sheer paranoia in the very definition of the word. If someone is resetting their password because
 it's been compromised, they won't use the same password anyway. But if they know it hasn't been compromised, why force people to use something other than what they're familiar with?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Predefined "Secret" Questions -</strong> Actually this is PRECISELY why you want to let users define their own questions. The typical predefined secret questions are like "Mother's maiden name", or "First school you went to" or "your first
 pet's name".. all of these are generally known to family and close friends. Given the option of defining your own question, I could actually frame a question that only myself would understand, like "Manly Beach" as question. Which in itself is not a question,
 but I myself would instantly recognise that because "I Almost Drowned" there when I was young (and that's the answer). I don't talk about it because it's an emotional scar to me, and if someone just saw that as a question, they wouldn't know what to do with
 it, because it's not an actual question!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst passwords are archaic and outdated, it is the only common denominator to identify a person across all systems, platforms, devices and communication methods, so the world will never be able to get rid of passwords altogether. Truth is, the vast majority
 of password breaches are insider jobs. People who work on systems steal other people's passwords. It is already near impossible in the modern age for an outsider to hack a system, mainly because all the security logic are designed to be server-side. In other
 words, it is still the software provider's responsibility to ensure their internal controls are in place to prevent such an attack. And if people get upset when their passwords are compromised because of a bad vendor, they rightly should be!</p>

            <p>It's mindboggling that the world continues to go crazy with password complexity requirements. Every single time someone's account is compromised generally falls under one of these categories:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Someone leaving their device unlocked, walks away, opportunistic friend posts derogatory self-proclamation on said victim's wall on facebook.</li><li>Unsuspecting users clicking on a phishing email, links to a spoofed login page and inadvertently types in their password to a service in response.</li><li>Someone with detailed inside knowledge of a specific system being targetted, uses this knowledge to retrieve unencrypted/decryptable passwords from the backend database</li></ol>
<p>Password guessing is nearly non-existent these days - no matter how well you know a person, you will never know what word out of their extensive vocabulary they have chosen to use as their password. Of all the people whose passwords I do know, one common
 theme prevails - they choose to use a word that they do not refer to in their daily lives, such as maiden name spelt backwards, or a nickname they've given a cartoon character from their childhood etc... fact is, by the time you incorrectly guess a password
 3 or 4 times, the system either time-locks you from trying more, or sends an email to the account holder advising them of the attempts and that's enough to deter any further guessing.<br />

</p><p>1) I for one grew up on different streets, in different countries too.. So is this asking me the name of the street I grew up on in my earliest childhood memory? (which fades from time to time too), or is this asking for the street I was at when I was born
 (which isn't even in English and I'm not sure the secret answer takes unicode).. or the street which I spent the most time in? And how the heck do I remember which street name I gave when I'm confronted with the same question years in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) First car I drove? or first car I learned to drive on? Many people dont have a "first car"...If there are more than 1 car in the family, you'd learn to drive on whichever one was available. This question makes a terrible assumption that all cultures simply
 buy their child a dedicated car. No, sorry it doesn't work like that, most REAL people share their first car with family/siblings, so again, the ambiguity makes this question impossible to answer in the future</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If you've had more than 1 pet, especially if they're not concurrent, chances are, they are your favourite as at that time. So what happens if you've owned 3 dogs one after another? This is as irresponsible as asking a parent to name their favourite child
 - Sometimes it's possible but other times it's just plain rude.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) ALL holidays are meant to be memorable. Ask a child, they'll probably give you an answer. Ask them again in 3 years time, see if you get the same answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Favourite toy - see #3</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) My most memorable school friend - If we were close, reality tells me I'd have more than 1 nickname for them... Being a secret question, this comes down to what I referred to them as, and whether that nickname even has a proper spelling. How would I know
 in years from now which nickname I nominated on this stupid website and even if I knew, how did I spell it back then? Was it Bobbo? Bobo? Boby? Bobby?... ****!<br />
<br />
7) Most memorable teacher - See #6 - they'd be a memorable teacher cos I hated them. So what did I say was the secret answer when I entered this years ago? Witch? ****? Horriblydisfiguredloudobnoxiousmatriarchofhell?<br />
<br />
8) Favourite park!?!?!? See #4...</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Favourite musician - This almost changes weekly... you want me to give you an answer that I can consistently answer when I eventually need to recover my password? Are you nuts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) Favourite hobby - Who here spent their life growing up to only 1 hobby? Can you reliably name a favourite one?!?<br />
<br />
Point is - these secret questions are all useless.. they do not provide a stable, consistent basis for account/password recovery purposes, all of them may change depending on the time and context at which they were originally answered. The only way this could
 work is if you allowed the user to specify their own question..... Something that is genuinely important to them and they know that they have never shared that secret with anyone else in the past..</p>

<h2>            Registration Message</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 on my laptop as a second user.</p>
<p>This was authorised and checking the original users account confirmed I&nbsp;that the copy was authorised on my laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A few weeks ago a message appeared saying I am using an unauthorised copy and 6 days to register.</p>
<p>After a long telephone call to MS&nbsp;presumably at a premium rate (to the Philippines) the adviser took control of my PC and sorted the issue.</p>
<p>Great, but, this morning the same message appeared! 'unauthorised copy - 6 days to register'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It will not let me follow the registration path from this message and just indicates an error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyone got the same issue?</p>
<p>Help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Installed again (under original account) and the 'unauthorised' message has gone.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/33ff4585-f88b-4a2c-b943-683decb5d0c9" title="Mudtostone">
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the email address of your account, please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Sign in to your account</span></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>
<p>Click your profile picture, or select <strong>Edit Profile</strong> in the Account details section at the bottom of the page.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Scroll down to the Contact details section and click <strong>Add email address</strong>.</p>
<br />

<p>In the box that appears, type your new email address.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the email address you want to change and edit or delete it, then click the green
<strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You canâ€™t delete your primary email address, as there always needs to be one in your Skype profile, so you need to add your preferred email address first before removing the old email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to changing the email address you are using to log in to your account, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Select <strong>Your info</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Manage your sign-in email or phone number</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Add email </strong>or <strong>Add phone number</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions to set up and verify your new alias. If you chose <strong>
Add email</strong>, you have the option to use an email address that you already have, or you can&nbsp;create a new Outlook.com&nbsp;email address.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information above answers your query.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 - How do you STOP and email from sending &#40;it&#39;s not stuck&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In Office for Mac 2011, the Progress Bar would allow you to stop an email from sending - it would put it on hold for a few minutes (viewed just above the bottom bar icons) so you could select it and either delete or edit the email prior to sending again.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Office for Mac 2016's "Stop Sync" (which is the closest I can find to the previous Progress Bar) when I click on the "Stop Send" or the "X", it disappears from Sync, however still goes through (doesn't appear to either edit or delete).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to actually STOP and email before it's been sent? (It's not stuck - found lots on that)</p>

<p>Hello Jfushtey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Once you click the Send button in the Outlook for Mac 2016 client, the email will be sent directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t want to send emails directly, itâ€™s recommend that you click the same icon next to Send and choose Send later. Or, you can save the email message to the Draft folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we also welcome you to share your feedback to our related team via this link:

<p>That's too bad. It was a life saver in 2011. &nbsp;I'm only referring to the odd time where you forget to attach something or realize there's an error. At least you could stop it from going through before.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No. We didn't get any information about releasing this feature in the Outlook for Mac 2016 client. So, it's still recommend that you submit a feedback via the uservoice link. Your cooperation is highly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Problems with Microsoft Word on Windows 8 Acer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cb1989  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Microsoft Word on Windows 8 Acer</h2>
                    I recently purchased a Windows 8 on an Acer system, and I can't make sense of the new text documents. Until recently I had been using Word 2003.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First of all, when I right-click, I'm give the option of choosing either a Text Document, a Microsoft Word Document, or Rich Text Format. What is the difference between a Word Document and Rich Text Format and why do I need both?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I check the Properties of a Word Document, I'm told it is a .docx file...why is not just a .doc?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The inside of the .docx looks like the old Microsoft Word, but File, Home and View are the only options at the top of the screen. Where's Edit, Tools, etc? It also doesn't give me the word count or the spellchecker.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, when I open a Rich Text Document, it looks like the older software, with the word count and the spellcheck available. But when I check the properties of the Rich Text Format, I'm told it is a .rtf format. I've never heard of this before, so I'm wondering
 if people on other, inferior computers would even be able to view it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way I can have all the features of the .rtf in the .docx? And can I turn either of them into a traditional .doc, so people who receive my documents are more likely to read them? I'd also like to know if I can convert these word documents into
 a PDF so the formatting doesn't alter whenever I email them to other types of computers.</div>

<br />
<p>What version of Word are you using? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>,docx is the new default format for Microsoft Word. You don't have to use it. If you want to save a file as .doc, you can do so by going to Save as.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Rtf is a more general format, one that doesn't require Word or some compatible program to read it.; almost everyone can. But .rtf&nbsp; files don't have all the formatting options that .doc or .docx files do.</p>
