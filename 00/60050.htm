<h2>            Display list of operating systems at boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently reinstalled windows 7 through the advanced recovery options in the control panel</p>
<p>but, now when I boot it displays a list of Operating Systems and i says </p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Boot Manager</p>

<p>Earlier version of Windows</p>
<p><strong><u>Windows 7</u></strong></p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Can I delete this&nbsp; </p>
<p>Earlier version of Windows </p>
<p>Option as it is very annoying as I can disable the list of oprating systems but If I press F8 it does not display</p>
<p>any recovery options at boot, which can cause all sorts of problems</p>
<p>Is there a way that I can either make the recovery options display when I press F8 or delete the
</p>
<p>earlier versions of windows option?</p>
<p>Please help</p>

<h2>            Quitting During a game download - can I resume and not lose code&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Quitting During a game download - can I resume and not lose code?</p>
<p>I am doing some work for Santa prior to the big day, but Forza 5 now been downloading for around 3 hours and is only on 55%.</p>
<p>My wife and kids were banned from the house as I did this elves work, but they cant stay out much longer!</p>
<p>If I switch off the xbox one and pack it all away again will the download resume the next time it is plugged back in on Christmas Day?</p>
<p>Obviously I inputted the code to access the DLC game, and would imagine it would not be allowed to be used again.</p>

<p>Many Thanks - Elf Dad</p>

<p>Yes it will, you will not lose anything. Just leave it as it is and the download will resume once you turn the console back on and connect it to the internet.</p>

<p>As everyone has already mentioned, the code has been used so you (or anyone) can't re-use it, but the game you got from the code will forever be tied to your account. &nbsp;You can redownload it anytime you want.*</p>

<p>once it is powered back up, the download will resume as long as you didn't cancel the download. but once you use a code, it is tied to that gamer tag, so you can throw the code away after you use it.</p>
<p>if the download was canceled, just go into games area of the store, find Forza or whatever other games you used a code for, and it should give you the option of install instead of purchase, hit install to start the download again.</p>

<p>Many Thanks to all who took time to reply.</p>
<p>So I guess the game will be tied to my gamertag, and can be downloaded again if ever its lost? I was wondering what would happen there as there is obviously no disc to reinstall.</p>
<p>From what I can see in your replies I just turn off the xbox one and when its powered up and connected to the internet it will carry on?</p>
<p>Many Thanks and Merry Christmas from a relieved elf.</p>

<p>You will always have access to redownload the game later if needed.</p>
<p>And yes, your download will continue when you power it up next, so the work you did today will indeed save time on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>I have a feeling Christmas morning downloads are going to be VERY slow! (Nearly all of us will be downloading something)</p>

I am no expert on Windows 10 but I just read online that Direct X 12 needs a gen 4 CPU. This keeps people who have to use Direct X 11 from being able to get the full power from the new Graphics cards that can use Direct X 12.

            Which generation i5 do you have? I am no expert but I read that you need at least a gen 4 or newer CPU to be able to use Direct X 12. Before my computer got a massive virus it was running Windows 10 but with Direct X 11.2.

<h2>            account permissions with external applications</h2>
                    <p>a few weeks ago, after following the fever of the new game Fornite decided to try it in computed so I linked my xbox account with the profile of Epic Games, the first attempt I redirected to a microsoft page to give permission to the account and continue to play it, when trying to start the session within the game application I miss a link error and now every time I try to link the accounts I skip a legend saying that my xbox account is already linked to another account.<br />I need to know where I manage these permissions that are given to accounts or pages external to Microsoft, in order to deny or allow these permits in the future.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>If you can help me, I'll thank you.</p>

<p>Heya,</p>
<p>I'm clueless as to what's transpired here. A couple of days ago or so I left the computer running and went to sleep. When I hopped on it the next day my Task Bar buttons were gone, Link buttons in the Start Menu like 'My Documents' and 'My Music' no longer
 function at all, and a folder entitled "%LocalAppData% has appeared on my Desktop. Additionally, the 'Show Desktop' button for the Task Bar has disappeared as well, no clue how to restore it.</p>
<p>I'm no programmer in the slightest, code makes me nervous. Worried about all of my wife &amp; I's files and photos, if this is something degenerative to the system.</p>
<p>Can somebody help please?</p>

<p>Yeah, that's kind of out of my league. I'm a bit scared to jack with the system32 stuff like that.</p>
<p>BUT, a few things came up. Noticed more error messages for simple things, and while browsing the internet the little icon on the left of the address bar didn't match whatever website I was on. Also, my wife's account on this computer doesn't seem to be having
 the same troubles. Started looking more into it with all these problems, nearest I could tell my user account on the computer had somehow become corrupt. Found a solution for that here;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p>Everything seems in order now. Have all my files, account works fine, no further issues.</p>
<p>Still don't understand how it happened in the first place.</p>

    <title>Transferring Office 365&#47;Onedrive after death of owner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy vs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Office 365&#47;Onedrive after death of owner</h2>
                    <p>My father recently died. He helpfully left details of his passwords so the family could access his computer files, including his MS office365 personal/onedrive account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now trying to set things up in my mothers name so she can continue to access this info/facilities via her own hotmail email account (for example Dad's office365 personal account is due for annual renewal on 3 Jan 2019 and i would like to transfer this
 into her name/email address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to know is how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to change the email account associated with log in to using the following method (I got this info off the Xbox support page):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Step 1: Add a new&nbsp;<strong>email address</strong>&nbsp;or phone number. Sign in to your&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft account</strong>. ...</li><li>
Step 2:&nbsp;<strong>Set</strong>&nbsp;the new&nbsp;<strong>email address</strong>&nbsp;as your primary alias. ...</li><li>
Step 3: Remove the&nbsp;<strong>email address</strong>&nbsp;you no longer want to use to sign in.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try and put Mum's hotmail account address in it says this address is already associated an account so doesn't seem to let me do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to recap - my ideal solution is to change the email address associated to my fathers microsoft account to my mums hotmail address and have nothing else about the account change, so she can continue to use all the existing saved files and facilities of
 Office 365 using her own login rather than my late fathers. Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy</p>

    <title>Slow Internet after installing Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Slow Internet after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 (clean install) last week. &nbsp;The first day or two Internet access was fine. &nbsp;It is now really slow. &nbsp;It is so slow that sometimes the browser thinks a site isn't responding. &nbsp;My iPad works the same as always.</p>
<p>I have tried suggestions from searching the Web, but the problem still exists. &nbsp;I have the slowest DSL because that's all that's available here. &nbsp;ISP is Century Link. &nbsp;I reinstalled the modem, just in case.</p>
<p>I ran a speed test today and got the following results:</p>
<p>Download speed: 1.61, 1.52, 1.65 Mbps</p>
<p>Upload speed: 0.25 Mbps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??</p>

    <title>System protection for D drive and images - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System protection for D drive and images</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i went into system restore today and noted protection is only turned on for my C drive. My laptop has a pretty small C drive and a large D drive. So I store all of my iTunes media and games etc on the D drive. Also there is another folder which is images.
 this is also turned off. What does the images folder mean? Should I turn on protection for C, D and images? I would hate to lose everything and have a restore of C, which contains none of my programmes, media etc.....I did chat with someone on support, but
 not entirely convinced with their answer as they had to refer to their "resources" they said that it should really only be on for C drive unless I really wanted to turn it on for D....</p>

            <p>I feel you are mixing up Windows System Protection with a backup. Windows System Protection is basically System Restore and is designed to backup System Files and Settings, so if your system breaks you can restore to a point in time when your system worked.
 Even if all your files were on your C drive and protection was enabled on that drive, your files would not be protected</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thanks for your prompt response. Do you fancy working for windows?! 😂 None of this was explained to me during my chat even when I repeatedly said I didn't want to risk losing my programs. So basically there is no need to turn it on for drive D then, as
 it won't really back up my games and media.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yeah ! Drag and Copy. I don't copy the whole folder in one go though. I make a folder of the same name</p>
<p>as my main game folder on the external drive and then copy the games in groups into that folder.
</p>
<p>I like to keep it down to around 50+ GB per copy.&nbsp; This way if something goes wrong with one session</p>
<p>you have less to do over .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games and software have registry entries in Windows, so as long as you are still running the same</p>
<p>Windows install as you were when you copied the games they will still run if you need to copy them</p>
<p>back to a new HDD.&nbsp; As long as the Drive Letter/file path matches your shortcuts the games will be good to go</p>
<p>( I use the same name for the external drive as the original, but add it's original Drive Letter in parentheses as</p>
<p>a reminder). </p>
<p>( btw - My Win10 goes back to 2010 via Win7. Most of my disk based games were installed on Win7</p>
<p>in the first few months of '10 ).</p>

<h2>            Is the iPhone 6 compatible with the Surface Pro 6 as a personal hotspot&#63;</h2>
                    I have an old iPhone (iPhone 6) and a new Surface Pro 6. I cannot get the iPhone to work as an internet hotspot for the Surface Pro; it doesn't show up as a wi-fi connection, I get a message on the phone that the device is not supported when I try to connect
 to the Surface Pro's Bluetooth, and it doesn't show us as a USB internet connection. Is there a fix?

            Yes, I have been using my iPhone 6 as a hotspot with an older computer for almost a year now. I'm concerned that the newer Microsoft computer is new enough that it's not compatible with the older iPhone.

<p>OK, I just set my iPhone X up with Bluetooth to my desktop system.&nbsp; So which part of the setup is not working with the SP6?&nbsp; By the way, I don't have an SP6 ..&nbsp; but there is a forum for those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember correctly, the SP6 has a no name type Bluetooth adapter.&nbsp; The iPhone 6 may be older but the OS is continually updated so I would guess it should work fine, but you are the expert.</p>

            It might be a problem with my phone's Bluetooth then? When I go to pair it through the phone, I get a message saying "device unsupported." When I try to pair it through the SP6, it sometimes picks up on the iPhone, but still doesn't pair with it. It will
 try for a while and then stop.

<p>It can get confusing when you refer to a procedure being used since it may be different and had to see those differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system, in Win 10, I went to the Settings-Devices-Bluetooth page.&nbsp; I selected add a Bluetooth device and chose the first option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone was already on the Bluetooth devices page and the computer popped up a message with the number which also showed on the phone at the same time.&nbsp; When I verified the number the iPhone paired and connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't get it to work using Bluetooth, will it work using Wi-Fi?&nbsp; Also, make sure the Bluetooth is turned on for the iPhone.&nbsp; I will disable mine I forget I had done so.<br />
</p>
<p>Maybe these folks will know..</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern. Based on the information that you provided it appears that tweaking the registry gave you the ability to use the briefcase software properly. You can always use a cloud storage using Onedrive in Windows 10. However, if
 you need to use the Briefcase cloud again, you need to contact the developer of the software to give you the patch or the latest one that is working in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

<p>Thank you for the input, Keith. We appreciate that. It could be that he is using some kinds of Briefcase software on Windows 10. However, if it is the built-in Briefcase feature, we do not recommend to tweak the registry just to use it since it is already
 deprecated in Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best. </p>

            <p>Hi Samip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons could be a faulty hardware or an outdated driver of the printer. For us to know the root cause of&nbsp; your concern, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to update the driver of the printer to the latest version?</li><li>Have you tried to use a different printer to see if the issue is coming from the printer or the operating system?</li><li>Did you get an error message upon printing a document?</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, kindly follow the steps on the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17420/windows-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Removed my battery</p>
<p>2. Plug in the power adapter</p>
<p>3. Turn on my laptop</p>
<p>4. Wait for the login screen to appear</p>
<p>5. Put my battery back in.</p>

            General blockages include 3rd party Firewall/AV or a proxy server.You can explore other options here:
<br /> Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:

<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<h2>            Please resolve my account issue.</h2>
                    
<p>July 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2013&nbsp;</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing this letter of complaint and disappointed due to the customer service and troubleshooting, and I use both of those terms not as a description of what I received but as what I believe their initial conception was meant to address, that I have
 received over the past month. I will begin with a brief history of the service, or lack thereof, that I have paid for and not received and then I will get into my grievances with the people I have talked to on July 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2013 between the hours of
 5 and 7.</p>
<p>I have been a customer of Microsoft for as long as I can remember and a member of Xbox Live since college where I enjoyed seamless online gaming and have since continued renewing my annual membership, for nearly seven years. During that time, I have used,
 valued, and enjoyed connecting Netflix and other services to my Xbox. In fact, you were nice enough to replace my Xbox years ago when I got the red ring of death. I was always very grateful for the customer service I have received in the past and perhaps that
 is why I feel so disappointed with my most recent experiences.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I tried to migrate my account to my roommate’s Xbox, something that I have done with success many times before. This most recent time, I was required to surrender my cell phone number, something that made me uncomfortable but I did with
 the trust garnered from my previous positive experiences with Microsoft. After various verification codes, password changes, security question changes, and other online troubleshooting adventures, I was able to get my account to work. Less than a week later,
 the account asked me to log in by once again entering my username and password. However, I received numerous error messages and was repeatedly informed that my password and username did not match or did not have an username associated with it. This of course,
 was after various verification codes and successful online verifications. I was indeed frustrated.</p>
<p>Fast forward a month when I finally gathered up the patience to attempt to troubleshoot and log in. Unfortunately, I was met with the same error codes. Luckily, a friend who had a similar problem gave me the customer service phone number. Prepared for the
 expected long haul that I was warned of, I called. All operators were very cordial and helpful, though their “solutions” were all the same. I logged in and out, restarted my Xbox, reset my password twice, received countless verification codes via both email
 and text, and was unable to rectify the problem after two separate phone calls. Besides having to call back because Microsoft was unable to transfer my call and remaining on the phone for over 2 hours, I no longer wanted to fix my account but just wanted to
 cancel the very short remainder of my subscription and receive a refund for the past month where I was unable to use my account and the few weeks remaining of my subscription.</p>
<p>Again, all customer service representatives were kind and understanding. However, I was informed that they could not prorate for a month’s service. This is hard to believe as simple division and a credit card machine makes refunds rather simple, especially
 with my history in retail. In other words, telling me you cannot refund a prorated expense is not true. At least have the decency to tell me you won't. I understand not all representatives have full privileges, so I was passed around again, to my fifth representative
 in an hour. Each representative was cognizant of the fact that I had paid for a service that I did not receive in full but none had the authority or ability to resolve my issue. I was not asking for anything that was not fairly due to me and all representatives
 were very understanding of that.</p>
<p>Happy this saga was approaching some kind of end with some kind of solution, my call was then dropped while on hold after about an hour. Mind you this was my second of two, marathon, phone, troubleshooting sessions. I was understandably upset, but not offended
 as mistakes happen. However, every representative I spoke with asked me for my number in case we got separated and, also, used my number to send me verification codes (yes each representative did this to verify my identity). I never received a phone call.
 I understand my issue was tricky but the least you can do is call back someone you have made jump through hoops for nearly 2 hours. I am unwilling to call back and be tossed from representative to representative and lose more money on cell phone minutes and
 the same advice with the false hope of being passed to someone who can “resolve” my issue. As the saying goes, “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”</p>
<p>I am incredibly disappointed with the steep decline in service that has been veiled with the façade of casual politeness. I will find it hard to continue to support Microsoft Products in the future based on my experiences today. As a lifelong Microsoft user
 and supporter in both my business and personal life, I am sorry to say that I am shocked and saddened by my treatment; though, I suppose I should expect an individual like myself, one of many millions, to only be so valued by a multinational company. My issue
 remains unresolved and coupled with my incredibly disappointing experience over the past hours, I would like a complete refund of my subscription and a cancellation of my automatic membership renewal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your past service,</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<h2>            Firing Range map on black ops won&#39;t load</h2>
                    
<p>I'm playing team deathmatch on black ops and people voted for Firing Range. So, firing range starts to load up but it doesn't fully load for me. It takes me back to the multiplayer menu saying "downloadable content has changed: &amp;&amp;1". Is there any way that
 i can get Firing Range to work again?</p>

<h2>            Audio stuttering then crash when watching Video with Windows Media center</h2>
                    I am having an issue with Windows Media Center that seems to have me stumped. Every time I try and watch Live TV or a recorded program using Media Center it starts playing repeating the first second of audio for about 6 seconds then stops playing gives
 me a video error and won't let me watch anything else. I have an Xbox 360 setup as an extender and that has no issues whatsoever. The strange thing is that if I open the recorded program directly from windows explorer with media center it will play fine. If
 I stop and try and then hit resume it stutters and gives me that video error. <br />
It used to work fine until I started messing with the audio settings to switch from 5.1 to 7.1 audio in the windows configuration settings. I have switched the settings in Set up your speakers to 7.1. I actually tried to switch it back but when I try to "Test"
 the speakers it gives a sound like it is stuttering and I still get the video error when I try to play. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Errors in installing Windows 10 error code 0X800F0830 -0X20003 on top Windows 7</h2>
                    Have twice tried to install Windows 10. &nbsp;I get the same message have no idea what it means, where do I go from here. Windows 7 was having update problems with Internet Explorer 11, I down loaded a newer, hopefully, &nbsp;version of 11 and the update errors
 stopped, there were constant retrys of update failures.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the response. Does the information match what the error message indicates or is the message too general. I continue to have update problems with Internet Explorer Security updates on 7, I have done what the system error tells me, no luck. I believe
 that&nbsp;this is some how related to the Windows 10 install as it is updating at the time of failure just a few percentage from completion, as it does. Is there someway to stop the constant update attempts always in the middle of my work</p>
