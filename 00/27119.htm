            If you access to your email account via web, the messages are still there?  I would try closing Outlook from both computer and creating a new Profile (do not delete the original profile) and ticking that option as you are creating the new profile, then I would do the same in the other computer. Anyway if you need to have access to your email from different devices I would rather recommend you to use IMAP configuration if supported by your email service provider. 
<br />Thanks

<h2>            Receiving pornographic emails</h2>
                    I am receiving pornographic emails.&nbsp; I have tried rules, I have blocked, I have reported, I have done everything I can short of contacting the NYS Attorney General and reporting it.&nbsp; Can anyone help me? I have contacted Outlook support, no one seems to
 care.&nbsp; This began happening when they switched me over to the "New Outlook".&nbsp; It appears their filters are faulty and no one wants to own up to it and fix it .&nbsp; Can anyone offer any advice at all?&nbsp; Can anyone from MSN read this and help me?&nbsp; Thank you.

            They do go into the "junk" folder, but the problem is, no matter how many 'rules' I set up, I have legitimate mail that goes into the junk folder as well, a lot of it.&nbsp; So, I am forced to sift through this offensive stuff.&nbsp; I was okay until I was switched
 over to the 'new Outlook.'&nbsp; It seems at the time, all of Outlook's filters themselves stopped working for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure I don't understand why it is a problem for them to look into this and fix it.&nbsp; I have tried blocking, phishing, I have used the screen
 you kindly pasted above, I have been passed around.&nbsp; No one seems to want to own it.&nbsp; I have sent suggestions to engineers, I have sent suggestions to the moon.&nbsp; I really don't understand it.&nbsp; And that no one gets back and says anything to me is incredibly
 frustrating.&nbsp; They can look at my rules, they can see they are set up.&nbsp; And the same occurrence happens in opposite.&nbsp; If I something is in junk and I say it is not junk, that it is safe, that I write up a rule, no matter, it stays in junk.&nbsp; So you can see,
 I have a real problem here, something isn't working for me.&nbsp; But thank you so very much for your help, I really appreciate it.<br />

            Diane, thank you so very much for all your help.&nbsp; I apologize for it taking so long to get back to you, I've been in the middle of chemo protocol and unwell.&nbsp; You know, the same problems are occurring, no matter what I do.&nbsp; I am slowly weaning myself off
 of Microsoft altogether and moving my clients over to GMAIL, which appears much more stable; plus when there is a problem, their people are great about it.&nbsp; The Outlook people give you the runaround about this and that and act like it's all my fault. So, soon
 I will be done with Outlook, except for the outliers who still contact me through there.&nbsp; What I find so interesting, is that with GMAIL, if you block something, simply by saying it's junk, you never see it again.&nbsp; Their servers trap it before it even goes
 into the junk folder.&nbsp; I have never, ever received a piece of porn from them.&nbsp; They are just better,&nbsp; I am telling everyone I know to make the change.&nbsp; I hope one of these days, Microsoft and Outlook are able to catch up with them.&nbsp; But in the meantime, I
 really appreciate all your advice and instructions, it is just a shame for whatever reason, the Microsoft servers reject my requests.&nbsp; Thanks so very much again, you are a gem.<br />

<p>I believe when you look at templates, it is pulling that information from the internet. This is going to be related to the browser settings for IE. You might try to turn off ActiveX filtering or try to reset IE to default settings.</p>

            That didn't help either.&nbsp; I can see all of the templates under C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Templates\1033\ONENOTE\14\Stationery.&nbsp; When I open the template the background is there.&nbsp; It is when I create a new page in OneNote and apply any template
 to the page all of the formatting and tags are present, but no background.&nbsp; Only the placeholder for the background.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello again...</p>
<p>I am at a loss at the moment to be honest. One thing you can try to do is to run a repair of the Office installation. I would also go as far as to check that OneNote, Office Shared files and Tools are all set to "run all from my computer". But try the repair
 first. Here are some helpful articles if needed:</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone music player can&#39;t do double albums</h2>
                    <p>I thought perhaps this might have been addressed in Wp8.1 but I just updated and the issue remains the same. If you have a double album in mp3 format then Wp completely fails to list the tracks in the correct order . rather than : 'disc 1 : 1,2,3,etc , disc
 2 : 1,2,3 etc.' it does 'album : 1,1,2,2,3,3,etc,etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has no-one at microsoft tried playing a double album?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about a four disc linguaphone language pack?! Totally fubar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MP3 jukeboxes have existed for a long long time. I am confused at how MS could fail so hard at implementing one now.</p>

<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.
<span>&nbsp;</span>As<span>&nbsp; </span>I understand you’re unable to install Office Publisher 2010 on the Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may create a New Folder on your desktop and try copying the entire contents of the disk of Office2010 setup to the New Folder. Once done try running
 setup.exe of from the New Folder on your desktop then install.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further help, reply and we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>Thanks.

    <title>Can Microsoft host my custom domain&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pattyechols  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Microsoft host my custom domain&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook.com* and, although I have a @live address, my email is to my custom domain hosted by AT&amp;T&nbsp;Yahoo Small Business.&nbsp; This is simply a domain I purchase annually and I get email.&nbsp; I have no associated web site on the domain but I'd like to consider
 that in the future.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Microsoft offer a simple way to host my domain, move it to MS servers&nbsp;and allow me to get my domain email via outlook.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*The need for this arises only because outlook.com can no longer access my email on YSB and blames interaction problems between MS and YSB servers that nobody has been able to correct.&nbsp; So, I figure that eliminating the problem servers will get outlook.com
 working for me again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            You can host your domain with Microsoft, but if you search the web for the most recommended hosting companies, Microsoft doesn't make the list. &nbsp;Judging from the posts here in this forum, I'd try other hosting services first for a business domain. &nbsp;I certainly
 would consider Microsoft for hosting a personal domain, however.

            <p>This is a personal domain.&nbsp; And the reason for MS to host it is simply due to outlook.com recently having a total breakdown in being able to access my domain servers for mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your help. I did not have Office 365 app on my Mac, I bought Office products last year directly from Microsoft. Now I installed Office 365 app, signed out of ICloud. For the time being it seems to be working with file accesses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you suggest using OneDrive as a backup for Office files? Sorry, I am just a user with very simple skills. I worked as an employee until last Spring. Now I am a freelancer who has to set up her own system.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your phone's battery indicator is showing your phone being connected to the power source, while it's not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the issue will reoccur after restarting the phone. You can do that by holding the Volume Down + Power Button for about 15 seconds, or by simply turning your phone Off and On again.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</p>

 &nbsp;This took me to a screen that said that two accounts were using my password, one being my private account and the other being an account supposedly created by my work or school IT department. &nbsp;The thing is, I don't work or attend school and don't have an
 IT department. &nbsp;When I clicked on the work account it said it was MSCOM-SiteMuse, something I don't recognize, but when I tried my personal account I was able to reset a new password. &nbsp;After checking that my new password worked, I checked reset password again

            <p>Thank you for your helpful reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Recent Activity on my account and discovered that my account has been accessed by at least three unknown devices from different parts of the USA since February 3, in addition to once from my hometown but not by me.&nbsp; I have changed my password
 at least 5 times since the first time I received a Microsoft email saying my password was successfully changed, when I was not the one who changed it.&nbsp; In addition, I changed my password to other accounts, including my PayPal account which was&nbsp;then soon flagged
 and limited due to suspicious activity.&nbsp; Someone got my password and tried to make charges from a device I don't own shortly after I changed my passwords.&nbsp; I spoke to a PayPal representative who suggested that I had a key logger, and at his suggestion I took
 my computer in over the weekend and had it searched for a key logger.&nbsp; They did not find the key logger but they did make browser changes and suggested that this should fix the problem.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also have Norton Antivirus and Malwarebytes installed on my computer,
 and neither of them found a key logger either despite doing deep scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While my computer was out being scanned, again someone changed my password and the Recent Activity flagged that as suspicious activity.&nbsp; When I got my computer back, my husband changed the log in names and passwords for all of our routers and wifi points,
 then I once again changed passwords and unlocked my PayPal account that I had locked while I tried to find the key logger software on my computer.&nbsp; There was also a computer that I didn't recognize that showed up on my Microsoft page as devices I used to sign
 in from, and my husband removed it from my account.&nbsp; Since we did this this morning, I have not seen any more suspicious activity on my accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest what I should do now?&nbsp; Can/should I report these incidents, and if so, where do I report them?&nbsp; It appears that Microsoft has information shown in my Recent Activity, including ISP addresses and locations from which my Microsoft account was
 used to change my password, repeatedly.&nbsp; Does anyone hunt these folks down and stop them?&nbsp; Have I taken enough steps to protect myself from key loggers?&nbsp; If not, what else do you suggest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for telling me how to check for the Recent Activity.&nbsp; That was very telling and helpful, but I am unsure what to do now that I can see when and from where my account was accessed without my knowledge or permission.&nbsp; I feel a bit violated by all this
 activity, and lucky that it appears that only Microsoft and PayPal have been affected.&nbsp; I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can give me about how/if to proceed from here.</p>

                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with a SharePoint Online site. I gave access to "Everyone except externals" to that site and yet I receive access request from certain users in my email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be happening here? I was under the impression that when I gave "Everyone except externals" access, there wouldn't be anyone needing to request access to the Sharepoint site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi ZenunJ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As "Everyone except external users" is a default group in Azure Active Directory. When you normally add a new user in your Office 365 admin center, it will automatically add this user to your Azure
 AD. But if this user was synced from an on-premise environment, he might won't be listed in Azure AD which could be a reason of this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this situation, could you help us confirm the following scenarios?</p>
<p>1.Is there a fixed pattern on these users comparing with those who could be invited without issue?</p>
<p>2.If you send the invitation to them by inputting their email address, could the invitation be sent successfully?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You will get it eventually. It usually depends on our operator. What network are to on? I just received the 1308 update 3 days ago after AT&amp;T had released it in march and suspended it earlier this month. I'm currently awaiting the 1314 update which most
 AT&amp;T customers have already received.<br />

<p>Is this the AT&amp;T update for the connectivity issues?<br />
Or another one?<br />
If so could you give me a link to the fixes of this update?</p>

<h2>            How to specify the order of results selected by a combo box with multiple options&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a combo box and allowing multiple values. When I include this field in a report, how do I control the order in which the options are displayed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, they are displayed alphabetically, but I would like them to appear in the order they are defined. I have tried both a 'Value List' and a "Table/Query" for RowSourceType but neither changes the output.</p>

            I think you have to add the .Value property for MVF to your query and place a sort on that. But I had a similar problem and you may not get it to work. I would suggest NOT using an MVF and using the more traditional junction table.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks Scottgem,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added the .Value to the query I'm using but it only enables alphabetical sorting for the field unfortunately. I'm reading up on junction tables now (have never heard the term before) but wanted to describe my application and see if that's still your recommendation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My report lists projects that my company is working on (one per row) and the "Team" field is my current MVF that I can't sort. I'm using people's initials to indicate who is working on it, and each project has a few people. I want to customize the order
 that the "Team" is displayed (in order to align with seniority at the firm in this case) instead of alphabetically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your quick response!</p>

            <p>The problem is that you got sucked into using Microsoft's misdesigned, incompletely implemented, frustrating and almost never necessary Multivalue Field misfeature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have been developing relational databases for about half a century without multivalue fields. It's very straightforward! In your case you have a Many to Many relationship. &nbsp;Each Team has zero, one, or many People; each Person can work on zero, one,
 or many Teams. The relational structure to manage this involves three Tables:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblTeams</p>
<p>&nbsp; TeamID (primary key)</p>
<p>&nbsp; TeamName (what do you call this team)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;other information about the team as an entity in its own right, nothing about team members)</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblEmployees</p>
<p>&nbsp; EmployeeID (primary key)</p>
<p>&nbsp; LastName</p>
<p>&nbsp; FirstName</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;all the usual information about the person, including seniority)</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblTeamMembership</p>
<p>&nbsp; TeamMembershipID (autonumber primary key)</p>
<p>&nbsp; TeamID (which team are you looking at)</p>
<p>&nbsp; EmployeeID (who is on this team)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;other info about THIS person's involvement with THIS team, e.g. date started, role in the team, ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Team Blue has eight members, there would be eight records in tblTeamMembership. And if you want to display an alphabetical list of them, you can create a Query joining all three tables, sorted by LastName/FirstName to see them alphabetically, or by HireDate
 to show them in order of seniority, or in whatever order you choose. This is easy with the relational design; all but impossible with MVF.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Excuse my ignorance, but once I set up the many-to-many relationship with a 3rd table, how do I then change my original table that holds most of the data (relating to each project) so that the "Team" field corresponds to the new "Team" table?</p>

            <p>I almost totally agree with John. MVfs can have their uses, but they are very limited. However, I would change the structure a bit. I don't think you need a Teams table. You should have tblEmployees and tblProjects, then the junction table would be tblProjectMembers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would need to see what your current structure is to advise how to convert it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You don't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that you're trying to store all the information in one table. That's not how databases work! Each Table contains information about one type of "Entity" - real-life person, thing, or event such as an Employee, a Project, a Team, a Company,
 etc. Your database will have several tables for different kinds of entities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Tables will stay "under the hood". If you're assuming that all of the information must be in one Table, and that you will use that Table to work with it... well, that's not how databases work. Users should never even SEE a table; all interaction
 would be done using Forms, typically with Subforms, Combo Boxes, listboxes and other tools displaying data from more than one table. You would have a Project form showing data from the Projects table, but it might have a Teams subform showing (multiple records!)
 of information from the the third table, and employee names from the Employees table. It's neither necessary nor practical to have One Big Master Table containing all the information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Add a column named TeamID to the projects table, of&nbsp; long integer number data type, and in a form for entering data into the table use a combo box set up as follows:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp; TeamID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT TeamID, TeamName FROM tblTeams ORDER BY TeamName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; In the combo box you can then select a team by name,
 but the underlying value will be the long integer number.<br />
<br />
Once you've done this for all your project's records you can delete the redundant multi-valued field and create a relationship between the projects table and tblTeams on TeamID, being sure to enforce referential integrity.<br />
<br />
In a report's RecordSource query join the Projects table to the tblTeams table, this to the tblTeamMembership table, and this to the tblEmployees table.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can include whatever columns from tblEmployees&nbsp; you wish to include in the report for the team members,
 and you can include sort orders on whatever columns you wish to govern the order in which the data is output.&nbsp; Group the report first by project and include the project data in the group header.&nbsp; The team membership data can be included in the detail section.&nbsp;
 If you wish the first team member to be on the same line as the project data, in the group headers Format event procedure put:<br />
<br />
MoveLayout = False</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In your case a projects data entry form could include a subform, in continuous forms view, based on the tblTeamMembership
 table and linked to the parent form on TeamID.<span>&nbsp; </span>This would enable you to enter team members once you've entered a team in the parent form.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you select an existing team its members will automatically show in the subform.&nbsp; To create a new team you can type the new team name directly into the combo box on the parent form, and include code in the combo box's NotInList event procedure to insert
 a new row into tblTeams.<span>&nbsp; </span>The combo box in the activities subform in my demo illustrates this, allowing a new activity name to be added to the list by typing it into the control, and answering yes when prompted to confirm.</span></p>
<br />

    <title>Microsoft support messages are on wrong language - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft support messages are on wrong language</h2>
                    <p>I have all my settings (including local PC settings and remote web interfaces, Outlook.com etc) in English, everywhere language is set English, but in same time&nbsp;<strong>all Microsoft account support messages are in German</strong>.&nbsp;I checked a billion of
 language/localization preferences both on the laptop and web - neither of them have German. BUT, I bought the laptop in Germany, so my first setup was on German, and I still live in Germany. Guess, one of these reasons make Microsoft emails to me in German,
 but i'm pretty sure it is configurable (at least it should be).</p>
<p><em>So where can i change Microsoft account emails language</em>?</p>

            No sir,
<div><br />
<div>Actually in india and maldives we have only the first number as the alphabet and the remaining 7 digits are numbers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So in the database we have to input a validation that would accept the passport numbers of these countries..</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thats y I asked what will be validation rule for tjhe same...</div>
<div><br />
<div>It should accept only one alphabet followed by 7 digits...</div>

            If the passports are to be from any country then this is probably impossible. Different countries have different sequences of characters. Some are all numbers, some are numbers and letters. There is also no standard length. My own passport has 9 numerical
 characters and no letters.<br />

    <title>Package Access Runtime 2016 in a database file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamdelaney1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Package Access Runtime 2016 in a database file</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this is the right community to be in and if not please direct me where I need to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have office 365 on my computer. I have built a database file for our American Legion post, and would now like to distribute it to other posts. I have 3 blank database files named: Membership 64, Membership 86, and Membership Access. The 64 and 86 versions
 are for computers that have that operating system, and the membership access is for computers that have access installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched to find out if I can distribute this file to someone who does not have access on their computer and found the download page for Access Runtime 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The page states that Microsoft Access 2016 Runtime enables me to distribute the file to users who do not have the full version of Access 2016 installed on their computers. It goes on to state that I can choose to distribute those Access 2016 solutions so
 that they run without requiring a full installation of Access 2016.&nbsp;<span>To do so I must package and distribute my application with the Access 2016 Runtime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then states there is no need to buy any special product in order to redistribute the Access 2016 Runtime. I can freely redistribute it or pint user to this download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions only state to download the file and save the file to my computer and to choose the version that matches the target office installation.</p>
<p>They than say to double click the&nbsp;<br />
AccessRuntime.exe file to start the setup program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want the runtime to install and run on my computer as I have office 365 and am concerned that it might mess something up. Also I don't know if the instructions are talking about the operating system on my computer or the computer I will be sharing
 with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY QUESTION IS: What are the steps I take to attach (package) access runtime 2016 to the file before sending it to another post.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help someone can give me on this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<p>Excellent question. MSFT has gone back and forth between the versions about how to distribute Access applications. They used to have a Package &amp; Deployment wizard, they have tried a few other things. Most of that has fallen by the waste side.</p>
<p>With A2016, I would *not* use Package and Sign - too much complication for too little benefit(your users already trust you).</p>
<p>Rather I would write up some instructions for each of the situations you might encounter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you already know if you have been following this forum, is that as a developer you have to be on the LOWEST version that ANY of your peeps might be on. So with you being on 2016, the user with 2013 or prior is out of luck. They cannot use your
 accde.</p>
<p>Assuming everyone is on 2016, you have to deal with various permutations including:</p>
<p>- is Access already installed</p>
<p>&nbsp; - if so, with what bitness? How can the innocent user find out?</p>
<p>- if not, give them a link to the A2016 runtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there are now TWO versions of Access 2016, the MSI one which is a perpetual license, and the Click-to-Run one which is a subscription license. You will have to tell people how to find out if they are A or B, and then download the CORRECT runtime
 for their situation (yes, there are two runtimes).</p>
<p>I know, it is mindboggling complex, and if Bill Gates had called me I would have smacked him over the head (figuratively, of course :-)) No I am not bitter :-)</p>

<p>Ok so you are correct this is mind boggling. First I want to say I am sorry if I am not understanding what you are telling me. I am not a developer in fact it took me almost 4 months to create the database and get it running perfect. So some of the things
 you wrote to me kind of went over my head a little. Below is what I do know only from reading about the runtime 2016 from the down load page.</p>
<p>Any simple advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So are you saying the microsoft download page with the Access runtime is wrong. The web page with the runtime download is at:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50040.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes there are 2 versions of the runtime: Accessruntime_4288-1001_X64en-US.Exe and Accessruntime_4288-1001_X86en-US.Exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a blank copy of the db file (no tables filled in) and what I thought I could do from what I read was make one copy named MembershipX64, and one copy named MembershipX86 both packaged with the access runtime 2016.&nbsp; Under the details tab it states the
 following:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft Access 2016 provides a rich platform for developing database management solutions
 with easy-to-use customization tools. If no end-user customization is required (including report modifications), you can choose to distribute those Access 2016 solutions so that they run without requiring a full installation of Access 2016. To do so, you must
 package and distribute your application with the Access 2016 Runtime.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 removed or disabled.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 You can freely redistribute it or point users to this download.&nbsp;</span></p>
 a copy of the database is ask them which system they are running either X64 or X86 and then mail them the correct one for their system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two databases would be for any post that does not have any version of Access installed on their computers or do not have Office 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize that if they have Access or office 365 they would need to upgrade to Access 2016. That would be on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So am I right from what I am reading that I can't package runtime with the database as the download page states?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is possible to package the two versions with 2 separate db's I just need to know how to do that.</p>
<p>Again thanks for all your time helping me with this.</p>
<p>Bill</p>
