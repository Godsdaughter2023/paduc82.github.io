<h2>            Microsoft Office Forms</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently creating a survey using Microsoft Office Forms. I know how to add a single picture, but is it possible to add multiple images on a question? My plan was to have a question where subjects may pick from a variety of images to answer the question.
 Is it possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Linked SQL table to Access table</h2>
                    <p>Looking for best practice advice. In access I have a linked sql table and one details table that joins the sql table.&nbsp; Is it best to create queries from the linked table&nbsp;and join them to the details table for forms to reference and will I be able to update
 the details data in the form this way. Or should I create a query from the linked table and then make table from that to join to the details table? Or neither option above?

<p>You definitely don't want to use Make Table. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I follow the other issues. If you have a child table that is in Access of a parent table that is in SQL Server, then you should have a mainform/subform for data entry and review.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would only need a query if you are reporting on the 2 tables. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, All tables should be linked. Whether the table is from a SQL Server database or from an Access back end. the only local tables should be temp tables or ones static to the user. And there is really no such thing as a "SQL table". SQL is a language
 uses with Relational databases. Tables are linked to a data store. Examples of data stores are SQL Server, Oracle and the native ACE for Access..</p>

<h2>            Excel Solver &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for help involving excel solver when creating lineups for DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports) purposes. I currently have everything set up correctly with lineups being generated no problem. The issue I have run into now is that excel does not know to only
 pick up to 4 players max from each team. Depending on when I run the solver, I could have 4 teams or 16 teams to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I set up a constraint so solver can recognize and choose players accordingly? Below are 2 images to see what I am working with. The first is a snapshot of my excel file and the second is a snapshot of my constraints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 15.19.1 - Still Large CPU Demands and Notifications Problems</h2>

<span>Hello-</span><br />
<span>Hello-</span><br />
</p>
<p>Still having a heavy load problem from 15.19.1 - My users are all reporting ~50%+ CPU load.<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, since upgrading to 15.19.1:<br />
<br />
- Users are reporting that they only get alerts when outlook is open.<br />
<br />
So, if you're a laptop user, this is a huge issue because it's draining employees batteries because they have to keep the CPU sucking application open to get meeting notifications. President of company is angry because people are missing meetings due to this.<br />
<br />
- Why the heavy CPU load?<br />
<br />
- Why only showing meeting notifications if Outlook is open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a peer-to-peer forum. No Microsoft does not monitor the forum. Moderators are community volunteers and have no affiliation with Microsoft. Your conclusion is correct that people are pretty much on their own to support each other. Sometimes Microsoft
 people respond to questions, but that seems to happen only if the question touches on a particular topic they are concerned about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding only getting alerts when Outlook is open - that is by design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous versions of Outlook and Entourage there was an app specifically devoted to reminders. It worked all the time and would fire reminders set by Word, Powerpoint and Excel as well as Outlook and Entourage. For Outlook 2016 Microsoft decided to cut
 corners and go without the Reminders app. This time around they took the cheap, easy way and built the reminders feature directly into Outlook. It's a lot simpler and easier for Microsoft. Not very good at all for users, but that was not the primary consideration.
 Cost in terms of money a dollars wrecked the feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add a feature request to restore the Reminders app, which would fix the problem you have described. If enough votes are made in support of your feature request, Microsoft might think about restoring the feature. Here's the feature request site:</p>

            <p>Hi Jim-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the explanation. I (and I'm sure others) greatly appreciate your (and other expert's) devotion to this forum. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time, this is quite disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in a sense, we're all stuck. High CPU utilization for an email and calendar app that doesn't tie into Apple's notification center resulting in dead batteries and no one making meetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, at the same time, Apple's Mail and Calendar applications are clearly made for the non business user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like we're back in 1999 when Apple is terrible in the corporate world and MS is making sloppy products for the mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any advice for an alternate to Outlook on the mac? I don't think there really is one, but 50%+ CPU utilization and no meeting notifications is a terrible combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

    <title>Lumia 630 Dual Sim - 3G active on both simcards at the same time&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zegert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 630 Dual Sim - 3G active on both simcards at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From various sources I noted that both SIM card slots support 3G.</p>
<p>What I can't find is if it's possible to have both sim cards with 3G active at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know the answer to this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason for asking:</p>
<p>I'm also testing an Android dual sim at the moment but I have to make a choice which sim is allowed to use 3G - also for calls, not to have 2 active data connections open.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do understand the part of having data connection for 1 sim only and to make the choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I mean with my questions is if 3G can be switched on for both cards (and not select a data conmection) to have better coverage for making calls.</p>
<p>On my current Nokia E7 (Symbian) and my Lumia 520 I have 3G on also without a data connection but just to have the better coverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Billing</h2>
                    Why do you insist on taking money for my subscription without issuing me with an invoice. I am a VAT registered individual and every year I have to fight tooth and nail to get a VAT invoice. It is a matter of international legislation that any VAT registered
 company must issue a VAT invoice irrespective of whether the recipient of the service is registered or not. You are clearly breaking International Finance law.

            i had the sam problem solved it by using super from erightsoft just download it<br />
output container:MP4<br />
output video codec:Mpeg 4<br />
output audio codec:aac<br />
for video resolution and smooth playback choose 608x272<br />
framerate:23.976<br />
(video)bitrate 528kbps<br />
options mark the 4 top boxes<br />
audio bitrate 96kbps<br />
<br />
and if you want to experiment you can go higher with a few settings e90 can playback in 800x352 (screen resolution) but this brings big files and not always smooth playback<br />
you always pause the vid in realplayer go the options and select fullscreen.

</p><p>Yesterday my computer was infected with Virus and Windows defender stopped working. Windows defender setting was grayed out. However, upon search on the internet I was able to restore windows defender. Now it shows that your computer is protected. However,
 when I did a full scan of the computer, it didn't show any items under quarantine or deleted items. The log is empty. Does this mean that the virus is still on my computer and how do I get the logs to show me the items. I have clicked all 3 options (Quarantined,
 allowed items and all detected items. It is blank and the options "remove all, remove, restore" are grayed out. Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run System File Checker tool</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Search Engine Changer for Cortana</h2>
                    <p><strong>Suggestion</strong><strong>: </strong>Allow us to change the search engine for Cortana to whatever we want, even Google. &nbsp;I know that this would probably disable voice integration, but I never use it, and others probably won't either. &nbsp;I also never
 use Bing and would rather not be forced into it. &nbsp;Even if not a lot of people use it, it's nice that it's still there. &nbsp;It shows that Microsoft won't force you into anything except out of necessity (ex. discontinuing Windows XP support because it's so old).
 &nbsp;It helps build trust back after The OS Which Shall Not Be Named, and it'll help convince more people to come over from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been using Windows 10 TP fo about a month or two now, so I'm not sure of they've added this feature (which shouldn't be hard to integrate, as it was available in IS, so they have the groundwork for it) or not. &nbsp;I'm assuming not, since I haven't
 heard about it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>I've learned that this is the Internet, so here goes: Please remember that this is my personal opinion and not something that must get accepted as law. &nbsp;Please respond, if you so choose, with that in mind.</em></p>

    <title>Can Worksheet_Change macro write to other sheets&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wordfool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Worksheet_Change macro write to other sheets&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I currently use a basic piece of vba to monitor each row of a worksheet (let's call it Sheet1) and write a datestamp in column D whenever any edits are detected in that row. This code works fine:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><br />
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
If Target.Row = 1 Then Exit Sub<br />
Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cells(Target.Row, "D").Value = Date<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the number of columns have multiplied, however, I've had to split the data for each record across multiple other sheets (Sheet2 &amp; Sheet3) and now have to write a datestamp in column D of Sheet1 whenever any changes are detected in that row on any of the
 three sheets.&nbsp; How would I go about modifying the above code to monitor the same row across multiple sheets? Can the Worksheet_Change function write to a different sheet?<br />

            1. Worksheet_Change can write to other sheets. You will have to qualify your statements with worksheet name like this as a sample
<br />
<br />Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("A2") = "Some value"
<br />
<br />2. To monitor the change in value in other sheets, you need to put Worksheet_Change in those sheet modules and write the timestamp in Sheet1.
<br />
<br />Note as a best practice, you should always qualify the sheet name.
<br />
<br />Cells(Target.Row, "D").Value = Date
<br />should be replaced with
<br />Me.Cells(Target.Row, "D").Value = Date
<br />
<br />(Me means the sheet where this code is put)

<p>Thanks, although I'm a little confused about your two separate statements about qualifying the sheet name. Would it be as simple as just qualifying the Target.Row line and putting this in the Sheet2 and Sheet3 modules?</p>

                    Hi All,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have windows 2013 professional plus installed on my laptop. It was working fine a few days ago but now i am unable to open any MS Office programs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the following things so far:&nbsp;</div>
<div>tried opening word in safe mode - did not work&nbsp;</div>
<div>tried running winword.exe as an admin - did not work&nbsp;</div>
<div>tried booting windows into safe mode and then opening word - did not work&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the event log is&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>Faulting application name: WINWORD.EXE, version: 15.0.4551.1006, time stamp: 0x5269335a</div>

</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The mso.dll file is in the folder, but i have no idea how to go about checking if it's compromised or not. Any help or advice would be really great! Thanks.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>It's OK, don't worry. I found a work-around. Export contacts in a csv format from mentioned accounts (google etc.) and import these files into Outlook. It's a bit of&nbsp;time but it works....</p>

<p>I haven't yet installed 2010, but in earlier versions there's an option on the External Data... Import dialog. FoxPro files are basically dBase files; if you don't see an explicit FoxPro choice try the different flavors of .dbf.</p>
<p>What version of FoxPro is this (there were several generations)? What have you tried?</p>

    <title>Word 2002, 2007, AND 2010 Crashing Since August - so far, NONE of the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2002, 2007, AND 2010 Crashing Since August - so far, NONE of the suggested fixes work. </h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is going to be long but I'm hoping to provide as much information up front as possible.</p>
<p>I have been a happy Word user for close to 20 years. I have Word 2002 installed on a desktop, and recently purchased a laptop which came with Word 2007.</p>
<p>In August of this year, I suddenly began having problems with Word crashing repeatedly - sometimes as many as five or six times in a single hour.&nbsp; It always tells me there is an unspecified problem, prompts me to recover the documents and restart, and offers
 me the choice of sending a crash report to Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crashes occur unpredictably - sometimes it is when I am typing; sometimes it is right after I have pressed return or shift.&nbsp; Sometimes it seems to coincide with an AutoCorrect activation, but not always.&nbsp; Startup is fine; saving is fine.&nbsp; After ten or
 twelve crashes and recoveries, I usually get a message that the file has been "repaired," but when I click to see what the repairs are, it usually only tells me "Style1" and doesn't indicate anything more specific.&nbsp; (Again, this "repaired" message only happens
 AFTER multiple crashes and recoveries on the same document - it never shows up as a problem in the first 10-15 crashes.)</p>
<p>I use Word for my job, for which I work from home.&nbsp; I do medical transcription: My reports are required to be in Courier New, with no formatting other than some occasional bold and underline.&nbsp; There are NO special fonts, NO tables, NO images, NO bullets,
 NOTHING other than plain text (with occasional bold and underline).&nbsp; I do not run macros. (That I know of. I don't even know what a macro is.)</p>
<p>When this first began happening, the error messages indicated that Word 2002 is no longer being supported, and suggested I upgrade to Word 2010.&nbsp; I thought that it was about time I started using something more recent anyway, so I started using the laptop,
 with Word 2007.&nbsp; <strong>I immediately began having the same problems with Word 2007.</strong></p>
<p>I wondered if I had somehow gotten a virus that had been transmitted to the laptop when I copied over my reference documents. I did thorough virus scans on the desktop and the laptop, and both were 100% clean.&nbsp; When the problem persisted, I took the laptop
 in to have the IT guys check it, and it ran 100% clean on their AV program too. (I use Kaspersky; they use something designed for corporate use.) A third scan with a program recommended by a friend was also 100% clean.</p>
<p>The error messages in Word 2007 merely requested that I send the crash report to Microsoft, then thanked me for sending it, but gave me no information as to what might be causing it, or how to prevent it. With no other information to go on, the IT guys suggested
 upgrading to 2010.</p>
<p>I downloaded the trial version of Office 2010, and <strong>2010 also crashes regularly</strong> . Same behavior, same error messages, same recovery process, same no-information when I send the crash reports.</p>
<p>I have followed every single step in the "how to troubleshoot Word" suggestions - I've deleted the appropriate keys in the registry, I've run the repair module, I've renamed Normal, I've double-checked that I don't have any problematic add-ins, I've re-installed
 my printer drivers - I can't even <strong>think</strong> of all the things I've done, but I've been haunting these forums, reading the suggestions and the links and the "see also" recommendations for a month, and I have tried every single suggestion I have
 seen.</p>
<p>I have also done System Restores to dates before the problem began, and have even<strong> completely uninstalled and then reinstalled</strong> the Word 2002 and (trial) 2010 programs (at different times, and of course on their respective machines - 2002
 is on the desktop, the 2010 trial is on the laptop).&nbsp; None of these steps have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Again, I want to emphasize: This is happening with <strong>three</strong> different versions of Word, on<strong> two</strong> different machines, both of which have tested<strong> 100% virus/malware free</strong> on multiple occasions.&nbsp; I have used Word
 for as long as I can remember, and I have never had this problem before, but it has been consistent (on a daily basis) since early August.&nbsp; (And I did not add any new hardware or software in at least the ~5/6 weeks before the problem began.)</p>
<p>In desperation, I have since downloaded trials of other word processors - Open Office and WordPerfect, and one other that I can't think of the name of.&nbsp; These word processors DO NOT CRASH, at all, but unfortunately they also are not suitable for my needs
 and the requirements of my employer. This seems to be a problem exclusive to Word, but one which crosses all the versions of Word that I have. I have ZERO problems with any other programs; again, there was no software or hardware change before the problem
 began, and I have scanned virus/malware free with at least three different AV programs.</p>
<p>Can anyone PLEASE tell me what is going on, and how to fix it? Microsoft's only suggestion seems to be "Upgrade to 2010!" and I would be<strong> delighted</strong> to buy a shiny new copy of Office 2010<strong>if it would fix the problem</strong> , but it
 happens with the 2010 trial just as frequently as with the 2002 and 2007 versions!&nbsp; (In fact, in the 2010 trial, it is LESS likely to successfully recover all of my information after a crash.)</p>
<p>This is affecting my ability to do my job properly and therefore my ability to provide for myself and my child, but because of the particular details of my employment, it's not something that my employer will handle.&nbsp;<strong>It's on me, and I'm desperate</strong>
 . Can anyone help with this?&nbsp; I've tried every suggestion I have seen, in these forums and in the support.microsoft pages, but every time within 45 minutes of restarting Word, it's crashing again.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your attention and patience.</p>

<p>You may need to start from scratch. First, uninstall all Office versions, <em>
then</em> delete their registry keys, <em>then</em> run an integrity check on Windows itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've done that and confirmed that evrything is OK, turn off your anti-virus software and install the oldest version you want to have on a given CPU first. Then test it. Install all that version's updates, then test again. Only then, install the next
 most recent version that you want on that CPU and repeat the foregoing steps. Only after you've done all that should you restart your anti-virus software (though your can restart it to download updates, if necessary, disabling again before installing them).</p>

As this seems to be happening randomly, have you tried testing for any length of time with Word in Safe Mode?
 If not test in Safe Mode.</p>

Hold down the Control Key and double-click the Word start icon. Word should start in Safe Mode. Now run it for a while and see if it is stable now. Please let us know what happens in Safe Mode.</p>

<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is going to be long but I'm hoping to provide as much information up front as possible.</p>
<p>I have been a happy Word user for close to 20 years. I have Word 2002 installed on a desktop, and recently purchased a laptop which came with Word 2007.</p>
<p>In August of this year, I suddenly began having problems with Word crashing repeatedly - sometimes as many as five or six times in a single hour.&nbsp; It always tells me there is an unspecified problem, prompts me to recover the documents and restart, and offers
 me the choice of sending a crash report to Microsoft. </p>
<p>The crashes occur unpredictably - sometimes it is when I am typing; sometimes it is right after I have pressed return or shift.&nbsp; Sometimes it seems to coincide with an AutoCorrect activation, but not always.&nbsp; Startup is fine; saving is fine.&nbsp; After ten or
 twelve crashes and recoveries, I usually get a message that the file has been "repaired," but when I click to see what the repairs are, it usually only tells me "Style1" and doesn't indicate anything more specific.&nbsp; (Again, this "repaired" message only happens
 AFTER multiple crashes and recoveries on the same document - it never shows up as a problem in the first 10-15 crashes.)</p>
<p>I use Word for my job, for which I work from home.&nbsp; I do medical transcription: My reports are required to be in Courier New, with no formatting other than some occasional bold and underline.&nbsp; There are NO special fonts, NO tables, NO images, NO bullets,
 NOTHING other than plain text (with occasional bold and underline).&nbsp; I do not run macros. (That I know of. I don't even know what a macro is.)</p>
<p>When this first began happening, the error messages indicated that Word 2002 is no longer being supported, and suggested I upgrade to Word 2010.&nbsp; I thought that it was about time I started using something more recent anyway, so I started using the laptop,
 with Word 2007.&nbsp; <strong>I immediately began having the same problems with Word 2007.</strong></p>
<p>I wondered if I had somehow gotten a virus that had been transmitted to the laptop when I copied over my reference documents. I did thorough virus scans on the desktop and the laptop, and both were 100% clean.&nbsp; When the problem persisted, I took the laptop
 in to have the IT guys check it, and it ran 100% clean on their AV program too. (I use Kaspersky; they use something designed for corporate use.) A third scan with a program recommended by a friend was also 100% clean.</p>
<p>The error messages in Word 2007 merely requested that I send the crash report to Microsoft, then thanked me for sending it, but gave me no information as to what might be causing it, or how to prevent it. With no other information to go on, the IT guys suggested
 upgrading to 2010.</p>
<p>I downloaded the trial version of Office 2010, and <strong>2010 also crashes regularly</strong> . Same behavior, same error messages, same recovery process, same no-information when I send the crash reports.</p>
<p>I have followed every single step in the "how to troubleshoot Word" suggestions - I've deleted the appropriate keys in the registry, I've run the repair module, I've renamed Normal, I've double-checked that I don't have any problematic add-ins, I've re-installed
 my printer drivers - I can't even <strong>think</strong> of all the things I've done, but I've been haunting these forums, reading the suggestions and the links and the "see also" recommendations for a month, and I have tried every single suggestion I have
 seen.</p>
<p>I have also done System Restores to dates before the problem began, and have even<strong> completely uninstalled and then reinstalled</strong> the Word 2002 and (trial) 2010 programs (at different times, and of course on their respective machines - 2002
 is on the desktop, the 2010 trial is on the laptop).&nbsp; None of these steps have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Again, I want to emphasize: This is happening with <strong>three</strong> different versions of Word, on<strong> two</strong> different machines, both of which have tested<strong> 100% virus/malware free</strong> on multiple occasions.&nbsp; I have used Word
 for as long as I can remember, and I have never had this problem before, but it has been consistent (on a daily basis) since early August.&nbsp; (And I did not add any new hardware or software in at least the ~5/6 weeks before the problem began.)</p>
<p>In desperation, I have since downloaded trials of other word processors - Open Office and WordPerfect, and one other that I can't think of the name of.&nbsp; These word processors DO NOT CRASH, at all, but unfortunately they also are not suitable for my needs
 and the requirements of my employer. This seems to be a problem exclusive to Word, but one which crosses all the versions of Word that I have. I have ZERO problems with any other programs; again, there was no software or hardware change before the problem
 began, and I have scanned virus/malware free with at least three different AV programs.</p>
<p>Can anyone PLEASE tell me what is going on, and how to fix it? Microsoft's only suggestion seems to be "Upgrade to 2010!" and I would be<strong> delighted</strong> to buy a shiny new copy of Office 2010<strong>if it would fix the problem</strong> , but it
 happens with the 2010 trial just as frequently as with the 2002 and 2007 versions!&nbsp; (In fact, in the 2010 trial, it is LESS likely to successfully recover all of my information after a crash.)</p>
<p>This is affecting my ability to do my job properly and therefore my ability to provide for myself and my child, but because of the particular details of my employment, it's not something that my employer will handle.<strong>It's on me, and I'm desperate</strong>
 . Can anyone help with this?&nbsp; I've tried every suggestion I have seen, in these forums and in the support.microsoft pages, but every time within 45 minutes of restarting Word, it's crashing again.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your attention and patience.</p>

            Have you found a solution yet?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have the same problem, Word crashs while typing - constantly but never at the same time. I tried all the "normal" ways to fix it: Delete the Data Key in the Registry, used Microsoft FixIt, disabled all Plugins, replaced normal.dot, nothing helps. ( I
 have gone through all these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</a>
<div><br />
<div>).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This happens on a HP Notebook with Windows 7 32bit and Office 2007 32bit and a Lenovo Notebook with Windows 7 64 bit and Office 2010 32bit. In fact, it happens on every Installation. (The only thing this installations have in common is that they are both
 licenced via PKC, which means I bought a Product Key Card for the already installed trial versions on both of these notebooks.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps it has to do something with my documents, but I'm just typing, formating text from time to time, build an index. That's all, no script magic or anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I even have different Virus scanners on both machines (McAfee Enterprise and MS Security Essentials).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm really depressed, I have to write my technical papers in Notepad or something else until I find a solution.</div>

            Apparently, it will detect that it was originally sold with the operators variant firmware, and put the most recent version for that operator on...<br />
<br />
Not sure how accurate that is, mine was originally locked to o2, I had it unlocked and generic firmware loaded on... I've tried the

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you go to Activesync on your phone and then choose Configure Server ? There you need to enter all data and make sure to check if your server uses a https connection.<br />
Let me know if you need more help with that.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007-Email replies stuck in OUTBOX. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doug house  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007-Email replies stuck in OUTBOX.</h2>
                    <p><u>Problem</u>: When replying to an email, it will get stuck in the outbox. All other emails will send normally. Only
<u>REPLIES </u>to emails will&nbsp;get stuck. For instance, if I receive an email, then write a reply, then write a couple more NEW emails, they will all reside in the OUTBOX until I slick SEND/RECEIVE ALL, then the NEW emails will be sent and the other (REPLY)
 email will NOT send.</p>
<p><u>Background</u>: I am using Outlook 2007, and have 2 separate accounts. I normally work offline and when I am ready to send emails, I click SEND/RECEIVE ALL.</p>
<p>I have tried to reply to email from both accounts with no luck. I checked all of the junk email, security, delivery, safe senders, receivers,&nbsp;and options &nbsp;settings etc.&nbsp;Can't&nbsp;figure it out! &nbsp;Any solution to this problem? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Insider Hub won&#39;t install in Build 10162</h2>
                    <p>I've just used the ISO for Build 10162 to make a clean install of this latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to install the Insiders Hub without success. I'm monitoring the installation progress and it gets to about 20% then stops.</p>
<p>Any suggestions how to complete the installation?</p>

<p>I couldn't find the Hub in the windows store so I can't see how resetting&nbsp;the store&nbsp;would help. I reset it anyway but it didn't help.</p>
<p>I used the steps in method 2 which worked in the previous build but not in 10162.&nbsp; I select the Insider Hub for installation and while monitoring the installation progress, it gets to about 20% and freezes.</p>

            I had the same problem the first time I tried to install it and then remembered that it's only available for Insiders.&nbsp; I had skipped setting up my Microsoft Account during the clean install because last time I did that, with build 10130,&nbsp;I ended up with
 two user accounts because I use a different user name on my LAN.&nbsp; After I set up my Microsoft Account info and tested it by accessing Mail and Calendar, I was able to install the Insider's Hub with no problems.

            I just tried&nbsp;to open&nbsp;mine and got nothing.&nbsp; The update from build 10162 to 10166 broke it.&nbsp; I had to uninstall and then reinstall it to get&nbsp;Insider Hub&nbsp;working again.

            I tried to uninstall the app but when I click on it, it does nothing, won't open, right click give pin / unpin options only. I can't find it in Add or Remove Programs so not sure what to do with it. Guess it'll be resolved on or after RTM.
