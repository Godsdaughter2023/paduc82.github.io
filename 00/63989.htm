            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Autodesk says much the same as many post by Microsoft as Autodesk does not support Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found that Windows 10 runs with Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 and Windows 7 Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Framework would work alongside other versions other than 4.6, could one download the 4.5 version to run alongside.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, would this help this problem with A/Cad and Windows 10.</p>
<p>

    <title>Win7 BSOD issues relating mostly to ntosknl.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cabba.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 BSOD issues relating mostly to ntosknl.exe</h2>
                    Ok so I bought a new system several weeks ago and it was Dead on Arrival, Faulty motherboard. Sent it back and the replaced the motherboard from a Asus M4A89GTD-Pro/USB3 to a Asus M5 A99x Evo.<br />
2 days after I had it back it started randomly blue screening, I have had the following Bug check strings occur: System_Thread_Exception_ Not_Handled \ Pool_Corruption_in_File_Area \<br />
IRQL_Not_Less_Or_Equal (this is the most common) \ Kmode_Exception_Not_Handled \ System_Service_Exception \ Unexpected_Kernel_Mode_Trap \ Driver_IRQL_Not_Less_Or_Equal &amp; Page_Fault_In_Nonpaged_Area.<br />
<br />
Bluescreenview lists ntoskrnl.exe in every crash but sometimes in the "Caused by driver" section it lists amdppm.sys \ ndis.sys Ntfs.sys and hal.dll but in all cases ntoskrnl.exe is second in the file name.<br />
<br />
I had PowerISO installed and after reading it can be a issue I uninstalled it, I updated nearly every driver I could think of. I ran Memtest86 4.0a and it would freeze up after 1 and a half passes, After 3 tries I ran the other version on the .ISO which i believe
 was 3.86b and it ran 16 passes no errors, I also ran CHK DSK twice and neither time found anything. I am really at a loss as to what the issue is, I would send it back to the company I bought it from but have already had to get a loan from my disablilty pension
 for the $400 in shipping the first time and really can't afford to keep sending it back.<br />
<br />
Update:<br />
Windows Update popped up showing 7 updates available to download:<br />
<br />
Security Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package<br />
<br />
Security Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack 2 for x64-based Systems<br />
<br />
2x Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems<br />
<br />
Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack 2 for x64-based Systems<br />
<br />
Security Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package<br />
<br />
&amp; Optional - Realtek - Network - Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller<br />
<br />
I set these up to Download and went to bed, Upon coming back my PC appears to have BSOD again and I could not get passed the Windows password screen after many attempts, sometimes it BSOD before it got to that.<br />
<br />
I did a system restore to yesterday and Startup repair prompted me to to fix errors, I ran it and after about 10minutes got a error<br />
<br />
Problem Event Name: StartupRepairOffline<br />
Problem Signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385<br />
Problem Signature 02: 6.1.7600.16385<br />
Problem Signature 03: unknown<br />
Problem Signature 04: 8<br />
Problem Signature 05: AutoFailover<br />
Problem Signature 06: 1<br />
Problem Signature 07: 0x7f<br />
OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.2561<br />
Locale ID: 1033<br />
<br />
Edit: To further rule out RAM I used 1 stick last night and got the same BSOD then changed to the other stick and it happened again.<br />
<br />
Further edit: I have reinstalled Windows 7 and the BSOD has happened again 4 times so far<br />
<br />
Not the most tech savvy but any questions \ information you require I can try find<br />
Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.<br />

    <title>High memory usage Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High memory usage Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I bought my wife a Lenovo Flex 3. I have Windows 10, only Microsoft Edge and Avast Anti-virus. This computer has 30 GB hard drive. Right off the bat it is showing that 27 GB are being used and consequently she keeps getting "low memory" warning. I've gone
 through her memory but can't find what is eaing it up other than the following:</p>
<p>Sys 32 4.66 GB, 17,&nbsp;481 Files, 1132 Folders</p>
<p>SysWoW 64 - 1.25 GB, 5,396 Files, 322 Folders</p>
<p>WinSxS - 6.77 GB, 71,179 Files, 20,066 Folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why these folders are using so much. I know that it is common for the WinSxS folder to be larger and from what I've been able to find out the other two folders are not excessively large.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the rest of her computer and checked the memory usage of each section but nothing else stands out. The totals for the 3 folders above are roughly 13 GB. If anyone has any insight on this I would be grateful.</p>

            <p>30 GB storage, that's <em>it</em>? Why do OEMs sell such rubbish, and more importantly why do people buy them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Memory refers to RAM; what you're seeing is high disk space usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you run Disk Cleanup yet? (Press the <em>Clean system files</em> button before selecting the options.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run TreeSize Free <em>as admin</em>, scan the drive and sort by folder size to know which ones are truly the most bloated. Provide a screenshot if you want us to look into it further.</p>

            <p>Yes, I did the disk cleanup first and I also looked at installed programs to see if there was anything there that wasn't recognized or necessary. I eliminated and cleaned up everything I could think of. I ran the TreeSize and am including a screenshot of
 the results. Please let me know what else. Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>~9.7GB for Windows on a ~27.1GB drive isn't bad at all. If you ran Disk Cleanup as admin or selected
<em>Clean system files</em> and then all the options shown, it should have <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/delete-windows-old-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
gotten rid of the $Windows.~BT folder</a>. Try running DC from Safe Mode as admin and see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can optionally search for <em>Create a recovery drive</em> using the Start Menu search and once the drive's created (keep it safe!) it should get rid of the Recovery folder (at least that was the way it worked in Win8.x).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run <a href="http://www.homedev.com.au/free/patchcleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PatchCleaner</a> to move/delete orphaned installers from Windows\Installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try all those and see how much space you manage to free up. Ultimately though ~27.1GB is just too small. Perhaps you can toss in a 64/128GB SD card or something and see if you can uninstall some software and install them on the card instead.</p>

            <p><span><span><span>First, note that the term "memory" is used to refer to the place where the computer holds the program and data it is working with at the moment. It's normally random access memory (RAM), but that can be extended with
 the page or swap file on the hard disk. The word "memory" is never used to refer to the space on a drive (whether that's a hard drive, SSD, diskette, CD, DVD, or thumb drive). Space on a disk drive is normally called "storage" or simply "disk space."</span><br />
<br />
<span>Calling disk space "memory" isn't so much wrong as just unconventional. In a sense, disk space is, of course, memory, but the important thing to realize is that the word is never used that way, and if you do so, you do it at the
 risk of seriously confusing your audience.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Second (related to the above), if she is getting "low memory" messages it is referring the amount of RAM she has. You didn't say how much she has, but my guess is that if she is running Widows 10 on a computer with
 32GB of disk space, she has very little RAM. She should have at least 2GB for decent performance.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Last, 32GB of disk space is a tiny amount these days. I would never recommend that anyone have less than 500GB, and 1TB or more is even better for almost everyone.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>xbox one controller not syncing or connecting to console - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            xbox one controller not syncing or connecting to console</h2>
                    <p>Just recently, I turned my xbox one controller on, to play a game, and it flashed for a while, then turned off. I charged the batteries, but it did not work. When I try to sync it to my console, it doesn't work, either, it just rapidly flashes, then turns
 off. It is happening with both my controllers, too. When I turn my console on, it comes up with a screen saying "You'll need internet for this", but I can't push cancel, because my controller isn't working. I know that my console is connected to the internet,
 because I haven't played with the settings, or with my wifi box. Please help, as I cannot use my xbox. Nothing that I search up helps, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Lazybro</p>

<p><span>Hi jthomasrn:</span></p>
<p><span>It looks like your having more of a “Print Shop” problem then a Windows problem. If you would put your “Software” Media in to the Drive, when it auto plays
 exit the auto play and boot your Windows Explorer. Locate the Drive and SETUP program, right click and click on “Run Compatibility”, if this doesn’t work, the see this KBA to see if it will help

<p><strong>No, you are not going to get that message. Also Windows 8 and 8.1 users will be eligible for Windows 10 when it becomes available this summer.
</strong></p>
<p>And going back to 8&nbsp;and then coming in off an upgrade to 8.1&nbsp;may be something I might prefer - get rid of some junk.
</p>
<p><strong>You can download Windows 8.1 with Update&nbsp;1 and do a direct upgrade to it:</strong></p>

The new downloader allows for selection of:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>⦁</span> Language </p>
<p>

<p><strong>No limitations, but the earlier the better as it pertains to support. Microsoft has not set any expiration when Windows 8.0 users can upgrade to Windows 8.1.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been having some problems with starting applications from Windows Live Essentials 2012.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to start any of them up, this error shows:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83563b3b-5241-4bc1-a06a-a52601348b07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83563b3b-5241-4bc1-a06a-a52601348b07" /></a></p>
<p>I tried changing compatibility of the programs, installing DirectX versions, and even more</p>
<p>This error happens to nothing else on my computer at all.</p>
<p>My OS is Windows 10 Pro(x64)</p>
<p>I did a clean upgrade from a disc from Windows 7 professional</p>
<p>any suggestions to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Why would my DVD drive suddenly start ripping incredibly slowly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why would my DVD drive suddenly start ripping incredibly slowly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been ripping CDs recently and for a while they were ripping at a pretty fast speed, however, I've come to do it today and they will not rip above 1x speed, which is obviously stupidly slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made absolutely no changes to the PC or the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried restarting the PC</p>
<p>I've tried other CDs, including ones that previously ripped at much faster speeds a couple of days ago,</p>
<p>I've tried using various software to rip the CDs, and tried altering the setting within the various programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anyone have any idea why this would happen? and if there is any solution to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Neither of these methods had any effect unfortunately, the troubleshooting simply said something along the lines of "some hardware changes may not have been detected", and the drivers are all up to date&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. What happens when you try to open ASPX files?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;</span>Do you get any error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ASPX is a file extension used for files that are of the Active Server Page Extended type. These are WebPages which
 are made using Active X scripting, and which are based on the Microsoft ASP.NET programming framework. These WebPages are generated by Internet servers. The ASP code is created by the Internet server, and then is interpreted as HTML by the web browsing program.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try following these steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Internet Explorer. You can do this by clicking on the shortcut from the desktop, or by opening it from the "Start" menu at the lower left of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on the "File" menu. It will be located at the top left of the Internet browser's main window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 "Open File" from the "File" menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 your ASPX file in the pop-up window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 "OK."</span></p>

            Thank you Srinivas KR for such prompt response. I am going to print out your solution methods for future reference when my symptoms come back as I have to use Murphy's Law if it's not broken, don't fix it philosophy. As of yesterday's and today's point
 in time there has not been an occurrence but when it does manifest itself again, as it has already in the past ... then I will follow your trouble shooting methods to try to get to the route cause.
<div><br />
<div>So I would like to pause and park this community issue "pending" rather than "Mark as Answer". I will provide you my feedback to you once the concerns happen to disrupt the stability of the Win7 OS. I am also waiting on getting a 2nd opinion from Bleeping
 Computer.com and also Major Geeks on what their insight into the problem could be ... but I really have to insist since you are the OEM that your input should carry more of a reliance upon providing the correct diagnosis of the root cause and the solution.
 More importantly, I am not sure I understand how productive or time consumptive it is by putting it into safe mode because that is more a a test environment that is completely different from it's normal operating fully functional state.
<div><br />
<div>So my only question to you is, did you take the time to review the log information from Speccy on my Operating system along with an entire report from MiniToolBox? Or did you just respond with a "blanket script" that MS Technicians use as the cadence to
 set the agenda by having everyone go down the standard path despite when I have provided you very specific Windows error log notices on Application and System errors? I have no way of telling whether these detected errors caused the application to crash or
 whether they were warnings in which the application or system files were still operational but maybe their functionality was impaired prior to it repairing itself (either with or without a reboot).</div>
<div><br />
<div>My premonition is mostly with the very first Application error as it seems to correspond with my Explorer hanging and having to consequently reboot the computer for it to restore itself back to stability until some other trigger happens to put it into
 an unstable state again.</div>
<div><br />

Please advise me what your thoughts are on the logs which may be a tell tale indicator or what the specific cause of the problem is as I have no way of interpreting what all of these machine language codes actually means? &nbsp;It may be that your have already given
 this some analysis since you have included the two articles:</div>

I am just concerned this may be a hodgepodge of things to try to see if any of them work with the downside risk that rather than making it better it could also make things worse. I certainly don't want to waste my time on these methods if the answers are right
 in front of us from those logs! Thank you!</div>

<h3> mikeproberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Easier &#40;2 click&#41; Shutdown system&#63;</h2>
                    Can I make the power button bring up the shutdown&nbsp;options with a hover or alternatively can 'power' be called shutdown with a twidly if one wants to restart (as W7).&nbsp; The Windows 10 system requires 3 clicks to shutdown while Windows 7 required just two.&nbsp;
 This is just another agravating factor where W10 seems a downgrade rather than an upgrade from W7.&nbsp; If I am missing something please let me know.&nbsp; Mike

            <p>Why so much effort to click 2 times when you can click only once ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a shortcut to a command line window ( "DOS-Box" ) and execute the shutdown command inside. You may need to execute this as an Administrator ( configure the shortcut accordingly ). Also,&nbsp;with this solution, I counted&nbsp;the needed double-click as single-click
 only. However, even&nbsp;when you count a double-click as two clicks, this solution meets your expectations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have no idea how to further minimize the shutdown efforts&nbsp;( without any click, just by intuition or so ). In case of enlightment I will let you know.</p>

            Thank you for your suggestion.&nbsp; If I have this right it will involve double click for the shortcut and then '/', 's', 'enter' to shutdown.&nbsp; This looks more effort than W10s 3 clicks.&nbsp; Please add clarification to your suggestion if you think I have missed
 something.&nbsp; Mike

            <p>You are welcome. I needed to test this and here is the implementation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) create a new directory with a name of your choice, e.g. "mycommands"</p>
<p>2) in this directory, create a file with the name "down.bat"</p>
<p>
</p><p>contents of the file "down.bat":</p>
<p>
</p><p>@echo off</p>
<p>shutdown -s -t 00</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) create a link to this file on your desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you double-click this link, the command will shutdown your computer immediately. Modify "down.bat" for reboot, time-outs, whatever you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way you can automate many processes in case you want / need to.</p>
<p>

            The other reply had a link that explains this system in more detail.&nbsp; I had not realised one could enter the shutdown -s -t 00 directly as the 'address' of a shortcut.&nbsp; Then add a nice red power icon and leave in on the desktop or drag to start menu or
 task bar.&nbsp; Also works with Windows 7 which is where I am about to return because W10 has no favorites menu option on the task bar (and the so called quick menu needs twice as many clicks as W7) and recent docs also&nbsp;need a click to appear.&nbsp; Really disappointed
 with W10.&nbsp; Why Microsoft removed&nbsp;several great simple features that work so well beats me (and surely would not need much space to have&nbsp;retained).&nbsp; Easy browsing is a critical requirement for any OS.&nbsp; Tried W10 on my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a&nbsp;new hard drive for my
 PC&nbsp;that I was going to use for a fresh W10 but is now&nbsp;going to have&nbsp;a fresh W7 and I hope MS see the light before W7 support runs out in 2020.&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>You can't just copy DVD's as a file to your computer.<br />
What you can do is make an .ISO file of the DVD to your computer for burning over and over.<br />
Note you will NOT be able to add files or video to the newly created .ISO.<br />
<br />
Use a program called Nero or a program like it.<br />
You can find Nero at Nero.com version 9.<br />
They have trial versions for download.<br />
If your computer is&nbsp;from someplace like a big computer store you may already have Nero.<br />

<strong>DID NOT </strong>come back on. If this is a bug.... <strong>FIX IT</strong>. Its not a driver issue,&nbsp;it is not a user error. Stop giving people round about answers trying to make it seem like its not the OS when most people already know it is.

<p>I'm sorry, but I didn't realize brand new meant only one day.&nbsp; And when I received my new laptop one of the very first things I did was create a resore poiint so even one day later I would have had a restore point to use - and that was possible here as well.&nbsp;
 I'm sorry that wasn't the case.</p>
<p><span>If the System Restore option isn't available, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE)
 or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, you can try going into the BIOS during bootup (the proper key to push will appear on the screen to enter boot menu or boot setup - try both in turn if both appear. It is possible that the BIOS contains an option to disable the keyboard
 (that may have been activated by the onscreen keyboard but not changed when you deactivated the onscreen keyboard) and you may need to re-enable it manually.&nbsp; This is admittedly a remote possibility but it is an option to try.</span></p>
<p><span>Another option to try is to setup a new user account which has never used the onscreen keyboard and see if the regular keyboard works when you login to that
 account.&nbsp; If so, you can just treat the original account as a corrupt account and use the following procedures to effect the transfer.&nbsp;
<span>
To fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope one of these procedures helps.&nbsp; I'm apologize if they
 seem "generic" but we don't really know what the problem is - especially since the system is new.&nbsp; We're trying to both identify the cause and repair the problem at the same time using the procedures we have available.&nbsp; I suspect there is a registry tweak
 that will fix this problem but I went through the entire registry and although I found many keyboard referencers, I could find none that seemed to control whether or not to enable the primary laptop keyboard (though it may have been in one of the entries that
 was coded in binary that I could not read).&nbsp; It' possible someone who knows more about the registry will reply to this thread with a suggested modification (or maybe another solution).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope one of the solutions I proposed works.&nbsp; Please post
 back in any case so we'll know whether or not to keep searching for an answer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>Hi All, I have a Synology DS413j NAS and I was initially very disappointed the Xbox One did not have the capability to browse my NAS and select movies/music as I did with my 360. &nbsp;I have the DS Video and DS Audio apps on my iPhone/iPad provided by Synology
 and have found that I can select the Xbox One from within the app and stream direct - it works great - just thought I would post this for any other Synology users out there.</p>

<p>I stream movies and TV shows directly to my Xbox One from my Galaxy S4. I discovered it by accident on the 360. I immediately tried to do it when I got the X1 and it didn't work. But then I remembered whenever I was streaming something to my 360, it always
 said I was using xbox video. So I downloaded that app on the X1 and now I can stream whatever I want.</p>

<p>Hi All, I have put in a request for adding DLNA Client support with Microsoft support. &nbsp;It works on a voting system to give priority. &nbsp;Please follow the link and use your votes to raise the priority status to get the Xbox One doing what it should of out
 of the box. &nbsp;Thanks! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there, you can only play original Xbox games on the 360 that are on the following link, which unfortunately the warriors is not one:
