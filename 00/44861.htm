<h2>            The Windows Store &#38; Windows Versions</h2>
                    <p>Wouldn't it be a nice additive to have a SEARCH option in the Windows Store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is, I very seldomly go to the Windows Store (app in Windows 8 and above) to get specific apps. This is because I loathe wading through screen after screen of 'app topics' like Productivity, Leisure, etc. Then having to select a sub-category like Paid,
 Free, etc. then, advancing from screen after screen of apps searching for the particular app I'm looking for. Microsoft should incorporate a search engine into the Windows Store app to search it's repository of available apps. This would cut down on the search
 process and allow you to 'get back to work!'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain there many others who feel this way, so step up and join in convincing Microsoft to start the process of incorporating this idea into the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings me to the availability of certain apps. I am running Windows version 8 [MS Windows version 6.2 (build 9200)], and when I do go to the Windows Store, the first thing I am presented with is 'Update Your Windows to Windows 8.1 - for free.' This
 is all well and good for most if not all users of Windows OS users. However, the constant reminder on the opening screen is a bit ridiculously redundant! Also, to obtain certain apps you 'must' update to Windows 8.1. This, to me, seems like 'force feeding!'
 Both Windows versions (v8 &amp; v8.1) run the (almost) exact same platform. So we as faithful users (of WindowsÂ®) should not be forced to obtain a version we either don't want, don't like or are just reluctant to upgrade/update. Now, if I'm not mistaken, Windows
 8.1 is basically a base version of Windows 10 (which incorporates 'Cortana', which I refuse to use - at this point). I have the privilege of running both Windows 10 (on my Windows Tablet PC) and Windows 8 (on my full blown Laptop). I have been in contact with
 Microsoft Support about getting rid of Cortana on my Tablet PC, but that's not possible - according to the support person. So, I had to disable it! On my own. PC's and technologies enter the market at an alarming rate as it is and we are forced to 'settle'
 for whatever or whichever OS in pre-installed on the device. We must re-learn the intricacies of actually navigating the new OS interface... Ok, this is getting lengthy and defeating my purpose. I have but the two issues to be discussed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) a search tool in the Windows Store</p>
<p>2) being forced to update/upgrade the OS just to obtain certain and specific apps from the Windows Store</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Very many of the unobtainable apps from the Windows Store can be found, downloaded and installed on your device from the Internet. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS! Do not attempt unless you are certain you are knowledgeable enough
 about Windows, programming, crash prevention and system restoration.</p>

            <p>Hello there, Bill. Thanks for the update on Win8, 'cause I didn't know that. However, Windows is Windows, right? And the Windows Store is still in-use in Microsoft's &nbsp;latest Windows version (10). My issue is really with the Windows Store no matter which
 version OS you might be running. A nice little app search engine would be most efficient and effective for every level of user. The more streamlined and user-friendly the OS and its navigation would draw more users into 'liking' the Microsoft OS even more.
 I've used Microsoft products since the advent of Windows 95, and haven't thrown in the towel yet. I think a search utility/engine would be a nice 'enhancement' to the Windows Store.</p>
<p>On the other side of update/upgrade enhancements, I think that Cortana should not be integrated into the OS (ver 10), but rather give the user the option to use or not use it. Some old die-hards like myself feel more comfortable using what we know, instead
 of going through the learning process again and again with each new release/version. It should be about user-friendliness to lower the learning curve. Then, after more familiarity (at one's leisure') with the new Cortana, the transition would be almost seamless
 for the user. I'm purchasing a new laptop and it has Windows 10. Not that I want to but I will have to learn to use Cortana. That doesn't mean I can't rely on or go back to my old faithful Windows 8 laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, I can be quite chatty!&nbsp;</p>

                    I have Vista and am attempting to upgrade to Windows 7. When I insert the Windows 7 installation disc the following README TXT message comes up. "This disc contains a "UDF" file system and requires an operating system that supports the ISO-13346 "UDF"

            There are a number of possible applications you may have installed. Nero 7 and others, for work with that drive. You will know what you have by looking in the Programs and Features app in Control Panel. I would try removing those kind of applications one
 at a time and restart to try the disk.

                    I do not want to have to log in each time I start my home computer or laptops as they are only used at home&nbsp; I am not a company and no one else has access to my computers so why do I have to do this. I am seriously&nbsp; considering getting rid of Microsoft

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with login of the computer. I will certainly help you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you able to boot to the desktop environment?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you facing this issue in local account or Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you are able to boot to the desktop I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Run </strong>by typing <strong>Windows+ R</strong> key.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>netplwiz</strong></p>
<p>3. Uncheck the Users must enter a username and password to use this computer.</p>
<p>4. Then click on apply and then <strong>ok.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If you canât access the system, I suggest you to go to Windows Recovery Environment and use the Command Prompt there, which is elevated.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:-</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <strong>Shift</strong> and <strong>Restart</strong> from the power icon (together)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong>Select <strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to <strong>Advanced Options.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>An user account with the name Admin will be created. Log in with that account and you will be able to access Admin privileges. You can also create more Administrator accounts with that account. I suggest you to do the same steps which I have given in
<strong>METHOD 1 </strong>to disable the password for that particular account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful regarding login of the computer. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, weâll be glad to assist you.

<h2>            Touch screen not working in full screen programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; I have a pretty much brand new Surface Pro 6 and it seems to work all fine, the touch screen and touch pad on the keyboard cover responding as intended.&nbsp; However things break down when I load a program that runs in full
 screen mode, like many games.&nbsp; The game runs fine and the touch pad continues to work but however the touch screen does not.&nbsp; Any movements on the touch screen are so greatly magnified that it's practically impossible to do anything but trace the cursor around
 the edges of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's acting very much like it thinks the screen is still running at full resolution, but these programs are very low res so most of my physical screen translates to locations off the edge of the game.&nbsp; Indeed if I put my finger at the center of the screen
 and move it extremely slowly it is possible to get "normal" cursor movements.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version<span> </span>10.0.17134 Build 17134</p>
<div>
<p>I have run windows update and made sure the touch screen's drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said this seems to be happening with any program that runs in full screen mode with low resolution but, to give examples, I have run into this problem with the games "A Golden Wake" and "Primordia" among others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there and thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; Unfortunately no luck so far.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>No change after a restart.</li><li>I got into the UFEI but wasn't sure what good this would do me.&nbsp; I can't run the programs where this problem presents itself in UFEI so I couldn't really test it.&nbsp; However the touch screen did respond well in the UFEI, though that said it responds well
 in normal windows so no surprise there.</li><li>The Surface Diagnostic Toolkit found no issues.</li><li>I mentioned in my original post that I had run windows update so on running it again, it found I was already up to date.</li><li>And restarting again made no difference.</li></ul>
<p>I uninstalled a couple of things as you suggested but my Surface is practically brand new so there's not much on it and it's certainly not running slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a little progress of my own however.&nbsp; I found at least one low-res, full screen app that does work with the touch screen - ScummVM so that suggests it's not such fundamental issue. I also found an option to run one of the programs I mentioned - A
 Golden Wake - in windowed mode.&nbsp; Not what I want to do, but it does fix the touch screen issue.&nbsp; Advice on another forum suggested that the problem might be programs that use an old version of the SDL dll.&nbsp; Indeed I have a copy of a old game from gog.com that
 uses the DOXBox emulator, which in turn makes use of this old dll and has the problem I am talking about.&nbsp; Swapping out that version of DOXBox for another that uses a newer SDL dll didn't fix the issue - it made it worse; program still played correctly with
 the touch pad but seemed to completely ignore the touch screen.&nbsp; However that does at least suggest that the touch screen doesn't play well with SDL.&nbsp; However I haven't been able to confirm that the other programs with this problem also use SDL.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion but again, no dice there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two games I mentioned in my first post aren't even that old. A Golden Wake was released in 2014.&nbsp; Not new, though older than Windows 10 so I guess compatibility could be an issue but I'm still surprised that I should have this much trouble.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's frustrating is that it works with the touchpad and I had assumed the touch screen would just send normal mouse input, so it should all just work.&nbsp; I guess that was a foolish assumption, but it does create a "so close but so far" feeling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Guy Corbett-Cox,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late response. In this case, we will need to reinstall the touchscreen driver and you may follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the&nbsp; search box on the taskbar, type <strong>device manager</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> in the results.&nbsp;</li><li>Expand the <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong> category.&nbsp;</li><li>Right-click <strong>HID-compliant touch screen</strong>, select <strong>Uninstall device</strong>, and then, in the Uninstall Device dialog box, select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. If you see two HID-compliant touchscreen drivers, right-click the first, select
<strong>Uninstall device</strong>, select <strong>Uninstall</strong>, and then repeat the process for the second driver.<br />
</li></ul>

</span>
<ul>
<li>Restart your Surface. It will automatically download and install the touchscreen driver when you connect to the Internet.&nbsp;</li><li>Use touch to open an application like Edge or a web browser, and try to scroll, pinch to zoom, swipe&nbsp;in from the right, and long press&nbsp;to test touch functionality.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the outcome.&nbsp;</p>

            Agreed.&nbsp; It seems really unlikely that reinstalling drivers would do anything, and testing in Edge feels redundant as it already works there.&nbsp; However I guess I will give it a shot tonight.&nbsp; I am confused though, surely it's not the responsibility of the
 program to support touch screen input?&nbsp; Obviously a program can be made with the touch screen in mind, and can add specific support for it for added usability, but if it's not made like that then the touch screen should still work fine by virtue of behaving
 like a mouse?&nbsp; Any Windows program more that a few years old is unlikely to have bespoke touch screen support, so surely apps should not have to care, just as they don't have to care whether input is coming from a mouse or touch pad.&nbsp;

            <div>&gt;surely it's not the responsibility of the program to support touch screen input? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>it's more a screen resolution/design thing. If you change the Surface's screen</div>
<div>resolution to 1920 x 1080, touch may work in these games as expected. Lots of</div>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all the suggestions so far, but I've still had no luck.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling drivers but it made no difference.&nbsp; Nor did reducing my resolution to 1920 x 1080 help.&nbsp; It didn't seem to even make it less pronounced as I had
 expected but that was hard to judge.&nbsp; Regardless the programs continued to work correctly with the mouse pad, so there's no evidence of usability issues that change with resolution - the touch screen simply doesn't respond correctly, seemingly regardless of
 resolution.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also tried changing my screen scaling to 100% in addition to dropping the resolution just in case that was the cause.&nbsp; Still no improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have however found a free-to-download program that manifests the issue.&nbsp; If any other surface user would be willing to try downloading it and seeing whether the touchscreen also misbehaves for them, that might help confirm whether the
 issue is just with my device.&nbsp; The program I found is a free game made with AGS, the same game making software used for a number (but not all) of the other games I have found with this problem. It can be downloaded here;</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to the issue? </div>
<div><br />
2.&nbsp;Are you trying to install the game using CD/DVD? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A cyclic redundancy error like that is usually caused by either a scratched or dirty disk or a laser misalignment on a DVD drive. Look closely at the disc and see if there are any scratches\dirt on it that might be the cause. If they are not too bad try
 cleaning the disk and retry the install. If the disk is bad, I would sugest you to duplicate the copy of CD/DVD and then try to install the game.
<br />
<div>It can also occur when you have a faulty hard drive and when the game is trying to write the files to the hard drive. Follow the method given below to troubleshoot for the issues related to hard drive.
<div><br />
Method 2:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It might be that some data that is present on&nbsp;hard drive is corrupted. I would suggest you to check the drive for errors. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you have checked the drive then try to install the game.</div>

                    <p>Best whoever is going to help me,</p>
<p>After stopping with playing for some time because of school and such, I tried to login again today. but for some reason I can't seem to login with any of my passwords I usually use, very annoying but I thought I could just reset it, after trying that I find out that my phone number, reset email and probably some other info have been changed. also whoever did that put on 2FA authentication so I can't reset it with filling out the form. I had sent 2 forms but then got an email that microsoft will ignore them if 2FA is on. how can I solve this? I really want to start playing again and now I can't play any games or play on my saves. (this is my backup account)</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Flickering screen in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i have one big problem</p>
<p>My Windows Media Player didnt work, when i open it it freeze my whole laptop, so i decided to reset it.</p>
<p>I opened <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and i clicked<strong> Turn Windows features on and off,
</strong>and then i unchecked windows media player, then i clicked ok, and then i restarted my laptop. When i booted it again, and logged in, my screen started flickering, and i dont know what to do. Its doing that every 15 seconds, so i cant open control panel
 to try to fix that by turning windows media player on again. D u know what to do, i tried booting in safe mode but its still flickering. I really dont want to lose all my data by reseting my Windows :(</p>

<p>try to power cycle your console. Please hold down the power button on the front of the console for approximately 15 seconds until the power light shuts off. Wait about 60 seconds, then power it back on. Be sure you see the green "XBOX ONE" animation loading

 up helping was clearing out all the dust that had built up inside the console. I used one of those compressed air dusters you get for using on PCs, unplugged the console and took it outside. Sprayed the compressed air through the vents and a whole chunk of
 dust cleared out. After that, the wifi was working fine again. Might have been a complete coincidence though!</p>

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

You may need to repeat doing a System

<h2>            WD MyBook File Permissions Issue &#47; WD Customer Service No Help</h2>
                    <p>I was told by WD support that my issue wasn't a WD product issue, but a Microsoft Windows issue. I'm using Windows 10. My WD MyBook external will allow me to drag and drop files from the external to my desktop, while denying me access to others. I get this
 notification on some files, "File Access Denied: You'll need to provide administrator permission to copy this file"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the admin on my account, and ownership of the drive has been claimed, though, for some strange reason it says SYSTEM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have experience with this? I have some incredibly important files that I can no longer access.</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are unable to transfer some files from an external hard drive to the computer requesting for Administrator permissions, I suggest you to follow the steps provided below to provide administrator permissions to the particular folder and check if it
 helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right click <strong>on the folder</strong> and select
<strong>Properties.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on <strong>Edit</strong> button in Properties windows. Click ok to confirm UAC elevation request.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Select <strong>user/group </strong>from permission windows or click
<strong>Add</strong> to add other user or group.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now under Permission section check the rights which you want to grant i.e. check âFull Controlâ under the âAllowâ column to assign full access rights control permissions.&nbsp;(Generally
 we add âEveryoneâ to given permission to all the users on the computer).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Edit the permission to Full Control for â<strong>Everyone</strong>â.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click
<strong>OK</strong> for changes to take effect and click ok again to exit from Properties window.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for&nbsp;further assistance.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    I am trying to create a kiosk environment in my Surface RT, so I've created an account to use for Assigned Access. When I go to select the application this account will have access to, the program I want to choose, Internet Explore, is not part of the
 list of programs to choose from. How can I include Internet Explore on the list? I have Internet Explore installed in this tablet.

            <p>Hi Anders,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to set the Immersive Internet Explorer (Modern IE) as the default application to be used in the âAssigned accessâ account. You might not be able to find the Internet Explorer in the âChoose an appâ list if it is a new account and you havenât
 signed in to the new account yet. If you have created a new user account and if you have set it as an assigned account, you wonât be able to see any app when you click on the âChoose an appâ list. You will have to sign into the new account first which where
 Windows will install the apps for that account. If you sign out of the account after first use and then try choosing the app, you will see the Immersive IE in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already used the account and yet IE is not displayed in the list, then the Immersive IE might be turned off in that user account. Log into the user account which you want to set as assigned account and check if you are able to access the Immersive
 IE from the start screen. If desktop IE opens when you click on the IE tile in the start menu, then it is possible that IE is not set as the default web browser. Set IE as the default browser and then check if you are able to access the Immersive IE. If yes,
 go to the administrator account and then see if IE is displayed in the list of apps. Refer to this article to set a IE as the default we browser:</p>

            Great. Let us try finding any bad driver.
<br />As no drivers were named, 
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier:

<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<p>Ok, so I ran into some issues. I couldn't get out of the crash loop and it wouldn't let me restore using a restore point. I had to wipe my drive and re-install windows again to get out of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-did the driver verifier and checked it was working with the verifier/ querysettings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time it didn't crash immediatly on start up and I got the "driver not less than or euqal to" when it crashed instead of the previously mentioned "detected violation". I have uploaded those dump files onto one drive under the folder driver verifier dumps.</p>

            Looks like a full memory dump is needed to be examined. No real help in minidumps.
<br />From C:/Windows/
<br />Copy the file named memory.dmp to the desktop, ZIP it and share it through Onedrive.

                    <p>The only way I seem to be able to get the background to be transparent, is by making my picture into a sticker. I want to be able to use this as a cover for an electronical story I am writing on Episode Interactive so I want to put my sticker on the background

<p>Hi Pinkii2005,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate that you are a part of the community. We love your idea of being able to save the sticker(s) that you've made on a 3D project elsewhere, using the Paint 3D. However, to save it as how it was formatted to be able to use it on a specific purpose
 cannot be done as of now. therefore, we recommend you to raise this as a feedback: In Paint 3D, go to
<strong><em>Menu &gt; Learn and Feedback</em></strong>. You you can send one by following the steps here:&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Send
 feedback to Microsoft with the Feedback Hub app</a>.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're using another program on making a book/story cover, both Microsoft Paint 3D developers and the third-party program maker should work together for the programs to meet both ends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All the best to you,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Difficult NAT Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samkowalczyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difficult NAT Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Alrighty then, so here's a list of things that are currently facts:</p>
<p>-I have a Linksys WRT54G router</p>
<p>-My XBox has a static IP address</p>
<p>-I currently have the proper ports forwarded for the XBox's IP address</p>
<p>-I also have my XBox's IP set as the DMZ host</p>
<p>-I have UPnP enabled on the router</p>
<p>-I have tried both hardwiring the XBox into the router and using a wireless adapater</p>
<p>-And yet, my NAT stubbornly remains "Moderate"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would not be a problem if not for the fact that it prevents me from connecting to games with, literally, almost every single one of the friends who I actually care to play with. I have tried all the standard NAT fixes mentioned here and elsewhere (you
 know, the ones with step-by-step picture guides that are narrated by Bill Nye), and, while I can get a problem-free NAT on any other machine on my network (mostly Macs or PCs), the XBox refuses to get with the program.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are over configuring your router, your are using UPnP and forwarding and a DMZ so the router is getting very confused as they all provide the same service for the xbox. Use only one of the methods, use UPnP only with no forwarding or DMZ and with the
 Xbox ip address on auto. If that doesn't work turn off UPnP set a static ip address and use forwarding, if that fails turn off UPnP and forwards and use the DMZ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart your router after making any changes</p>

<p>Although you took, what i believe from reading your post, was the proper approach, i think your problem may lie in having both port forwarding and UPnP enabled. For routers, having multiple networking options of Port Triggering, Port Forwarding, and UPnP
 are all nice and dandy. But, you only need to pick one or the other, otherwise this could create problems.
</p>
<p>Try picking just UPnP first and only that, (while leaving all other options alone, off, or defaulted), as it usually just fixes it on the spot and it simplest to do for basic internet users. On a side note, you may want to get back a dynamic IP setup on
 your Xbox 360 before trying UPnP. I wouldnt take my word for it, but just as a word of caution.</p>
<p>If this doesnt work, turn off UPnP, and then only reenable only port forwarding as you have previously setup before, then try again. Side note again: Switch back to Static IP for this part, but i believe you may know what you're already doing at this point.</p>
<p>If any of these options dont work or show improvement in your NAT, you could take it up with your ISP. But i hardly doubt it will get you anywhere as they may or may not throw you into steps i laid out or the ones you have already tried. Otherwise, NAT's
 just seem to change sporadically depending on the area the network traffic in your area.
</p>
<p>Hope this or anyone else's suggestions help you out!</p>

<p>Success.</p>
<p>After disabling UPnP and DMZ, setting the IP to static, and hitting the proper ports between the eyes at a thousand yards, I finally managed to get that little thing in the corner to say "Open."</p>
<p>Now, solutions like this have worked in the past, only to fail me later. However, the fragile 'Open NAT' crown which now sits atop my XBox managed to survive a restart or two, so things are looking optimistic.</p>
<p>For now, solved. Much obliged, folks.</p>

<p>1) Go to the Security tab, then the Firewall section. Uncheck "Filter Internet NAT Redirection" and click on Save Settings.</p>
<p>2) Go to the Administration tab, then the Management section. Set UPnP to Enable. Click on Save Settings. This will cause your router to cycle, so you may momentarily lose your internet connection.</p>
<p>Retest the network on your Xbox 360 and NAT should be listed as Open.</p>

<h2>            Slow Firewire 800 Transfer Speed</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 7 and have found the same firewire card I used in Windows XP now runs at half the speed of USB 2.0</p>
<p>Any ideas about this issue and what I can do to fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

2. Click Manage-&gt; Click Device Manager.<br />
3. Expand IEEE 1394 Bus host controllers.<br />
4. Right click your FireWire host controller.<br />
5. Click Update Driver Software.<br />
6. Click Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
7. Wait to see if a more current driver is found.<br />
8. If one is found, click Close and test out to see if your speed has increased.</p>
<p>If you already had the most current driver/the speed didnât increase:</p>
<p>1. Click the Start-&gt; Right click Computer.<br />
2. Click Manage-&gt; Click Device Manager.<br />
3. Expand IEEE 1394 Bus host controllers.<br />
4. Right click your FireWire host controller.<br />
5. Click Update Driver Software.<br />
6. Click Browse my computer for driver software<br />
7. Click Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer<br />
8. Click 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy)<br />
9. Click Next.</p>

                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the fact that I only need an HDMI connection to my monitor and it does video and audio. The problem is when I use skype, it has this label telling me that the speakers are muted. &nbsp;They aren't really, but I have to endure the little message. &nbsp;I hear
 the other person just fine. &nbsp;Is there any way to acknowledge that message and not see it any more?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see this message within the Skype app itself?</p>
<p>Does it happen if you are using a headset, earphones or external speakers maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you provide the Skype version you are currently using? (<strong>please specify the version number</strong>)</p>
<p>

<p>I'm talking about when I use the Skype application on macOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype version 8.18.0.6<br />
Calling version 2018.11.01.10</p>
<p>macOS version 10.13.4</p>
<p>MacBook Pro 15 inch early 2011</p>
<p>It does not appear when I am using a headset, earphones or external speakers if these are attached to my Mac directly.</p>
<p>This does happen when I connect a headset, earphones or external speakers (I have used both external speakers and earphones) connected to the audio out port on my monitor, which is connected via mini display port to HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can get rid of this label if I connect my speakers directly to my Mac. &nbsp;That is how I have had my system for years and years. &nbsp;I was so happy that I could connect my speakers to my monitor and then have the sound go through my HDMI connection, since
 it meant one less cable connected to my computer - and one less to plug and unplug each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Mac cannot control the sound output levels when my audio goes through displayport/HDMI. &nbsp;I need to adjust the audio levels using my amplified speakers.</p>
<p>In fact, when I look at my Sound preferences in System Preferences, when I select my HDMI monitor, it says "The selected device has no output controls". &nbsp;It does not say something like "The selected device is muted". &nbsp;</p>

<p>The sound comes out of the speakers which are connected to my monitor.</p>
<p>My monitor is connected to my computer via HDMI</p>
<p>The computer cannot control the sound volume on the speakers, no matter what I am listening too (Skype, iTunes, Facetime, iMovie, Audacity, system beep, email notifications, etc).</p>
<p>The speakers or audio volume are not muted, as Skype thinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audio just cannot be adjusted from the computer.</p>
<p>Plug in a Mac to an HDMI monitor, then put speakers onto that monitor.</p>
I just want a way to turn off the message. &nbsp;

<p>The message is just incorrect in Skype, that's all. &nbsp;The sound works fine. &nbsp;I just have to control the sound from my speakers directly, but that's no problem. &nbsp;The audio works the same for all applications. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update 1803 failed on a BitLocker drive -- Rollback not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troubled_yet_bewildered  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1803 failed on a BitLocker drive -- Rollback not possible, reset not available, everything is stuck and corrupted</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>Important note: my C drive (Windows installation drive) and F drive both have Bitlocker turned on.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>When I turn on my computer now, I am not asked to provide my BitLocker password for C drive!!!</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest update (1803) failed mid-installation (around 60%) and it was stated in a message that Windows will rollback to a previous installation. Seemingly, that has also failed because I am now continuously thrown into the blue "Recovery" menu where I
 have to "Choose an option". But in that menu NOTHING works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly four options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Choosing "<strong>Continue: Exit and continue to Windows Rollback</strong>" does nothing and simply restarts the computer and takes me to the same menu again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "<strong>Use another operating system: Continue with another installed version of Windows</strong>" takes me to a window where I have three options:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <strong>Windows Rollback</strong>. It does not work just as the one mentioned above..</p>
<p>- <strong>Windows 10</strong>: On volume 2. This takes me to my lock screen (my personal wallpaper shows up there and it requires my Windows password!) and then a screen shows up where I receive the usual greetings when Windows is installed/updated. Then
 everything is done and I am in the desktop environment, but nothing works and I keep getting errors that this and that are not found. Explorer does not work, start menu does not show up, NOTHING is functional, absolutely nothing. A heavily corrupted installation
 of Windows is only there..</p>
<p>- <strong>Windows 10</strong>: On volume 2. Same scenario as above.. A corrupted Windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. "<strong>Troubleshoot: Reset your PC or see advanced options</strong>" gives me five options:</p>
<p>- <strong>System Restore: Use a restore point recorded on your PC to restore Windows</strong>. This asks me to enter the Recovery key for my
<strong>F drive</strong> (NOT C drive)!!! And when I do it simply takes me to a Window where I am given three options exactly as the ones outlined above in point 2 (Rollback and 2 Windows 10 on volume 2 options!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Go back to the previous version</strong>. Takes me to a Window again identical to the one outlined in point 2 above..</p>
<p>- <strong>System Image Recovery</strong>. Same as above again!..</p>
<p>- <strong>Startup Repair</strong>. Same as above again!.. I tried "Windows Rollback" in this one and interestingly unlike others this time it did something and tried "Diagnosing" but in the end it failed and I got a message that repairing was unsuccessful
 and some log files have been saved on D drive.</p>
<p>- <strong>Command Prompt</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4. <strong>Turn off your PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>1. What can I do? How can I solve this issue? The system seems to be stuck in a limbo where NOTHING is possible. Everything I try in the Recovery menu fails. And I have no reset option..</p>
<p>2. Can I access and unlock my C drive to get my files at least in any way? </p>
<p>3. Can I deactivate BitLocker on C drive through the command prompt above (point 4)?</p>

            Nothing works. sfc, chkdsk, dism.. Tried all of them and I am still in the Rollback loop. I even tried "Upgrading" with a USB drive containing the latest Windows 10 Pro ISO and I get an error when I try to do the installation.

<p>So Microsoft forces Windows 10 users to install all these buggy updates without even doing a full requirement check of the system BEFORE the update without even creating a restore point and then breaks the system of the user and doesn't even care about the
 end-user on their own official forums? Just perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I signed into the corrupted "<strong>Windows 10 on volume 2</strong>" (point 2 in my original post) and then used a USB thumb-drive that had the latest ISO (created using the
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a>) on it and then did an "Install and keep all my files and apps/programmes". Well, this was the only thing that worked. I got everything back and all my files and programmes were intact and untouched after the installation through the
 USB drive. However, after a couple of restarts and hours of usage, I now have corrupted Windows Apps, that is to say, I cannot open "Settings" or even the "Start menu" and anything that is an "App" by Microsoft's definitions. I have already tried DISM and
 sfc and nothing has fixed the issue.</p>

            Hi troubled, I have an almost identical issue. When you signed into windows 10 on volume 2, how did you use the iso usb drive? I am unable to even open windows explorer, on this windows version.

<p>Got this (sort of) resolved, by using a fat32 USB with a windows installation on it, created on another PC with the windows media creation tool.</p>
<p>Rebooted the broken comp with the drive inserted, and a screen came up saying something like "it looks like you started an upgrade and booted from a USB drive - hit yes to continue the upgrade (which always goes to the recovery screen options and rollback
 failure loops) or hit no to do a new windows install."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose no, and did a custom windows installation on the C:\ drive (although I think on that screen, they don't list your drives as numbers - had to make an educated guess based on space left on each disk....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow - the end result was a fresh windows 10 install, and I just had to copy everything from my old user folder in the windows.old folder on the C:\ drive, to my new user folder. And reinstall all the programs....but at least the files are there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still unsure what caused windows update to break this badly - super frustrating.</p>
