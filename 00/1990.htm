<h2>            can&#39;t copy files to storage card</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
When the mobile device running WIndows 6.0 is commected to my laptop, I can see the storage card on the laptop windows explorer. I can delete, move and rename files on the mobile device from the laptop. But I can't copy files from the laptop to the storage
 card although I did this already some time back (otherwise obviously there wouldn't bee anything on the storage card ;-). Drag and drop does'nt work, nor does copy and paste. Thks for your help.<br />

                </div>

            Are you opening it so you can see the contents of your storage card?&nbsp; You will get the crossed circle (mine is red) if it is not opened.&nbsp; Once you can see the files , you should get the "+" showing you can drag and drop.

            It might be "call divert", which means all your incoming calls are redirected automatically to other number, usually to your voicemail. To check the status of diverting choose Settings from menu, &gt; Call settings&gt; Call divert&gt; ... &gt;Check status or if you

I think it means you tried to send a message but it didn't go, maybe because you were out of range. You will find it in your outbox. Either send it or delete it and the icon will disappear!<br />

            Khursheed, this is an issue of your network operator Ufone (Pakistan). Please, contact Ufone or directly your service provider (if different from network operator) to get more information about this call forwarding. Some operators use a dummy number to
 create the SMS when your phone number is called, while your phone is turned-off. Some network operators ignore GSM commands and still forward. In both cases, you have to contact your provider to remove this forwarding manually. Because I am not a customer
 of Ufone myself, I do not know the exact answer to your issue. Anyway, was this helpful already?

<p>**************************************************</p>
<p>I got rid of this problem, here's how:</p>
<p>I saw a mysterious message in my 'sent items' box '55668 OTP ******'. I deleted this mail and hey presto!!! The freaking up-arrow-in-a-pot vanished.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards I got a warning mail from my banker that my request for third party transfer using the OTP (one time password) sent my them, cannnot be honoured.</p>
<p>I guess it might have been a spam message or so. Whatever it was, I was able to get rid of that icon.</p>
<p>If it helps you, please respond suitably!</p>

<h2>            PR 1.1 Orientation</h2>
                    
<p>Ugh, another PR 1.1 problem.&nbsp; It sometimes out of the clear blue, thinks I am holding the phone as portrait when infact I'm holding it as landscape, and I have to then shake it hard to get it to go back to landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm cussing at this phone at this point, it cost me an arm and a leg to buy, and it SUCKS worse now.</p>

<p>I am still on PR1.0 but what Inx64 says is one of the many problems with my phone. Quite often when I am in portrait mode the phone without warning changes to landscape mode and then the only way I can get it back is to shake it all over the place. I have
 had so many problems with this phone that I have gone back to my trustee X6.</p>
<p>At the present time I have not had the update to PR1.1 and I am seriously considering complaining about this phone to:</p>
<p>1. The Office of Consumer and Business Affairs.</p>
<p>2. The ACCC</p>
<p>3. The Telecommunications Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia I want my money back as this phone is not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>My recommendation after three months of ownership is do not buy an N8 or any Symbian 3 device.</p>

<p>So, tonight my N8 advised me there's an update. I let it perform it (Pr1.1) and suddenly the orientation sensor quit working. Having found this thread, if I shake the phone vigorously it can be made to go landscape again, but if I turn it portrait it won't
 go back to landscape without a good shake, which is just ridiculous.</p>

<p>Turn the phone off and remove the battery for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>You can't remove the battery on the N8 but you can simulate a reboot by pressing and holding the power key for around 8 seconds until the phone buzzez 3 times in quick succession.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, but why would Nokia customer support say remove battery, and not that?<br />

Clearly not trained for the job correctly.

<p>Because that is the standard rebooting procedure for all the other phones. They are probably so used to saying that and they forget that the N8 and now the E7 are different.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You said you typed "=A76". The correct formula is =A76 note there are no quotes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. maybe the cell was formatted as text. Select the cell, right click, format cells and select 'general'. Now tap F2 and enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Maybe you're worksheet is set to display formula nd not results. Hold down the CTRL and tap `</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ` symbol is to the left of the 1 key.</p>

            <p>I found the answer.&nbsp; It is because Outlook 2013 defaults to the iPad mode so there will be more space between folders for the fingers.&nbsp; If you right-click on the down arrow by the Quick Access Toolbar in the upper left corner, then select Touch Mouse mode,
 it will put the little icon on the panel.&nbsp; Then select the icon and select Mouse Mode.&nbsp; That will close up the panels considerably.&nbsp; I was on the phone with Microsoft for some time today, and they said there was no way to do it.&nbsp; I'll tell them.</p>

<h2>            Extra Writing Space and Pen Input in OneNote 2010</h2>
                    
<p><span>I'm trying out the OneNote 2010 Beta and I have a problem adding extra writing space. I can add space just fine, but doing so switches from pen input to a regular cursor, just as if I had clicked the "Select and Type" button in
 the drawing tab. I'm using a tablet and handwriting is my primary type of input, so after every time I add extra space, I have to manually re-select the right pen. This is a major interruption of workflow.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Is there any way to make it switch to the previously selected cursor type instead, just like it did in ON 2007?<br />

<p>When I tab the keyboard for further options, almost all options are disabled, hence I could not tick/untick.</p>

<strong>Store</strong>&gt;<strong>...</strong>&gt;<strong>check for updates</strong>. How about the phone software, do you have the latest software version installed on it? We look forward to your reply. ^_^

</p><p>I just got a new laptop. There were built in microsoft offices. I entered the product key came with the laptop but i am unable to activate offices as it is saying that this product key can only be activated in certain geographical regions. Now tell me what
 to do to activate offices.</p>

            <p>If the installed Office and its key are not valid in Taha's region, the phone activation isn't likely to be any more successful than the online one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be possible to get a different key that is valid, or the whole Office installation may need to be replaced, depending on whether the installed software includes features that can't be exported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, I believe the responsibility for providing working software belongs to the manufacturer or vendor of the laptop, because the Office license is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) license.</p>

            <p>It could be that your keyboard&nbsp;shortcut that uses the Delete key has been modified.&nbsp; Here is how to see if that has happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[1]&nbsp; Open Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[2]&nbsp; Click on File -&gt; Options.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[3]&nbsp; click the "Customize Ribbon" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[4]&nbsp; Click the "Customize . . . " button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[5]&nbsp; As shown below, scroll down and select "All Commands", and then scroll down and select "EditClear".&nbsp; If your Word installation is working with the default values, you should see "Del" in the Current keys box (as is circled below).&nbsp; If you&nbsp;don't see
 this, then you can use the "Customize Keyboard" dialogue box to fix it.&nbsp; For more information on this, in Word help, type "customize keyboard shortcuts".</p>

<h2>            Malware injection has damaged system restore&#39; and regedit for 64-bit Windows 7 -how to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Two days ago my anti-malware product stopped an attempted diversion/redirect when I was doing research a friend asked me about. &nbsp;The product and producer are noted, screen capture done, but the safety/privacy sw said to report this as a false positive with
 the next upload or update.... &nbsp;A bootscan was also recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC was shut down, with bootscan set to launch next time PC was stated. &nbsp;Which I did the morning of Christmas, running the boot scan successfully and well as full system scans for an admin &amp; a 'stduser' account. &nbsp;Everything was reported as "ok" - no hits,
 nothing quarantined, nothing remarkable or any changes which I had not authorized /programs installed but not authorized, etc : all three scans (bootscan, 'an admin' and my standard user account "full system scans" were all run and nothing &nbsp;was found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite these results the utility "Hitman Pro, 3.0- 64-bit still in the registry, and when I went to do a system restore point prior to editing the registry I found this malware had at some point in the past 24-36 hour since the "false positive" attack was
 blocked, something like the pcspeedup malware injection had also altered Chrome "opening tabs also blocks "System Restore" [error code "Access is denied. (0x800700005) for the admin a/csin this 64-bit Windows 7o/s so the first "page" was a mocked-up fake system
 scan report from 'pcspeedup' reporting lines and lines of horrible problems with this computer - attempting to scare a user into doing a full startup scan, into purchasing the 'full' version product, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have material quarantined in the "Hitman Quarantine" but the "PCSpeedup" still shows up on a rescan by Hitman, and Hitman cannot remove or quarantine it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Is booting into safe mode, or into repair mode the better option for scrubbing the system another time?</p>
<p>2. What is the value in quarantining a potentially harmful file instead of deleting it, if their malware status is confirmed.</p>
<p>3. If anti-malware s/w tells the user to report a harmful &nbsp;file as a "false positive" what type of error (TYPE I or II) is this; more critically it seems the label of 'false positive' invites a user not to be concerned - sort of doubling down on user's danger
 rather than a more conservatine "unclassified" or "unknown" status would == would be more appropriate?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Safe Mode</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>In addition to that, quarantining a threat restricts it's activity, stopping any harmful activity by that application on your PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Run a Virus Scan</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would recommend you to run a complete virus scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner. It will scan the computer for viruses and malicious programs. To download it and know more about it, click on the link below.</span></span></p>

            <p>Sahil Bali,</p>
<p>Thank &nbsp;you for the response with your suggestions, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I was asking about the distinction, if any of running in Safe Mode vs. Repair Mode, two approaches suggested by different posts on MS technet and in the community forums - thought I had expressed my query more clearly, my apologies for not being clearer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.0.1 issue reasked/retry - since apparently, both Safe Mode and Repair Mode (both chosen after using the "F8" to interrupt normal startup with autologons, etc. are capable of permitting the user to again activate or unblock System Restore I asked about
 the pros and cons of one versus the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.0 When I tried the link you suggested, <a href="http://safety.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://safety.live.com/</span></a>&nbsp;, that URL was redirected to another site, https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx which my browser blocked because it said there were unauthorized(?) scripts on the page attempting to
 load (?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.0.1 reload and retry - again let me try to clarify what I did:</p>
<p>As suggested when the hit took place I did a boot scan which was clean, as well as a full system scan on the admin/owner account and standard user accounts, both of which were clean as well.</p>
<p>2.0.1.1 &nbsp;HiJackThis scan was also performed, and there were no &nbsp;entries associated with the apparent malware "pcspeedup" or the nominal publisher/website offerring this freeware, and nothing in the "04" class of items which another poster on MS Community
 forums wrote were the area to be concerned about;</p>
<p>2.0.1.2. &nbsp;Another poster suggested the use of a cloud based utility, Hitman Pro r.3.7.12 Build253 (64-bit) which I ran when the installed anti-virus antimalware program in 2.0.1 above found nothing on the boot scan or full system scan of admin and stduser
 accounts.</p>
<p>The results were truly staggering: Hitman found</p>
<p>2 Threats</p>
<p>106 Traces</p>
<p>Scanned 1,845,916 Objects</p>
<p>Scanned 62, 384 files</p>
<p>Remnants Scanned 595,013 files/ 1,188.519 keys</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 Threats Quarantined:</p>
<p>C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\befajjeffi.exe &nbsp;647,720 bytes</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\HJlrETK1\setup.exe</p>
<p>note: additional details provided in Hitman Log; these entries were found "Valid" by authenticode, RSA Key Size both 2048 and &gt;Kaspersky: .... not-a-</p>
<p>It appears these elements were quarantined in the&nbsp;</p>
<p>"C:\ProgramData\AVAST Software\Avast\chest but the install for "pcspeedup" was somehow cloaked or stealthed to do its work the next time the system was restarted and the default browser was opened - &nbsp;as described in the original post - opening an 'apparent
 scanning report' stating numerous CRICITCAL threats had been found (non matching the HiJackThis or HitMan Pro results) and which recommended purchasing the full version of "pcspeedup" in order to do an extensive cleanup of so many problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.0 HitmanPro removed the threats and traces, enumerated above in &nbsp;when that step of the process had completed, details previously summarized in&nbsp;2.0.1.2. above.</p>
<p>4.0 &nbsp;System Restore was not working, but rescan with Hitman Pro as well as another Avast bootscan and Avast full system scan of Admin/Owner account and "StanUser" were without any 'hits!'</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: In my original post I asked what purpose quarantining, or as some 3rd party products offer a "attempt to repair" feature; &nbsp;I don't believe you addressed the reason NOT to just nuke the offending material, after
 submitting sample of it to the user's deignated safety-privacy s/w product?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SORRY but for some reason the underline choice above will not be cancelled?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cutting this short for that reason.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>5.0. System restore is working, apparently, upon restarting the computer after the second round of Hitman Pro and Avast bootscan+fullsystem scans of admin/owner and stduser a/cs after Windows was started again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.0 The possible appearance of "pcspeedup" in AUTORUNS was checked with SysInternals Autoruns utility, but was not found to be present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.0 &nbsp;System Restore is working again, will do a stress test after this posting is completed to follow up on the the matter, but have already created two new restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>new 8.0 &nbsp;this may be a no-brainer: checking the admin/owner and the stduser accounts to verify their designation, access control and privileges: I found the standard user account settings were intact, however when I opened the admin acct settings I found
 it was 'stuck' if that's the right term on "standard user" and could not be changed;</p>
<p>8.1 The further examination of user accounts privileges showed, for the first time in my experience, "Trusted Installer" in the Security Tab; "Trusted Installer" was via properties tab said to originate from "C:\windows\sysnative" where the folder and file
 size were both "zero [0]" and there was no date available for it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;"TrustedInstaller" account is apparently a valid account class for Windows 7, but with the Administrator accounts not having access to it and the associated apps and applets it is not an approach I am comfortable with, even though I have an NVIDIA
 graphics card upgrade, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why is there a need for such a class when an administrator class exists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.1.2. &nbsp;By temporarily elevating a user account to administrator class, then switching users, to open that user account, I was able to switch the Owner-Administrator from a "user" account back to Owner-Administrator "administrator" but when I switched back
 to the 'owner' account and opened the "User Accounts" the tile for "Owner" subtitle said it was an "Administrator" however changed the account type was clicked the "Owner" tile opened to show it was seen to be a "Standard User" with no ability to change it
 back to "Administrator [NOTE THIS MAY BE SIMPLY A MISCUE ON MY PART DUE TO MISUNDERSTANDING THE LOGIC INVOLVED: PERHAPS IF IT SAYS IT IS AN ADMINISTRATOR TYPE ACCOUNT AS SUBTITLE ON THE TILE, THEN THE ONLY POSSIBLE ACCOUNT TYPE CHANGED WOULD BE TO A 'STANDARD
 &nbsp;USER'; THEREFORE ONE CANNOT CHANGE IT TO ITSELF?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>BEFORE MY THOUGHTS BECOME TANGLED, IT SEEMS THE HITMAN PRO HAS DETECTED AND REMOVED AND REPAIRED THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE MALWARE WHICH INJECTED THE INSTALLER FOR "pcspeedup" [note - this is s/w which is 'green lit" or still noted as safe on many sites despite
 the actions described here, and which a few reporting sites have picked up on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do about being unable to access the Safety Scanner Service,&nbsp;<span><a href="http://safety.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://safety.live.com/</a></span></p>
<p>by S. Bali. &nbsp;It would seem the HitmanPro scan has accomplished much the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have to sign off and post now.</p>

<h2>            Would I lose my software after upgrading my win8 to 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I would like to participate in windows program insider, but I'm little confused. Because I do not know whether or not &nbsp;I'll lose my programs such as Microsoft office after updating to windows 10. By this I mean what would happen to my programs
 and what I would encounter after updating to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

 to go into a boot loop or have other critical errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only have one computer, you should not put it on the insider program - put it on a spare/extra computer that you don't need.</p>

    <title>Spreadsheet refuses to edit in Excel Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darklilcorner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spreadsheet refuses to edit in Excel Online</h2>
                    <p>We have an Excel spreadsheet that has been saved with macros disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we view the spreadsheet in Excel Online, it says that there are unsupported features.
</p>
<ul>
<li>We attempt to make a copy and replace the existing file.</li><li>The new copy, however, asks to make another copy. </li><li>We do, and replace, but then it just asks to make another copy when we try to open it.</li><li>Making a new copy without replacing yields the same loop.
<ul>
<li>unsupported features</li><li>attempt to make new copy</li><li>continues to ask if we want to make new copy</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Solutions tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear browser cache
<ul>
<li>No effect</li></ul>
</li><li>Open in Excel and save.
<ul>
<li>No effect (still says it has unsupported features in Excel Online)</li></ul>
</li><li>Upgraded browser (chrome)</li></ul>
<p>Other spreadsheets work in OneDrive and Excel Online, it's just the one file. We can view it fine, just can't edit it online.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, this does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restate: The problem is that when we attempt to save a copy without the feature causing the problems - Excel Online gets stuck in an endless loop of "making a copy".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a good answer would be some link or instruction as to where to go in Excel Desktop that turns off "Shapes and Other Objects" so that we can save there and then try to edit in Excel Online. This is a bigger worksheet and we would rather not lose anything
 to trying to paste the cells to a new spreadsheet. Further, it would be nice to know how to prevent this problem in the future by knowing what it is that I can disable in Excel Desktop that causes this looping problem in Excel Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<h2>            10130 hangs at very start of install</h2>
                    I've never been able to install 10130.&nbsp; It hangs at the very start of installing/upgrading wphether from the automatic download or the ISO.&nbsp; Now for some reason I cannot access my backups either so I cannot restore my computer.&nbsp; It continuously shows either
 the Windows 10 logo and nothing else or it says something about starting a repair operation if I reboot.&nbsp; It alternates between these two screens.&nbsp; None of the fixes posted here has any effect.&nbsp; Is there a solution or will I have to install Windows 7?<br />

            <p>I've been trying for the last two weeks to get 10130 to install. I finally gave up waiting for an Enterprise Edition ISO and decided on going to Pro Edition instead. At first my computer did not go past the swirling Windows Logo thing when I booted into
 the DVD.&nbsp;One part of the solution that worked for me is listed&nbsp;below as it was taken from another thread,&nbsp;the second part&nbsp;was added&nbsp;in&nbsp;by me:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BIOS setting "Non-Execute Memory Protection" must be set to ENABLED</em></p>
<p><em>(Had same problem myself! - have a search on "Boot Loop")</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The setting does work. The only problem is it may not be an obvious setting in the BIOS. I found mine hiding under "Execute Disable Function" with a sub-label of 'No-Execute Page Protection Technology." Once I enabled it, I was able to boot from the
 ISO and install 10130-Pro Edition with no issues.&nbsp;My Enterprise Edition&nbsp;still refuses to upgrade, no ISO's have been released for this one yet.</em></p>

            <p>Because antivirus products embed deeply into the operating system, it is normal for products that work on version x to not work on pre-releases of version x+1, or even sometimes on production version x+1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS will work with the antivirus providers and they will release Windows 10 versions at or after Windows 10 goes RTM. Speak to antivirus suppliers now and most will say they have no plans to release anything prior to the final release of Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, just rely on Windows Defender.</p>

<h2>            JW Library - latest update using too much mobile data, why&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Since last update (the one that announces, that Windows 10 will be required for next update) there is something strange happening. Several times a week JW Library suddenly uses
 approx. 20 mega if my mobile data without any reason. It mostly happens in the morning, when I am in tram (no wi-fi) on my way to work and open the app to read daily text.
</span><span>I finish, close JW Library and notice my available mobile data have just droped by 20 - 21 MB and the info about applications and their use of mobile data shows, that JW Library
 downloaded them. </span><span>Downloading using mobile data is disabled in the app, of course. There is no automatic publication download feture within the app anyway... I suppose the app
 is always checking for news, to update list of publications, or something, but 20 MB is too much data.</span></p>
<p><span>When I have noticed this problem first, I had Windows Phone 8.1. I upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile last week and the problem remains. I upgraded without back-up, so all applications
 are freshly downloaded and installed.</span><span>I did not have this problem before, neither with previous versions of JW Library, nor with any other application.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does anyone have this problem too?&nbsp; Any idea, what is going on? :(</span><br />

I have Lumia 830.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Office 365</h2>
                    <p>We have installed on 8 computers Office 365. Out of the 8 computers 2 have problems with Excel, Word, Outloock (only on 1with Outloock). Our computers are all the same brand with the same Windows 7 installed at the same time.
</p>
<p>After 2 weeks, our outside sourced IT haven't been able to solve the problem. Of course we have unistalled Office 365 several times and reinstalled it. Looking at the community it seems that it&nbsp;is a fairly commun problem. Very frustating indeed as we cannot
 use our work stations.</p>
<p>Anyone knows a possible answer?</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Please try to perform a quick repair of your Office.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

    <title>Page numbering, &#34;Page x of y&#34; Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcf_writer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page numbering, &#34;Page x of y&#34; Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 17 page report; the first page is the cover, so is not numbered ("different first page" and a Section break Next Page).&nbsp; From there I want to number the pages "page x of y" - the problem is the report is 16 pages but with the cover, the document
 is 17 pages so it formats "page x of 17" with the last page ending up as page 16 of 17, due to the section break after page one.&nbsp; How do I make this "page x of 16" other than manually entering (and having to change every time a page is added or subtracted)?</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;help appreciated.&nbsp; I can no longer&nbsp;find the'advanced' page number formatting&nbsp;info&nbsp;that I used in previous versions of Word; the only&nbsp;formatting available seems to be the ultra simple tab on the Design ribbon.&nbsp; Good for most things, but no nuance or advanced
 features available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>You can just select the { NUMPAGES } field and then press Ctrl+F9 and it will then be enclosed in { { NUMPAGES } } and then you can add the = and the - 1 in the required positions.&nbsp; That is, the Cut and Paste is not required.</p>

<blockquote>Using <strong>ALT+F9</strong> to display the <em>Field Codes</em> rather than the<em>Field Results</em>, modify your page of pages statement to be,
<p>{ PAGE } of { = {NUMPAGES} - 1 }</p>
<p>This will require a special technique. Highlight the {NUMPAGES} field and Cut it (e.g. CTRL+X). Press CTRL+F9 to create a new field. Just typing the<em>braces</em> will not suffice. With the cursor inside the field braces, type /=/ (equals) then paste (CTRL+V)
 the {NUMPAGES} field in. Type a /- / (minus) and a /1/ (one).</p>
<p>Your own fields may have extra number formatting involved. Press ALT+F9 again to toggle back to the /Field Results/, highlight the fields or press CTRL+A (/select all/) and press F9 to /update fields/.</p>

<p>Using<strong> ALT+F9</strong> to display the<em> Field Codes</em> rather than the<em> Field Results</em>, modify your page of pages statement&nbsp;to be,</p>
<p>{ PAGE } of { = {NUMPAGES} -&nbsp;1 }</p>
<p>This will require a special technique. Highlight the {NUMPAGES} field and Cut it (e.g. CTRL+X). Press CTRL+F9 to create a new field. Just typing the<em> braces</em> will not suffice. With the cursor inside the field braces, type<em> =</em> (equals)&nbsp;then
 paste (CTRL+V) the {NUMPAGES} field in. Type a<em> -</em> (minus) and a<em> 1</em> (one).</p>
<p>Your own fields may have extra number formatting involved. Press ALT+F9 again to toggle back to the<em> Field Results</em>, highlight the fields or press&nbsp;CTRL+A (<em>select all</em>)&nbsp;and press F9 to<em> update fields</em>.</p>

Enjoy your Windows 10! AS for suggestion about the OS, I recommend that you use the feedback app.
