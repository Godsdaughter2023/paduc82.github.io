<h2>            Strange behavior on upgrade to 14931 and sfc &#47;scannow fails even in safe mode&#58; how to repair&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to 14931 a couple of days ago and found the upgrade stuck at 80% with no cancel button. Left it that way for 12 hours with the same so I used the power button to restart. It said it was rolling back but winver shows 14931.1000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there was some odd behavior booting, where only a blank black screen after entering password to sign on to Windows. &nbsp;So I ran SFC /scannow. First time it quit at 20% with&nbsp;"Windows Resource Protection could not perform the required operation". &nbsp;Next
 I ran it after a boot into safe mode with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the errors from the failed unit of work from the log. &nbsp;How do I repair?</p>

<p>
</p><p>After installing Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 my screen flickers when using Powerpoint.</p>
<p>When using powerpoint every 10-15 seconds the slide-panels on the left and the slide i am editing get white and refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried the following:</p>
<p>-Updating the video card driver</p>
<p>-Repairing Office 2016</p>
<p>-disabling hardware acceleration in Office Powerpoint</p>
<p>-Re-installing Office 2016</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you are experiencing this issue with Microsoft PowePoint is due to some incompatible video configuration on your system. To further troubleshoot this issue, we suggest running the
<span>Office Configuration Analyzer Tool (<strong>OffCAT</strong>). This tool can determine if your
</span><span>current video configuration is compatible with Office.</span><span> </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run OffCAT, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Visit this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and then click on
<strong>Download </strong>button.</li><li>Select <strong>OffCAT.msi</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Run </strong>when you are prompted to download the OffCAT tool.</li><li>Once the OffCAT is installed, launch it by searching OffCAT using <strong>Cortana</strong>
<strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>NEW SCAN</strong> page, select <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Scan</strong>.</li><li>When the scan is finished, the results will be displayed.</li><li>In the <strong>All Issues tab</strong> (if issues were detected), review the list of symptoms.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you'll see the </span><span><strong>Hardware acceleration is disabled by Office
</strong></span><span><strong>warning </strong>under the&nbsp;</span><strong>Display</strong><span>&nbsp;symptom, your current video configuration is not compatible with Office. In this case, y</span><span>ou'll have to wait for 30 days and then update your video driver
 again.</span> <span>By that time, </span><span>your video manufacturer may have an updated driver that is compatible with Office.</span>
<span>If you'll not see the <strong>Hardware acceleration is disabled by Office</strong>
<strong>warning</strong> under <strong>System Details section</strong> of the OffCAT report, disabling the
</span><span>hardware acceleration in Microsoft Office should address the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update us about the results.</span></p>

    <title>Account Locks After Azure AD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account Locks After Azure AD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck in a problem and unable to find to way out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two to three weeks back we have configured AD Pass-through&nbsp;with seamless SSO which was successfully&nbsp;deployed but after some time our OFFICE365 and LOCAL AD account for random users are blocking we have raised SR and found that it's due azure and calling
 computer against&nbsp;event id 4625 is Azure AD machine so further&nbsp;after more diagnostics I found that some of the users account are accessing from unknown/anonymous location which not belongs to us also for some users I asked that they are not using a type of
 Proxy VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having a challenging issue on one account on which I have blocked OWA and Active Sync also removed all credentials from his computer but still his account is accessing from unknown/anonymous location resulting&nbsp;block of account although Azure Smart
 lock is configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me how can I move forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps what we did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On AD domain joined PC make entry required for SSO</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Enable an Internet zone policy setting through Group policy.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Why we needed to do this first is because by default, the browser automatically calculates the correct zone. Browsers will not send Kerberos tickets to a cloud endpoint, like the Azure AD URL,
 unless you explicitly add the URL to the browser's Intranet zone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, to get this to be seamless for your users, you need to add
</span><a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fautologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cv-abjame%40microsoft.com%7C45566a8b75e64679593c08d612260f2e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636716352043270515&amp;sdata=9vbfKTc79mqyw1qSATUSuVJxoUt04NW9o5gwU%2Bd9VYo%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com</span></a><span>&nbsp;to
 your local intranet zone.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>I would also recommend adding&nbsp;</span><a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faadg.windows.net.nsatc.net&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cv-abjame%40microsoft.com%7C45566a8b75e64679593c08d612260f2e%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636716352043280523&amp;sdata=Oz5ZeVN1f8QZ1nFuxQx8Zg63ib9J7fj617S1llSago0%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net</span></a><span>&nbsp;to
 your local intranet zone, as&nbsp;autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com&nbsp;is a CNAME of it.&nbsp; Once you do that, your browser will see that web site as "internal" and will send your Kerberos ticket to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. AD Smart Lock</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. For one user block Active Sync and OWA</p>

<p>Hi Osama,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support. Glad to reply to your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue has been dedected as one of the Azure AD account is accessing from unknown/anonymous location, my suggestion is to make this user's account identity (credential) to be more secure if we know this behavior (accessing from unknown/anonymous
 location) is not done by the user himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, in Azure AD environment, there are several types of risk events, ie, leaking credential, signing in from anonymous IP addresses, signing in from unfamiliar locations, etc. And for detecting the user's signing in from an unfamiliar/anonymous location,
 the suggestion is to enable modern authentication for that user. For more information, you can refer to<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risk-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risk-events</a>&nbsp;(Sign-in
 from unfamiliar locations).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, as you mentioned that you have raised a SR, I'd like collect the SR number so that we can go through the whole process of the SR and monitor the SR if it hasn't been closed. For protecting your privacy, you can provide the SR number in the&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/new">Private
 Message (PM)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p><span>Hi Osama,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your update as well as the Private Message.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For your current situation, that is some specific user is blocked in Azure AD due to detecting the user's signing in from unknown/anonymous locations. This is expected if an user will be blcoked due
 to the signing in behavior is detected to be against the signing in policy. And, your current settings like "Smart Lock" are all served for stoping the user from signing into service (blocking the account) if he is detected as violating the signing in policy
 but not opening the gataway for signing in. That is why the user is still blocked after he is detected signing in from unknown/anonymous locations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be noted that it is Azure AD is doing the good thing about keeping your account to be secured while detecting the signing in behavior. What we can do is to unblock the user who has been blocked.
 For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-unblock-user" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-unblock-user</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On another hand, since the SR status is open, it means our engineer is still working on it. So, my suggestion is you can continue to communicate with the SR engineer for avoiding the replicate work
 here if the issue hasn't been resolved. Meanwhile, I will also monitor the SR and update it here once there is any progress has been achieved. Thanks</span></p>

<h2>            Flashing the EMMC.</h2>
                    
<p>As the title says. Just how important is it to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the 2 updates I have done I haven't bothered to do so, and everything has worked fine. Or am I living life on the edge and tempting fate by standing on one leg?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did have a scare about an hour ago. Noticed the little Mediaplayer desktop widget was blank, started Media player and it couldn't find any tracks or videos. Then I realised I'd just installed MussOrgsky and hadn't yet done a restart. :smileyindifferent:</p>

            eeep.. you will have stuff left over..<br />
<br />
but you're probably ok..<br />
<br />
The emmc stores installed apps and settings and application data..<br />
So, imagine you installed blahapp..<br />
<br />
blahapp is put on the emmc, but it is referenced by the main OS rootfs (hence you can see an icon for blahapp on the application menu)<br />
<br />
If you reflash the OS, the phone no longer knows about blahapp.. the package manager won't show it as installed and you will no longer have an icon to launch it..<br />
<br />
But..<br />
<br />
all its files are still on the emmc.. why would they be removed.. you only flashed the OS!!<br />
<br />
So.. they might be stagnent and eating space, but it probably won't cause you problems if you haven't already seen them..<br />
<br />
It's when people flash the os and there are broken files on the emmc that the os tries to use.. this causes reboot loops and stuff.. all very bad.. but as you're going, you're probably ok...<br />
<br />
I'd recommend flashing the emmc to anyone looking to flash their phone, though.. just incase it seems to "brick" it..

<p>Ahhhh, I see (said the blind man).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence it's similar to uninstalling a program from Windows. All you're removing is the icon and link files that tell Windows it's there. In reality it is still there but because Windows can't see it it doesn't count it and will eventually overwrite it
 as you use the PC.</p>
<p>Surely Maemo will do the same.</p>

            it won't nessarily overwrite it.. for example, if you had gltron on PR1.1 then reflashed to PR1.2, gltron and its other packages would lurk.. but unless you re-installed gltron it would never get overwritten..<br />
<br />
However, if you reinstalled then re-removed gltron.. it would be gone.. if you see what I mean..<br />
<br />
The big concern for me is settings files..<br />
<br />
What if a settings file was added by a package.. and something else sees and tries to use that file.. but finds the rest of the software has gone (or isn't recognised).. it might lead to problems..<br />
<br />
I'm paranoid like that though ;)<br />

<h2>            How do I retain quick parts and auto texts in a copied word template&#63;</h2>
                    I have developed some word documents with quick parts and auto texts. I ahev saved them in PC as 'Word Templates (.dotx). These templates will need to be mail merged using another program. However, anytime I copy the template, the quick parts and auto
 texts disappear. I have not saved the quick parts in 'building blocks' or 'normal' location. Instead, they are saved in the 'specific templates'. Is this the reason? Is there a work artound or suggested fix. Help please. My weeks of work is now in jeopardy
 as the efficiency gain is about to erode with loss of efficiency if I cannot mail merge

            Saving the Quick parts to the same template name should work. As long as the file has already been saved as a template you should not have a problem saving quickparts or autotext to the template as long as the name is in the "Save in" field.

<p>Thanks Rohn007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be missing a step. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am opening the word template to appy mail merge, then save it at a different location as&nbsp;a&nbsp;template&nbsp;(.dotx) again. However, as mail merge is applied on number of documents in bulk, the saved documents are given different names for identification purpose.
 This is when the quick parts disappear. When I open the saved and mail merged documents (not the original template), there is no quick parts.</p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are, where you started, which OS you are using, if you are installing for the first time or re-installing or upgrading or what, so we'll start at the beginning and see if that works.&nbsp; This is not a commonly seen error and so there
 are no set procedures specifically designed for it occurring with MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>T</span></strong><strong><span>hen, restart your PC if you made any changes at all.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. We need to uninstall because you tried to install, so we want to get rid of whatever may have already installed. Because it didn't fully install, you may need to use some of manual unininstall methods (or
 only be able to use the manual uninstall methods). To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>

    <title>Has floppy support been removed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sega dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has floppy support been removed&#63;</h2>
                    Has floppy support been removed? I tried my USB floppy drive and the Windows Technical Preview doesn't have a driver for it. The drive has always been plug and play. I realize almost no one uses floppy disks today and that they are long considered obsolete.
 However, there are still some people who use floppies for one reason or another. It was nice to have the option. On Windows 8.1 the drive used the driver "sfloppy.sys" in&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\drivers. This driver is not present in the Windows Technical Preview.
 Has anyone else try to use a floppy drive, internal or external on the Windows Technical Preview?

            <p>This is incomplete beta software so some features are not available but might be when the OS is final. I wouldn't be surprised if floppy support is a thing of the past along with some other obsolete hardware and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should be stressing the fact that this is beta software that expires in April and will stop working and could even be withdrawn and removed from computers before then. It should not be installed on anyone's primary computer or over their current
 Windows. There are users who don't read all the info and think they are upgrading their windows instead of signing on as test subjects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Secrets says this--&nbsp;<span><strong>Note:</strong> The usual beta software warnings apply to Windows Technical Preview. It's actually a pre-beta-quality operating system — you'd be crazy to put it on a production system. Put
<strong><em>nothing</em></strong> on a Preview test system you want to keep.</span></p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course, I want to be able to restore them again, or maybe search the backup itself for emails and retrieve attachments :-O !</div>

            To save individual messages elsewhere you can simply drag them to your Desktop and copy them where you need.
<div><br />
<div>You can also drag a folder from Outlook to the Desktop to create an MBOX file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Both can be imported back into Outlook for Mac.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Pivot Table Refresh Problem from Field List</h2>
                    <p>I am don't know if I can explain this clearly....I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have several worksheets with about 10 pivots in each sheet.&nbsp; Each sheet contains in essence the same pivots as the other sheets, except that some have more than 1 row label field (to show details of the information).&nbsp; I also have months going across the
 table (Column labels) and an additional column label to identify if the data is actual or forecast for the month.&nbsp; So far, all the tables I have built are working properly and showing my data in the format below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mth1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mth2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mth3</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fcst</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's one table that when I try to change it to this format it inserts another column and the data shows as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mth1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mth2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mth3</p>

            Actually figured a way around this problem.&nbsp; I went to my source data, copied the field causing the problem to another workbook and cleaned it using the trim formula.&nbsp; Copied the new re-freshed data back to my source data and Voila...worked perfectly.

<p>You can't. You have to keep track yourself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>AND, Office 2010 Pro is only good for install on 2 computers at the same time, NOT 3!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm if you have Office 2010 Pro or Professional Plus.&nbsp; You can find out by going to File menu &gt; Help command.&nbsp; Pro Plus is often resold illegally, offering "3 installs".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you have a legitimate Office 2010 Pro, it allows install on up to 2 computers at the same time. It also allows you to "transfer" the installation from one computer to another. Uninstall from one of the current machines, then install and activate
 on the new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to do a phone activation to complete the activation process.</p>

<p>Thanks for that reply ...</p>
<p>The box says: "<em>Microsoft Office Professional 2010</em>"</p>
<p>It also says on the box "<em>Licensed for noncommercial use on up to 3 home PCs</em>"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>i.e. mine, my wife's and (I think) my mother in law's PC.</p>
<p>But I am about to replace my mother-in-laws PC [being too old ... the PC, not the mother-in-law :) ]&nbsp;
</p>
<p>so I wanted to check if I had a spare licence ... </p>
<p>or I suppose the other aspect of this question which you have nicely preempted would be how to transfer the licence to her new PC :)</p>

<p>I have a 2007 box, but I'm sure the 2010 box was the same:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you take a closer look you'll see an asterisk in front of the statement about being licensed for 3 computers, and the asterisk refers to Home and Student ONLY.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So uninstall from the old computer before installing on the new computer. Let us know if you have any problems activating. MS has been generating a couple of misleading error messages for which there are simple work arounds.

    <title>Build 10159 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leegplayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10159</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since installing build 10159 I am having some issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly when I close IE I get a popup saying Internet Explorer is restarting and it starts up again.&nbsp; When I close it again it remains closed.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the games folder/app has gone.&nbsp; The only app that now lists the games is the Xbox app but I can only view my achievements, I cannot launch the games.</p>
<p>The icons in the most used list on the start menu keep disappearing, there is just a coloured square and the name of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another issue that has not been resolved with the various builds.&nbsp; This is that I cannot play Blu-ray discs properly with the stock graphics driver supplied with the builds.&nbsp; (version 15.2)&nbsp; If I install the latest driver, 14.4 that is available
 on the AMD website, I can watch Blu-ray discs but this driver is automatically replaced by the stock version and I am back to square one.&nbsp; I cannot seem to stop this stock driver&nbsp;from being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue that has existed across the builds is that occasionally my computer will wake up during the night.&nbsp; I have all wake timers disabled in the bios and also on the network card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

 Check for update. Also, check if there is any update available for the phone's system apps by going to Store &gt; ... &gt; settings &gt; check for updates. Let us know how it goes.

<h3> onino  say:</h3>
<h2>            help with N95 phonebook</h2>
                    My father bought an N95 a few weeks ago, i read the manual and other forums but i couldn't find a solution to his problem.<br />
his problems are:<br />
1)He has a friend's details and number in his phonebook, but whenever that friends sends an sms to him, the name doesn't show, only the number (i looked for duplicate numbers or the contact's name but theres no duplicate and the number is under mobile)<br />
<br />
2)He's wondering whenever he opens a contact in his phonebook, and he highlights the mobile number, under option he chose copy, then the phone shows "Copied to Clipboard", my dad wonders where the clipboard is and what happens to the number and what's it for?<br />
<br />
i hope someone can answer this asap. i tried doing trial and error on my phone but mine's different, i'm using an E65.

            1) Make sure that the number is stored in the contact in the complete international format: +00 000 000000 this is the way you receive the number from a call or a message.<br />
<br />
2) Once you copy something it react the same way as a PC (Ctrl-C), and of course you can paste it (Ctrl-V) in a text message, a contact, a note, an internet address etc.:<br />
- You select something, you click the pencil button (copy), now you go somwhere else, say, a contact field, you click the pencil again (paste).

            Use the free Nokia Search software to find for sure if the number is duplicate or not. If is not the case, the other solution is the field number starts with a blank space.

<h2>            Powerpoint and Mirror displays on my MacBook Pro</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>i have my MAC set on mirror displays under system preferences.</p>
<p>Go into powerpoint and my slides mirror fine whether in presenter view or normal slideshow view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However i have video links within my presentation and when i click one of these it will display the video on my computer but not mirror that display. When i look back in system preferences it has turned off the mirror displays option!!. It even
 does this between slides so if i reset the mirror displays to get the video displaying it will fail on a subsequent slide.. This only happens in presenter view and seems to be a new problem because they have always worked in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i get this to stop and stop it unchecking the mirror displays option.</p>

</p><p>We'd like to replicate the issue here on our end and for us to do so, let's get ourselves on the same page. Let us know the version of OneDrive you're using. Is it for Business or Personal? Also, is it integrated with SharePoint? Lastly, send us a screenshot

<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the OneDrive I'm using is Personal and it is not integrated with SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The OneDrive desktop app version is 17.3.7073.1013 with Files On-demand enabled</li><li>The Photos app version is&nbsp;2017.39081.15820.0</li><li>My Windows version is 1709 16299.19</li></ul>
<p>I have this exact same issue on both of my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is Collection pane:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/680bf5ba-9dba-4c46-9e80-ab03110bf025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/680bf5ba-9dba-4c46-9e80-ab03110bf025" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is the Folders pane OneDrive\Pictures:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/782f6f77-ff3e-43e1-8376-14b9a3c5af34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/782f6f77-ff3e-43e1-8376-14b9a3c5af34" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how the picture on the Camera Roll folder is the same as in the first picture in the Collections pane. However, when I try to open it, this happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90f0a883-180e-4ea9-a2e0-5864530ca186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90f0a883-180e-4ea9-a2e0-5864530ca186" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another interesting issue is what it shows in the OneDrive root folder:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23b1739a-0175-4a25-a7ce-5c3365e0d774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23b1739a-0175-4a25-a7ce-5c3365e0d774" /></a></p>
<p>Basically all my folders. Yet this is what I have in the settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/586b7f21-6154-4bbc-8a9c-2e7b82b39782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/586b7f21-6154-4bbc-8a9c-2e7b82b39782" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, that's not it. I already run the Windows apps troubleshooter on my other PC which has the same issue. What are the changes of two computers having the exact same issue because of corrupt system file around the same time, which was little after I switched
 on Files ON-Demand? The computer I took the screenshots from is fairly new one (Surface Pro - 2017), so the system should be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess would be that either the Photos app doesn't play nicely with OnDrive Files ON-Demand or my OnDrive is somehow corrupted, since I'm seeing the exact same issue on both computers.</p>

<p>Look, I mean no disrespect, but perhaps it would be better to escalate this issue. I'm not exactly a computer novice since I've been working on IT about 20 years now, although I mostly work with Windows Servers and not client OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never the less, removing the Windows Desktop OneDrive app and then install OneDrive store app doesn't exactly sound as very well thought answer, since the user would end up losing their OneDrive functionality on Windows 10. Perhaps it would better to give
 the <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
proper link</a> to restore the OneDrive desktop app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I did remove it just so that you may put a checkmark that I've tried that too. Obviously that removed all OneDrive syncing from the PC, including the Files On-Demand which was the entire point of this thread. But as for the Photos app, it was now
 able to open some of the folders in OneDrive Photos, but not all. After restoring OneDrive DESKTOP app, the situation remained the same: some folder work and others don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I need to be a little more clear what the issue is, so that we can avoid these general answers:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>After enabling OneDrive Files On-Demand, the Photos app is able to access all the photos in my One-Drive in the Collection pane normally, but not from Folders pane.</li><li>The exact same issue can be seen in multiple computer (weel two, but still more than one) with same account, making it very unlikely that it's a system issue on the computer.</li><li>In one of the computers the search functionality work correctly with OneDrive, the other one doesn't seem to search for in OneDrive at all.</li><li>On both computers only the Pictures folder of OneDrive is selected, but all folders in OneDrive are shown. Interestingly all the folders which have pictures in it are shown correctly in the sense that it sees those in the Folders Pane, although those folders
 (like Documents) shouldn't be there in the first place.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So, based on those findings, I would guess that one of these is the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>There is a bug in the Photos app which prevents it work properly with OneDrive/<span>OneDrive
</span><span>Files On-Demand.</span></li><li><span>There is something wrong with my OneDrive account in the CLOUD, not the desktop</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate the help you are trying to give and I do understand that you have procedures you need to follow before you may escalate the issue. But perhaps we could finally view this issue as something more than just another user error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Pardon my skepticism but I suspect the original poster gave up after that last "cut and paste" answer offered by the Microsoft tech. The tech answers here are the same that can be seen in response to almost every question in a MS tech support forum. A couple
 of these answers would be OK with me if I were enrolled in a beta program and committed to digging deep for an answer but I'm a typical end user who doesn't want to uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure or create a new account. I want these apps to work and I want
 them to work because MS makes them work and not because I've jumped through hoops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same issue as originally posted here. Sasler0 has spoken well for me. My Windows, Onedrive and Photo app are all up to date as of this post. I'm too lazy to look them up and write them down.</p>

                    Every time (almost 40 times in the past two weeks) when I made the long distance phone call, when it got connected and the other side said "Hello", I could not hear sound any more. Every time when it got connected, I was charged for one minute even though
 I could not hear any sounds other than that "Hello". This is very frustrating and annoying. I was wasting my time and money. I want my money back.

</p><p>Skype charges are per minute basis. Call quality issues are usually caused by a weak connection you
<em>(or your contact)</em> are using. Try changing connections and check if the issue persists. You may refer to this support link for the recommended upload and download speeds for optimal Skype call experience.

<p>I have changed into another connection but the same problem happened! Both connections have no problem because they are the connections at my working place. The bandwidth is more than enough. Moreover, I have been using that connection for Skype phone call
 for more than one year and there was no such kind of problem until last month. The problem became worse and worse and wasted me a lot of time and money. I remember 3 or 4 weeks ago, when I was making the Skype phone call, after I started speaking with the
 people on the other side for one minute, the it got disconnected. Then I called again and after about 1 minute it got disconnected again. I clearly remember it was a Friday evening. I called about 30 times within one hour because I had urgent things to speak
 with the people on the other side. It was very irritating and frustrating. I was trying to contact Skype support but I was too busy to do that. Now the problem is worse. It got disconnected after I heard "Hello" from the people on the other side. I also called
 different contact but the same things happened. This is ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I don't know why there is no Live Chat support anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone stops playing music</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced the problem where the song playing ends and the next one can't begin? This is on the phone, not specifically the Xbox Music app. You can use the slider to get to any point in the song, but it won't move after that, it just sticks
 at whatever time you set it to regardless of whether it's supposed to be playing or be&nbsp;paused. As far as I can tell, it can only be fixed by a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia 1520 - WP8.1 DP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi Oli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; With regards to the music issues you're having on your Nokia Lumia 1520, I'd like to go over a few things and see what we need to do next.</p>
<ul>
<li>I do understand you're on the developer preview, but I'd like to verify something.&nbsp; On the phone, navigate to both,
<strong>Settings&gt;Extras+Info, </strong>and <strong>Settings&gt;About&gt;More Info</strong>.&nbsp; What is the complete OS version, and Software Release name?</li><li>Is this music synced to the phone's internal storage itself, or is it streaming?</li><li>Does this happen when connected to Bluetooth headphones, analog headphones, or the phone's external speakers?</li><li>Do your headphones become unplugged at any point when this happens?</li><li>Do you have Bluetooth enabled?&nbsp; If so, try turning if off for now and see if the issue persists.</li><li>Check <strong>Settings&gt;Audio</strong>.&nbsp; If you have any enhancements enabled, try turning them off for now.</li><li>Does this also happen to playlists synced to the phone?</li><li>Are you able to pause the music, and then resume playback, with the audio possibly coming back?</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to get back to us when you can and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the similar problem with my Lumia 925. But, as far as i could see, most users have problem with music stopping at the end of a track, and my music (I use built in player, headphones I got with phone and mp3 music saved to the phone) pauses every few
 seconds or minutes.... It just started out of a sudden around 2 months ago, and &nbsp;it is very annoying. &nbsp;I didn't change any settings before the bug first appeared. It stops 3-4, sometimes even more times during one song! It means when I'm trying to listen to
 music, I have to hold phone in my hand and unpause song all the time! It continues from where it was paused. I had some feeling that it reacts on motion, because if I am holding it still in one position, it (usually) works, but if i move my hand or put the
 phone in my pocket or bag, music just stops. Probably it has nothing to do with the problem, but who knows.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, sometimes when I unpause the song, it starts playing it on the phones built-in speaker, like it doesn't see headphones.... sometimes it switches to headphones itself after few seconds, but sometimes I have to plug out and back in headphones so it'll
 realize they are connected. </p>
<p>When I listen with phone's speakers, it plays normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spend few hours every day in the metro and I really need my phone to play music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please.... :)</p>
<p>Tamara</p>

            <p>I have the exact same issue Tamara mentions on my Lumia 930. I first experienced this issue after the installation of the Denim Update. I had also received an update for the Spotify app, but every other app that I can play music with has the same issue,
 Mix Radio, Xbox Music and Spotify. Even in Netflix the&nbsp;audio is suddenly stuttering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tamara mentions that it reacts on motion so I uninstalled the Gestures Beta app but that doesn't seem to work. I also tried to keep my phone as still as possible but still the issue arises.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Ansers to the questions:</p>
<p>1: OS Version: Lumia Denim 8.10.14219.341.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: I have&nbsp;experienced this when&nbsp;playing music synced to the phone but also while streaming using Spoify or Mix Radio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3:This only happens when I have headphones plugged in (and they stay plugged in).</p>
<p>When I use the speakers the music keeps playing and everything is ok. I never use Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: Turned Bluetooth off but that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5: Turned off all enhancements, the issue still arises</p>
<p>
</p><p>6: Yes, it happens when playing audio synced, streaming and on diferent apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>7:I can pause the music just fine and when I start the music again it continues where it stopped. But after a few seconds it pauses automatically.</p>

            <p>My issue was caused by a 'broken' headphone. Funny thing is that the headphone works fine when plugged into my PC but not&nbsp;into the phone.
</p>
<p>I had used another headphone and that resolved it.</p>
