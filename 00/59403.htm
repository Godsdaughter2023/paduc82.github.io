<h2>            Internet Unable to Connect but only certain websites</h2>
                    I just bought an HP Envy from best buy and im able to connect to the internet and get on most websites but not all of them. When I try accessing some sites it tells me unable to connect but im able to pull those same sites up from my phone so i know the
 sites are not down. I am running Windows 8.1 id been reading there were some problems with certain routers and windows 8.1 could that make only certain sites not show up? I've tried opening them in internet explorer and firefox.&nbsp;

            Hi Jerry 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Use an applocker policy.
<br />This can stop users from opening any app based on the app as well any script.
<br />See link.

<br />You can do that in Group Policy
<br />
<br />Go to User Configuration - Administrative Templates - System - Don't run specified Windows applications
<br />
<br />And add Wordpad.exe to the list of disallowed applications . . .

<h2>            How to run useful command &#34;Desktop Show All Windows&#34; without Microsoft Touch Mouse</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Windows 8.1 (64-bit) running on my laptop.&nbsp; Earlier today, I </p>
<p>installed your Microsoft Touch Mouse.&nbsp; This product is a few years </p>
<p>old, but it's compatible with both Windows 7 and Windows 8.&nbsp; I </p>
<p>installed the latest software for it called Microsoft Mouse and </p>
<p>Keyboard Center (MouseKeyboardCenter_64bit_ENG_2.3.188.exe).&nbsp; It's </p>
<p>working fine, but there's a feature I would like to ask about...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the settings in the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, I can </p>
<p>set it so that the gesture for swiping 3 fingers up runs the </p>
<p>following command: "Desktop Show All Windows."&nbsp; This is a great </p>
<p>feature, which shows all of my open windows as big as possible </p>
<p>simultaneously on the screen.&nbsp; This feature is similar to (but </p>
<p>different from) the command Alt-Tab, which allows you to see all </p>
<p>your open windows, but only in small little icons in bar in the </p>
<p>middle of the screen.&nbsp; The "Desktop Show All Windows" command is </p>
<p>much more visually helpful, as it shows much bigger views of the </p>
<p>currently-running open windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because I don't have my mouse with me when I'm on the go with my </p>
<p>laptop, I can't use this 3 finger swipe up gesture on my laptop, but </p>
<p>I would like to still be able to use this very useful "Desktop Show </p>
<p>All Windows" command.&nbsp; Is there some way this can be initiated </p>
<p>without my Microsoft Touch Mouse, perhaps with a keyboard shortcut, </p>
<p>or a macro, or clickable link, or something else?&nbsp; It's obviously </p>
<p>just triggering some kind of software command when I use the 3 </p>
<p>finger gesture on the Microsoft Touch Mouse, so it seems that there </p>
<p>should be some way to setup a keyboard command or clickable link to </p>
<p>trigger the same software response.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see a good example of what I'm talking about in the </p>
<p>question that was previously asked at the online post at the link </p>
<p>below.&nbsp; A person posted 2 screenshots (if you scroll down a bit) </p>
<p>showing the option in the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center and an </p>
<p>example of what his screen looks like showing the open windows when </p>
<p>he runs the "Desktop Show All Windows" command gesture.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/show-all-windows/683d1aac-9ea1-49ed-a38d-7ddadeffe939?rtAction=1412363535220">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/show-all-windows/683d1aac-9ea1-49ed-a38d-7ddadeffe939?rtAction=1412363535220</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That post was posted years ago and never got an answer.&nbsp; And to be </p>
<p>clear, this is *not* the same as the option "Show windows side by </p>
<p>side" that comes up when you right click on the empty space in the </p>
<p>task bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks very much for your help.</p>

            <p>Well I went digging through all the resources that come with the Mouse and Keyboard Center Software (my mouse uses that same expose-like function with wheel click), but it looks like the resources for the effect are contained in a DLL file, so doesn't appear
 to be a way to invoke it that I can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Although it doesn't help yet, Windows 10 (very early, still a year away) has replaced the old Alt-Tab with something that's almost identical to what the mouse does.&nbsp; Here's both on my computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7183ee40-b29d-4369-8d8b-b3c8035d1942" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Mouse/Keyboard Center Instant View thing (buggy because it's running on Windows 10 right now).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/211aa143-556a-46e9-b11a-f50d0bd73f0e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But having said that, there are good options for achieving what you want. It does require a program, but it's very tiny and I've used it often.&nbsp; It's called Switcher and has keyboard shortcuts you can configure to any you wish, and performs pretty identically
 to the mouse center's function.</p>

            <p>Compatibility mode is a way of making older program run under certain conditions to give them a better chance of running in newer versions of Windows. It is just&nbsp;a set of&nbsp;settings associated with a particular program.&nbsp;Please see:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP Mode is a "virtual machine" that is available in Windows 7 Professional Ultimate &amp; Enterprise editions only. It effectively creates a whole additional software based Windows XP Professional (SP3) virtual computer on the Windows 7 host computer. This enables
 many XP programs to run. Its primarily intended for business software. XP Mode was intended to help companies with the transition from XP to Windows 7. XP Mode does have limitations, in particular it is not good for graphics intensive things like 3D games

<h2>            Parental controls</h2>
                    I play a game called Tom Clancys Rainbow Six Seige. Ive played over 1000 hours of the game and took a little break. Now when I try and run the game, I get the error that parental controls block the game. I already contacted the game support and steam support
 and they told me to contact microsoft. My parents say they havent set up any parental controls and they dont have any problems with me playing my games. My account is also run under an administrator account so I dont see what the problem is.

                    <p>Purchased new mobo and cpu after mobo SATA crashed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7 Professional 64bit doesn't start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>computer originally came with Vista but purchased Win 7 Upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded the Win 7 Pro 64b&nbsp; ISO from the link provided on this web site.&nbsp; (the original DVD is in another state/office)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation says I'm using a invalid certification number.&nbsp; The number is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the ISO I downloaded not except a Win 7 Upgrade MAK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I contacted the MS support 2 weeks ago. They promised to investigate this issue. Today I've got the answer that they were not able to identify this problem and they cannot reproduce this bug.
</p>
<p>Instead I should contact the customer service to <span>
have the IAP refunded and then re-purchase the IAP on the account</span>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot tell all my users to contact the support! This is a really frustrating answer and a horrible situation. How can I get the information that they cannot reproduce it when this obviously seems to be a general and already known Windows 10 store issue?</p>

</p><p>last week Microsoft released the Windows update KB3106932, that should fix this issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately this works only for less customer devices. On many Windows 10 devices this trial issue remains.</p>

The Microsoft Internet E-mail lottery Awards is sponsored by our CEO/Chairman, Bill Gates and a consortium of software promotion companies. The Intel Group, Toshiba, Dell Computers and other International Companies. The Microsoft internet E-mail draw is held
 periodically and is organized to encourage the use of the Internet and promote computer literacy worldwide. The Microsoft Window lottery has discovered a huge number of double claims due to winners informing close friends relatives and third parties about
 their winnings and also sharing their pin numbers. As a result of this, these friends try to claim the lottery on behalf of the real winners. The Microsoft lottery has reached a decision from headquarters that any double claim discovered by the Lottery Board
 will result to the Canceling of that particular winning, making a loss for both the double claimer and the real winner, as it is taken that the real winner was the informer to the double claimer about the lottery. So you are hereby strongly advised once more
 to keep your winnings strictly confidential until you claim your prize.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again on behalf of all our staff,<br />
<br />
<br />
CONGRATULATIONS!!!<br />

<p>Sorry, but pretty sure it is a scam. Using a quick google search using copy and paste of a line from the letter, I stumbled across this:

<p>It is word for word, except this link was from a post on November of 2009. I guess since MS is such a big company, the scam would seem more believable. Always remember, you can't win sweepstakes if you don't enter.</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>Plus why on Earth would the Microsoft Security Department be using a yahoo email address instead of a @microsoft.com one? And providing a mobile phone number instead of a landline.</p>

<p>How anyone could think this is genuine is beyond me, especially given the spelling errors.</p>

            <p>Maybe you've solved it, but if not here's a suggestion, which got me out of trouble with exactly this adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the file&nbsp;f5d7050v3_ww_03.00.07_w2.exe from the Belkin web site. This is the latest driver software and is the one now working on my Windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager, if the adapter is listed, remove/uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install the driver software and when instructed restart. Probably the wi-fi will work. It did for me the first time but pretty soon it stopped again and I was really struggling. In fact I installed my Powerline adapters to get connected to the Internet and
 take the pressure off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More relaxed, I went and looked at the device drivers again in Device Manager. I tried "Upgrade Driver", and manually browsed to the driver files as extracted from the above downloaded file. System told me that I had the latest driver.</p>
<p>Still puzzled, went and got on with my life. Came back and had another look, at the device driver in Device Manager. Spotted that it was a Ralink driver NOT the Belkin driver which I had thought I had installed. Aha! Windows 10 has superimposed its choice
 of driver. This time I selected "Roll back driver", ignored the dire warning, and found I now had the Belkin driver.</p>
<p>I disconnected the Powerline Adapter, and connected to the router by wi-fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this experience is helpful to someone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to Rakesh Narayanaswamy's response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically you have to get the latest drivers from the Belikin website here:</p>
<p>http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=4896</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you get the one for your adaptor.&nbsp; The ones with larger numbers aren't the latest releases, they're for different models of the adaptor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After downloading it, run it in compatibility mode for Windows Vista.&nbsp; Worked great for me!</p>

            Your personal folders and Microsoft Store apps are things you can move over to the larger hard disk.
<br />
<br />Sounds like you have a Hybrid drive but its not being used.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Disk Management
<br />Could you take a screenshot then post it in a reply here?
<br />
<br />If the D: drive is larger than C:, I would try partitioning the drive.
<br />
<br />Here is an article how to partition a drive:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-partiti" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-partiti</a>...
<br />
<br />Name one Partition 'Files' and the other 'Apps'.
<br />
<br />Open the Files partition, create a folder and name it:  zoklev
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %userprofile%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Right click your Documents folder
<br />Click Properties
<br />Select the Location tab
<br />Click Move
<br />Browse to the Files partition we created earlier then select  zoklev folder.
<br />
<br />Repeat the same steps for other folders such as Pictures, Videos etc.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
<br />Under More storage settings, click 'Change where new content is saved'
<br />
<br />In New apps will save to list box, choose the 'Apps' partition we created earlier.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features
<br />Select any large app you have downloaded from the Windows Store
<br />Click Move, choose the 'Apps' partition

<p>I did all that, but I still only have 29 GB of free space on my SSD, I would like to make some more space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I just search for the things that are taking up the most space in my SSD and transfer them to the HDD? or will that cause some problems?</p>

            <pre>There might be large files that eating up space on the SSD, see how you can free up space on it:
Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Troy, I presume the dsk file is an old disk image file?
<br />
<br />Windows does not natively support dsk files, you will have to download 3rd party software to open the disk image - there is free software available on the web for extracting the files form a dsk archive

<h2>            printer problems - blank sheet</h2>
                    After initial boot-up, my printer will usually work fine. Then all of a sudden it will receive the signal to print, but print-out a blank sheet. This only happens when I have to right-click then select print. If I am in a program, like Adobe and have a
 pdf open, and I select "file" then "print" it works fine. But, again, when I have to right-click then print, it prints a blank sheet. Any ideas what the problem could be? I am using Windows 8.1.

            The printer is a Samsung SCX-3405W. But its the same problem I had with my last printer (Brother MFC 7340). I bought the Samsung hoping it would solve the problem. So its not a printer issue and its definitely not a toner issue. Recall I said it works
 fine when in a program that allows you to select&nbsp;"file" then "print" but it will not work when that is not an option and you have to right-click then select print. I thought it might be a corrupt printer driver but I tried that. I think its a "settings" issue
 with Windows 8.

            Yes. When I right-click and check "print preview" it shows a blank page. Here's another interesting twist...when I first log-n and boot up for the first time, it will work properly when I right-click and select print. It will work for maybe 15 minutes.
 Then it will stop working and for the rest of my work day I can't right-click and print. It would almost suggest that it has something to do with the lap top being warmed up having an affect.&nbsp;But I do have a lap-top base with a cooling fan device.

<h2>            Verbatim 1TB USb 2.o driver. </h2>
                    I have a Verbatim 1TB usb 2.0 external hard drive, and while the drive shows up as the F: drive, I cannot get into it. I am running 64 bit windows Vista home premium. I have had this issue with another brand of driver that didn't support 64 bit. Is there
 a driver out there somewhere i can download and use to get this driver working as it is supposed to?

<span>Hello skip_hunter,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If this is a new disk drive, you can try to format the hard disk.</span></p>
<p>
<span>As the drive is showing up as F: in the Windows browser, right click on the device and click on Format.
<br />
Here is an article that will give information on formatting the hard disk: <br />
<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/3ccec49c-2c67-4ff7-b672-ea1d32977aa81033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/3ccec49c-2c67-4ff7-b672-ea1d32977aa81033.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Here is another article I found on the Verbatim Website that talks about ‘How to Reformat a Verbatim Hard Drive for Windows’:
