    <title>Using my Epson SX 200 to scan on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithjardine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using my Epson SX 200 to scan on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have used the SX200 with great results for a few years with windows XP. it scanned documents direct to PDF</p>
<p>with again great , easy to use results.</p>
<p>With windows 10 it will only offer photo options, no document scanning. The detailed Epson control panel that appeared on XP does not come up on windows&nbsp; 10.</p>
<p>I have checked I have the latest Epson drivers downloaded but no success. Any suggestions please? or is it to be a new scanner/printer.</p>

            Ask this question to Epson. They are the ones who provide the printer driver that controls the features enabled on the printer.
<br />
<br />Have you tried loading the XP printer driver. It probably won't load, but it may.  
<br />
<br />Another option is to setup a "virtual machine/computer" running XP or Vista with the XP Printer driver loaded.

<br />•	Our Geek School articles can get pretty complicated, and there’s no reason to do a ton of crazy stuff on your own desktop PC. Instead, you can just VirtualBox like we do to create virtual machines for all of your testing. Here’s how to do it.
<br />•	You can even network multiple virtual machines together, so as long as you have a decent amount of RAM in your PC, you can fully test a scenario without messing with your PC’s settings at all. It’s a much safer way to learn!
<br />Before we get started there are a few things that we will need:
<br />•	A copy of VirtualBox which can be obtained here.
<br />•	A Windows 7 ISO which can be obtained here.
<br />•	A Windows Server 2008 R2 ISO which can be obtained here.

<h2>            I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s wrong with this machine.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Studio 1535, with Vista Home Premium 32 bit OS.<br />
I can't seem to connect to the Internet.<br />
I think I uninstalled a necessary driver, but can't seem to find the software to run it again.<br />
<br />
I have a NETGEAR RangeMax Wireless Router WPN824 v3 and a ZyXel Prestige 623-41, ADSL Dual Link Router.<br />
<br />
Under <b>Device Manager --&gt; Network Adapters</b> I have only <b>Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet</b> listed.<br />
<br />
What driver do I need (and where can I download it) in order to get my wireless working again?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Dave<br />

            &nbsp;Hello dmastt,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your question to the Microsoft Answers Community Forum.<br />
<br />
If you want to find your drivers for your&nbsp;Dell Studio 1535, go to the following Website and download the current driver for your machine. If you don't know what is the Wireless Adapter you have installed in your computer, you can put in your service tag number
 and Dell will tell you what came installed with your service and you can download the correct drivers there.
<br />
<br />
Can you connect with a wired network?<br />
What error message are you getting?<br />
Have&nbsp;you reset or rebooted your router to see if the router could be the problem?<br />
Can&nbsp;you ping your router? Your gateway? Any other machine on your network?<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if this answer helped with your issue or if&nbsp; you still need assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks,

I did a System Restore, and it fixed the problem.<br />
Not sure what changed, but it's working and that's all that matters to me.<br />
Thank you, though.<br />

There's a yellow error triangle under my wireless adapter <b>"Intel(R) Pro/Wireless 3458BG Network Connection"</b><br />

<h2>            Bluetooth &#34;pairing&#34;&#47;connection between headphones and desktop PC for Windows 10 not available &#40;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Case #1429170588 -- Earlier today, I had remote help from a tech support person to set up my new headphones with a 3.5 mm jack.&nbsp; However, what I needed was to "pair" my headphones to my desktop computer.&nbsp; We could not connect Bluetooth to my desk top computer,
 since I needed to download a dongle. I now have a dongle and had downloaded the disk.&nbsp; I also have a wireless stereo transmitter. So far this is what I have done:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Successfully paired my headphones to my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Unable to pair my desktop PC to my headphones, since I keep getting a message that Windows 10 PC does not have Bluetooth capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Services enabled for Bluetooth on desktop PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; Device Manager drivers for Bluetooth icons (incl. hidden ones) checked for driver updates.&nbsp; Same for Windows update.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>My questions are:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a)&nbsp; How come the iPhone and headset paired just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
b)&nbsp; Why Windows 10 Bluetooth can not pair the headphones to the PC? (print screen follows):<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a54b6b84-f89e-458d-8cf4-0dea589dd477?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a54b6b84-f89e-458d-8cf4-0dea589dd477?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10, Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.81) -- once again, on a desktop PC.<br />

<p>Based on the details that you've provided, your headset (<strong>Cowin E7</strong>) should be using Bluetooth 4.0 technology. We can't seem to find the specific Bluetooth technology used by your dongle nor your transmitter. However, you may want to consider
 using only either of those two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use <strong>Wireless Stereo TaoTronics Model TT-BA01</strong>, it is connected to your PC using the 3.5 mm headphone jack so your PC should detect it not as a Bluetooth device but as a regular headphone. You would then need to check the manuals
 for your transmitter to find out how to pair it to your headphone since you would need to do it on the buttons of the transmitter itself and not through your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you prefer to use your <strong>White label USB Dongle</strong>, you would need to pair it through the PC Settings. Check out this article to find out how to

<strong>Connect a Bluetooth device</strong></a> to your Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whichever device you may be using to connect your Bluetooth headset to your PC, kindly ensure that you disable the other Bluetooth devices to ensure that those devices do not 'unintentionally' connect with your headphone. Bluetooth connectivity can only
 be used with one pair at a time so you may also want to ensure that other devices' Bluetooth (such as your iPhone's) is disabled when doing the pairing.</p>

<p>We apologize for the delayed response, Ed. May we know if your PC already recognized your headphone? Based on your previous explanation, you already tried different jacks but still failed to recognized by your PC, there's a possibility that your PC's port
 is malfunctioning. We can isolate this by trying these devices on a different PC, if it'll work on a different PC, this means the port is the main problem.</p>

            <p>So last night I redownloaded windows 10 (thinking maybe my earner copy was corrupted)&nbsp;as ISO file. I formatted a usb drive to FAT32 and down. I extracted the files from the ISO file and copied them to the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I held down shift and clicked restart and when the menu came up I chose reformat and&nbsp;I inserted the USB drive in my surface&nbsp;but a message comes up that the media or file is incorrect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>

            Yes. You need to boot from the USB drive to carry out the installation.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response with the latest update on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check whether the artitecture of the Computer is similar to the ISO file on USB drive.</p>
<p>If you are having a 32&nbsp;bit architecture&nbsp;computer, then we need to create a ISO file of 32 bit Windows 10. Also we should create a 64&nbsp;bit ISO file&nbsp;on USB for 64&nbsp;bit Computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To check to the&nbsp;System Information:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Press the Windows Key + Pause/Break key.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Or else click on search bar next to <strong>Start Menu</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Type "<strong>Control Panel" </strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">without the quotes</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and click on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Click on <strong>System&nbsp;and Security</strong>. Then click on
<strong>System</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check what is the System Type&nbsp;of the Computer</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;difference&nbsp;between the ISO file bit version and system type bit version. Then I suggest to perform the below steps to create right Windows 10 ISO file for your Computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run the media creation tool.</p>
<p>2. Select Create installation media for another PC.</p>
<p>3. Choose the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10.</p>
<p>4. Follow the steps to create the installation media, and then select Finish when it’s done.</p>
<p>5. When you’re ready to perform a clean installation, turn on your PC, insert the DVD or USB flash drive you created, and then shut down your PC.</p>
<p>6. Restart your PC, and then press any key to boot from the DVD or USB flash drive.</p>
<p>If you restart your PC and your current version of Windows starts, you might have to open a boot menu or change the boot order in your PC's BIOS or UEFI settings so that your PC boots from the media. To open a boot menu or change the boot order, you'll typically
 need to press a combination of keys (such as F2, F12, Delete, or Esc) immediately after you turn on your PC. For instructions on changing the boot order for your PC, check the documentation that came with your PC or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>If changing the boot menu or order doesn't work, try again by signing in to Windows, shutting down, and then starting your PC.</p>
<p>7. On the Install Windows page, enter your language and other preferences, and then select Next.</p>
<p>8. Select Install Windows.</p>
<p>9. On the Enter the product key to activate Windows page, enter your product key. The product key should be in a purchase confirmation email if you bought Windows 10. It looks like this: PRODUCT KEY: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>If you’ve already successful activated Windows 10 on this PC, including if you upgraded by taking advantage of the free upgrade offer you won't need to enter a Windows 10 product key. You can skip the product key page by selecting the Skip button. Your PC
 will automatically activate later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. On the License terms page, if you accept the license terms, select I accept the license terms, and then select Next.</p>
<p>11. On the Which type of installation do you want? page, select Custom.</p>
<p>12. On the Where do you want to install Windows? page, select the partition that you want, select the formatting option you want to perform (if needed), and then follow the instructions.</p>
<p>13. When you've finished formatting, select Next.</p>
<p>14. Follow the rest of the setup instructions to finish installing Windows.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to your computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Is that a Desktop or Laptop computer?</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Who is the computer manufacturer and what is the model number of your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps and check if that helps you in fixing the issue
 on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Hardware troubleshooter wizard on Windows 7 and check if there are any errors using the hardware on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Method 1 does not help you in fixing the issue on your computer follow Method 2.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to download the Driver from the computer manufacturers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also check for the latest driver updates using your Windows Updater.</p>
<p>Click on <b>Start</b>,
<b>All Programs</b>, <b>Windows Update </b>and check for the available updates.</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p><strong>Put the computer in clean boot and test
</strong></p>
<p>Follow <strong>
Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service. After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program,
 if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup
<strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When you perform
 a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I hope this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</p>

<h2>            Laptop keeps restarting.</h2>
                    Can anyone tell me why my laptop keeps restarting? It started doing that after a windows 10 update and has been doing that ever since. Did a complete virus scan and came up clean. What can I do to stop it? Computer Geek said it could be a corrupted file
 during the update, could that be true?

<p>I can be on it for about 5 to 6 hours. At first I&nbsp; thought it was getting overheated. Not that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would shut down, go in to it's restart mode. Then comes up a window: Troubleshoot or Restart!</p>

<p>Alright, let's see what failure is happening that is causing it to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to do this is to turn off automatic error reboots.&nbsp; This way when a failure happens, you'll get a chance to see the error code and then restart yourself.&nbsp; We can then use that error code to find out what's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the Start button and choose Run</li><li>Type or paste in <strong>SystemPropertiesAdvanced</strong> and then click OK</li><li>In the "Startup and Recovery" section, click Settings...</li><li>Turn off the Automatically Restart option, then click OK</li><li>Restart your computer (do not shutdown+turn back on:&nbsp; do a actual <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
restart</span>)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now, just wait.&nbsp; The next time a failure occurs that would have triggered an automatic reboot, you'll see the error message instead.&nbsp; Note what it says, then restart your computer (with the power button) and come back and let us know what the error was.</p>

    <title>&#34;Restart your PC to finish installing updates&#34; stuck. I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Restart your PC to finish installing updates&#34; stuck. I manually stopped windows 10 and deleted downloaded file.</h2>
                    <p>OK so here is the quick background so you will completely understand. The other night I turned my PC on.&nbsp;I hadn't used my PC in a few days as I have been off of work for a bit and therefore hadn't booted it up in a little while. When I turned it on everything
 was fine as I was updating steam, the Vive&nbsp;that I just got a bit ago and my graphics card. All of a sudden with NO warning what so ever my PC goes dark and informs me it's installing Windows 10! WHAT!?!? This did induce a bit of a panic for me as I work off
 of my PC and my job does NOT support Windows 10. So as quickly as I could I tried to find somewhere to stop this absolute madness but couldn't find anywhere to stop it so I just manually shut it down with the power button. While this actually INFURIATES me
 as I don't&nbsp;pay thousands of dollars for someone else to dictate what I can and can't do with my own machine, that is beside&nbsp;the point because as stated I CANNOT use Windows 10 because of my job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I boot my computer back up and immediately, of course, it wants to restart and install 10. My first inclination was to navigate to the update file itself and get rid of it that way at least it would have nothing to update with. So I navigated to the update
 file inside ("C:/Windows/software distribution/Download") which was like 3GB and I deleted it all together. It was the only pending update to be installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, my problem now is when I go to "Control Panel" and click on "Windows Updates" I get this message..."Restart Your PC to Finish Installing Updates" I restart the PC and because the file is no longer there to update it only just restarts and boots normal.
 However when I go back to the update section it still reads that it needs to restart and when I click on "Check for updates" it will no longer look for new updates it will only give me this message..."You'll need to restart your PC to finish installing previous
 updates." Now my computer is stuck in this loop and I can't get the important updates I need for my PC due to the fact that Microsoft intends on forcing their Windows 10 down my throat. I TRULY can't believe that Microsoft has resorted to this kind of tactic!
 No one ever cared if my very job meant I had to stay with Windows 8.1 and CANNOT upgrade to 10. They just shove it down your throat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in resolving this issue would be very appreciated. I would&nbsp;be so grateful to anyone that could help me start getting the important updates I need for my PC to stay safe and secure. I resorted to turning&nbsp;auto updates off, something&nbsp;I have never done
 in the HISTORY of owning my PC's. Here I am in 2016 trying to get my PC to update because Microsoft compromised my ability to clock into my own job! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to summarize,&nbsp;I am trying to figure out how to get everything back to normal and remove whatever I need to in order to get the computer to allow updates and not believe it needs to update to 10. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing issues with Windows updates and getting an error message.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be due to some corruptions in Windows updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the link given below and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>reset Windows updates components</strong> and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</span></span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:
</strong>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the<strong> section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.

            What happens when you try to put the key you have after changing hardware?
<br />If the key you have is an OEM license, it would not be transferred to the new motherboard.
<br />However, if it is retail one, use Activation troubleshooter to activate it by choosing I recently changed hardware.

            Hi, Andre,
<br />There is no way to withdraw a usage of activation key, the command you've used just partially remove information about the key from computer.
<br />How did you obtain the license? The answer can help to find a correct recommendations for you.

<p>I am simply writing this to say that Bethesda need to actually LOOK at their games before releasing them, Skyrim was a great game but there are so many glitches bugs. Another thing, I am not joking when I say literally every single quest, side quest, quest
 line, storyline, misc quest, radiant quest, location, people and more have several bugs.&nbsp;Bethesda seriously need to fix not just these majore glitches but the glitches and bugs that don't make anything impssible but really annoy you in the next update for
 Skyrim because I, and probably a lot of other people are never buying another Elder Scrolls game again if Bethesda don't iron out the many problems Skyrim has.</p>

<p>The only reason they rush games is because the masive fan base do nothing but moan about getting things out quickly. I`m suprised they have put their foot down with the playstation fans in regurds to when they get dawnguard because they want to make sure
 there are no bugs. But alas, all the ps3 fans are still moaning. </p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes it is! If I can learn to work around them I say anybody can. I too am waiting for the end of the year to see if they finally fix some of it. I still don't have Dawnguard for that very reason. I only got Hearthfire because it was reasonably priced even
 if it didn't work. As far as the skyrim defense force? I can only say you get what you pay for but in this case, Skyrim, I still feel kind of cheated. Way to many bugs/glitches for a so called GOTY award. Somebody must have bought that award, or they got it
 early from some lame demo. It certainly does not get my vote.</p>
<p>All in all it does play out fairly well if you take your time and give it some thought. It certainly is not a run and gun FPS game.</p>
<p>Rant over!</p>

<p>I'll be the first to admit I find the glitches frustrating as hell, but once I played the game, with it's vast scope, freedoms, and complexity, I began to wonder how Bethesda managed to get the game to work as well as it does. The playability issues can
 usually be addressed by "cleaning up" the console, and managing game files and cache every so often.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>The storyline issues have workarounds 9 times out of 10 &amp; I have exactly three missions I cannot complete (all radiant) due to actual "game code" glitching, this after attaining nearly 70 level ups over 6+ months. I might be among the more fortunate as I
 did come along after patch 1.4... but nevertheless my Dragonborn is still finding new places every so often, and getting into scrapes where his survival is not always guaranteed, just last night I was shouted off of a precipice at Arcwind by a Draugr Death
 Overlord I never saw coming, only moments after his comrade suffered the same fate. Still I doubt that will teach me to not rush to the edge to watch a hapless victim bounce down the side of a mountain... I love that part.... : )</p>

<p>Whilst I doubt anyone sensible will deny that there are glitches and bugs in Skyrim, I have to agree that I am yet to come across one that is actually game breaking. There are things I would prefer done different, some things I think could be done better.
 As much as I hate work arounds, and I do not think I should be expected to find one for a game I have paid for, in the real world it is the way it is...</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As has been said, with which I agree entirely, considering the nature, size and complexity of the the game, it isnt half as bad as it could be... but the area they really let themselves down (at least for me) is the DLC and the issues that always seems to
 happen when they are first released.</p>
<p>However Bethesda are not alone there...</p>
<p>- Also, OP, if you want Bethesda to consider your criticism, then maybe post your suggestion the official website will offer more chance of success....

<p>Skyrim has its fair share of glitches, but I myself have never came across one that is game breaking. It is forgivable given the size of skyrim and the amount of detail in it. But in all honesty Bethesda is an superb developer but any gamer who wish to invest
 in them should be aware of the glitches that come. But the glitches at times are hilarious I must admit.

<p>I was one of the sceptical gamers when it came to Skyrim. &nbsp; Bethesda are known for buggy games and I got burned a few times on Fallout 3. In fact I am still missing the achievement from Broken Steel because of a day 1 bug. &nbsp; &nbsp;I wont even get into how much
 of a bug infested disaster New Vegas was. I know its&nbsp;a different developer but NV still used the game engine from Bethesda that was used in Fallout 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With that said I am beyond shocked at how well Skyrim has been in terms of being bug free. I have well over 240+ hours into Skyrim and I have not run into a single game ending bug. In fact I cant even recall any major bugs at all with this game that frustrated
 me. If I did run into a problem, it was nothing I couldnt resolve with a game save re-load.</p>

            Hello,
<br />Windows Defender is at least as efficient as Norton without all issues caused by Norton.
<br />So just uninstall Norton

    <title>Xbox360 DLC License Transfer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supersize09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox360 DLC License Transfer</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I'm stumped here.</p>
<p>I've already done the License Transfer after buying a slim.</p>
<p><br />
Step from powering on the Slim:</p>
<p>Logged into live and Downloaded my profile, did the online License Transfer through the xbox360.</p>
<p>Then proceeded to download all my old DLC etc.<br />
The current game of choice for the family is WWE 12, which was working perfectly offline, and each local profile could access the DLC.</p>
<p>Well now on the new xbox360, you can only play the WWE 12 DLC while online and with the Live profile only, or I get error that the "downloadable content package isn't accessible, please re-download the content again"</p>
<p>From what I am aware you could use DLC for your Live profile, plus all local profiles on the Licensed Xbox360</p>
<p>But this isn't happening for any of the DLC, like before.</p>
<p>Anyone come across this at all??</p>
<p>Whats the next step?</p>

<p>Hey there Supersize! I have checked in to your account and do see that there is an open investigation for you on this issue. Unfortunately I don't have the visibility to personally assist you with this issue, but I will keep my eye on this issue for you.
 Can you clarify when you were told it would be 10 days? Did they say they would call you back at that point? When was the last time you heard from them? Let me know, thanks!

<p>I was told it would take a week during my first support online "chat", then 10 days extra after my first phone call a week and a bit later, then the next phone call the lady said it usually take 20 days to complete, they took my phone number and said that
 its already been 20 days so they would get someone to call me soon, that was on Friday of last week and still haven't heard anything.</p>
<p>I'm sorry but seriously this isn't good enough 20+ days, the first support guy never even asked for the console ID's.</p>

                    <p>I have tried all the suggestion on this forum, as well as all I can find on-line,&nbsp;with no solution.&nbsp; I am running Panda Security however, I de-installed it and the problem remained.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried the repair on the original CD's, ran Fixit, and a number
 of other solutions.&nbsp; I would just reformat the drive and start over but donot have my original CD's for MS Office and can't afford to loose it.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Vista Professinal</p>
<p>SP2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I tried to reset the update app I lost the history of the updates that are on this machine.&nbsp; The last update was 2/1/2013.&nbsp; So that should give an idea of where the OS is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran sfc/scannow as suggested in my previous post and found a file it could not fix:</p>

<p>2013-03-03 11:26:35, Info CSI 000001fd [SR] Could not reproject corrupted file [ml:520{260},l:46{23}]"\??\C:\Windows\System32"\[l:22{11}]"autochk.exe"; source file in store is also corrupted</p>
<p>Since both the working file and the source are corrupted, where can I get an un-corrupted version of "autochk.exe" and how do I go about replacing this one?</p>

<p>Running Vista Professional SP2.</p>
<p>Thanks, Lester</p>

    <title>No HDMI Out Signal on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericksonl  say:</h3>
<h2>            No HDMI Out Signal on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been using my new Xbox for over a month with no change to any settings since I set it up. I played on it last night with no issues and turned it off. I tried to turn it on today and I got no video signal, but I got audio through the optical cable.
 I tried multiple things to isolate the issue, but to sum up the most telling tests I used two different HDMI cables and two different hidef TVs with the same results, no video signal. In using the different tvs I had to physically unplug the Xbox One and move
 it to a different room so I have also forced a complete power off and power on.</p>
<p>Through this process of elimination I have narrowed the problem to the HDMI Out not sending a signal, but I am now at a loss as to what to do about it. Any help would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>P.S. I tried multiple inputs and I verified that I was on the proper input on the TVs based on the physical label I plugged the Xbox into. The issue is not an incorrect input. Additionally, I am well aware there is an HDMI Input and HDMI Output on the back
 and I was most certainly plugged into the Output. Which is obvious, because it worked yesterday and then not today, but I realize tech support must rule out the obvious first and I just want to reassure any support that I am aware of these potential problems
 and checked them. </p>

<p>Reset your display settings.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If there’s a disc in the Xbox One console, eject it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On the console, press and hold the Xbox button for five seconds to turn off the console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Press and hold the Xbox button and the Eject button until you hear a beep to turn on the console.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Note This will boot your console in a low resolution mode (640 × 480). If you can see things...reset these settings again, press the Menu button, select Settings, and then select Display &amp; sound.

<p>Thanks for the tip. I saw something similar for XBox360, but didn't know the steps. I am on vacation so it will be a week before I get a chance to try this.

<p>Yes I had same problem and apparently a lot of people have since this new update. I am sick of this type of stuff happening I didn't pay £100's of my hard earned income for your systems to fail and keep me off my xbox for days, controllers not syncing up
 properly because of Microsoft releasing a console that clearly was not ready or completed

<p>It sucks that all this is happening. But it's not a wide spread problem. I've not once had an issue. Works perfectly in all aspects. So its not the product per say that is bad. Its just localized problems that happen with any launch. Things will go wrong

<h3> janetkinlaw1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to make in app purchases in The Tribez in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>After an update, suddenly I was unable to purchase any in app purchase in the game.&nbsp; I spent several hours chatting with your techs.&nbsp; I rolled back the computer to before the update, and in doing so, I lost several items I had purchased that week without
 any recourse and because I had purchased, no longer able to repurchase.&nbsp; I was told that I needed to contact the game manufacturer, which I did and was told this is a Windows store issue and I needed to work with you to fix. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Twice, I spent 2 hours or more on the phone with your techs.&nbsp; I still can not purchase.&nbsp; They've done all the restore health and scans which is all I can find to "fix" the issue.&nbsp; I asked if there is a way to archive my purchase history and got no response
 at all.&nbsp; The last one was supposed to keep researching and give me a call back.&nbsp; Haven't heard a thing.&nbsp; Not even an email asking if it was working yet.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you though, I have been able to save a quite a bit of money I was very willing to give to you.&nbsp; I've been playing the game for several years now and have no idea how much I've spent during this time, but will not order another game
 from you with in app purchases.</p>

    <title>Transferring info from old Xbox to new one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xcharliegirlx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring info from old Xbox to new one</h2>
                    
<p>I have no idea about the Xbox so appreciate any plain speaking help thanks. My childrens xbox has broke, yet again, and while I have said I would not be replacing it as it has been nothing but trouble due to having spent a lot of money on games and LIVE
 membership I guess I have to.</p>

<p>We have a white Xbox 360 with external hard drive but the new xbox's have internal HDD am I right in thinking they would not be able to attach their old hard drive to a new xbox? I have read that everything is stored under their log in so what is actually
 stored on the hard drive? What will they be losing if the info/data cannot be transferred? Is there any way to transfer whatever is on their hard drive onto a new xbox? I have read about cables but posts were over a year old so don't know if they apply now
 to the new xbox's.</p>

<p>There are a few Q's there I would appreciate any help with. I'm not a total idiot where gaming is concerned :-) but not interested in how an xbox works, just how it will impact on my kids. If they are going to lose important stuff and have to start over
 again I will cut my loses (all the games and newly purchased live membership) and xbox can shove it up their bottoms :-) as I am fed up with having to pay for their shoddy goods. I have had to pay for the 6 discs which have been 'chewed', games I have bought
 which have refused to play and the countless controller and battery packs which last all of 2 minutes. Nah I'm not a fan of a console which has been the most expensive ever, I have 5 of the oppositions consoles and they are all working (versions 1,2 &amp; 3) and
 they haven't cost me as much as an xbox or given me any trouble. Sorry I needed that :-)</p>

<p>The new 360's hard drive is different and not compatible with the old version, though it's still accessible and not really an internal drive. All game saves, arcade games, add-ons, music, video, and etc is stored on the hard drive. Transfer cables are still
 an option and can be found on eBay for fairly cheap. Or if you have a USB flash drive then you can also use that to transfer content. Even if the USB drive isn't big enough to fit everything at once, you can still copy a bit at a time until it's all moved.
 See the link below for detailed instructions:</p>

<p>Once you're done with that you'll also want to follow the instructions from the link below to transfer his content licenses to the new Xbox.</p>

<p>A USB drive will be a hassle though since you'd need another Xbox 360 that allows the hard drive, then take the files you want and move them onto the USB then move them onto the Slim. Your best best as Lestat said, would be those transfer cables. It's really
 up to you how much money and etc you're willing to save.</p>

<p>Ohh yea... I guess it&nbsp;depends on what exactly is&nbsp;is wrong with the old Xbox,&nbsp;whether it will still turn on, and if it allow you to access the hard drive. If not, then a USB won't help much unless you can borrow a friend's console or something like that.</p>
<p>Also regarding the "chewed" games, make sure your kids have the Xbox laying flat instead of standing on it's side, and make sure it's never moved or bumped while a game is being played or the disc could be scratched. It's also a good idea to install games
 to the hard drive so the disc isn't constantly spinning - That saves the disc drive from wearing out and lessens the potential for discs to be scratched. I've played a fair amount of games over the years and never had my Xbox scratch a disc.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links and info. I know they have bought games and map packs and such with points but I assumed that is 'stored' under their log in. My kids probably know all that I'm asking here but I'm trying to decide if I will be replacing their xbox or
 not without having to deal with whining kids promising me the earth if i do :-)</p>

<p>Not sure what extent the damage is. It was self inflicted this time, I believe the console was knocked while playing a game it 'sizzled and screeched' before shutting down. Not 100% sure what the kids did immediately after but its not been turned on since.
 Thanks for the advice about laying it flat and this is what they do as a disc has never played when its on its side. Disc chewing started when I bought Halo and to this day I have never been able to get a copy of this to play, it was just that game and many
 discs were tried until the store refused to take the unplayable discs back for an exchange. Since then it will take a dislike to random games which are all useless now. Very frustrating as there is no reason or pattern to it. I am on a downer about xbox as
 I have never had any problems with their rivals consoles all of which still work and are many moons old (except the 2 x version 3's I have) yet nothing but problems with the xbox. I will certainly look into downloading a disc if I get this console to work
 or buy a new one. &nbsp;</p>

The official cables will be able to attach to the older HDD, as well as the new HDD if you need it down the road. A lot of Ebay sellers are "moving" older/unofficial cables which are basically useless. </p>

<p>A heads up, even with using the data transfer cable you will need to log into the account on the new xbox and do a license transfer and "redownload the data", truthfully it just update what xbox has the rights to play that content.</p>

<h2>            ADDRESSING DDOS ATTACKS</h2>
                    Recently the online community has suffered an extreme increase in ddos attacks targeting players during competitive matches. Why is it that we are so vulnerable to these attacks? Why has Microsoft done nothing to protect the security of its paying customers?

<p>[/quote]It's not just gamers that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks. &nbsp;Sites throughout the year get hit with massive DDoS attacks in an attempt to bring services of said site down. &nbsp;This is not something unique to gamers playing on an xbox. &nbsp;Also this is an
 issue that MS cannot particularly address as this is an attack that is not going through their network. &nbsp;It's happening over the internet itself. &nbsp;MS's only jurisdiction is over xbox live. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you (or anyone else for that matter) is suffering from a DDoS then you need to contact your ISP as MS has no control over this. &nbsp;If suspect anyone of breaching the Terms of Use or Code of Conduct then file a complaint via your console. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also MS has already dedicated a page to DDoS attacks:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/dos-attacks-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/dos-attacks-faq</a></p>

<p>Would you mind expanding in that for me please? &nbsp;I'm not sure whether you meant that I was mistaken calling it a ddos, or if I can use udp to counter ddos. (I'm sure that makes no sense, but I know very little about the topic) &nbsp;I have read up on it but don't
 quite understand how it is Microsoft would not be able to protect/encrypt/hide that info from other users. &nbsp;Seems like they have broken their own agreements on sharing our info...</p>

<p>Thank you for responding. &nbsp;I understand that it's done outside of the console, but I figure with the amount of money we put in to this community, that MS could easily find a solution.

<p>[/quote]Unfortunately there isn't another course of action. &nbsp;The attack is being done directly from one user to another user. &nbsp;MS has no control over the internet outside of their services, so as long as the guilty culprit is staying outside of xbox live
 to do this, nothing can be done in this situation, by MS. &nbsp;You can however take it up with your ISP, and they can look into it, and they can mitigate it, and possibly contact the offender's ISP to have them stop DDoS'ing one of their users.</p>

<p>[quote user="Gods TrgrFinger"]Why is it that we are so vulnerable to these attacks?[/quote]Because you play&nbsp;using client/server and not dedicated server. The&nbsp;"server" console can see all the&nbsp;"client" consoles.&nbsp;The "client" consoles all know which is the

<p>Actually with the new TOS agreement you signed &nbsp;MS takes Lag switching/ DDOS attacks and using modded controllers illegal. MS if you are caught lag switching/ ddos will contact your isp and ban your ip where you cannot get on live ever. If they are doing
 this to you and or your isp then contact them. I belive if we pay MS for service then this has to stop or they need to refund us the money and make it free like PSN.</p>

<p>From a legal perspective, this is not within MSFT's realm of responsibilities.<br /><br />Still, people do get banned for malicious attacks (DoS, DDoS).</p>

<p>I can't play a decent ranked game of Madden. For the longest I thought that there was a problem with my internet but when I did my research online I saw what the problem was. Why is it so easy for these kids to boot me off of the servers, maybe even offline?
 This is not what I paid my money for. </p>

<p>ddos attacks on your home IP address is out of scope for Microsoft they have no control over that section, Your IP address is publicly available and unfortunately it is up to to the ISP to resolve any and all ddos attacks. &nbsp;You might pay Microsoft for a
 service but how you access that service is your responsibility hence you will have to contact your ISP to have these attacks investigated and change your IP address.</p>

<p>Taidara What I said is true. MS has the resource to stop a ip flood. I can tell you this because I worked for a isp so I would know. If you got hacked or ddos that company must report to the isp so that a ticket can be started. Also the police will be involved
 if the isp found the person that did this. Say me and you join a game match. I can get everyones ip address. Also if you join a xbox live party without being on a game I can get your ip address. So with the 2nd one in mind that is on ms servers the chat. You
 telling me that I have to contact my isp and ms cannot do anything about it is BS. You can quote me and mark through some things like illegal controlllers that give you a unfair advantage and lag switching all you want. The fact is MS themselfs have lately
 been ddos but hides the fact so no customers will leave. If this actually gets out onto the news MS will suffer more loss than ever. I give sony thumbs up because at least they let people know what happen.</p>
