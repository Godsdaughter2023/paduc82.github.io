<p><br />
That one is the Built-in Administrator Account. It is part of the system. You could call it the Almighty Admin because it can do anything without the UAC interruptions.</p>
<p>You cannot change its account type, you cannot " remove " it.<br />
But, you can disable it.<br />
<br />
Before you do that...</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you have your own admin account.<br />
Make sure your own admin account is working.<br />
</strong><br />
To disable Buit-in Administrator Account .....<br />
Logpn to your own admin account &gt; start button &gt; in the search box, type cmd &gt; look up to top left, right click at cmd.exe&nbsp;&gt; click Run As Administrator &gt; in the black and white window, at the flashing prompt type this command line .......<br />
<br />
<strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong></p>
<p><strong>press Enter key.<br />
<br />
** copy/paste the command line to avoid typo.**</strong></p>
<p>It is now disabled.</p>

    <title>I can&#39;t print through my network printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianperryza  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t print through my network printer</h2>
                    <p>My Laptop (Vista) used to print wirelessly (to a Canon MP610) through my&nbsp;home network, linking wirelessly to the system router and&nbsp;from there by ethernet cable to&nbsp;my old desktop&nbsp;computer&nbsp;which ran&nbsp;Windows XP. This was linked by USB cable to the printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have a new desktop computer (Dell XPS 8500) running Windows 8. The connections are the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made all the same correct connections, but although the printer is 'shared' and the laptop is part of the Homegroup and the two can exchange documents, the laptop&nbsp;will not print through the network. I keep getting error message 0x0000000d when I try
 to connect and being told that the printer is offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can print OK from the desk top. I can print from the Laptop if I connect by USB and configure the USB Port. I would like to print wirelessly from the Laptop through the homegroup network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a Windows 8 problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ihave spent 2&nbsp;1/2 days on the phone to the Dell software support team, and the other half day getting new drivers for Windows 8 from Canon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone out there knows the answer!</p>

            Network printers are not shared since they are connected to the router wirelessly or by ethernet cable and not connected by usb cable to a computer. Since the Canon printer is not a wireless printer it is a shared printer on the new computer connected
 by usb cable. Make sure you select File and Printer sharing on the new computer. Install the software and windows 8 drivers you get from Canon Support--do not use the printer install disk since it will be out of date for win 8--on the new computer.&nbsp;The connected
 computer must be on and not sleeping or hibernating so the other computers can use it.
<div><br />
<div>Forgot to mention--go to Network &amp; Sharing Center by seaching or by right clicking on the network icon in the lower right corner, select Advanced sharing settings to share the printer on the network.</div>

<h2>            Why cant I resize windows properly, and why can&#39;t I see my Desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Long story short: I left my laptop open and my cat sat on the keyboard.&nbsp; I don't know if that is what did this, or if it is part of the Windows update errors that people are having.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last idk 36-48 hours I have not been able to see my Desktop, the screen is dominated by the... I don't even know what to call it - Start bar/Windows thing.&nbsp; The ugly constantly changing blocks window that used to be small and hidden at the lower
 left of my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot adjust the size of any of my windows, they are either open to full screen, or minimized into the tool tray/bar whatever the hell people are calling the strip at the bottom of the screen now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent most of yesterday trying to fix this, reading endless posts telling people "It's stuck in Tablet Mode." I have checked, rechecked, restarted, rechecked and restarted until i wanted to kill myself.&nbsp; MY laptop is NOT in tablet mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using computers for over 25 years now. I am not an idiot, but I am not a programmer either.&nbsp; I am just so frustrated with this situation that I can't think straight any more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some please tell me a solution that does not require 15 steps to complete and some kind of computer degree to understand?&nbsp; In theory my cat did this my mashing a few keys, why is it so hard to find a solution?</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 populating Outlook 2016 drafts folder with the same missed conversation</h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently having an issue with Skype for Business 2016 populating the Outlook 2016 drafts folder with missed conversations. The individual that missed the conversation eventually responded. However, the drafts folder keeps populating the missed conversation
 multiple times. The drafts folder had about 450 of the same missed conversation item. I had to clear the user\appdata\microsoft\office\16.0\lync\sip_(account)\history spooler folder in order to prevent the same missed conversation from populating the drafts
 folder. Is this a known issue or can it be corrected? I assume another missed conversation will cause the drafts folder to start filling up again.</p>

<p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a known issue and of course it can be corrected.</p>
<p>Firstly, please try to update the Outlook client to the latest builds (Open the Outlook client &gt;
<em><strong>File</strong> </em>&gt;<em><strong> Office Account</strong></em>&gt; <em><strong>Update</strong>
</em>options), then delete the Lync/Skype cache folder<em><strong> C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</strong>
</em>and check if they can help rectify the issue. If not, I’d like to confirm which scenario below matches yours to move forward on this issue:<br />
A.&nbsp;Your Skype for Business (SFB) client is signed with a SFB Online account. And your Outlook client is configured with an Exchange Online account.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;Your Outlook client is configured with other email account (not Exchange Online account), or your SFB client is signed with other account (not SFB Online account).</p>
<p>C. Or any other scenario?</p>
<p><em><strong>For scenario A</strong></em>: This is the supported scenario in our Office 365 forum. Our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business online services. If this is the case, please provide your tenant information and problematic email address via
 private message. I will help you involve our escalation team to troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access it.<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p><em><strong>For scenario B</strong></em>: This issue is more strictly related to Outlook client settings. For this scenario, it is recommended that you post at our Outlook client forum to troubleshoot it:</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-us/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-us/home?forum=outlook</a></p>
<p>They are more proficient at Outlook client configuration.</p>
<p>Which one is your scenario? I appreciate your clarification.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A 1TB (Terrabyte) USB drive can be bought for under 100.00 and of course smaller drives<br />
cost even less.<br />
<br />
Get a USB External Drive - use Start -&nbsp;Computer&nbsp;&nbsp; OR&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Explorer to navigate to<br />
the folders you want to put on the external drive - RIGHT CLICK on the Folder names - COPY<br />
navigate to the USB Drive&nbsp;- RIGHT CLICK in right panel and PASTE. <br />
<br />
When you RIGHT CLICK on a top Folder all the sub-folders are also copied.<br />
<br />
Make sure the USB External Drive has copies of all the pictures and documents you need.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> fraxis_tcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 reactivation after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    I have noticed several comments about reactivating Office after upgrading to windows 10.&nbsp; In a business environment this can created a real problem because of the time wastage. Some people may have 5 days and 4 hrs to kill but most do not.&nbsp; Since the Office
 2013 was from an expired MSAP, the activation key had expired.&nbsp; Interestingly, when i returned to windows 7 the activation key was now not needed and my office problems went away.&nbsp;&nbsp; This seems like a registry issue and MS needs to resolve this during the installation
 process along with the add printer and print spooler issue.&nbsp; Maybe all this will be resolved in a couple of months and updates from now.&nbsp;

            In other words when i went back to windows 7 i did not need to reactivate office 2013 anymore which meant i didnt have to spend long hrs on hold with (Foreign Country tech support) to get something done that should not need to be redone.&nbsp;

            Hi Jeanette.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start.  
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Jeanette, 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Pin File to Taskbar</h2>
                    <p>The more "Advanced" computers become, the more inefficient they are. Have owned various computers since 1985!</p>

</p><p>I use several FILES on a regular basis. Prior to Windows 10, I could pin them,

<p>
</p><p>Why should I have to click folder icon on taskbar, then have to click AGAIN to open file?</p>

            Hi  pjwoods, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here every week . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer, and I know you're not going to like it,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi PJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>I'm having this same problem again.&nbsp; A couple years ago Microsoft fixed this problem with tablets with limited memory by allowing us to choose an installed memory card in addition to the other options of choosing a different external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we're back to the same problems again because this option isn't available anymore and reinstalling Windows 10 because it's begging for 8GB of memory and so forth.&nbsp; I'm going to try and get a standard USB to micro USB converter to try and use a thumb
 drive so it can have that option; I've read from others who've tried something similar it didn't work because that drive wasn't recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too wonder why Dell made this tablet with such limited memory when you can't do much with the device other than surf the internet because every time an update or something comes around this little jewel can't remember it has tons of other storage already
 but for some reason Microsoft makes the tablet dumb and doesn't know how to use it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I don't have this problem with my desktop, laptop, and other Dell tablet which has two or four times the memory; I can't remember exactly how much because I really don't care because if it works I don't get too excited about it, I'm just happy
 the thing works without getting into the weeds of how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help with this that doesn't entail reinstallation, checking all kinds of files, switches, and so forth because I've really had it with going on scavenger hunts or recreating the wheel every time I ask for help; this is normally what
 happens when I call tech support; dealing with Verizon Home Internet/Cable is the worst experience ever when dealing with customer service when trying to get their substandard equipment to work that I'm forced to rent from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm asking for is for Microsoft to reenable the ability for us the choose an internal memory card for the temporary storage of these files like they did a couple years ago when we all had problems with the first Windows 10 major update.</p>

<h2>            Xbox live account deleted</h2>
                    <p>Our xbox live account has suddenly been deleted and no one will help us get it back. Called tech support amd they said you have to do it yourself and if that doesn't work you are out of luck. You cant be serious right? All the money spent on these games
 and they are just gone without us doing anything to make that happen..... I cant believe it!!!!!</p>

<p>Hey Dimples thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry this issue came up but rest assured we are here to assist. First things first, we suggest checking out our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Account Recovery Form</a> to possibly recover the account in question. Also we would like a little more information on the matter, can the account be signed into on another device? Give it a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or any other
 matter!</p>

            we have already tried going through the account recovery until it says this account cannot be recovered and says you should start a new account which is all fine and great except all the stuff we paid for it on the old account.

<p>Hey there Dimples! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this problem. As stated previously you would need to fill out the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/17875/microsoft-account-recover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account recovery form </a>correctly, If these answers are not matching then unfortunately you won't be able to access the account therefore everything that has been purchased on the account would be lost.
</p>
<p>This is why on the account you should always have up to date information for moments like these that you are unable to login, This way you are able to receive the recovery code to reset your password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>

<h2>            When I open OneNote, all I get is a purple screen&#33;</h2>
                    After around 30 seconds, the purple screen reverts back to the start page but I see that OneNote is still trying to load. &nbsp;When I look on task manager, OneNote isn't there. &nbsp;AHHH! I can't access anything past the solid purple page! (There isn't even a
 loading sign or OneNote logo, just a solid purple page.)
<div>I restarted OneNote and restarted my computer to see if OneNote would reset but every time I tried to open it, the app just went to the purple page. &nbsp;</div>

                    <p>I am adult with an XBOX&nbsp;account that is a number of years old with XBOX&nbsp;live and an user (Dingies).&nbsp;My user (Dingies)&nbsp;is mostly used by my child. I want to set the account as a family account and add parental time controls. Can someone walk me through how to make my main user (Dingies)&nbsp; a child? Or set up parental controls on the main account (Dingies)?&nbsp;I don't want to create a new user for my child because he has been playing as Dingies. I just want to limit the hours. Thanks!</p>

<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of
 various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software
 solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop).</span></p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands
 of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />

To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></a><span>.
 Do all the procedures.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster (though perhaps not
 so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).&nbsp; Even better, get Autoruns from
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;and use it instead as it is a MUCH superior product to Vista's msconfig.&nbsp; When I did this on my system I was able to remove
 over 90% of the listed items and it showed a noticeable change in startup and when working on the computer throughout the day.<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using
</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;(which also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of
 normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but
 probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span>&nbsp;is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts
 on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I would also suggest downloading
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></span><span><span><br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

            In the most recent bugcheck, the BSOD occurred when verifier detected a non-fatal error. "A driver has returned STATUS_PENDING but did not mark the IRP pending by a call to IoMarkIrpPending. (IRP specified.)" &nbsp;In this case, the driver was&nbsp;LGBusEnum.sys,
 a Logitech driver. &nbsp;That driver is from July 2009, so you may wish to try updating it.
<div><br />
<div>Essentially, verifier detected a non-fatal bug that the driver was responsible for. &nbsp;If you can't update that driver, I'd suggest uninstalling it and seeing how things work. Delete verifier settings as well, after removing or updating the Logitech software.
 &nbsp;Post details of any new bugchecks (including dump files). &nbsp;Depending on those bugchecks, it may be worthwhile to turn verifier on again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, try disabling legacy USB support in the BIOS.</div>

            <p>I was experiencing a similar issue. The touch keyboard icon on the taskbar did nothing - either in tablet or desktop mode. Turns out the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service had somehow been disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the Windows key and type services.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service. The service should be running and the service type should be set to automatic. The service type can be changed by double-clicking the service. If both of these settings are correct, try stopping
 and restarting the service. </p>

            Hi  alinesavoie ,
<br />
<br />You may need to reinstall Alexa. If your machine isn't preinstalled with the software then it's easy enough to install, though you'll first need to ensure your PC is up to date and configured with US Language settings.
<br />
<br />    Download Amazon Alexa for Windows 10
<br />    Run the installer file
<br />    Click Install
<br />    Click 'Yes' when prompted by User Account Control to allow this app to make changes to your device
<br />    You'll be prompted to restart your machine once the installation is complete
<br />    Once the PC has booted launch Alexa from the Start menu
<br />    Click 'Set up Amazon Alexa'
<br />    Click 'Continue' to accept the T&amp;Cs
<br />    Click 'Finish setup'
<br />    Sign into your Amazon account
<br />    The software will prompt you to install the latest update
<br />
<br />Normally, you should contact Amazon support/FAQ to see how to cofigure it.
<br />Thank you.       
        </p>

<h2>            windows 10 mobile help</h2>
                    I have just downloaded the new windows 10 mobile for my phone. I have a number of problems.<br />
I cannot use the outlook mail app, it just keeps asking me to add an account. Same for the calendar app.
<br />
I have none of my phone contacts, despite having synced them from my sim. Nor can I add new contacts. It has the option to add new, but when I click it, the screen briefly shows a new page, but then backs out to the home screen.
<br />
I have installed the latest update, and checked to see if there is a new one, I even turned my phone off and on a few times to see if that worked, including taking the battery out for a little while. I have also been into carphone warehouse to ask them for
 advise. <br />
I am at my wits end and would dearly love for this to work.

            <p>I had similar issues until I "Reset" my phone...&nbsp; now everything seems to work "perfectly."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Reset is under Settings, System, About, and at the very bottom there. It asks at some point if you want to delete your Apps on the SD card, and it worked better when I did that (the second time...) still leaving my other files intact on the SD, pictures,
 videos, etc... It also asks if you want to transfer info. from a backup of your "old phone"...&nbsp; That just made it as crappy as it was before, so I wouldn't suggest that...)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, besides having to go to the Store and re-download most of your Apps and update them, it was way more painless than trying to figure out why things like e-mail were either not working, or hanging, or working slow, etc...&nbsp; I know&nbsp;others here have suggested
 the same and similar... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, add my vote then,&nbsp;to a clean install.&nbsp; A few days later and I'm honestly happy with Windows 10 Mobile, now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Oh, PS, even though it says "reset," it doesn't revert to 8.1... it&nbsp;clean installs 10....]</p>

            <p>Thank you sooooooooooo&nbsp; much for posting this solution to the&nbsp;Windows 10 Mobile download issues. &nbsp;I had &nbsp;all of the issues posted above plus flickering screen on/off and loss of functions. These&nbsp; issues were completely disabling my phone except for calls.</p>
<p>My &nbsp;Windows Lumia 640XL LTE Dual&nbsp;Sim now functions in all the basics, and the recover data option worked well for my contacts. I have yet to get my apps back from the Windows Store and personalise the start screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall use this opportunity to keep the 'apps count' low .</p>
