<h2>            N71 supplied memory card, questions&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone<br />
<br />
With my 71 i recieved a 128mb card. When i take a look at the card content on the app in the phone it tells me something is hogging 30mb of memory, but i dont see what it could be. any ideas?<br />
<br />
Also the phone came with quickoffice pre-installed which i have tried to uninstall but app manager tells me that it cannot???<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

            If QuickOffice is installed in ROM (Read-Only Memory), it can't be uninstalled, but there it doesn't use any space that you could use anyway.<br />
<br />
If you have a PC, connect the phone to the PC with the supplied USB cable in "Data transfer" mode, and you will be able to see the complete card contents on the PC.<br />
<br />
You can also simply reformat the card (use the options of the "Memory" app in the phone for that) and clear out anything and everything stored there.

    <title>Office 365 OneNote App access by external user with Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john connett cmt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 OneNote App access by external user with Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm a volunteer Systems Administrator for a museum (charity, non-profit) and was hoping to use
<strong>OneNote</strong>&nbsp;as a multi-user collaboration tool between our <strong>Office 365</strong> licensed users and external users identified by email address. My hope was to allow this collaboration in a well-controlled manner. My preferred option in<strong>
 Office 365 | Admin =&gt; SharePoint Admin Center =&gt; Sharing</strong> was <em>Allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users</em> but I could live with
<em>Allow sharing only with the external users that already exist in your organization's directory</em>. It appeared that the only requirement for an external user to participate would be a
<strong>Microsoft Account</strong> linked to their email address. These are freely available and I anticipated that external users with an existing&nbsp;<strong>Work or School&nbsp;Account</strong> or an
<strong>Office 365 Account</strong> would also be able to participate. <strong>OneNote</strong> clients are freely available for a variety of platforms (although I couldn't find anything for<strong> Linux</strong> apart from the web interface). It sounded like
 an excellent solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works fine for users with user names like <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> but I am having problems with external users like
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>. These external users appear as active users with user names of the form
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>. On a PC signed in as <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> I can browse to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/mysite which displays the Documents for the
<strong>UnifiedGroup</strong> and click on Notebook which displays the Notebook with
<strong>OneNote Online</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then try <strong>FILE</strong> =&gt; <strong>Edit in Microsoft OneNote </strong>
I am not able to edit. There is a sign in request and I enter the <strong>Microsoft Account
</strong>credentials which are accepted but result in the message <em>Sorry, we couldn't open the notes you were looking for. They may have been moved or deleted, or you may not have permission to open them</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some details of the user from the directory:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">PS C:\Users\SomeBody&gt; Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** | FL UserPrincipalName,UserType,CloudExchangeRecipientDisplayType</p>

<div>
<p class="contentCodeblock">UserPrincipalName&nbsp;: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
UserType : Guest<br />
CloudExchangeRecipientDisplayType : 6</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">PS C:\Users\SomeBody&gt; </p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked a related question, <a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/445629?pi14985=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add external user with Microsoft Account to UnifiedGroup?</a> , elsewhere but am still confused! The suggested solution was to create a
<strong>MailUser</strong> for each external user. This creates the additional complication of having to manage an additional identity,
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em>, and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would much prefer a solution with a single identity for the external user and let them manage their own password. However, I can see that there might be a problem connecting the external
<strong>Microsoft Account </strong>to the Notebook on <strong>Office 365</strong>. How would it know that it was on contoso.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone point me to a clear explanation of how external users are intended to work with a Notebook hosted on Office 365?</p>

            <p>Hi, you are doing the right stuff. OneNote is not very good at Multi-user and sharing. For your case here at the museum I strongly reccomend you start using OneNote class notebook creator. Dont mind the name as it is simply a multi user OneNote creation
 tool for education or corporations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use this tool for multi user scenarios where you distribute notebooks to other people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onenote.com/classnotebook</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>About external sharing. This one is tricky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only way to share notebook and allow edit is by them having</p>
<p>a. A Microsoft Account</p>
<p>b. A Office 365 account </p>
<p>
</p><p>The best experience is with a 365 account. </p>
<p>That microsoft account sharing is so-so as you experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like tech stuff, mabye Azure AD B2B could help you.</p>

            <p>That looks like a very helpful reply! Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be two steps in adding an external user to a <strong>UnifiedGroup</strong> so that they can then access the associated
<strong>OneNote</strong> notebook:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Add the external user to the Office 365 directory;</li><li>Make the external user a member of the group.</li></ol>
<p>It's the first step that I have been struggling with. Maybe <strong>Azure AD B2B
</strong>could help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be happy to use <strong>PowerShell</strong> to create the directory entries if I knew the appropriate cmdlets and parameters to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faced with a list of email addresses and display names (and any other required information?) I would like to be able to create directory entries for them. I suspect that the email address must be able to find an associated
<strong>LiveId</strong> to confirm that it is known to Microsoft. Not sure what would happen if the same address is associated with both a
<strong>Microsoft Account </strong>and a <strong>Work or School Account</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time for some reading.</p>

            <p>using the Class notebook creator should fix issues with distributing notebooks, however the external user scenario&nbsp;is simply not a "supported" scenario.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have Office 365 and adding/managing external users can be tricky and you will not get the super experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggest:</p>
<p>&gt;Get the external users email's and add them to your Azure AD /Azure AD B2B and then import them into your Azure AD using a CSV file.</p>
<p>&gt;Put them in a group called external users</p>
<p>&gt;Share the OneNote with that group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to curate that group. The users will not be active untill they log in. Before they login they will have the EXT* infront of their UPN.</p>

            <p>Many thanks. I used the the old Azure Active Directory portal (https://manage.windowsazure.com) to inspect the
<strong>USERS</strong> and <strong>GROUPS</strong> I had already created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong>USERS </strong>the entries for external users with Microsoft Accounts had their account email address as their USER NAME and their SOURCED FROM as "Microsoft account". Their UserPrincipalName, obtained from
<strong>Get-MsolUser</strong>, had the Microsoft Account with the "@" replaced with "_" followed with "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried adding another external user with a Microsoft Account by clicking on "ADD USER"; selecting "User with an existing Microsoft account"; provided the account; proceeded to the next page; provided {FIRST NAME; LAST NAME; DISPLAY NAME; ROLE=User};
 then clicked the tick. The user was created and appeared to be similar to the others. I then clicked on it in
<strong>USERS</strong> and set its USAGE LOCATION to "United Kingdom".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used <strong>GROUPS</strong> to select the group and then <strong>MEMBERS</strong>. Clicked "ADD MEMBERS" and added the user. Confirmed that the user has been added to the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switched to the Office 365 portal (https://portal.office365.com); selected Admin center preview and confirmed that the user was among the Active users. Selected the group and the user
<strong>wasn't among the members!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Office 365 | Outlook; selected the group and inspected the members. The new user
<strong>wasn't among the members!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some more digging and I found that, unlike the others, the new user had UserPrincipalName of the Microsoft account with the "@" replaced with "_" followed by *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Could this be the source of the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to use the new Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) but that could only see my
<strong>Visual Studio Professional with MSDN </strong>subscription but not the<strong> Access to Azure Active Directory
</strong>subscription. Browsing to "Active Directory" takes me back to the old Azure portal. Is this expected behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be no "B2B" in the new Azure portal but there is "Azure AD B2C".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sharing with external users with Microsoft accounts appears poor or worse.</p>

            <p>The thing we are doing is not going to be as elegant as you would like to. It is really now scenario that covers your intended usage with OneNote at this point. Just putting it out there.</p>
<p>btw, no need to use portal.azure.com or portal.office.com at this point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Azure B2B part is not a separate function. It is the part when you in manage.windowsazure.com add an additional active directory and source users from that directory into your main directory so you can add them to your services.</p>
<p>(after putting them in a group)</p>
<p>
</p><p>They will be "external users" even in your own directory as they have no license to use any services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to group external users and share a OneNote notebook with them.</p>

Add new users or users with Microsoft accounts to Azure Active Directory</a> which says

<p>
</p><p>I created a group "Externals" using the old Azure portal and added the three old and the new external users to it. Created a new group "Test Group". Went to the Test Group Notebook. Clicked "Share". Invited "Externals". Appeared to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the group "Externals" only has the three UserType "Guest" external users not the new one, UserType "Member", created via the old Azure portal. The group "Test Group" only has one member, the owner.</p>

            <p>You are right. Tried it to. Does not work.</p>
<p>You can only share the OneNote with users that are licensed in your directory or external users with a link/direct invite.

            <p>Thanks again. It appears that the answer to my original question <em>Office 365 OneNote App access by external user with Microsoft Account?</em> is that it is not currently possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the OneNote App would need to be able to obtain a one-to-many relationship between the Microsoft account and tenants where it is a guest user. This would allow the UserPrincipalName
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</em>to be constructed&nbsp;so the shared Notebook could be found. Scope for a possible future enhancement to the OneNote App?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, access from OneNote Online does work if the guest external user can be found in the directory. In my case, if a user finds guest access inadequate for their needs then I can make them a member so that they can use the OneNote App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The underlying question&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;<em>how do you share an UnifiedGroup with an external guest user</em>? As this is off topic for the OneNote App part of the community I will pursue an answer elsewhere. It appears that the

            <p>You can not do what you are trying to do. That is the simple answer.</p>
<p>You are trying to manage users that do not have license to access the services or license to be managed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not add MS accounts to a managed group and have them given same premissions as an internal user.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Account password change for Nokia Lumia 1020 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmymoorcroft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account password change for Nokia Lumia 1020</h2>
                    <p>My partner has had a Nokia Lumia 1020 mobile for the last 18 months. When she bought it, the technician at the phone store set everything up on the phone for her, including her Microsoft Account. She is now being asked to enter her M.A. password to enable
 her to download an app. She tells me she has never known this password, and has never needed to use it before. She cannot therefore access her account. We tried the phone store where she got the phone from, so they created a NEW Microsoft Account for her,
 with the intention of resetting the phone, and then entering the new account. However, the phone kept defaulting to the OLD account user name / password. He told us this was common with this type of phone, and that we'd need to contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>This I did. I was told I'd need to use the account verification form on-line. When I tried to do this, it asked us lots of questions relating to an @live.com email account which has NEVER, EVER, BEEN USED. Because we couldn't pass the security test for proof
 of ownership of the account, Microsoft Support have referred me to this forum,&nbsp;<strong>9
</strong>emails later.</p>
<p>I am now hoping somebody else can suggest a way of resolving this, as it has been on-going since 22.09.15.</p>

<p>Microsoft takes security of passwords very seriously (which is understandable) so when setting up an account there a ways to create a means of account verification. If that was never done and if she does not remember the password (or if they never told her
 which I'm surprised at) the quickest way might be to hard reset the device and use the new account you set up.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I'm assuming that you can use the device and make calls, and that you can see the start screen and by swiping to the left can see the apps already on the device. Correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes then look at the app list and go to Settings</p>
<p>Scroll down to ABOUT</p>
<p>Click ABOUT then click on MORE INFO</p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom on the page and click on RESET YOUR PHONE</p>
<p>There will be a warning message so click yes and it will go through the process of returning the device to the way it was when it came out of the box</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it is done, you then can setup the device using the new account that you created</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also assuming that when they helped you create the NEW Microsoft account and that they created it by going to outlook.com and created a new account that uses something like "jimmy(at)outlook.com" and there is a password that you wrote down.
</p>
<p>I want you to go to a PC and go to www.outlook.com and log in using that user name that was used and the password just to make sure that it works. If it does then you can hard reset the device and start the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they did not setup the NEW account using outlook.com then you create a new account from outlook.com. You do not have to use outlook.com but I highly recommend it for a variety of reasons which I will not get into now. Just make sure you setup an account
 with outlook.com ... trust me on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device should setup fine at that point. Her primary email account will be that account name and you can add other email accounts if she wants but the primary will be the outlook.com email.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. Just a question that I'm sure you've had many times before though - how do I back up the MANY photos and contacts that she currently has on her phone, prior to resetting it back to the factory settings ?</p>

<h2>            Continuous subform&#58; Unbound control to pull data based on record</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found myself against a brick wall and don't know if what I want to do can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Reconciliation Form that contains a continuous subform.&nbsp; To display the data I am using VBA to populate a number of comboboxes with the data I desire, however this only works for the first row and then repeats. Is there any way to force the comboboxes
 to "requery" for each entry in the recordset I'm working with?</p>

<p>You're not using the continuous form correctly. It is not a grid like Excel, but rather (like datasheet) designed for showing BOUND data, meaning there is a Form.RecordSource, and all controls have a ControlSource.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to set aside VBA for a moment and create a query that can be the recordsource for the subform? Maybe something like: select * from someTable where Reconciled=False;</p>

<p>The subform has a record source, and I use this record source to identify what data I want to populate my comboboxes with. My problem is that it only does so for the first record. here is a screen cap of my form:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c2c3f55-3725-4ee6-b18e-13038fa3cff2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c2c3f55-3725-4ee6-b18e-13038fa3cff2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The sub-subform is where I am having trouble. the comboboxes are populated using the textbox's which are bound. I want this to happen on a per row basis. In the VBA I do thus (which again works for the first row):</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RecordSet for the sub-subform is set at the master form level and is dictated by the dropdown found there. Everything else works as I want it to... just not the continuous form...</p>

<p>The comboboxes I see are all unbound (have no ControlSource). That's going to cause the problem I outlined.</p>
<p>For the moment setting the Rowsource of the comboboxes is besides the point (but it may later cause secondary issues).</p>

            but I don't want/need a control source. that binds the data to the back end itself, not the goal here. Even if it was, I am trying to group each field represented by a combobox on the texboxes values. Can such a grouping be done? I thought to do so with
 the RecordSet, but I know that each record gets a line in a continuous form... which is not what I was trying to do....

<p>Sometimes one plays the fool...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Learning experience for those to follow. It turns out that in a continuous form there is no way to use unbound controls because the rows are not treated as instances (coming from a web dev background I assumed they where), instead it is just redrawn and
 populated with bound data.... so unbound controls are just copied. I'll have to figure out a different way to do what I want.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook Tasking - Grouping By More than One Field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Tasking - Grouping By More than One Field</h2>
                    <p><strong>OS &amp; Software:</strong> Working on Windows 8.1 Pro. Office 365 Business with exchange server.</p>
<p><strong>Updated?</strong> I have made sure that both the Windows 8.1 &amp; Office 365 are updated. Due to company software, we cannot work on Windows 10 OS, so the OS is as updated as we can get.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> </p>
<p>When trying to group the tasks on the To-Do Bar (or folder) by DueDate&nbsp; ThenBy Category, all of the tasks dissapear (shows there aren't any, the tasks are actually still there). All of the tasks have due dates -- though not all of the tasks have categories.
 This just happened in the most recent update. Working with mostly emails that were turned into tasks, but also have a few actual tasks that were created. I have tested it with both individually, and it still does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried grouping by different fields -- not category or due date, it seems that any time I group by more than 1 category, my to-do bar says that there are no tasks, when there are.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Googled high and low and cannot find any mention of this by anyone else experiencing this issue. But a co-worker and I are both having this issue after the latest Windows/Office updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that a work around would be to roll back the outlook version, but I am trying to see if anyone has a solution or fix before I do so.

    <title>Command Button Icon Gets Duplicated After Click Event is Performed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> statmanhal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Command Button Icon Gets Duplicated After Click Event is Performed</h2>
                    I have an Active X Command button that copies a range and pastes it into another location. The changed cells move on the screen vertically a bit leaving two pictures of the Command button – one apparently real and one where the Command button used to be
 before the click event.. I can get rid of the duplicate by scrolling or clicking the ‘real’ Command button again. The screen window has a horizontal partition – the top 3 rows are always viewable.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the code I used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>Range("H103:T115").Select</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Copy</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Range("H25").Select</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ActiveSheet.Paste</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I automatically prevent the second command button picture?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I added</p>
<p>Appication ScreenUpdating = False at the beginning of the code</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Application ScreenUpdating =True at the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That seems to do the trick. Is this the way or am I just temporarily lucky?</p>

<p>I have had this "ghosting" before but under different conditions. One suggestion was to uninstall the video driver and reinstall it. However, that did not fix it and I just put up with it until it came time to do a total re-installation of windows and software
 due to other problems and the ghosting problem has not been there since so I am suggesting it is a glitch in the software somewhere.</p>
<p>However, there is no need to select ranges for copy and paste. The following copies and pastes in one line. Note it is one line with just a space between Copy and Destination. It might&nbsp;alleviate your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
&nbsp; Range("H103:T115").Copy Destination:=Range("H25")<br />
End Sub</p>

 storage/whatsapp/Databases"&nbsp; folder at Android smartphone. I would like to ask your help to give some directions about how to import the old messages to new Whatsapp on Android. I only need the messages (text), the videos and pictures are not important.</p>

            There is nothing new about this. &nbsp;All preview builds have shown "rs_1," etc. since the first redstone build back in late November. &nbsp;If you are trying to find a clue to whether or not 14393 is the final, you won't find it in the software. &nbsp;We will all know
 the final build when MS announces that the Anniversary Update has been released to manufacturing.

            <p>Here is another clue that build 14393 is the possibility of final. Look at this from Dona's twitter account.</p>
<p>I think this is a first time since no expiration dates have been showing up in builds. Microsoft is using windows update for a driver not a full build. This was posted earlier today.</p>
<p>
Known issues for PC
</p><ul>
<li><del>We are aware of certain cases in which Surface Books and Surface Pro 4’s may bugcheck (bluescreen) due to a camera driver issue. An updated driver will roll-out via Windows Update soon that will fix this.</del>&nbsp;After updating to this
 build (Build 14393), you should no longer experience bugchecks (bluescreens) due to a camera driver issue. The bad driver is removed on updating to this build and a new driver is rolling out via Windows Update.</li></ul>

<p>Its just a new driver.&nbsp; If you add a new piece of hardware to your device you will get a driver download, if needed, no matter what version or build of Windows you are running.&nbsp; Notice that this issue applies to Surface Books and Surface Pro 4s.&nbsp; That's
 why Microsoft can write the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, you are not going to find any definitive clue to the final build until MS announces rtm.&nbsp; In July 2015 we were on the final build for a week before we knew for sure.&nbsp; This time we know to watch for rtm.</p>

            I stick by my statement, when was the last time that Microsoft had a driver update for insider builds. Microsoft does it as of normal practice on patch Tuesdays for public builds not insider builds.

            When was the last time Microsoft did a new driver for <em>Surface Pro 4</em> and
<em>Surface Book</em>?&nbsp; The driver does not apply to most of us because we don't own
<em>Surface Pros </em>or <em>Surface Books</em>.&nbsp; It is a specific <em>Microsoft </em>
hardware issue.&nbsp; The other 100,000 or so hardware devices out there are completely unaffected.&nbsp; Fish away if you like but you are grasping at a very isolated facet of the blog.&nbsp; She talks about it because the devices are in-house,
<em>Microsoft </em>products.&nbsp; She does after all work for Microsoft.

<p>Hi Ray</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust me, trying to determine if a certain build is going to be the final build is an exercise in frustration. The&nbsp;odds of getting it correct are astronomical. I have been beta testing Windows since Windows 98 and I have never seen any particular formula
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do save screenshots of certain locations in each build of a Preview product just so I can&nbsp; refer back to them later, if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a SS of the BuildLab value in the registry of the first Build for Redstone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/096a4db8-7510-46a7-a8e3-0cdf52771957" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/096a4db8-7510-46a7-a8e3-0cdf52771957" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the Build number is <strong>11082</strong> the description is <strong>
RS1_Release</strong> with a code number at the end. This build was released on <strong>
December 16, 2015</strong>. Very similar to the screenshot you posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is located in the Registry at <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion</strong> and that location has a lot of good information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, there are currently close to 6 Million Insiders on the planet and they are probably using over at least 600,000 unique devices to test This Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When each build is released there are drivers included in that update for any system that happens to be experiencing a hardware problem. The driver only shows up for the devices that have the particular Hardware Device installed for that driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will guide you in the right direction.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You might be facing this issue due to the incompatibility of the drivers with Windows 10. I suggest you to update all drivers in device manger and check if it helps.</p>

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/how-to-update-drivers</span></a></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose whether this issue occurs in “Safe Mode”, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some third party programs conflict. The
 word Safe mode appear in the concern of your monitor to identify which windows mode you are using.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the below link to resolve the issue to perform safe mode.<br />

            Hi Chi
<br />
<br />You can install Office 365 on all your devices, your licence will cover that. Once you have initially installed Office 365, you no longer need your product key
<br />
<br />If there is a previous version of Office on the PC, you should uninstall that before installing Office 365
<br />
<br />1.
<br />To install Office on another PC that is attached to your Account:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, select Install Office - Install 
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />To Share Office with another person on their PC:
<br />
<br />Sign in to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/office/s...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Services &amp; subscriptions
<br />
<br />FInd your Office 365 subscription and click Sharing
<br />
<br />Choose Invite via email or Invite via link
<br />
<br />If you select Invite via email, enter the email of the person you want to share with and then select Invite - Got it
<br />If you want to invite someone else, select Invite someone else
<br />
<br />If you select Invite via link, copy the provided link then send that to the person or people you want to invite to share Office

    <title>Back Button in IE11, doesnt work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithcrotty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Back Button  in IE11, doesnt work</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I am really getting sick of having to double <strong>click the back button</strong> in order to try (and I emphasize try) to get back to a previous page.&nbsp;Originally, I just tried to never again go to a website that uses this practice.&nbsp; But now,&nbsp; you
 cant even do that because&nbsp;almost everyone is doing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a search and go to some link&nbsp; Hit the back button.&nbsp; It is not likely to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes two clicks will work, but more and more that doesn't work either.&nbsp; If
<strong>start doing a rapid fire</strong> on it, it will sometimes work, but then that usually takes you back about 4 searches prior.&nbsp; Far too often, you just cant even get off the page so you have to hit the home button.&nbsp; This is especially irritating if you
 are on page 15 of a search.&nbsp; Now you don't even remember what page you were on or even what your search parameters were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked for solutions.&nbsp; One post wanted us to add those sites to blocked, or such.&nbsp; Really!&nbsp; If I did that there would probably only be about 10 web pages that I could visit.&nbsp; Additionally, this is
<strong>not an issue with FireFox</strong>.&nbsp; FireFox does have an issue of displaying a blank page on the back button, but that is fixable by changing a setting in options.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I want to use IE.&nbsp; But it is almost not usable now because of

            <p>First. thank you for the reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not found much for suggestions,&nbsp;so&nbsp;I am&nbsp;suspecting that it may be just my pc.&nbsp; I typically, stay with defaults, I don't install a lot of extras. Mostly, Microsoft, VS express products.&nbsp; I am running
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thunderbird&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Spotify</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yahoo IM</p>
<p>&nbsp; Skype</p>
<p>&nbsp; Free Desktop Timer</p>
<p>&nbsp; Replay Media Catcher 6</p>
<p>&nbsp; GFI Backup</p>
<p>&nbsp; VLC Media Player&nbsp; (had to do some cleanup after that install )&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, I cannot set the stereo mix option&nbsp;on My pc.&nbsp; Its just not there and the chat suggests that it is a driver issue.&nbsp; My audio is on the mother board, so not much I can do there.&nbsp; I erroneously thought that Windows Media Player was having a
 problem and installed&nbsp;VLC&nbsp; I do not think that has anything to do with this.</p>

</p><p>Ok,, for your questions.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer? </p>
<br />
<p>I dont have the date, but it was when windows 8 was released, and the 8.1 update when it wa released.&nbsp;&nbsp; both were done within days of the release.</p>
<br />
</span>
<p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<br />
<p>This was an was a clean install.&nbsp; I did the install on a new harddrive. Well, then my hard drive crashed, bought a new one and repeated then install.&nbsp; So I am not sure how long its been.&nbsp; But it has been running properly for quite some time,&nbsp; Im guessing
 this has been going on for a couple of months.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currenty-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,<em>not</em>

<br />
<p>I do have CCleaner, but it only runs occassionally. I did run MalwareBytes once, after this problem occurred,&nbsp; but that is gone now.&nbsp; Those are the only two things i have used for years, and of course Windows Defender.</p>

<p>　</p>
<p>7a. Is Modern IE11 (AKA IE11 Metro) <em>and IE11 Desktop</em> working OK otherwise?</p>
<br />
<p>Ths one is harader to answer.&nbsp; I have only used the Modern version i think once.&nbsp; I just clicked in the IE icon to open it.&nbsp; It appears to go the the windows store, and I dont see any way out of it or to perform a search other than with the windows store.&nbsp;
 Maybe I have to install the google app.&nbsp; Whatever, im not going to use it.&nbsp; Its one of those things where Im going to stay with the desktop version, same as Skpe.&nbsp; In fact, mnost of the new style apps, I just dont like.&nbsp; Ill stay with the desktop versions.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the desktop works as expected as well as the IE11 there, other than this problem of coursse.</p>
<br />
</span>
<p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<br />
<p>Firefox is now istalled.&nbsp; But this was only after finally getting fed up with this problem.&nbsp; That has been installed, maybe 2 weeks now.&nbsp; I dont have any plugins.&nbsp; I remove chrome if something else installs it.&nbsp; Ive got rid of the google toolbar several
 times.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Thanks Rober</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I remember why I did not do it a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Right now, I&nbsp;will delay&nbsp;a refresh/restore/etc.&nbsp; I don't really want to have to re-install all the apps that have been installed unless it becomes necessary to do so.&nbsp; If Firefox were not working, I would
 do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I can install previous version of IE and just use that?&nbsp;&nbsp; But hey, I guess ill live with Firefox.&nbsp; I installed that and its not having the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing ... I have a new web host.&nbsp; To get to their control panel, you go to</p>

<li>Make sure the web address <span>

<p>My brother has IE11 on windows 7.&nbsp; He has no problem and I can get the&nbsp;page with Firefox.&nbsp; Personally, I prefer IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, maybe a way to refresh just IE would be a good idea.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I opened 3 tabs, then searched for acer r7 in google, bing, and yahoo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google...&nbsp; cant go back from the acer.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; works fine</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; works fine, but for some reason opens everything in a new tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I opened a new tab, the home page is google, then pasted in&nbsp; <a href="http://www.acer.com/aspirer7/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.acer.com/aspirer7/en_US/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate there, then back.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; So, it occurs when clicking on a link from a google search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bad Google, not playing nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its still strange that it seems to only be affecting me. Oh well, guess that is a good thing.</p>

            <p>No, I hate that thing and get rid of it as soon as something puts it in.&nbsp; I just checked uninstall to be sure it was gone and not just disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no.&nbsp; I did have it as the 2nd option.&nbsp; But tonight, I disabled it, so its just Bing now, and that 3d option search the web. As of tonight, I am using Bing for the home page as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I had accidently changed the tab option, so that seems to be why Yahoo was causing new tabs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to mention this, because its looking more and more like if I want to use IE, I am going to have to do the refresh as you suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am getting a lot of&nbsp;cant display pages now.&nbsp; If I do a fix connection,&nbsp; it spins, and appears to do nothing, but
 finishes.&nbsp; That is to say it finishes and I get options to end troubleshooter,etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time, after I close this, the page displays.&nbsp; It doesn't happen all the time, and&nbsp;it mostly started tonight.&nbsp; Previously, I was getting just it on that one page
 with the cm.sccrow.com (which just wont work at all, ever after doing fix connection).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am resisting the refresh.&nbsp; I don't install a huge amount of programs, still it takes a significant amount of time to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vs&nbsp; C#, Vb, window phone, web developer.&nbsp; Throw in some older versions for existing sites, it soon adds up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Setting up e-mail
 accounts, blah, blah.&nbsp; Plus, what happens if it happens again.&nbsp; You cant just keep re-installing or refreshing. Especially, when firefox works ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know its not going to happen, but a way of doing just refreshing the affected program (IE) would be nice for a future ms&nbsp;project.&nbsp;I think the other programs like mail and calendar are less likely to have problems unless its using Google calendars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm feeling like&nbsp; Google is picking on me&nbsp; :-(&nbsp; because I wont use their toolbar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there any other admin in your organization, you may contact other admin and let him reset password for you:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you reset your password via click “Forgot my password” link in sign-in page and if you have added an contactable alternate email to your personal info before issue occurs,
 use the alternate email address to receive the reset password email to verify the process, and please check whether you received any verification email in your alternate email. About "Office 365 number", may I confirm whether it referes to the login ID, or
 phone number in your account Personal info page-&gt;Contact details?</p>

<p>hello Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not being specific on the office 265 number, however the Office 365 Number is the actually the previous tech lead's phone number. Is there any other way to change it? and I have already received the auth code to pass through the first verification
 process, It is just the phone number that is keeping me away from resetting the admin password.</p>

<h2>            Is MS Offfice File Validation Add-In Still REquired&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 from 7 (upgrade not clean install) and have uninstalled Office 2007 so that I can install Office 2016 Pro Plus.&nbsp; I notice that I still have the MS Office File Validation Add-In that was installed as part of an automatic update
 back in 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On reading about it it sounded quite important/useful; but if it is now a standard function of Office 2016 then I don't see why I need it kicking around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So since I'm cleaning up - Is this still an important add-in and do I still require this?&nbsp;Or is it now part of Office 2016 and so redundant and can be safely uninstalled?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Many thanks for any advice</p>

            <p>Sorry, I don't agree. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That article just says it is needed for 2003 and 2007.&nbsp; The article has a link to a more detailed KB article that says it is also needed for 2010.&nbsp; There is no explicit mention of 2013 or 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I don't know. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that it would be added into the program installation at some point. Frankly I thought that point was 2010, but apparently it wasn't.

            <p>Thank you Harsha but I tend to agree with Rohn007.&nbsp; The link to the article you provided states the security patch is required for Office up to 2010 at time of posting.&nbsp; It does not state that this has been fixed for any versions after this (although I would
 hope it has!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'll leave it on while I install 2016 and see if the installer removes it.&nbsp; I just don't want it posing any&nbsp;future conflicts&nbsp;down the line if the patch has already been implemented in the 2016 version.&nbsp; Plus, if it hasn't, you have to wonder why..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update if I find out anything useful.</p>
<p>

            <p>Installed Office 2016 Pro Plus and the above mentioned old security patch add-in is still there.</p>
<p>So I guess the question still remains open to anyone who can advise?</p>

<h2>            VBA - FormatConditions inconsistent behavior</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have some code that loops thru cells and adds two conditional formatting conditions per cell.&nbsp; Basically, if the value of the cell is within the range, I want the font to be green.&nbsp; If the value is outside the range, the number should be red.&nbsp; The
 following code works just fine sometimes, but other times the formatting condition rules get messed up.</p>
<p>When I step thru the code, I can see what is happening but do not understand why.&nbsp; For the cells where the format conditioning gets messed up, the first rule is created just fine with green for the format color.&nbsp; Then, the second rule gets created OK but
 on the line of code where I try to set the format color to red, it applies it to the first rule instead of the second rule!&nbsp; Again, this only happens sometimes and not all the time in my loop.</p>
<p>FYI - this code worked just fine in Excel 2003 and I am now trying to get it to work in 2010.</p>
<p>On a worksheet, I entered some numbers between 0 and 200 in cells A1 - A25</p>
<p><br />
Sub Macro1()</p>
<p>Dim workRange As Range<br />
Dim iRow as Integer</p>
<p>Set workRange = Range("A1")</p>
<p>For iRow = 0 To 24<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With workRange.Offset(iRow, 0)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FormatConditions.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FormatConditions.Add xlCellValue, xlBetween, 20, 100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FormatConditions(1).Font.ColorIndex = 10</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FormatConditions.Add xlCellValue, xlNotBetween, 20, 100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FormatConditions(2).Font.ColorIndex = 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
Next</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p><br />
I am wondering if anyone can help me with this</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Change my old mobile number for login in to my 365 accounts</h2>
                    <p>Could you guys help me out in changing the phone number associated with my account.</p>
<p>It currently is +3***7. I'd like to change it to +3***1</p>
<p>I've asked the local IT teams to update the phone number and they seem to have done so, but it still sends a 2-step verification text to my old number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

 After the IT finished, you will</span></span><span>&nbsp;be prompted to set up multi-factor authentication again the next time you sign in to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office
