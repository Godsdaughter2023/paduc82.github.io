                    <p>I just noticed that my floppy drive was not installed in Windows 10, all I have is the device hardware ID ACPI\VEN_PNP&amp;DEV_0700 and could not find any once else posting about this abnormality. I know there are some that think a floppy drive is not worth

            <p>I had two problems installing W10 on a non-primary Dell PC (older):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A 3rd party usb card would not allow Power On Self Test (POST) to complete. &nbsp;It would hang the PC and not finish POST. &nbsp; This card had worked fine with Windows 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remedy: I removed the 3rd party USB card and the W10 installation completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. On booting the PC would light up the floppy drive and just sit there forever. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remedy: I unplugged both the power and data connectors on the floppy and booted without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: &nbsp;Floppy drives like parallel ports are not part of the modern PC technology base configuration and have been dropped. &nbsp;If you need either when buying new you must request as add-ons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presumably one could buy a floppy with its own driver and install as new hardware. &nbsp;Better yet, get a USB attached external floppy drive and use it that way IF you still need a floppy drive. &nbsp;Otherwise, remove power and data connector leaving drive in case
 to fill the hole.</p>

            Could it still be in the BOOT sequence list in BIOS on these PCs? &nbsp;I moved the floppy to the very last with primary hard drive first, CD/DVD second, USB third and then floppy. &nbsp;I did not see a way to remove it from BIOS but just a thought you may want
 to check.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>The only problem I have is the Floppy drive controller not being recognized, my parallel port on the other hand is recognized and is being used to communicate with my HP LaserJet 6p, so Windows 10 dose recognize parallel ports.</p>

                    <p>No matter what setting I try to mess with (turning it off/on, allowing exceptions, changing scan dates etc) it won't let me do so and gives me that error? It's actually worrying me, because just a few days ago I had to perform a factory reset on my computer
 because the system's security settings and directory was corrupted, and I've been unsure if the factory reset was enough or if I should have gone with a clean reinstall. I've even performed a few system scans and even one chkdsk after the reset and it didn't
 come up with anything? So I'm hoping this just means that it's something else that's messing with it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record: Windows Defender is presumably on (I'm trying to turn it off since I don't need it..) At least it says it is. But I'm running Bitdefender as my AV and Malewarebytes AntiMaleware as my backup program, so could it have anything to do with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium x64, running an HP Touchsmart320 All-in-One PC. I have 4 GB of RAM, with my processor being AMD A-4-3400 APU with Radeon HD Graphics., 2.70 GHz.</p>

<h2>            Restore a Windows OS 10 Word 7 file of overwritten and saved file</h2>
                    This may be an impossible task, but in an effort to open up space on my hard drive I was taking files from similar folders located under folders of a different name and combining them under just one main folder. For almost every file, overwriting was not
 a problem as they were just the same exact files. However, I had one Word file that I continuously wrote to that was not being updated in the other locations. Why, I do not know. Anyway, I do have a back up from last October, but have written almost daily
 to this file. That's about 9 months of data. When adding new information to the file a few days ago, I did not realize I was writing to an older version and saved. This was like 5 or 6 days ago. I've not written to Word at all, have not turned off the computer,
 and had a Windows update a little over a week ago that I thought I could use as a restore point, but it doesn't show up. Does anyone have any ideas? I've searched through the Microsoft community and emailed some proprietary rest

<p>The advice you've gotten is correct -- the only way to recover an overwritten file is to have another copy of it somewhere else as a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than a manually created backup such as the one you have from October, there are two possible ways you could have a backup file that you weren't aware of. Both of them depend on having the mechanism set up before the overwriting occurred. If neither
 of them was turned on when you last saved the file, then there is no going back.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Word 2007, go to Word Options &gt; Advanced, scroll down to the Save section, and look at the setting for "Always create backup copy". If that box is checked, then there should be a file in the same folder with the document, named "Backup of &lt;document name&gt;.wbk".
 That will be the file as it existed just prior to the last Save. If there is such a file, you can rename it to something like "Recovery of &lt;document name&gt;.docx" and open it in Word.</li><li>In Windows 10, the File History feature can back up selected folders at regular intervals, which would give you multiple versions of the document to recover. The feature isn't turned on by default, and it does require an external drive (possibly a USB drive
 or network share) or a second drive inside the computer. See&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files</a>&nbsp;for

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank you for taking the time to attempt to assist me. I had the "Always create backup copy" box checked, but for whatever reason, a .wbk document for this file was not created. I resign myself to the fact that aberrations occur. As you no doubt
 understand, computers don't last forever, so two NAS external hard drives are my minimum and I usually keep a couple of thumb drives for often used files, but I had not kept up for this file, so shame on me. Throughout the years I've only lost one backup hard
 drive, a Maxtor. Fortunately I had the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I took my first class in FORTRAN, we didn't have PCs, just a 20 foot long, 12 foot high unit that required punched cards. My slide rule and hand held calculator were more powerful. Following grad school, even the WANG computer we had at my first post-university
 engineering company didn't have the power of my programmable HP 41C. My next firm finally had PCs with the 286 chip set. We had an IT for engineers who weren't well versed with the units, but this was almost a playground for me. I'm just including this discourse
 as when we upgraded to the 386 chips, our IT exclaimed that it even had "a 500 MB hard drive, more memory than you'll ever need". I laughed internally as I could see the expansion of PCs being exponential. If you're as old as I am, and even if you're not,
 you'll appreciate that little anecdote I thought I'd share for your amusement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, your prompt reply is most appreciated and confirms my suspicions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            Thanks for the trip down memory lane, Paul. It sounds like we're "of an age". I was introduced to assembly language on a Univac I in 1961 (it was literally a museum piece already), and FORTRAN in 1966. I still have several slide rules, but the calculators
 have all gone to the Great Bit Bucket. I retired as a software engineer five years ago.

<h3> loumac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring to front on single click in charts</h2>
                    
<p>In Excel 2003 if you had several charts you could cascade them on top of each other and as you clicked the top of the one you wanted to look at it would come to the front.</p>
<p>In Excel 2010 if you do the same you can see the outline of the chart but not the detail - it stays behind the others.</p>
<p>Without having to right click and say bring to front, is there a method/fix so that you can click through the graphs and each on comes to the front.&nbsp; Due to the number of graphs it is preferable not to have them all seperate but rather stacked in groups.</p>

<h2>            Moving Outlook 2007 to a new PC</h2>
                    
<p>I'm moving Outlook version of Office 2007 from a Vista machine to a new Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>1 PC, in place replacement. Can't use Easy Transfer, etc.</p>
<p>I've backed up the .pst files using procedure for moving .pst from one PC to another outlined in:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287070</a></p>
<p>There is only one account.</p>
<p>I'm not a Office person, just a lowly tech.</p>
<p>1. Should I create the user Account on the new PC&nbsp;before moving the .pst or is that accomplished in the transfer?</p>
<p>2. In the above KB, it also suggests using the Backup Utility. I did and created another .pst file on the external drive I'm using. Which one is the proper one to import?</p>
<p>I have the original PC in my shop and will be doing the final transfering of data on Monday. I'll be able to access the old hard drive and data using a USB adapter, if necessary.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>Hassan is correct. To elaborate a bit further: You must create your Windows User Account first. Moreover, you should also create your Outlook Profile and set up your mail accounts. Only then will you be able to transfer your Outlook data correctly, and importing
 should never be used for this process.&nbsp;Note that your new Outlook profile will have a new empty Outlook data file that you will not be using. Instead you will open your previous Outlook data file in your new profile and set it as your new default. Take a look
 at these pages for info on Outlook data backup or transfer:<br />
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/config/move_outlook.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/config/move_outlook.asp</a><br />

<p>Note that some of the information on the Microsoft page is outdated and contains errors, particularly when applied to Outlook 2003, 2007 or 2010. Specifically:<br />
1. Ignore any advice to copy your PST file to Outlook's default location to connect it to your profile. Doing so will often corrupt your Outlook profile. Copy it anywhere BUT the default location and then open it within your Outlook profile.<br />
2. Ignore any advice that tells you to use export or import to transfer an entire Outlook data file. That has never been sound advice, but the process has become too deeply flawed to be trusted.</p>

<h2>            Footnote duplicating in merge fields</h2>
                    <p>I have an IF merge field, where if a condition is True, it should include the appropriate paragraph in the document. &nbsp;This paragraph has a footnote. &nbsp;In the paragraph text within the IF merge field, the footnote shows #1 and a single footnote appears at
 the bottom of the page. &nbsp;When the document is merged, the footnote reference changes to #2 and the footnote displays twice at the bottom of the page. &nbsp;See below. &nbsp;I'm using Windows 7 Professional and Word 2013.</p>

            The footnote duplication is a consequence of having the footnote reference&nbsp;inside a field - which is what you're trying to use to conditionally show/hide it. The behaviour isn't limited to Office 2013, either, so using a different Word version is unlikely
 to resolve the issue. Without VBA programming - to either conditionally add the footnotes at runtime or delete the extraneous ones post-merge - you would need an approach that doesn't use conditional footnotes. Doug's addin
<em>may </em>be able to achieve what you're after.

                    When i use the "eye scan" to unlock my phone and it doesn't find me it then asks for my pin number great! however when i swipe up to enter it, it just lets me straight into the phone. Also i can do this while it is looking for me? so in effect my phone
 is not locked. Anyone else come across this ?<br />

<p>I'm experiencing this issue to. The emails I'm getting are all some random address "On Behalf Of" then a trusted address.</p>
<p>On behalf of is typically added when the source address is not authenticated with the email address it is trying to send as. Unfortunately the spam filter is recognising the email as genuine and allowing it through even on Exclusive. If you can spot a common
 trusted address that is being misused, remove it from your safe sender list and set your filter back to standard. The junk filter should then catch the emails.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone will fix this loophole...</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            This has been going on for months, people have been complaining, and Microsoft has done absolutely NOTHING about it. This is a widespread issue, not just happening to a few users. No "suggestion" has worked so far for anyone who has brought this problem
 up, including me. It has nothing to do with our personal filtering settings, etc.. &nbsp;It's clearly an issue on Microsoft's end, and so far they have shown no interest in fixing the problem and helping their users. &nbsp;I would LOVE for them to come out and address
 this issue directly. &nbsp;Until then, the frustration continues to mount...

<h2>            Permanent Delete</h2>
                    Ok, here's the deal. I was syncing my phone for the first time. As it was syncing, I noticed it uploaded a bunch of pictures that I have never seen before. I tried to delete them, but there were 206 of them. I clicked on the the delete all option, thinking
 it would delete the entire page. It deleted everything! Photos,Contacts,everything. I restored those things back and I permanently deleted the things I didn't want. Once again that deleted everything!!! Permanently! I stop syncing because I fear the service
 will erase everything from my phone. What am I to do now?&nbsp;I just got my invite twenty minutes ago and now I can't use the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When you select photos to be synced My Phone will sync every image found on the device.&nbsp;This is the normal behavior for the current version. However&nbsp;it is already addressed for future releases.<br />
<br />
When you delete all the photos on the Web portal you still can restore it, so you won't delete permanently unless you delete also from Deleted items&nbsp;page. If you want to delete some specifc images you need to select the images you want and then click on delete
 (without "all" tag).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
João Paiva

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought a Nokia C3-01 and WAS able to stream Youtube videos until today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know what happened and I didn't change the settings of my phone but now whenever I try to watch videos on Youtube using Opera Mini, the "Watch Video" link and the image of the video are missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, I am unable to stream videos on the internet via my phone's media player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please someone help me. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            accidentally disabled my outlook</h2>
                    Yesterday, I got a pop-up message stating that there was "suspicious activity" from Outlook.&nbsp; It asked me if I wanted to block it or accept it.... i blocked it, but apparently,&nbsp; disabled my entire Outlook, and now&nbsp;I can send or receive anything.&nbsp; I'm assuming
 it came from my virus software, which is TREND.&nbsp; How do I re-enable my outlook??

            I'm assuming you have referenced Outlook on your PC.&nbsp; The fastest way IMHO is to do a System Restore to an earlier date then when you get that message again, do not block it.

</p><p>Oh sorry for that, Lee, best to check the spam or junk folder of the contact email your using for the recovery form as the result might be on those folders (Happen to me too!) but if no luck, try using another contact email as its possible your current contact
 email might be blocking the result from Microsoft. Good luck mate! </p>

<p>Hi Vikas,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To automatically populate data from a lookup field (allowing multiple values to be selected from lookup table), you need to use PWA workflow.
</p>
<p>Reference: </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/project/add-a-custom-field-to-a-project-detail-page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a custom field to a project detail page</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/project/create-a-sample-project-web-app-workflow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a sample Project Web App workflow</a></p>
<p>However, the workflow can’t help you separate by “;”. It just can show data automatically based on the value in your “Principle” field using “set project field” action command.</p>
<p>If you still meet problem, you can post the thread to our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/projectserver/en-us/home?category=project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Project Online forum</a> for dedicated help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I get an email newsletter from a source about once a week. The body of the message is missing totally or invisible or something when using the Outlook.com browser window (any browser - Firefox, Chrome, IE). Yet I see the message perfectly well using my Android
 phone default email client to connect to my Hotmail account. I would like to be able to review these newsletters on my desktop where I don't have to scroll back and forth to view the content. Why are the headers all visible and then the assine "<span>Too many
 newsletters? You can <a href="https://col127.mail.live.com/mail/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
unsubscribe</a> or better yet, <a href="https://col127.mail.live.com/mail/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">schedule automatic cleanup</a>." message, but no message body visible?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If I forward the email newsletter to another account it is still not visible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My next step will be to totally abandon the Hotmail/Outlook.com account and go with yet another gmail account (which I don't really want to do).</span></p>

            Hi Marco - I'm getting the same problem. &nbsp;My business provides email marketing services and I alwsys test in Outlook.com before sending a newsletter.<br />
<br />
I'm also finding the body of the email is not visible and it's not a caching issue. For the client I'm sending for sometimes the email is visible then another time a different email is not.<br />
<br />
There seems to be no way to make the email visible - I've looked everywhere. &nbsp;Any ideas on how to fix this?

            It was never a cache issue as I tent to reload often and clear history often as I'm also building websites and always needing to refresh as I work. Also have ad-blocking extensions on some of my browsers, and have turned off this feature to see if the
 message body will be viewable, but not the issue either.<br />

<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; This may have been a big mistake as my HOTMAIL is now experiencing the same problem as above.&nbsp; I can read all my messages.&nbsp; But when I try to reply or forward, the message is not shown.&nbsp; It's NOT a cache problem.&nbsp; This
 problem did not exists until I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>

            Hi! Can you check if the system apps are all up to date by going to Store? You may also try rebooting the phone by pressing and holding the power &amp; the volume down keys simultaneously for 10-15 seconds. Let us know how it goes.

            A phone unit that is repaired (minor, or with some parts changed).<br />
It was so common in our country few years ago since Nokia launched its own sales centre, it is lessened.

            Refurbished usually means: taken to he service center/factory reset and restored to factory defaults, replaced any broken and worn parts.<br />
<br />
So it i basically a used item that has been looked over and has had any worn parts replaced as to make it new again. But since it isn't a brand new item, it should be sold as such.<br />
<br />
If the price &amp; warranty is right, they are often a good deal.

            A tiny bit cheaper.<br />
<br />
But i don't tend to go for Refurbished handsets as they don't come with the original accesories as it says in the operators clearance policy.<br />
<br />
It's not garanteed that it will not come with a scratch or accesories.

                    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason,&nbsp;I can't update Windows 10 from Pro Insider Preview built 10565 to 10586. I tried to update to 10576 but the update failed after 70%; I got a black screen that did nothing for 90 minutes. Days later, after 10586 was released, Windows Update
 did not recognize 10576 or 10586, even now. My PC is stuck on 10565. I don't want to do a clean install, btw. I also got to reset the Windows Update components but still nothing. Please help ASAP.</p>

            You do not have to clean install to use Couldofbeen's method. &nbsp;You can use the "Upgrade now" link on the website or make media. &nbsp;If you make media, don't insert the media until Windows is running.

<p>I've seen in the news recently that the only way to update W10 will be via Windows Update. TechBench says it is to update from Windows 8 and 8.1 to W10. Can the update from Win10 10565 to 10586 still be possible? Will I still be able to keep Pro, instead
 of downgrading to Home? Some users, according to some news site, had W10 changed to Home after upgrade. &nbsp;And, the update is no longer possible with the Media Creation Tool [<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/windows-10-november-update-mysteriously-pulled-as-concerns-about-bugs-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/windows-10-november-update-mysteriously-pulled-as-concerns-about-bugs-grow/</a>].</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have used the following script below to update from 10240 to build 10586.&nbsp; I invite you to copy it to notepad and save as resetWincomponent.cmd, then right click on the file and&nbsp; run it as administrator. Restart your computer and try to update.</p>
<p>GoodLuck</p>

            All that is different is that the current copy of Windows 10 has to be installed for 30 days before Windows Update will upgrade your computer to the November Update (build 10586). &nbsp;Nothing else is changed. &nbsp;This does not affect any other updates. &nbsp;The
 only reason the download sites no longer offer the November Update is to ensure that Windows Update has to be used to upgrade to build 10586 and thereby enforce the 30 days.

            Yeah. It is working. I executed the file from its download point, without saving to a USB. Right now, the MTC (Windows 10 Setup) shows "Install Windows 10 Pro" and "Keep &nbsp;personal files and apps" checked (the way I wanted it). Do I still have to be careful
 with my pictures and apps? Are there some personal files and folders that could still be deleted?

            <p>Sure. &nbsp;Things do go wrong. &nbsp;This is normally a very robust installer, but the installer cant't conrol everything. &nbsp;That's why you should always backup your personal data. &nbsp;Windows will make a windows.old folder and copy your previous Windows files and your
<p>
</p><p>If you want to back up your files now or even make a system backup using your backup program, press the Windows key to bring up the taskbar. &nbsp;Then all you have to do is plug in a flash drive and save your files and folders using your backup program to the
 flash drive. &nbsp;Then remove the flash drive and go back to Setup (its icon is on the taskbar). &nbsp;If this is not your primary computer there probably wont't be much to save.</p>

<h2>            Merging an Excel doc with hyperlinks into Word doc</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a simple Excel document and one of the columns includes a hyperlink. I am attempting to mail merge this into Word document. However, when I do, I lose the hyperlink. The text is still present but the linkage is gone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>If you use the Merge to Individual Documents, or Merge to Email with Attachments (it's not actually necessary to have any attachments) utilities on my Merge Tools add-in, the hyperlinks should remain intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can download the MergeTools – 20140218.dotm Add-in that I created from the following page of my One Drive:<br />
<br />

<p><span><br />
The file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.<span>&nbsp; </span>In Windows XP the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 it is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - </span><span>In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select
 the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of
 "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".</span><span><br />
<br />
When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/745db96c-e905-409b-846c-3666c01eefab" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One thing to note is that the field names in the data source must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9).</span><span><br />
<br />
You may also want to download:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That document explains how you must set up the Excel Data Source and the Mail Merge Main document to be able to execute a merge with a Chart that is unique to each record in the data source.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>the Using the Many to One Facility document that describes how to use that facility.</span></li></ol>
