            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the issue description, you are facing issues with USB devices and ports are not working. However, to help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would
 appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What are the troubleshooting steps did you try in order to resolve USB issues?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Let us start with running the hardware troubleshooter and check. Follow the article mentioned below for more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</b></a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button, then <b>Device Manager</b> in the search box.‌</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Look for the device under
<b>USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller</b>, <b>right click</b> on it and select
<b>Uninstall</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>

Hi Imran,</p>
<p>Please review my statements above.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have indicated, the USB devices do not work.&nbsp; This means I have no keyboard or mouse to "select", "click", or even type anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The machine boots up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing can be entered or selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is how to access the machine when the mouse and keyboard aren't recognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The machine has no other access ports except USB.&nbsp; No serial, no PS2.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We tried other "USB" keyboards and mice.&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not work.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The original keyboard and mouse works on other machines.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The machine (yes, it was cheap) only has USB connections.&nbsp;&nbsp; NO PS2 ports are available.&nbsp; So can not use a USB to PS2 converter.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The machine boots.&nbsp; It can be powered off by the power switch.&nbsp; But no&nbsp;USB devices work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enter, select, or point at anything&nbsp;requires the USB ports to be working.&nbsp; They are not working no matter how many times we boot the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not aware of any "other" type mouse or keyboard on the market.&nbsp; Only USB or PS2 connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regretfully, there isn't a "recovery" disk available to this machine.&nbsp; Otherwise, I'd try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions (what hardware is needed) to try and follow your recommendation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Tech-2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you get a solution to this. I have an Inspiron 1545 with only USB ports running Windows 7 and like you I have lost all access to these ports. Fortunately it is a Laptop and so I can still use it. However I prefer to use mouse and wireless Keyboard and
 also USB memory sticks, earphones etc. None of which work any longer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the ports and rebooted and though it installs all the ports on start up and also the software for the keyboard and hubs it does not even register them when they are plugged in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also used the diagnostic tool but it gives no solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone help please. Roger</p>

This site was useless.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one answered with any common sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; My client ended up purchasing another machine and I had to pull the hard drive to get the data off of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were not happy.

            <p>Unfortunately I can't give you an absolute fix, but I think I can shed some light on this problem.</p>
<p>I experienced the exact same issue with a four year old HP Compaq dx2400 running Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I noticed that during the BIOS boot the keyboard responded appropriately - I could even hit F10 and enter setup.&nbsp; When I did I checked that the USB ports were
 still set to active, so it wasn't a hardware or BIOS problem.&nbsp; It is absolutely a Windows issue because as soon as Windows took over the keyboard and mouse went dead.&nbsp; Luckily for us this PC has PS/2 ports and I happen to keep some old keyboards and a USB-to-PS/2
 adapter around.&nbsp; When I hooked up the PS/2 devices the PC booted normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, two significant things:&nbsp; 1) the PC is joined to a network with Windows Server 2008.&nbsp; When the PC booted I&nbsp;logged in with&nbsp;an&nbsp;administrator account, and not the same user account that had been on before.&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;As soon as the PC&nbsp;booted there was a message
 window stating that the PC had to be rebooted in order for&nbsp;recently installed updates to complete installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there were some lingering updates that were halfway installed at the time that the PC last was shutdown (and&nbsp;I don't know if this was&nbsp;manually
 by the user or "automagically").&nbsp; I also don't know if part of the issue was that the user account&nbsp;didn't have the authority to allow these updates to&nbsp;be applied.&nbsp; In any case, I rebooted to allow the updates to complete, then shut the PC down hard, disconnected
 the PS/2 devices,&nbsp;reconnected the&nbsp;USB devices,&nbsp;started the computer, and everything worked normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, again, this is absolutely a Windows problem (and I find the response from Mohammad_Imran pretty lame - it's like telling a mechanic that your car won't start and&nbsp;he says to drive it over so he can take a look at it).&nbsp; It also&nbsp;seems to have something
 to do with partially installed updates.&nbsp; In this case the updates were in the categories of "Security Update&nbsp;for Win 7" (KB2862330, KB2864085, KB2862335, KB2884256, KB2876284, KB2847311, KB2883150, KB2868038, &amp; KB2864202), "Update for Windows" (KB2888049,
 KB2882822, KB2852386, &amp; KB2846960), "Security Update for Microsoft.NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 SP1 x86" (KB2861191, KB2863240, &amp; KB2861698), and "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7 Service Pack 1" (KB2879017).&nbsp; Four of these
 updates had actually failed on install the day before (KB2864085, KB2862330, KB2862335, &amp; KB2888049) all with error code 80070490.&nbsp; Now the specific updates that others may have will probably differ from these, but I would bet that there is an underlying problem
 that Microsoft needs to look at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you are lucky enough to have&nbsp;PS/2 ports on your computer there is a workaround.&nbsp; If you don't the good news is that your machine isn't toast, you just need to repair, restore or reinstall Windows.&nbsp; Just test first to see that your keyboard works with
 BIOS setup before it goes dead, then you'll know for sure.</p>

<h2>            Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Mutliplayer Info &#91;RUMORED&#93; </h2>
                    Hello everyone, if you're reading this you're probably as excited for Halo CEA as I am. Well I was doing some research last night on Bing to see if there was any multiplayer info for CEA. I found an article about some interview with Frank O' Connor that
 I don't know if it was true or fake.

<p>That doesn't make much sense. Why would you download a content pack for Reach, but only be able to play the maps using the CE disk? I think we'll be able to download the 7 maps to Reach and play them using the Reach disk. I don't think we'll be able to access
 the full Reach multiplayer from the CE disk. That's just what makes sense to me.</p>

    <title>Where can I find additional &#40;official&#41; Windows XP themes that - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where can I find additional &#40;official&#41; Windows XP themes that were left out of Windows XP&#63;</h2>
                    It has come to my attention that there were several official themes that were created for Windows XP but were never included in Windows XP.<br />
<br />
What most of us are aware of are the <i>Windows Classic Style</i> theme and <i>Windows XP Style</i> theme.&nbsp; The title bar, borders and taskbar in the Windows XP Style color scheme are blue, olive green or silver, and cannot be changed to another color at all.&nbsp;
 Only in classic (advanced) mode do we see any other color applied to the title bar, border and taskbar.<br />
<br />
However, there are other themes out there that can change the Windows XP Style color scheme to black, red and even yellow or pink, among others.&nbsp; Word has it that Microsoft produced themes such as
<i>Royale</i> (which include Royale or Energy Blue), <i>Royale Noir</i> (where even the
<i>Start</i> button is black), <i>Zune</i> and one called <i>Windows Embedded</i> (where everything including the Start button is blue).<br />
<br />
I am quite aware of the exotic themes that are presented by software like <i>WindowBlinds</i>, but I am not interested (yet) in radically changing my WinXP desktop to that much of a degree.&nbsp; I'm only interested in adding more colors to the official WinXP color
 scheme, beyond blue, olive green and silver.&nbsp; Where can I find them, especially the official WinXP color schemes that were never included in WinXP Professional, and how would I install them?<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that you need to add more colors to the official Windows XP color scheme.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For Windows XP you can download the themes from the link below.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/themes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/themes</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To personalize Windows XP themes I would suggest you to use your favorite search engine to get required themes.

<p>Well it would be better if you could suggest some other method as reset is the last thing that i would like to opt for, it causes lot of data loss and fuss. Nor any of these seems to be a specific and a promising solution to my problem. And also see if you
 can help with the other question with playing music.</p>
<p>Lastly, recently i found that cortana refuses to provide me some sevices and asks me to try later, for eg: if i ask to play some sleeping sounds she asks for my permission to link with microsoft and after given permit it says "Uh oh it seems that this skill
 is not available now, please try later,etc..."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cris ryannypil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is in fact my first post. I recently upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1 on my Asus Transformer T100TA. On my past os version, i had several devices that are paired to&nbsp;my Asus T100TA&nbsp;and i was happy to notice that after i upgraded it was still there.
 But when i tried to transfer a file from my smartphone to my Asus T100TA, it didn't work. It said that i have to remove my device and then connect it&nbsp;again but at the&nbsp; same time this message flashed on the screen, a driver installation was immediately in progress
 and im not sure but i think it was someting like an OBEX push service. This driver installion was like stuck and it didnt succeed so i just thought it didnt matter so i closed it. Now when i tried to remove my smartphone from my Asus T100TA, it failed and
 now i can no longer transfer files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: The bluetooth still turns on/off properly on my Asus T100TA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need some help. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ryann</p>

            <div>Hi Cris, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. &nbsp;<br />
I completely understand your concern and feel sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For a better understanding of your issue, please answer these queries below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you receive any error code or error message, while connecting the Bluetooth?<br />
2. &nbsp;Are you facing this issue on Microsoft account or Local account?<br />
3.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates or driver updates on your system?<br />
4. Have you made any changes to the system, prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the&nbsp;system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue is with the Bluetooth, then try to refer to the suggestions provided by Abdul_Malik, replied on November 17, 2015, to fix your issue.<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/bluetooth-not-working-on-windows-10/448b5fc2-52ab-48ef-a325-f078672f1099"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/bluetooth-not-working-on-windows-10/448b5fc2-52ab-48ef-a325-f078672f1099</span></a></div>

 again.</div>
<div><br />
•Make sure that the Bluetooth-enabled audio device is on and discoverable. How you do this varies with devices, so check the info that came with your device or go to the manufacturer’s website.</div>

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10 Flips Video Around</h2>
                    <p>This is a super annoying problem.&nbsp; Skype for Windows 10 flips my video around and the person I'm talking to sees everything in reverse.&nbsp; They see a mirror view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even more annoying, there are no camera settings in Skype that you can change to fix this.&nbsp; So, does anyone know how to fix it? &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you confirm if this is happening to the Skype application only? Open your <strong>
Camera app </strong>to check whether it is happening to your native camera settings. If it is, it might be with the settings of your camera. Please also check the software installed for your webcam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change your camera settings on Windows 10:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Open the Camera app and select&nbsp;</span><strong>See more </strong><strong>(...),</strong> then select
<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li><span>Adjust each setting.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please make that you have the latest updates for your drivers. <span>Check <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17444/windows-camera-app-webcams-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> from the Microsoft support site for additional details.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, please let us know when the issue started and the Skype version you are using and the brand/model of the webcam you are using so we can further check.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it's happening only with Skype.&nbsp; The camera app shows video the right way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running the newest version of Skype.&nbsp; I just downloaded it four days ago.&nbsp; I can't find where to see the version number.&nbsp; There is no menu on this version and I don't see a way to find the version number. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's so annoying that they've removed so many options and functions.&nbsp; There used to be a menu system where you could go into settings and tweak the camera specifically for Skype.&nbsp; But now, it seems all you can do is turn the camera off or on.&nbsp; I don't understand
 why they've removed all the options and our ability to make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Microsoft LifeCam.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>To check the version of Skype for Windows 10:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Skype.</li><li>Click your <strong>profile picture</strong>. </li><li>Choose <strong>About this version</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Windows 10 makes it easier to find the settings of the application, although the offered settings are limited compared to the classic Skype for Windows desktop. You can check the settings similar on how you check the Skype version of the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you specify what LifeCam model you are using? Please visit <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> and choose the webcam you are using. Download and install the latest
 drivers for your device.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; slow startup, slow operation</h2>
                    <p>Since i have upgraded windows 10 to my Toshiba Ultrabook with 6GB RAM and CORE i5 processor my computer has started to work very slow. The initial start takes about 7 min of average time. I have AVG antivirus installed which i thought would help to optimize
 the computer. Sometimes i get so frustrated that i want to smash the compute. But have a small window &nbsp;to realize it is not the computer but the Windows 10 which is making me crazy...</p>

<h2>            Unable to remove a printer gone in &#34;Unspecified&#34; group</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a Canon-Pixma printer that is listed in the "Unspecified" group. I need to remove it to reinstall it correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right clicked on the device selecting the "Remove device" command but Windows 10 put it in "Removing device" state forever without actually removing it (see picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I force the removal of the device (ore remove it manually)?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8724dcee-d9a8-48d2-99af-e2fff103897f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8724dcee-d9a8-48d2-99af-e2fff103897f" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Maybe I wasn't clear enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device, even if it is a printer, is not listed as a printer both in "Devices and Printers" and in registry. The system sees it as an Unspecified device. The links you sent me do not apply because they are referring to devices correctly recognised by
 the system as printers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - WiFi fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi-<br />
<br />
When I first tried upgrading to windows 10 earlier this year, I encountered issues with WiFi and after searching I found others had had the same issue and as such there were some suggestions for fixes, at the time I tried all of this and none of them worked
 so I ended up reverting back to 8.1, now I'm back checking a few months later, has this issue been fixed and will it be sorted automatically? or will I still have to try mess around with the registry etc.? or at least is there an easier fix now?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I am also having serious&nbsp;issues and it's getting beyond a joke. It's comical/farcical, in fact. I even tried contacting Live Chat support. They were no help and said sorry --&nbsp;Win 10 and no WIFI is&nbsp;a common problem and to contact my vendor. I live in Indonesia,
 and my brother-in-law had&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;issue and called Microsoft's regional branch and managed to solve it. However, I don't speak the language and have tried his "fix" as I see it (his driver version and all his settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my issue: I used to get fine WIFI with the Windows 8.1 OEM version this computer came with (an HP 14 series laptop). All my Apple products also work fine throughout the apartment with WIFI.&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;looking forward to Windows 10 as an ex-Windows (3.1
 through to XP) user turned Mac user. Indeed, all was good for the first month or so. Then the WIFI started showing&nbsp;the seemingly common&nbsp;"limited connection" problem, and I found I could only get WIFI if I was right next to the router. Then it stopped altogether.
<p>
</p><p>I tried various fixes before the 1511 update. These included:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Doing the obvious power-plan management fix and the WIFI sleeping issue fix and uninstalled all anti-virus software and stopped the Windows Firewall. (And restarted after all of these steps.)</p>
<p>2. Doing all the command-line stuff with netsh.exe, flushing DNS (I don't even know what that means), renew IP, disable autotuning etc.</p>
<p>3. As the signal&nbsp;said it was&nbsp;"limited" I bought a signal booster, which has not solved the issue.</p>
<p>4. Uninstalled the WIFI adapter and checked for hardware changes to reinstall it. Done this many times.</p>
<p>5. Played around with the WIFI adapter advanced options,&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;"801 ad hoc support."</p>
<p>6. Enabled and disabled the adapter repeatedly in Device Manager&nbsp;(this worked for a short period of time).</p>
<span>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log commands then restarted.</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Currently I am on driver version 5.0.57.0 dated 5/18/2015 from Media Tek as this is the one I've had most (but very limited) success with, and which works on my brother-in-law's HP laptop.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Anyhoo,&nbsp;along came 1511 and since that time I have no working WIFI. Well, I've had hope a few times when it&nbsp;shows five bars.&nbsp;But then it drops out again and won't come back after 1-5 mins and is then gone for days or until I fiddle
 with the settings and even then I only have it for another 5 mins and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
cannot access any websites.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Given the fact that I spend more time trying to fix this issue than I&nbsp;have actually&nbsp;using the computer for work, I can't remember the fixes I've tried that have worked for these short periods of time. Oh, and I resorted to downloading
 a third-party Win 10 internet fixer, which did no good. And the Windows&nbsp;troubleshooters and the HP's built-in troubleshooter don't fix it either.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If I connect to the router via Ethernet, it's all good. I've also tried resetting the router and signal booster. No effect.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Sometimes Edge won't connect to a website or even search from the input/address field. IE works but I prefer Edge and hate IE like many. I don't know if this&nbsp;is related. I may try Chrome as Edge has this problem, though I don't
 want to: I want Win 10 to work as it should.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've reset the computer fully twice causing me great time lost in redownloading Office 365 and I've created and used multiple restore points. Sometimes a restore point that was created with a working WIFI comes back with none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've lost so much time on this that my wife is very&nbsp;upset about how long&nbsp;I spend on&nbsp;it each and every day and says we should get another Mac and throw this&nbsp;PC away basically and be done with Windows. But&nbsp;I don't want to waste money and neither do I think
 I should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice? Solution?</p>

            <p>I have experienced the same issue on many of HP and Dell laptops. Nothing helped me. I wasted many days of reinstalling drivers, systems and other stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy it's in the past now!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Here is the solution:</strong></span><br />
Simply&nbsp;<strong>turn off your bluetooth </strong>and most importantly - <strong>unplug your wireless peripherals such as a mouse.</strong></p>
<p>You should disable bluetooth drivers from Windows Device Manager completely. Who uses bluetooth on laptops anyway, this technology is an unwrap. Come on, 10 meters of range and waiting eternity for pairing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is the reason:</strong></p>
<p>In one sentence: it's caused by 2.4 GHz frequency interference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of WiFi routers work on 2.4 GHz frequency, which is pretty common for all types of consumer wireless connections.</p>
<p>This frequency is also shared with bluetooth and other wireless connections, such as a wireless mouse or keyboard (you can check the frequency your device uses on the box/in the manual).</p>
<p>The reason is pretty simple: everyone can use this frequency free of charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, most Windows laptops are equipped with pretty cheap Wifi/Bluetooth bundle network cards (most likely
<strong>Realtek</strong>). It means HP, DELL and some other manufacturers are using one network card for both Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth and wireless devices (like a mouse) signal is stronger than a WiFi signal, also they use more channels than WiFi to transfer less data (especially Bluetooth -
<strong>that's why you can't stream music via WiFi from YouTube and stream audio to a Bluetooth speakers/headphones</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the interference is low (sometimes all you need to do is change the USB port for a wireless device, so it's not too close to your network card/antenna), the network speed slows down.</p>
<p>When the interference is high, there's no internet connection, but you can still see the signal is 5/5 and you're connected.</p>
<p>After that, Windows shows the "connection limited" error, which is a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why don't Mac users have this problem?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 theories (they can all be true):</p>
<p>1. Well, they are masochists and prefer to use a built-in touchpad. But it's ok to them to do the same things 10 times longer on the Mac interface from previous century :-) They just love the old cascading menus and messed up navigation.</p>
<p>2. They do have this problem as well, but they didn't notice it, because they just pretend to work on Mac. Everyone knows there's no professional software for Mac, so you can't do anything, even play Solitaire.<br />
3. The other explanation can be that Apple actually cares about the network cards and don't use cheap Realtek bundles (because there are no drivers for Mac OS hahahaha).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to have a proper WiFi connection and still use a wireless mouse?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution #1 (The best)</strong></p>
<p>The best thing you can do is to replace your router for a new one, that supports 5 GHz frequency.
</p>
<p>This is only possible when your laptop network card has 5 GHz support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case your internet runs separately from useless Bluetooth and your beloved wireless mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to replace your laptop's network card if possible, to support 5 GHz frequency.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution #2</strong></p>
<p>Try to plug your mouse USB-stick to another USB port, maybe on the other side of your computer.</p>
<p>This may decrease the interference, but it's not the best solution anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution #3</strong></p>
<p>Try another mouse/keyboard, maybe there are less power-consuming versions, that occupy less wireless channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution #4</strong></p>
<p>Disable your WiFi drivers completely (in Windows Device Manager). Buy a USB-WiFi adapter. You'll have a separate network card in a USB stick, it should solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution #5</strong></p>
<p>Get a cable. Yes, I know it's 21 century, but if MacOS can still have an interface from the 90's, it's no shame to connect your computer by a cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To Microsoft:</span></strong></p>
<p>It's obvious it's not Windows fault and software solutions won't help. However, it is a joke that so so many users have this problem. It's also a joke your forum "experts" can't help and don't even want to help to diagnose the problem. They fob off the users
 looking for support. What do you think they will do? They will buy a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things like this can cost you loosing your leader position on the desktop and enterprise market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there are two things you can do about this issue. Please consider each one seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. The easiest solution:</strong></p>
<p>In case of the "connection limited" error, Windows should display a notification (or warning):</p>
<p>"Having troubles with your WiFi connection?</p>
<p>Make sure there is no interference caused by Bluetooth devices or your wireless peripherals (such as a wireless mouse or keyboard)."</p>
<p>It would be even better, if Windows can even scan for active Bluetooth connections and check wireless data usage, or/and scan for USB mouses and keyboards, to prepare a proper notification according to the actual status.</p>
<p>This would help a lot. I'm looking forward to see an update for Windows 10 with such notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if possible, it'd be great to increase the WiFi priority, among other connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. The best solution:</strong></p>
<p>You should force your manufacturers like HP, DELL and others, to equip their products with better network cards, with 5 GHz as a standard. Otherwise they will continue to generate losses for you and blame Windows for this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days WiFi is a must. Normal Windows users don't know anything about radio interference, they will just assume it's a bug in Windows or in their hardware.</p>

</p><p>Hello Deepak Krishnan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very sad to see fobbing off users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The make and the model does not matter to diagnose the issue. Please do not procrastinate.</p>
<p>2. The exact problem was well described, you just did not read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not related to drivers, Windows 10 has all the drivers in the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not related to the latest Windows 10 build as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you will show some support instead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is your answer (I quote):</p>
<p><strong>"Please get back to us if you have any other queries related to windows 10."</strong><br />
</p>
<p>It is a joke. We can get back to you if we have any OTHER queries? What about the actual issue? If you cannot solve it, it does not mean it is solved. You should be fired immediately for posting this quoted reply above. I have not seen anything like this
 before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is your lucky day! It turned out I found the solution!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Wireless headset is barely picking up voice</h2>
                    
<p>This is the 2nd time it has happened and I fear that it will not fix itself this time.</p>
<p>Whenever i first discovered it would not pick up my voice, it would pick it up as i moved it closer to my mouth. Over time it would get weaker and weaker till it could not pick up anything. I thought that if i left the batteries to drain then it would work.
 Nope. Both times this has happened, I used the AC to charge it using a USB plug. Could this be the issue? I have also tried resyncing the headset but it doesnt work either Before this happened, I was blowing into the mic, quite hard (no dirty jokes please
 ._.) so maybe this is the problem? I test it by sending a voice message but it just sounds like I'm very far away. How can I fix this? I cant find any results anywhere. Yes, it is an official xbox headset.</p>

<p>Hey Muzzles56, just to make sure this is a wireless mic correct? </p>
<p>And you have checked to ensure the volume is turned up? </p>
<p>If so I have heard of a few things. First you mentioned blowing into the mic with a lot of force that can be the issue. If the mic was fine before you blew into it then you could have gotten saliva (spit) down into the mic itself. This moisture could damage
 the mic's components and could definitely cause issues with it picking up your voice. Some other questions, do you ever have trouble hearing through the mic? And do you notice any change in the volume? Like when your in an Xbox Live party its super quiet but
 people can hear you better in an actual game lobby? I have never heard of the charging method damaging the mic itself unless they are left on charge for long periods of time. Get back to us with the answers to the questions I asked and we can try to figure
 this out. I would not recommend you attempting to disassemble the headset in anyway. You can render the mic completely unusable. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hey NSaNeCards. Yes it is a wireless mic</p>
<p>The volume is turned up. When entering an xbox live party and talking, the speaker beside my name does not change to the speaker with the round audio lines. I thought that saliva could have entered it, but i would have thought it would have drained out by
 now. I do not have any problems hearing through the mic and there is no change in volume. I was not going to disassemble the headset because I'm sure that there would be no need as this has been working perfectly for 2/3 years now.</p>

<p>Hey there, Muzzles56. Very sorry to hear about your difficulties! Let's see what we can do to get to the bottom of this. To start, have you tried an alternate microphone? I'd be interested to know if the issue persists when you use different devices or if
 this is an issue unique to this particular mic.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! Keep us posted.</p>

<p>Even if the saliva drains or drys the moisture could have permanently damaged the receiver or another electrical function . Also if you've had the mic for 2-3 years it may just be its time to go unfortunately. Charging and using it do "wear and tear" components
 and they do eventually give out or fail to function as desired. &nbsp;You said when you enter a party you do not get the symbol showing that your in party chat or do you mean when you talk you do mic doesn't respond with the appropriate moving symbol, like being
 in a party but in game chat? &nbsp;I would try what Mister Darcy suggested and use another mic on your Xbox to see if its a problem that needs to be fixed on a console level before going out and buying a new mic and continuing to have the same issue. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Sorry for the delay. I have not tried an alternate microphone as I do not have another. Ive also noticed that the earpiece has a lower quality. I will try an alternative and if this doesnt work, ill buy another official one. Theyre brilliant. Ill report
 back later. Thanks for all the help so far</p>

<p>Microsoft is going to lose so many consumers over this. It is happening to majority of people with no solution. I can hear everyone but they can't hear me. My mic doesn't pick up sound. My bubble doesn't even move. So I bought a brand new controller and
 xo fours thinking it was that and same problem. I know many others are frustrated with this. I have also looked up many videos and tried everything and nothing works. It happened randomly and now it is ruining many people's gaming experience. This is ridiculous
 . I hope they fix this soon</p>

<h2>            NTFS File system Error on HP Pavilion Notebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a submission tonight(22.1.2018) and need urgent help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was recently able to download a Windows 10 update. When I tried o switch on my laptop today, it switched on the first time, but froze immediately after. Since nothing seemed to be responding, I pressed the power button to switch it off. When I tried to
 switch it on again, a blue screen that says " your PC has run into a problem, and we need to restart"- that is apparently known as the Blue Screen of Death came on(showing a FAT file system Error) and then the screen kept on switching between the BSOD and
 a Black one saying something like " Automatic repair" came and went 3-4 times till it said that my PC needa to be recovered from a Drive because it couldn't be fixed. This entire thing happened again only this tjme it was an NTFS File system error and ended
 again with a Failure to Recover message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do about this? Kindly help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ISHITAGHOSH,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'd like to request the exact error messages that showed on your system. This way, I can provide you with the best troubleshooting steps. Also, please provide me this information so we could move on with the troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make and model of your device.</li><li>Current build and version of your device. This <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> can help you with this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since this happened recently, you can try out restoring your device to a previous point in time where the issue isn't present. Here's how you can do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;button, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>control panel<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>then choose&nbsp;it from the list of results.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE: </strong>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for <strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select
<strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Configure System Restore </strong>&gt; <strong>Configure
</strong>and make sure <strong>Turn on </strong><strong>system protection is selected</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>

    <title>Corrupted Profile &#43; Can&#39;t Recover &#61; Help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isabellacarosi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted Profile &#43; Can&#39;t Recover &#61; Help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't see any solution to this, I've tried everything that's been recommended :( My gamer profile is showing as corrupted, it won't connect to Xbox LIVE although the other profiles on my account (which are LIVE profiles) are fine, and can connect. My profile
 connected by default on sign in, but showed my gamerpoints as 0 and my avatar as blank, but now it's not even doing that. I tried to recover my gamertag, but I get the
<i>"Xbox LIVE signup currently unavailable - Try again later" </i>message. I've also heard about people losing their saves, even though they chose not to delete them when recovering their gamertag, which scares me a bit. I don't have a memory card or anything
 like that to transfer my profile to either. I've got no idea why it's corrupted, I've done nothing wrong!
</p>
<p>I don't know if it might be something to do with the fact that when I try and return to dashboard after being in a game, the drive makes some funny noises and the screen just remains black - it's like it's trying to quit the game but can't. Mind you, that
 hasn't happened in a while because I try to avoid doing it, it's only happened a few times, not for a couple of months at least, and my profile has been fine until now. Any suggestions? :( All help appreciated, thank you!!</p>

<h2>            &#40;Re&#41;installing Windows 7 Professional, language</h2>
                    Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
today I got myself a HP Compaq NC6320 second hand. The current language is set to German, but I would like to change that to Dutch. The operating system DVD says it has optional languages: English, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, .... etc. So it should be possible to
 set the language tot Dutch by reinstalling everything. <br />
<br />
Problem is when I finally get the laptop into systemrecovery and through installation, I can't change the language to Dutch, just the keyboardsettings. The language stays German and I can't click the pull down menu for other languages as if I don't have any
 other options. Though the DVD says it should.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Grs.<br />

            <p>Presumably its an actual HP recovery DVD, and if that is the case the installation options are those provided by HP</p>
<p>&nbsp;The official downloads for the win Pro ISO's are here, you would need to use ISO burning software to create the installation DVD for use with your win Key</p>

            Hello Palcouk,<br />
<br />
The disk that I received with the laptop says "contains software and drivers already installed. For software reinstallation and repair only". Maybe that clears the question what kind of DVD this is?<br />
<br />
I'm not really that handy with computers but I do have a diskburner in my laptop and iMac. Those " ISO's " you're talking about, are those the programmes with which you can change the language?
<br />
<br />
I've also read several answers about how to use the windows update to get language packs but my laptop doesn't find any language update possibilities so that's not working either...<br />
<br />
Grs.<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 fails to boot. Automatic repair is not working and I can&#39;t get to the menu to recover or start in safe mode.</h2>
                    One day my desktop was working fine. &nbsp;The next day (no additional software installs) it failed to boot. &nbsp;I can get it to say automatic repair on the boot screen but can't get to the menu to try other options. &nbsp;Most of the time the boot ends with a blinking&nbsp;courser&nbsp;or
 just a blank screen. &nbsp;Not sure how to proceed and get to recovery options. &nbsp;Did forced shutdown, unplugged and I am running out of options!

<p>If you dont have one, borrow one or make on friends computer with same bytes win8x64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or 32..&nbsp; bytes have to match yours&nbsp;on&nbsp;any win8&nbsp;repair or install disc.</p>

<p>You could try using a Friends Windows 8 machine to create the "Recovery Drive" (don't add the Friends Recovery Partition to it though).&nbsp; You should be able to use that "Recovery Drive" for Startup Troubleshooting on any Windows 8 machine.<br />

            <p>Matt, I'm just wondering if either or both replies you received helped you solve the problem you had. I too am stuck in a Automatic Repair loop and have been unable to fix it using any of the suggestions made here?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've seen suggestion that require the User to be able to boot into Safe Mode which I can't do. Nor does System Restore and Refresh of Windows 8 work. I've also tried booting from repair DVD and USB without success to install Windows updates. How can one
 edit the Registry or apply an update if one can't boot to Safe Mode at least?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Googling this Autorepair problem show it's well known to Microsoft yet only a few lucky people have been able to fix it. I would have thought Microsoft would have come up with a fix for this issue but from what I've read solving it is beyond even their Tech
 experts. Lots of guesses/suggested fixes but none have worked. What a joke this is!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought a new PC to run Flight Simulator X and chose Win 8 Pro 64-Bit to avail of extra RAM to realise my dream of having a stutter-free FSX. Now, after only a couple of months using this PC, Windows 8 Pro is stuffed. That means I'm looking at having to
 reinstall the O/S AND FSX as Microsoft gives us an O/S which does NOT protect Users from loss of Programs in this circumstance. I'm NOT impressed and want to record this so the Company and its Techs know quite clearly that this Windows 8 Automatic Repair failure
 is causing many clients a LOT of anxiety.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My FSX Installation is 128Gb in size and if I have to reinstall the O/S I'll have to reinstall FSX which is very time-consuming. Like Matt and all the others reporting this problem to Microsoft it simply shouldn't happen if the programming was professional
 and fully error-checked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just wish FSX was available to run on an Ubuntu rig because I know there would be no unsolvable issues then. Microsoft, hang your corporate head in shame!</p>

<p>You could never install a Windows Update in Safe Mode because the required Services would not be running.</p>

See what this says about RegEdit, hopefully you wont need it.</p>

Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These options are built-in to Windows 8 also. </p>
