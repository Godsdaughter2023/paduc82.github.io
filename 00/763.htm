            The most probable reason, as suggested by Suzanne, is that the layout property (wrap) of the image is 'in line' thus it behaves like a large font character. You must set the layout to something other than 'in-line' before you can drag it around.<br />

<p>"the Moderator" should be "moderators" as there is more than one of us.&nbsp; But both things are&nbsp;credible once further information is known. Without this information I Can see why it would not look credible. &nbsp; I'll first address why a moderator may not be able
 to supply the answer that you want. The</p>
<p>A Majority of the Moderators here are not Microsoft employees and in general are not privied to the internal day to day activities of Microsoft.&nbsp; We are regular people like you. The moderators tend to already engage in helping others both within and outside
 of these forums. I myself had been helping users in Microsoft and non-Microsoft forums for about two years before I was granted moderation priviledges within these forums.&nbsp; There are occasions in which I receive information not available to the public (I receive
 this information for reasons totally unrelated to having moderator status) and that information is attached to a non disclosure agreement. Thus when I have such information it's not something that I would ever share for as long as the NDA is active.</p>
<p>With that information it may be easier to see that "the moderators of these forums are unable to explain why" is equivalent to "others in this forum cannot explain why."</p>
<p>To address your other statement, that the Marketplace is not available in several countries, it seems that the activities required to setup a Marketplace in other countries are slow in general. Until a few months ago Google only had support for paid applications
 it's Android Marketplace available in 11 countries. If you look at the history of the expansion of the iTunes store you'll see that it took a couple of years to get to the 30 country mark. In trying to infer&nbsp; the necessary considerations when adding a new
 country to the Marketplace the publically available information suggest Microsoft has to&nbsp;examine local tax laws, rules and laws on trade between various nations, draft contracts suitable for the laws of that country, &nbsp;identify local decency standards, establish
 relationships with local financial institutions, and in some cases translations and hiring staff that can speak the language of the new country being added. Microsoft doesn't make public information on the commercialization of a product.<span>(I've
 been in a position to asks Microsoft employees in the know about the exact details of adding a new country but dare not ask. If I were successful in getting the details then I'd probably end up being prohibited from speaking about it because of an NDA)</span>.&nbsp;
 The only information that is publically available on the expansion of the Marketplace is that Microsoft is working on it, and they will make announcements as new nations are added.</p>
<p>All of the above boils down to "worldwide trade agreements arn't established over night." With that consideration the unavailability of the Marketplace in all 200+ countries that make up this world is credible. Coverage will increase with time.</p>

                    <p>Hello, I have purchased an OEM version of MS office 2013 just to found that it's in Chinese. I know I can change the menu to any language I like by installing appropriate language pack and select the display language in office. &nbsp;However, it appears that
 the method does not work for the menu of Excel VBA editor. &nbsp;It's always displayed in Chinese. May I know if there is a way to change it to English pls ?</p>

            <p>Hello, I've had the same problem and finally found the solution. The language file for VBA editor interface is stored in the following folder with different subfolders:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\VBA\VBA7.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>(you may need to search for&nbsp;VBEUIINTL.dll if you can't find this folder on your computer)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;in this folder the 1033 subfolder and its contents are for English interface. The other ones are for different languages. &nbsp;Somehow VBA chooses the wrong subfolder. So you basically need to copy the contents of 1033 folder ( as a workaround ):</p>
<p>
"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\VBA\VBA7.1\1033\APC71ITL.DLL"<br />
"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\VBA\VBA7.1\1033\VBE7INTL.DLL"<br />
"C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\VBA\VBA7.1\1033\VBEUIINTL.DLL"
</p><p>
</p><p>to the 2052 folder (for chinese for example, may be you have different), for changing the language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing this , restart and don't start any office products. Then copy the files; overwrite if asked. I also suggest you to take a backup of VBA7.1 folder in case something goes wrong.</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Dan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your question, Iâ€™m eager to assist!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to first confirm that you have UET (Universal Event Tracking) set up within your Bing Ads account and that the tag has been placed on your website across all pages? By having UET set
 up on your website, you can track conversion data and variable revenue using conversion goals.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before you can set up variable revenue, make sure you have completed the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>UET tag:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Create a Bing Ads UET tag and add the UET tag tracking code to your website. To learn more, see&nbsp;<a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56682/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How
 do I create a UET tag?</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56688/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How do I add the UET tag to my website?</span></a></span></li><li><strong><span>Conversion goal:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Create a destination URL or event conversion goal.

 do I create a conversion goal?</span></a></span></li><li>
<strong><span>Ability to edit website:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Make sure that either you or your webmaster can edit your website code.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the steps listed above are complete, you can set up variable revenue on your Bing Ads account. Our
</span><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56687/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How do I track variable revenue</span></a><span> help article lists step by step instructions on how to set it up starting
 from the goal in the account following how to place the script on your website. Once you have set this up, you are able to edit the columns on your dashboard to show the revenue value.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You stated that you are using BigCommerce and while we are not subject matter experts on this platform, I am able to provide you with a help link that shows how to do a basic set up of
</span><a href="http://bingadsuet.azurewebsites.net/BigCommerce.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">UET with BigCommerce</span></a><span>.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need further assistance with this matter, I am happy to help and I have sent you a private message that you can respond to. Please check your private messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps!</span></p>

<h2>            show increase and decrease percentages for more than just 2 numbers</h2>
                    I have looked all over this forum for a formula that would let me calculate the increase and or decrease for more than just two variables. Example: I have 6 months worth of data and want to see what is the increased average percentage from the first month
 to the last, keep in mind I have a company laptop and I can't install any&nbsp;plug-ins. However, I do have power pivot installed for office 2010.

<h3> oral anderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add email2 or email3 of the same contact to a group&#63;</h2>
                    I haven't changed my email address from Hotmail.com to Outlook.com.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I use Microsoft Outlook 2007 (MO2007) and my email manager.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before Outlook.com, I was able to create a distribution list (group) in MO2007 using multiple emails of the same contact (ie one person with multiple email addresses).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since Outlook.com, only the primary email shows up&nbsp;after MO2007 syncs. (even after I've manually added email2 &amp; email3 in MO2007)<br />
<br />
I've tried to add email2 &amp; 3 using Outlook.com, but I do not see an option to do so.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks

            <p>It can be kludged. Create a new contact for each email address you want to use in a group. For example, if John Doe has a private address john at doe dot com and a work address of john.doe at company dot com, then create a new contact with&nbsp;the same name
 but insert only the&nbsp;work address. Then add both contacts to your group. When you address a message to the group, you'll see multiple instances of the name, but pointing at each name will reveal the underlying address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add a nickname like John Doe (Work) using the options under 
<strong>ãŠ‰</strong> <strong>Name</strong> on the create or edit contact screens. The nickname will not show on outgoing mail, but will figure in searches. So if John works at BHP, you could nickname him
<em>John Doe (BHP)</em>. Typing bhp in the search box would bring him up.</p>

<p>Hello Luca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know if you have local Exchange server in your environment? If yes, please share the detailed version. Since this shared mailbox can be accessed from Outlook client, this issue should not be related to itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you create a new shared mailbox and then try to access it from OWA? Will it work? To identify if it is network related, please try another network such as the internal wifi, will this shared mailbox be opened from OWA?</p>

<h2>            m.facebook.com on IE Lumia 730 display issue</h2>
                    Hi all.&nbsp;The mobile version of facebook is displaying incorrectly on IE. The display of the main page shifts to the left, which makes it possible to view only a part of the page . BTW, please do not advise me to use the dedicated Facebook app.

            Hi&nbsp;Anna_Ko<br />
Try&nbsp;clearing&nbsp;history&nbsp;of&nbsp;browser&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;try&nbsp;again.&nbsp;To&nbsp;clear&nbsp;history&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;IE&nbsp;&gt;â€¢â€¢â€¢&gt;&nbsp;settings&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;delete&nbsp;history.&nbsp;

            <p>Sorry, but clearing the IE history did not solve the problem. Facebook mobile is the only web page that is affected. I doubt this is related to the history of the browser. It's as though the mobile facebook page was somehow wrongly "fitted" into the screen
 - the system is unable to determin what size of the page to apply for the browser. When I logged in to facebook again after clearing the history, the facebook page was visibe only partially, with no possibility to scroll up to the top to access any of the
 menu options :( </p>
<p>Let me add - sometimes it loads with access to top menu buttons and when I click on the Notifications button, the page goes back to normal for a minute. Then, when I click on something, go back to facebook, it starts all over again. This has got to be a
 bug.</p>
<p>Any other ideas? Thanks. </p>

No, I haven't. I might need to, then. I just feel like it's a shame having to install yet another app just to make something work better, when it is supposed to work on the original tool ;-) I will try that and I will let you know.</p>

</p><p>1. AC Browser - the same problem occurs, and on top of that, I am unable to "Like" a post.
</p>
<p>2. Opera Mini - all ok, except the speed. The page lags while scrolling.</p>
<p>3. Surfy - it would be my favorite if not the "Like" button not working.</p>

pprabhu.it</a>. We understand the situation, and we're here to help you out. First, let's try to isolate the root cause of the issue. When you said that the phone has been sent to Care Point for almost five times, does it mean the technicians didn't do anything
 apart from resetting your Lumia 730? If that's a yes, can you try to take a look at the other workarounds given below? Let us know the outcome so that we can think of another resolution for you.</p>

<h2>            Why is my resume format different when I open it in Microsoft Office then when I open it in Word Pad&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My resume looks different in Microsoft Office, then in Word Pad. For example, in Office things look crooked. But in Word Pad things look exactly how I typed them. My friend also has a resume. Same problem. She has her resume format designed with her dates
 of employment on the right-hand side. But if she opens her resume in Office, her dates are on the LEFT-HAND side and out-of-place. (Not in it's original format.) Looks sloppy. Why is this??? My main concern is when I email my resume to employers, I HOPE that
 their default IS&nbsp;NOT set to Office.&nbsp;We do not want to lose out on job opportunities. Can somebody please tell me why such a thing occurs???&nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello Blake McNeill:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your questions about family options for different services available across your Microsoft devices.&nbsp; We can certainly appreciate your desire for a easy way to manage and streamline the use of your services across
 a family.&nbsp; I will provide the details currently available regarding your questions as well as some resources to make your voice heard when it comes to suggestions for future features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this time there are not family options for services like Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Music.&nbsp; There was once a Xbox Live Gold family pack, that was disbanded starting in October.&nbsp; As far as I am aware there has never been a family pack type option for the
 Xbox Music Pass, formerly Zune Pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the current state a&nbsp; User for Xbox Live would need to have their own individual account and Live subscription to enjoy all the features of Xbox Live Gold.&nbsp; On a Xbox console a family could easily share the same profile if there is no need to have individual
 members using the subscription at the same time.&nbsp; When it comes to your phones, tablets and Windows 8 PC's this becomes a tougher scenario.&nbsp; All of these devices work with a primary Microsoft account that is typically individualized to the user.&nbsp; It is likely
 unrealistic that 3 family members would want to use the same primary Microsoft account and share the same SkyDrive account, contacts, calendars, Xbox Live, Xbox&nbsp; Music, etc....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to using the Music Pass I have a couple suggestions that may allow the family to take advantage of one Music Pass, at least on some devices.&nbsp; One thing you can consider is simply using the
<a href="http://music.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Music website</a>.&nbsp; This site will allow users to stream music from our marketplace at no cost.&nbsp; This site will allow each user to sign into the site via their browser and create a collection and build playlists that are
 unique to their accounts.&nbsp; This is going to require a connection as music cannot be downloaded and played offline.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to have some expanded use of the service you might consider buying the Music Pass on a fresh account that is created for the purpose of sharing this service.&nbsp; You could then create a local profile on your Windows 8 devices, this will not be possible
 on the Windows phone, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</a>.&nbsp; Once you create these local profiles on your tablets/PC's you can then sign into the Xbox Music application with the shared account, do this by opening the app
 &gt; then opening your charm bar &gt; clicking settings &gt; account &gt; sign in.&nbsp; This would allow you to download music with the Music Pass to a total of 4 devices.&nbsp; If you need to use the Pass for downloads on more then 4 devices, it would be suggested to purchase
 a second Pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for sharing a playlist you created with another user.&nbsp; The best and easiest way to do this would be via the Xbox Music website through Facebook.&nbsp; There is a new feature of the site that allows you to share this playlist on Facebook and those that click
 this via your Facebook page will be able to stream it seamlessly for Free.&nbsp; You can do this by creating the playlist and then clicking said playlist.&nbsp; The icon farthest to the right will be the share icon that allows you to set this up.&nbsp; If you go with the
 option of setting up a shared account to be used on multiple devices, this will allow for access to that playlist by multiple users from different platforms.&nbsp; Now, the use of the playlist will be limited.&nbsp; The Xbox Music application does not store playlists
 locally on devices but instead saves them to the cloud.&nbsp; This means the playlist would have to be streamed and streaming can only be done from one device at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or if any of the above information needs additional clarity added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do i know if i have a keystroke logger program on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    When i tried to sign into my email account, it said i was entering the wrong password (no, it was the right one) and locked me out after multiple attempts.&nbsp; When i went to change it i found out that my security question had been changed too.&nbsp; Spam emails
 had been sent from that account.&nbsp; With the ISP's assistance i did manage to get in and change my password but now it is happening again with another address on that account.<br />
<br />
Is this a simple add address book worm or do i have a keystroke logger?<br />
<br />
My Microsoft Security Essentials says i do not have any infections - but do i trust that?&nbsp; I am afraid to check my bank accounts and credit cards because if i do have a logger virus i don't want that compromised.<br />
<br />
HELP!!!!!<br />

    <title>6310i Bluetooth to Notebook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            6310i Bluetooth to Notebook</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've just got a notebook and want to use bluetooth to my 6310i to get my emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded PC Suite to the notebook and tried to install the&nbsp;'Modem Setup for Nokia 6310' which I've also downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I get to connectivity the bluetooth option is greyed out and it says I need modem, I've got a bluetooth modem in my notebook on COM3?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try PC Suite it says the phones not connected, and it doesn't appear in Device Management under Bluetooth devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet the phone does connect when I click on connect to Bluetooth on my notebook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone give me&nbsp;a step by step&nbsp;guide to get this working, not to technical as I'm a 'learner' !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can't upgrade it yourself although don't know whether Nokia Care Point will pull a long face in view of it's age, but failing that independent specialists could certainly do this for you.</p>

    <title>How do I move .pst folders and the files within them into a new .ost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clc2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I move .pst folders and the files within them into a new .ost file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just deleted a POP3 account in outlook 2016 and replaced it with a new IMAP account. &nbsp;That's left me with a two part file structure -- the one on top appears to be data my original .pst file ( it has the folder structure that I made by creating new
 folders in my inbox still there with about 1GB of email files distributed throughout the folders), while the one below has a simple in and out box folder where new mail downloaded from and sent to my and sent to my ISP. &nbsp;This lower set of folders appears to
 be the new .ost file</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, it looks like shifting to IMAP left me with my old pst structure and data, including calendar and contacts data listed above a new stripped-down set of .ost files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is consolidate the .pst folders with files within into the new .ost data file. How do I do that on a 1GB scale?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do about my calendar and contact data? &nbsp; Where are they now and where ought I to put them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to wind with just one list of folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? &nbsp;The only question on this community board is an outdated one where the person wants to go from a German .pst to and English .ost file. &nbsp;(Why German to English? &nbsp;BTHOOM &nbsp;Beats The ...)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best directions would send me to an on point YouTube video (Have I already looked? Yes.), but anything that works will do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Until creating the the IMAP account, I'd been receiving all inbound mail to the primary .pst inbox and either deleting the items or dragging messages thatI wanted to keep into created folders or subfolders organized by subject. &nbsp; All outgoing mail left
 from the primary sent folder. &nbsp;Later, I'd either delete the message or drag it to the appropriate subject folder or subfolder on the inbound folder side. &nbsp; There were no rules regarding moving messages. &nbsp;I dragged them. &nbsp;Might I manage differently if I could
 find clear instructions as to comparison and implementation of alternatives? Yes.)</p>

            <p>Hi Harsha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've found after some experimentation with the new, primary .ost file:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I was able to drag all my <em>messages </em>from the .pst Inbox, Sent and Drafts folders into their respective .ost Inbox, Sent and Drafts folders</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Dragging a created folder or subfolder from the .pst file inbox crashed Outlook -- twice.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I <em>was </em>able to create manually in the .ost inbox file an: "Airlines" folder and "American," "Delta" and "United: sub-folders, then I dragged individual
<em>messages</em> from the .pst &nbsp;sub-folders</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Once I opened my ISP to "Mail", IMAP's syncing capability had recreated the expanded folder structure, online, that I had created in the .ost inbox as well as duplicated the individual messages into the right sub-folders (For example: from the "American"
 .pst sub-folder to the "American" .ost sub-folder.)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>1. Is there a method that would recreate the old .pst account file structure into its replacement .ost acount file AND move the right messages into the right files?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If no method, then the movement of message data would all go far faster if I could import the .pst folder&nbsp;<em>structure</em> into my new .ost account's inbox. &nbsp;<em><strong>2. Is there any way to i</strong></em><strong>mport just the .pst folder&nbsp;structure&nbsp;into
 my new .ost account's Inbox</strong><strong>? </strong>&nbsp;That would leave it to me to do just the dragging and dropping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't move the folder structure <em>en-masse,</em>&nbsp;then the process would
<em>still</em> go faster if I could print out the .pst folder structure, so that I could to duplicate it by hand more quickly in the .ost "inbox". &nbsp;<em><strong>3. Can I print out the .pst folder structure?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>4. If none of these questions has an affirmative answer, will Microsoft be creating an easier way for customers to convert from POP3 to IMAX&nbsp;accounts? &nbsp;
</strong></em>Once customers use Outlook on several computers, many will want (or need) to sync Outlook data between their different computers, tablets and mobile phones by conversion to IMAX. &nbsp; As I understand it, I can work from data on my own computer if
 the internet is down from wherever I am at any given point. I don't know if Office 365 will allow that. &nbsp;AND, I don't want to shell out for Office 365 when I'm already invested in Office 2016 on my individual computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>General Comment: &nbsp;Where are the "<em>This is how to handle this common situation</em>" YouTube videos with paired written instructions? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Great application programs are of little use if even comparatively computer-literate customers must
 spend days figuring out how to use them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation is a case in point. &nbsp; I only understood that I needed to convert to IMAX after spending several hours Googling and finding out what I needed to know about the alternatives from 3rd party YouTube videos. &nbsp; Moreover, it's usually faster and
 easier to use <em>Google </em>to find an answer in the <em>Microsoft</em> Knowledge Base then it is going directly to the &nbsp;Knowledge Base. &nbsp; Why does Microsoft go to such extraordinary lengths to trash it's own brand? &nbsp;Is the ghost of Steve Balmer still lurking
 in the MS bureaucracy?</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1a - Most likely reason(s) for Outlook crashing are probably because you copied an extremely large folder without setting Outlook to "work offline" which means it would have likely started to sync while still in a heavy "copy" process over-lapping with
 the usual send/receive process</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1b - <strong>Outlook PST import function</strong> (see &lt;Palcouk's&gt; response regarding limitations which shouldn't be ignored. Maintaining contacts/calendar data in an .ost file is definitely ill-advised.</p>
<p><br />

<p>#3 - For printing folder structure, refer to&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>#4 - That same question could be asked of any vendor providing any &lt;email client&gt; but regardless, answer provided in #1b with caveats in #1a and #3. You can just as easily create your folder structure using webmail as you can using Outlook remembering that
 the ultimate control of IMAP folders is at the server level.</p>

            <p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you very quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>#1a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the ticket!</strong> &nbsp;Moving Outlook off line (click on the send/receive tab, click on the Work Offline Box so that the box itself is highlighted) &nbsp;allowed me to drag folders with sub-folders and messages the .pst file to OST the
 .ost file. &nbsp; That being said, things were a tad persnickety at the .ost dropping end. &nbsp;Lots of crashes, but ultimately I got everything moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1b &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>Outlook PST import function</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;was too complicated for me. &nbsp; I wouldn't try it in the absence of a current Microsoft video to show me how to do it, any more than I'd change
 stuff in my computer registry without VERY specific instructions. &nbsp;Also, I never found an explanation of how it would interface with an existing .ost file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">#3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I found&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.msoutlook.info/question/515</a>&nbsp; and succeeded in making it work, although not in
 getting the list to print. &nbsp;Thankfully, I didn't need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">#4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't care about other email clients, because I'm using Outlook 2016, which integrates into the rest of Office 2016. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I don't think that my needs are all that unique. &nbsp;I'm sure that MS marketing people have been able to divvy up their customer base into standard classes. &nbsp;Personally, I have two Windows
 10 computers from which I want to work on the same Outlook account. &nbsp; I also have a mobile phone on which I'd like to review mail, but don't want to paralyze with too much data. &nbsp;My ISP -- probably the biggest in the country -- allows up to 10 GB of data storage
 for mail, so I'm at only 1/10th of capacity. &nbsp;Is that really unusual?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And I can't lose my data. &nbsp;I've already downloaded Safe PST Backup, which claims to to address the .ost file issue. &nbsp;I have an onsite Buffalo backup and &nbsp;continuous backup to Acronis. &nbsp;Do I need the SafePST
 backup in addition? &nbsp;Who knows? Cuz MS doesn't tell in a way that's accessible to me. &nbsp;My primary unit is protected by an APS-Back Pro1000, so lightning and power jags are buffered somewhat.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Am I a Microsoft hater? &nbsp;No. I've always used the latest version of Office and I was very grateful to move a business from Novell Netware ($2500 or so for 10 seats) to Microsoft NT at about 1/10th the
 price as soon as it became available. &nbsp; Yes, I used a consultant for that larger operation, but see no need for one now when my scale of computer use is much less.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to believe that Microsoft is trashing its brand by only answering tiny discrete questions rather than also giving
<em>its own</em> guidance to broad classes of small customer on how they should organize their home and travelling offices, then pointing to specifics on YouTube showing how to implement. &nbsp;Personally, I've found that relying on zillions of third parties for
 basic information is exasperating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good companies answer needs, not just questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, how do I even know that opening Outlook on my laptop which has no data in it's .ost file won't erase everything on my ISP's mail server obtained from my desktop unit? &nbsp;Understanding the initial setup when adding a 2nd computer will require
 yet more research to answer basic questions that wouldn't be such a big deal for MS to answer. &nbsp; Still, if I get no answers, I can skip Outlook on the 2nd unit and go directly to my ISP mail site. &nbsp;Is that really what MS wants?</p>

</p><p>#4 - While this may be construed the wrong way - Outlook is a tool which works in different environments. There comes a point where you need to become familair with things just like when you buy a car, the car manufacturer doesn't provide detail driving
 instructions or extensive information about various requirements in different jurisdictions .</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - Honestly, not sure what is considered normal but can tell you just by reading some of the posts in this forums about their data file sizes, 10gb would not accommodate them. A 1gb data store is not considered large by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p>
</p><p>#6 - <a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/safepst-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SafePSTBackup</a> is an excellent product but whether you need it or not depends on you (not to mention that backing up .ost files requires the Enterprise paid version which also allows for scheduling). Also, SafePSTBackup "backs up" an OST file to a PST file
 which is then accessible - the sasme thing you can do manually by simply exporting the OST file via the Outlook export process, Different backup programs provide different capabilities for different requirements (coincidentally, one of the articles I'm working
 on happens to be entitled &lt;Creating an Outlook backup strategy&gt; with an additional coincidence being that both &lt;<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/safepst-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SafePSTBackup</a>&gt; and &lt;<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/acronis1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis</a>&gt;
 will be referenced)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#7 - "How do you know....." - with all due respect, you really need to educate yourself regarding the functionalities of the different industry standard protocols regardless of which email client is in use. In short, an OST file is nothing more than a mirror
 of the data stored on the server. Far too many people confuse the "sync'ing" done that is inherently done as part of the &lt;email protocol&gt; with 3rd party "sync" tools - addins or otherwise.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A great concept but a somewhat of a simplistic view given that there are endless ways that people work and organize themselves, all of which may be "correct" for a given scenario - there's no "one size fits all answer" and I would submit that no matter what
 info was provide in terms of best practices, someone out there is going to be critical and complain that anything provided didn't significantly or properly cover their specific scenario. Just like someone might ask you - with all the concerns you have etc

            <p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now bought and installed Office 365 Essentials for Business. &nbsp; After converting Outlook mail to .ost-IMAP, I'm using Microsoft's exchange server to sync &nbsp;my remaining .pst-POP3 files -- &nbsp;Outlook Calendar and Contacts &nbsp;This latter took the help of a
 MS tech service guy who had me create an account in both Outlook clients for my new business email address -- *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While not understanding of all the details, I'm told that this new arrangement was made more baroque because Comcast, my isp, offers POP3 and IMAP accounts, but no exchange server accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation of OneDrive for Business and Sharepoint, which come along with SKYpe for Business was also an interesting proposition to install on both Windows 10 computers, but it's now done. &nbsp;Doing this ought to have a snap, but the software is anything
 but intuitive &nbsp;-- sync means more than sync --and I never found any video showing me how to do it. &nbsp;My guess is that most users will use these cloud services via a browser, but not have them installed onto their Windows 10 computers, so that they can drag
 and drop documents into them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, great software but rotten or non-existent instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last act will be to arrange for local backup of all data on my desktop Outlook 2016 client into a .pst file, but that's not necessary right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for pointing me in the right direction,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chuck</p>

</p><p>As for the backup process - when you get around to it, one program that may be of interest is
<a href="http://www.contactgenie.info/safepst-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SafePSTBackup Enterprise Ed</a> (as opposed to free) which allows you to backup any .ost file (converting it to a PST file) - all can be done on a scheduled basis. Found this to one of the most comprehensive OST2PST tools in that it includes data related user-defined
 fields, custom forms etc etc (in essence it includes the &lt;hidden items&gt; that many other programs don't). Anyhow - there are lots of different ways to go about things - this is just one of a myriad of ways which IMHO is worth checking out if your plan is to
 make local copies of your OST data files.</p>

                    <p>"Log onto incoming mail server (POP3): The operation timed out waiting for a response from the receiving (POP) server. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 7 &amp; have&nbsp;used outlook on my desktop&nbsp;for years, I changed my password on 8/25 and it worked until Friday 8/31 - I ran a repair on our Office 2013 but nothing fixes the issue, and I deleted the email account in settings in hopes it would fix
 something and now because of this error I cannot add it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saw a&nbsp;previous email about running a MAPI repair tool,&nbsp;that did not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to receive emails from the Google website and on my phone, so&nbsp;it's not the end of the world but is annoying to not know the reason
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just noticed I have an Outlook Program and Outlook 2013 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is related but&nbsp;over the last 2-3 months Word &amp; Excel has been corrupting, I will get an error saying my subscription is expired then once I run a repair it goes back to normal.</p>

</p><p>Verified, there are not 2 Outlook programs running, I may have mislead you. Here are copies of my settings. I played with the POP3 and Outgoing Server input numbers and got the test account setting to complete, however, there is no close option, therefore
