<h2>            Locked up MS Lumia 950XL</h2>
                    Total novice here. June 16 I bought a 950 XL. Friend set it up for me and the phone and camera functions worked, but nothing else.&nbsp; Only recently discovered the phone did not get listed on MS devices on MS account. So, my friend&nbsp;didn't have time to troubleshoot,
 then moved away&nbsp;and I've been trying to fix it ever since.&nbsp; Discovered he used wrong email address. Tried to reset, but password he supposedly used failed.&nbsp; Can't change one without the other being correct.&nbsp; Many trips to MS store, many hours on the phone
 with MS help, support, tech support (which it turns out doesn't do phones) and lots of Lumina experts, all to no avail.&nbsp; Yesterday, I found a YouTube demo on how to reset to factory settings and started the process.&nbsp; Reached the point where it calls for a
 reset key and I don't have one.&nbsp; Went looking for how to get the reset key and all things lead back to MS devices list or MS account, or support, etc. I'm in a do loop and now have

            Hello Nath and thanks for your suggestion.&nbsp; My heart soared when I found B2X.COM yesterday. It certainly seemed to promise that I had finally found someone who was going to help me solve the problem. I on-line chatted with a rep for some time who wanted
 to walk me through the same steps I had already completed to unlock the phone.&nbsp; It took some time for the rep to understand that I had gotten probably halfway through the process when the next step was to put in the key and that it was that key I am now chasing.&nbsp;
 I explained that my phone is basically locked up on the screen demanding the key....won't go back or forward.&nbsp; At that point, the B2X.COM rep advised that they don't do key words and I should contact tech support team.&nbsp; I explained that the tech support team
 doesn't do squat on MS's cell phone issues and sent me to B2X.COM to fix the problem.&nbsp; B2X.COM rep answered that they could help with the process, but not with software issues and key words are software

<p>Hello Nath and thanks for your response.&nbsp; I've visited the MLA Team page and it appears dedicated to resellers, not the home users.&nbsp; Also, I can't find anywhere a reference to MS cell phones at all.&nbsp; 93tid is correct in observing that I need a protection
 reset key before I can move further into unlocking the phone and ... I am hoping... getting valid email address and passowrd loaded for future phone use.&nbsp; I still need to find an MS expert on MS cell phones who can help me get this phone unlocked, scrubbed
 of inaccurate email address and password and reactivated.&nbsp; I'll appreciate in finding the MS experts on these issues.

</p><p>I am not 100% sure if this will work, however try using the Windows Device Recovery Tool for a complete full reinstall of the software on your device as per

<p>Hello 93 and thanks for trying to help.&nbsp; I bought the cord to connect my phone to my pc, downloaded the factory reset software...all 2.78GB of it...and ran it.&nbsp; I thought for a moment that it had solved the problem, but when I went into programming the phone
 came to the same bug-a-boo screen that says, Hey looks like you forgot to turn off protection so you have to put in your reset protection key.&nbsp; Locked up again and still searching for a way to get access to the key.</p>
<p>The screen tells me I can get access to the reset key through my devices on my MS account.&nbsp; However, that leads to another MS problem... they did not list the phone as part of my account when they sold and shipped it to me in 2016. I shows up as part of
 a multiple item purchase from MS, but is lost somewhere in the screen protectors, etc., I ordered at the same time I ordered the phone.&nbsp; Anyone know how to get MS to list on you account devices list a device they sold you? I can't figure out why it was not
 listed when the phone left MS shipping, but that is what it is. </p>
<p>Anyone at MS reading this posting and who can tell me how to get my phone listed on my devices on my MS account?

<p>
</p><p>That only happens when you set up your MS account on the phone. From your original post I understand that this is not what happened in your case. If you cannot access the account which your friend used to set up the phone, you cannot get to the email message
 containing the reset key. Unless b2x.com somehow are persuaded to properly wipe your phone I don't think you have a solution.</p>

Hello 93 and thanks for your suggestion. Unfortunately, no cigar on the rebuild of the system or activating a solution at B2X.&nbsp; B2X can't/won't do anything, other than refer me to MS Account Support and they don't do support
 for what I need. From everything I can tell, you are correct in your final assessment that I will never find a solution.&nbsp;

</span><span>Hello, thank you for contacting B2X support for your Microsoft device. How can I help you?</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>Hi.</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>hello swaiti. I hope you will be able to help me today.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>Yes.I'll do my best to resolve this issue for you.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>How may I help you?</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>Basically, I have a MS Lumina 950XL that a friend set up incorrectly in 2016 and have been chasing how to get back on track since then. Thought I had the solution when I learned about hard reset and new windows instal but
 am back in the same position as before. I don't have a access key number and the email address my friend put in is incorrect. I've been everywhere in MS trying to get help, but all drop me when I say I need the key or help getting the key.</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>This morning, I got this message on the community discussion page: Unless b2x.com somehow are persuaded to properly wipe your phone I don't think you have a solution.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati
 S:</strong> </span><span>I'll do my best to resolve this issue for you.</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>So, my bottom line is that I need to B2X to wipe out the registraion of the account and free it up for me to start over again.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>As I can understand your device is asking for reset protection key . Am I right?</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>yes</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>I apologize but we do not support the reset protection recovery key.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>You need to contact Microsoft account support specifically. As in order to get the recovery key you must have the access to the Microsoft account with which the device was configured before the reset.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati
 S:</strong> </span><span>Please visit this link microsoft support.com/contactus.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>Are we connected?</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>Yes, I understand that you do not do reset protection key, but community speaker has led me to believe that you can erase the whole registration and allow me to restart the process. I've contacted ever function at MS I can
 identify and they all blow me off or send me to B2X. The MS support folks you want me to contact repeatedly run me in a circle then refer me to B2X, Just as the authority posting answers to my community posting does. "Get b2x to wipe out the
</span></span><span><span>program so you can start over or give up" is his latest advice.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>I apologize but it is not possible.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>I apologize you may contact to the Microsoft support.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>The recovery key would be generated by Microsoft account which was used in the phone before the reset
</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong> </span>
<span>Well, do a favor for everybody else who ever contacts your for assistance. Tell them "MS will not help you and we will not either. MS has nobody that will answer or try to solve your problem and Lumina problems are not B2X problems."</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati
 S:</strong> </span><span>I understand but reset protection key is not in our boundary.</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></span><span><span><strong>Me:</strong>
</span><span>I'm not asking for a protection key any more. I need the account abolished and left vacant so I can start over.
</span></span><span><span><strong>Swati S:</strong>
</span><span>I apologize but it would not be possible from our end.</span></span></div>

            I meant for b2x.com to do a complete factory reinstall of the software on your device, not erase any account or registration, which they definitely cannot do. Apologies for not being 100% clear in my previous message. This seems to be a security feature
 which tends to go rogue when people don't really pay attention to it. MS seem to wrongly assume that everyone reads all their support articles before using the device, similar to me assuming that everyone understands what I mean when I use semi-technical terms.<br />

<h2>            Add-in to allow Mac Office 2011 to read and write xlsx files</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet that has data validation that links between different sheets that I created in Excel 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to share that file with folks using Mac Excel 2011. Is there an add-on or compatibility viewer that allows my Mac users to see, edit and save the xlsx file?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like an add-in if possible. Does Office 365 account for these differences?</p>

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read one of your other posts that said that there's likely an activex control inside the sheet somewhere. &nbsp;I found the rouge control that when removed enabled the file to run fine on Excel 2011 (Mac). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran this bit of code adopted from someone else http://www.ozgrid.com/forum/showthread.php?t=52684 :</p>
<p>Sub find_activeX()&nbsp;<br />
Dim objX As Object</p>
<p>For Each sht In Sheets<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With sht<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each objX In .OLEObjects<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Debug.Print sht.Name &amp; ": " &amp; objX.Name &amp; " | " &amp; objX.Left &amp; " | " &amp; objX.Top<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
Next&nbsp;<br />
End Sub&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now a little more confused regarding how to actually find and ActiveX control vice a 'Form' control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presumed that everything in the OLEObjects is an ActiveX control, but I still have some objects in this collection in the files that now work on the Mac. &nbsp;Are there certain ActiveX controls that are allowed and some that are not, or, are more than just
 ActiveX controls contained in that collection?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the control that was causing the problem was missing a library reference.</p>
<p>

            Active-X has never been supported on the Macintosh. If that code will not find active-x controls, i don't know how to help. To run on the Mac you will have to replace all the active-x controls.

</p><p>Do you happen to know the best way to test for an ActiveX object? &nbsp;The code above traverses the OLEObjects container, but clearly there's more than just ActiveX stuff in there.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello, russellcarroll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. Follow these steps on how to stop your phone from restarting:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First, check to see if you have an update available. Go to the App list, tap <strong>
Settings</strong><span>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkbdevstorage1.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f12619_en-us_2" /></div>
</span>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Phone update</strong>, and then tap <strong>Check for updates</strong>. If there is an update available, install the update.
</li></ul>
To check and fix your phone using an app
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Download the Stop Restart app to your phone, open it, and then follow the steps in the app. (For best results, connect to Wi-Fi.)</li><li>The app will display either of two results: </li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your phone is OK</strong>. Your phone is fixed, and you don't need to do anything else.</li><li><strong>We need to fix your phone</strong>. Follow the "To fix your phone using a PC" steps in this topic if the app wasn't able to do so.</li></ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Even if the app fixes your phone or says your phone is OK, you may still be offered a critical update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix your phone using a PC </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your phone's battery is completely charged.</li><li>You don't disconnect or use your phone while the fix is running.</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Connect your phone with a USB cable to a PC that is connected to the Internet.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Unlock your phone if you have set a lock screen password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On your PC, run Microsoft Fix it Solution—Stop Phone Restart.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Leave your phone turned on and connected while the fix runs. During the process the phone will restart and display spinning gears with a progress bar. It should take a few minutes for the process to complete.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the process is complete, your phone will be fixed and display the message "Update successful."</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap <strong>All done</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps! Let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            How can I turn my sculpt wireless keyboard int a wired keyboard.</h2>
                    Just learned the shocking news that my $120 keyboard may &nbsp;be worthless now that I broke the transceiver and there is apparently no way to replace it. &nbsp;I've decided instead of chucking it in the garbage and buying myself a cheap Logitech version like I
 should have in the first place, that I will try to turn it into a wired keyboard and mouse. &nbsp; Anyone have some good links or advice as how to proceed with this crazy plan?

            Typically, replacing the hard drive will wipe the Office software . Depending on the type of your license, you can reinstall it . If it is an Office 2010, you needed the product key for activation . For Office 2013 / 2016/ 2019 you needed to use the Microsoft
 account associated to your license that is installed before on your computer

<h2>            OLE Excel links from word broken</h2>
                    <p>I created a report in word with a list of different information. The dates I needed vary all throughout the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed each date a to be linked into an excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; I linked the information by copying the date and special pasting as a linked text. They are linked so when someone updates the word document the info will automatically update the excel sheet.</p>

</p><p>When I open the excel worksheet and perform the updates I receive an error that stating the links don't work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single link is broken. I'm not sure if it's because it's an OLE link or something else (OLE_LINK43').</p>

            I had a similar problem. I accidentally started a download for Windows 10 - tried it for a few days - hated it and went back to Windows 8. I could no longer open any Office apps. and can't re-install, repair, or un-install. I need WORD for our business
 and can't find any answers. I've called the "help"&nbsp;line and they ended the call when they thought I was all set. Very time consuming! If anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

</p><p>Have you restarted the computer between efforts to repair or uninstall?&nbsp; Sometimes an install/uninstall process hangs and blocks subsequent repair and uninstall attempts.&nbsp; Assuming you have restarted/rebooted and that you were using the control panel to
 do the uninstall,&nbsp; and you still have the problem have you tried to use the appropriate "fix it" tool to uninstall?

            <p>Cool.&nbsp; First time I've seen any mention of this type of problem with the uninstall "Fixit" tool. AFIK, the Fix it is written for a specific version of Office, so it is the "nuclear option". You run it and it nukes what ever pieces of office you aim it at.
<br />
</p>
<p>What version(s) of Office do you have installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I'd try is is click on the "Multiple copies of Office installed" link to see exactly what it says there.&nbsp; Also scroll down to see if there is more specific information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't get anything useful there, I'd go to control panel &gt; Programs and Features to see if you can find more than one copy of Office installed. You can uninstall from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you can use the manual method to uninstall Office:</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Mobile - Lumia 930 - Getting alternative Camera Backup Accounts in Pull-down Box</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 930 with Win 10 Mobile on it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Default Camera&gt;Related Settings (Manage OneDrive upload settings) you can get to "Camera upload." &nbsp;(How else can I get there, by the way?) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the "Camera backup account" I see my personal OneDrive in the selection box. &nbsp;As I understand it, it is not possible to set your phone up so that a Business OneDrive will become an option there. &nbsp;But is it possible to setup your phone so that another
 personal OneDrive will appear there? &nbsp;If so, how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were go get the Office 365 Home Premium for up to 5 users, could I get another user's OneDrive to appear there other than the personal OneDrive with which I am logged on, on the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also go to the Camera upload by going to the<strong> OneDrive</strong> app<strong>&gt; All Files&gt; Settings&gt; Camera upload.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding OneDrive for Business account or personal OneDrive account is also possible. To add your OneDrive account,

<p>go to the <strong>OneDrive </strong>app<strong>&gt;</strong><strong> All Files&gt; Settings&gt;</strong><strong>Accounts&gt; Add or remove accounts&gt; Add account.</strong></p>

</p><p>Yes, adding another user's OneDrive account other than your personal OneDrive account is also possible<strong>.</strong></p>

            <p>It is definitively not possible to add a OneDrive for Business account as a Camera Backup account. &nbsp;That has been reported elsewhere in this community forum and is my experience as well. &nbsp;I also am not able to get another personal account to appear other
 than the one that the phone is log-in as. &nbsp;Yet having a drop-down option box suggests that somehow some other account, other than the one that the phone is log-in as, ought to be able to be selected here, but what and how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much appreciate it if someone who really knows what is possible from either personal experience, or is an authority from Microsoft on this, to report here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much in advance,</p>

    <title>Hotmail&#47;Outlook junk filter not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orlaesmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail&#47;Outlook junk filter not working</h2>
                    I used to get TONS of spam emails, and so I've had my spam/junk box setting as 'exclusive' for a long time now and have never had a problem. However, recently I have been receiving some
<em>obvious</em> spam emails somehow bypassing the filter and going straight to my inbox. As I said, I tend to get a lot of these (they used to only appear in the junk folder) so now my inbox is filling up pretty quickly and I am not sure which emails are actually
 junk and which are legitimate. Please can someone help me, as this is very annoying especially when I need to scroll to find an email quickly.

<p>I just want to say I have had the same issue and same for my sister. Neither of us have made any changes to our accounts or to our devices but suddenly we have obvious spam/junk mail coming into our inboxes. This increase has been going on maybe close to
 two weeks now.</p>
<p>Please include me in helping how to sort this out as it is very frustrating.</p>

<p>I've been having the exact same issue since this spring. Outlook misses 98% of the most obvious junk e-mails in the world -- stuff coming from e-mail addresses that, no exaggeration, look like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>I reported this to Microsoft but it didn't get past tier one support. I'm unclear what happened, but there is effectively no junk filtering on my account. (Yes, I have it enabled and mark everything as junk, but that hasn't changed anything).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a few examples of obvious junk e-mail bypassing the filter.</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously? Whatever junk filtering solution Microsoft was using is clearly not working/degraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disappointing because I really liked my outlook.com e-mail service until now. Please fix this Microsoft! Happy to provide any diagnostic information needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone with a premium Outlook.com account tried the paid support to hopefully get this escalated? If you browse these forums, you can find a bunch of posts referencing this issue as of recently, but no official reply or fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be willing to pay for a year of service if I could actually get this sent/escalated to engineering.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. As a matter of fact, I've been having similar problems on and off since July 23, 2017. At that time it was the sweep rules that stopped functioning. Now it's a problem with junk mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I have to say that it's very, VERY annoying that your so-called tech support representatives CONSTANTLY push the problem back to customers. So, I'm advising you from the outset, do NOT ask me if I changed anything recently; I have not. Do NOT
 ask me if I set my junk mail parameters; I did and I know what I'm doing. Do NOT request that I perform unreasonable technical tests and perform investigative work to solve my own problem; THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAID TO DO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have MANY PEOPLE complaining and I have to wonder how many have the same issue but are not complaining. I see that you've had this ongoing issue dating back to at least 2015. Why, oh WHY can't you fix it and stop frustrating and annoying your customers?</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, yes it is a very poor service from Microsoft. Nothing they have suggested works and not only that it makes the situation worse, i.e. when I have put rules in place to stop unsavoury e mails coming through, I get even more!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a G Mail account, but I did not know you could set it up to check Outlook - could you give me more info on this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a poor answer from a so-called Microsoft representative. Going by the number of likes the original poster has received, it would seem this is not a one off issue on their part but more systemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been happening to me for the last week or so. Some spam is still managing to be filtered but all the spam that is still managing to get through, seems to be from the same domain. Even though the domain was blocked automatically after Outlook asked
 me and then when that didn't work, added by myself 'manually' to the block list, I'm still getting 4 or 5 spam emails from this address a day in my main inbox!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? We'd like a proper answer please not a cut and paste scripted one.

            Don't bother paying for their service. I'm paying and this will be the last year. I'm going back to Gmail or find another service. I'm getting hundreds of spam emails a day. To expect customers to individually create rules and open each email is absolutely
 ridiculous. Microsoft should take care of this problem. This happens fairly frequently. This should be a priority and obviously they aren't fixing the problem.

<p>Yeah, I've just given up on Hotmail entirely. Since the spam filters stopped working a year or so ago it's just not worth the hassle anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't turn the extra spam filter on it just lets malware/phishing stuff through all day every day, if you do turn it on it puts half your valid e-mails into the garbage. Either way is unacceptable. Sure, you can manually add every single address you
 want to be let through to your contacts, but who wants to deal with that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their two-factor authentication system is a joke too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been using it for almost 20 years, but it's just become so outdated and broken that it's not worth keeping anymore.&nbsp;</p>

            We need an actual screenshot of the email (including clickable links) to be sure but there are a couple of things you can check yourself.&nbsp; First legitimate emails have a green lock in the address bar, second when you mouse over any links they must clearly
 point to a ms site.&nbsp; Additionally if you are asked for personal information like DOB, passwords, etc it is a fake because Microsoft already has your info.<br />

If it turns out to be a scam you can report it here report_spam AT outlook.com

<div>I would like to send an email which has, in it's body, a file embedded in an image. I would like the recipient to open the email and see in the body a mid-size image with a preview of the contents of the file, and then, after double-clicking this image,
 he/she can open the actual file.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will provide you the details on how to embed a picture of the file in the body of the email can be accomplished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be accomplished if the file is placed in a location where both sender and the recipient can access it.</p>
<p>In order to show the content of the file as an image, you need to manually take a screenshot of the opened file and then paste it into the body of the emails.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> This image will not be real time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now right click on the image and click Hyperlink and choose the location of the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion provided is helpful.</p>

            <p>You can do this via the Object button on the Insert tab.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that it will not work for all document formats but a Word document should work. Also note that not all recipients will be able to receive it as intended but if they also use Outlook and are within the same Exchange organization, you shouldn't have any
 issues. As a final note, the object will be embedded within the message just like an attachments, it will not be a hyperlink to a storage location.</p>

<h2>            Adjacency, Black Tie and Other Themes from PowerPoint 2010</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />What do you do when you need Themes that were included in older versions of PowerPoint, such as PowerPoint 2010.
<br /><b>Details</b><br />PowerPoint 2010 included several Themes, most of which are not available in newer versions of PowerPoint -- so what do you do if you need a particular Theme from PowerPoint 2010 for a project or a study exercise?<br />
<br />
You can ask anyone who has PowerPoint 2010 to create a single slide presentation based on that Theme and send it to you. Alternatively, if you have PowerPoint 2010 installed on an older computer, you will find all Themes within this folder:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 2010\Document Themes 14<br />
<br />
Your location may differ if you installed Office 2010 on a drive other than your C drive. Your folder path may also differ if you did not choose to install Office 2010 to the default location.<br />
<br />
Either way, the Themes included within Office 2010 were:<br />
<br />
Adjacency<br />
Angles<br />
Apex<br />
Apothecary<br />
Aspect<br />
Austin<br />
Black Tie<br />
Civic&nbsp;<br />
Clarity<br />
Composite&nbsp;<br />
Concourse<br />
Couture<br />
Elemental<br />
Equity<br />
Essential<br />
Executive<br />
Flow<br />
Foundry<br />
Grid<br />
Hardcover<br />
Horizon<br />
Median<br />
Metro<br />
Module<br />
Newsprint<br />
Office Theme<br />
Opulent<br />
Oriel<br />
Origin<br />
Paper<br />
Perspective<br />
Pushpin<br />
Slipstream<br />
Solistice&nbsp;<br />
Technic&nbsp;<br />
Thatch<br />
Trek&nbsp;<br />
Urban&nbsp;<br />
Verve&nbsp;<br />
Waveform<br />
<br />
You can find out how these Themes look at this resource page: <a href="http://www.indezine.com/products/powerpoint/learn/themes/which-themes-are-installed.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><span>Gantt Charts in SharePoint is a view and contains lists. You can create many tasks and display them in one Gantt chart to easily analyze the project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dfa01fa-2c0f-49be-a359-8968932b0876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dfa01fa-2c0f-49be-a359-8968932b0876" /></a></p>
<p><span>So it is possible to merge them into one. The problem is we need to display in one Gantt Chart from multiple lists.</span></p>

<h2>            Edit entries in my Outlook address book</h2>
                    <p>How do I edit the entries in my address book?&nbsp;&nbsp; When my address book transferred from my previous email software to Outlook I ended up with entries that look like:</p>
<p>John Doe&nbsp;"John Doe" "John Doe" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>I would like to get rid of the redundancies.</p>
<p>And what can I get rid of?&nbsp; Can I just keep:&nbsp; John Doe &nbsp;(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp; and get rid of the stuff in " "&nbsp; and &lt; &gt; ?</p>

            <p>You may export Outlook contacts to Excel or .CSV format. Once the contacts are exported in Excel format, then you may edit and make changes to it. Before importing
 the contacts back into Outlook, make sure to take a backup of all contacts and then delete them in Outlook so that they do not create duplicates.</p>

<h2>            Cortana commands</h2>
                    <p>I've tried to do many things with Cortana, but stuff that's supposed to be answered just redirects to Bing. I have no idea how to solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Example from Microsoft itself: "What is the keyboard shortcut for paste?" Doesn't work. [Can't get Windows help!]</p>
<p>2. "How far is &lt;place&gt;?" Doesn't work.</p>
<p>3. Contacts search doesn't pull up contacts (I just search for the name).</p>
<p>4. "Navigate to &lt;place&gt;" doesn't work</p>
<p>5. "What can I say?" doesn't work. [Can't get Cortana help!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only very few things work. Not even the stuff in Cortana (beta) in Windows Phone 8.1 works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there not a feature parity between English (US) and English (UK) versions of Cortana? If not, isn't Cortana outside US (in the few locations it is available in) rather useless?</p>

            <p>Hello Spacm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue specific to one website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Please run this <strong>Microsoft fixit </strong>and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable </strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, then use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Sometimes, a website you're visiting doesn't look like you expect it to. Images might not appear, menus might be out of place, and text could be jumbled together. These can be caused by a compatibility problem between Internet explorer and the site you're on.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please use suggestions from this article and check the issue.<br />

</p><p>On this&nbsp;web page&nbsp;there is an icon in the address bar stating that "tracking protection has blocked content from 9 services on this site."&nbsp; However, I cannot unblock content.&nbsp; Could this be the source of the problem?</p>

            <p>That's Microsoft not giving a solution once again. You can't just make something up to make customers with issues go away. (<strong>site display problems with Compatibility View)Come on ....really?</strong></p>
<p>Did you even go to the webpage mentioned and see for yourself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is clearly the webpage. First they don't want you to opt out which is why it says sign in to opt out figuring after the guy spent 20 minutes trying to log in last time he will give up and not opt out.</p>
<p>You can say it ain't true but your only fooling yourself.</p>
<p>When you click sign in it magically changes to signed in.</p>
<p>Then it pulls this statement out of it's sleeve "Opt-out is currently unavailable, please try again later."</p>
<p>Really? opt-out is on a coffee break?</p>
<p>To top it off every time you click on anything on that page it auto changes the first question "Personalized ads in this browser" from NO to YES.</p>
<p>What a scam. You just want to track us to death and sell us junk....at any cost it appears.</p>

            <p>I have been having this same problem for over a week now. It is a simple problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go here:</p>
<p>http://choice.microsoft.com/en-gb/opt-out</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choice to turn off 'Personalised ads in this browser' is disabled. Clicking on it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Win7, Win8 and Vista and IE11, Firefox and Chrome. The problem is not with any of the many and various machines I have used, it's not a driver issue, it is - A TECHNICAL ISSUE WITH THE WEBPAGE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chatted with two Microsoft people via the webchat app and they both acknowledged that the fault lies with the website as they could not choose the 'off' option either. However, they then tried to fob me off with it being a 'pop-up blocker' issue which
 was wrong and the other person simply kept me waiting an hour and then closed the chat app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were a conspiracy theorist I would say that this is a sly way that Microsoft have used/abused so no one can opt out of personalised ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you Google "Personalised ads in this browser"&nbsp;it comes up with the link and underneath it says "<strong><span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">Opt-out is currently unavailable</span></strong>, please try again." This has been 'unavailable' for many, many days now
 and 'trying again' is pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This proves there is a fault or that the 'off' option has been deliberately turned off with no reason as to why or information as to when it will be enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone at Microsoft look into this urgently please as we should, by law, be able to choose what we see online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a simple 'browser issue'. This is a serious problem that need to be resolved.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac Preview - Cancel Meeting and Send Message to Participants&#63;</h2>
                    Am I just missing something? Is there no way to cancel a meeting and send a message to the participants? All I see is a cancel meeting button with no option to send an optional message to participants. This seems like such basic functionality for it not
 to be included. Thanks for the help!
