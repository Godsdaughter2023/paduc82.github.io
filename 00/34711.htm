<h2>            Headphone jack not working</h2>
                    I recently updated to the highly anticipated Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and unfortunately my headphone jack has stopped working. The headphones play fine in any other device, and my Dell XPS 13 laptop speakers work as well

<p>Hello Michael,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried other headphones, and they have yielded the same result. There is no error message, it acts like I haven't plugged in anything at all. When I used to plug in my headphones, it brought up a small window that that specified the audio source, i.e.,
 headphones, medium. After that, I confirmed OK, and the audio worked just fine every time. The only thing I could think of to do was check to see if there was an available driver update, but alas, I am all up to date, and now I'm stumped. Thank you for your
 time.<br />

    <title>Lock Screen Images and Previously Used Background Images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward m baker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock Screen Images and Previously Used Background Images</h2>
                    <p>2 Questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My lock screen shows a nice picture I'd like to save so that I can make it my background image and not just my lock screen image. I have checked the c:\windows\web folder but am unable to locate the image. Any idea where else the image might stored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I accidently deleted a picture I had previously used as a background image. When I go to Personalize, there is still a thumbnail image of the deleted photo and I have the ability to make that image my background. I would like to find that image so I can
 resave it to my personal folder and not just use it as my background image. I tried doing a screen shot and editing the photo but I am never able to get the same exact same photo or quality. Any idea where previously used personal background images are stored?
 Again, it is not found anywhere in the c:\windows\web folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Edward, to locate the Spotlight Images used on your PC
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, check the box marked "Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />Copy and paste this text into the address bar and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%/AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets
<br />
<br />In that folder you will see a lot of files with alphanumeric characters
<br />
<br />Copy these files into a new folder
<br />
<br />Change the file extension on each file to jpg so Windows recognises it as an image file . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />With regards to the deleted wallpaper background image
<br />
<br />You will find it in one of these locations:
<br />(copy and paste into address bar in File Explorer)
<br />
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\CachedFiles
<br />
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\TranscodedWallpaper

            Hi Edward.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here's How to Find Windows 10's Spotlight Lock Screen Pictures:  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/find-windows-10-lock-screen-pictures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/find-windows...</a>

<br />Here's Where to Find the Windows Wallpaper Location on Your PC:  <a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/windows-wallpaper-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/windows-wallpaper-...</a>
<br />
<br />A copy of the current wallpaper can be found by typing below path in Windows File Explorer address bar:
<br />
<br />Path 1 -
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\CachedFiles
<br />
<br />If you don’t find a copy of your current desktop background image here, try below path instead
<br />
<br />Path 2 -
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\TranscodedWallpaper
<br />
<br />Note: The file TranscodedWallpaper in Path 2 does not have a file extension. Use "Open With" or "How do you want to open this file?" dialogue box and select any image viewer, such as, "Windows Photo Viewer" or the "Photos" app)
<br />
<br />Note for Windows 10: The above locations have limitations. For example, if the wallpaper you’re looking for is no longer visible in the ‘Background’ tab in the Settings app, you can’t recover it. It will work for your last five wallpapers but nothing older. (Source)
<br />
<br />Default Windows wallpapers can be found in
<br />
<br />%SystemRoot%\Web
<br />
<br />You will see 3 folders
<br />
<br />    "4K" for 4K wallpapers,
<br />    "Screen" for lock screen backgrounds, &amp;
<br />    "Wallpapers" for Default Windows wallpapers
<br />
<br />Installed themes (Aero, etc):
<br />
<br />%SystemRoot%\Resources\Themes
<br />
<br />Per-user installed themes (including pre-installed from OEM):
<br />
<br />%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Don't forget to sample the fantastic background Themes at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes following the link to the Store where there are many more for free. 
<br />
<br />  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 installation of the additional memory.&nbsp; Is it preferable/essential only to install additional memory cards of the same size as the existing cards?</p>

<p>You mean 512MB and 256MB (not GB) I assume.</p>

<p>See Daave's reply, but also note the following two points:</p>
<p>1. You started out with 512MB. How much RAM you need for good<br />
performance is <strong>not</strong> a one-size-fits-all situation. You get good<br />
performance if the amount of RAM you have keeps you from using the<br />
page file significantly, and that depends on what apps you run. Most<br />
people running a typical range of business applications under XP find<br />
that somewhere around 512MB works well, others need more. Almost<br />
anyone will see poor performance with less than 256MB. Some people,<br />
particularly those doing things like editing large photographic<br />
images, can see a performance boost by adding even more than<br />
512MB--sometimes much more.</p>
<p>So unless you had special needs, it's likely that the 512MB you<br />
started with was enough for you.</p>
<p>2. You say "it had gotten terribly slow." That implies that the<br />
performance used to be OK, but had gotten worse. That reinforces what<br />
I said in point 1 above. You don't need more memory simply because<br />
time has gone by.</p>
<p>There are several possibilities for why it had gotten slower, but the<br />
most likely one is that you have become infected with malware. What<br />
anti-virus and anti-spyware programs do you run? Are they kept up to<br />
date?</p>

Hi vikingdatter<br />
<br />
Open <strong>Personalize</strong> / <strong>Screensaver</strong>.<br />
<br />
Select the <strong>Windows Live Photo Gallery</strong> screensaver.<br />
<br />
Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button.<br />
<br />
In the <strong>Use This Theme</strong> drop down menu, one of the options is <strong>
Black and White</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the <strong>Random</strong> option is set there, it will automatically switch to different themes and&nbsp;occasionally switch to the
<strong>Black and White</strong> theme.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer without any operating system and I tried to install the Win 10 Education. The process requires the input of the activation key at the beginning of the installation (since there is no operating system, it can't be skipped).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to activate Windows with my key it says 'The key cannot be verified. Please check your installation package.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the ISO file and the activation key are downloaded from the msdn webpage from a verified account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<h2>            PAYMENT OPTION NOT VALID&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I try and connect to xbox live, it says my payment option is not valid. So i go to account management and then select the card i want to use.&nbsp;<br />
Then im connect to xbox live until i go onto a game, or sometimes, I connect then disconnect and the problem starts again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So i went onto the xbox website and checked the details for my DEBIT card. (does it matter if its debit or credit?)<br />
anyway, I put in the security code and checked everything and clicked save.<br />
Then it said my card isnt valid and then says "please verify"..<br />
what do i do!?<br />
<br />
<br />
oh, and it also says im suspended due to a payment option!<br />
and i just remembered I bought Portal 2 from Steam, using the same debit card and Steam is completely legal.<br />
<br />
its getting annoying &gt;:C&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe that the system will not accept DEBIT cards. &nbsp;You need to use a CREDIT card, &nbsp;or you can</p>
<p>1. Go to &nbsp;a local game store or electronics store and purchase a subscription card with a code. &nbsp;You can use your debit card to pay for it there.</p>
<p>2. If you have the new update and have a paypal account, you can use paypal to make your payment.

<h2>            Windows 10 Keeps Rearranging my desktop Icons</h2>
                    <p>Why does Windows 10 (64 bit Home, Pre Installed), Very Recently, keep Rearranging my Desktop Icons ?, Even Though, I have Now been informed to turn my desktop “Auto Arrange” Off, And When I do, On reboot, it turns it Back On! Is this Down to a recent Windows
 Update? As I Have Not installed Any Third Party Software Recently!</p>

            That is a long time complaint about Windows.  The only sure way to do it is using a 3rd party tool.   Here are reviews of some of the tools. The one I like best is StarDock Fences, but I do happen to be using ICU at this time
<br />
<br />LOCK ICONS ON DESKTOP – LOCK DESKTOP – STARDOCK FENCES
<br />That is a fairly common question. Bottom line, MS does not have a feature that “locks” icons in place on the desktop. 
<br />PS: there is at least one feedback suggestion asking MS to this sort of functionality to Windows. Please upvote it and add your comment 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/Obr6l3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Obr6l3</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Icons all showing up on left side of screen can be caused by:
<br />.  *  right clic on desktop
<br />.  *  View command &gt; Auto Arrange option.   If it is on, turn it off
<br />
<br />If your icons stay in place where you put them, Auto Arrange is already turned off.
<br />
<br />They get re/dis-organized when Windows changes the screen resolution.  If it happens every time you start the computer it could be the result of the way Windows boots your computer and video system.  If Windows starts at a lower screen resolution, then later moves to higher resolution, then it is possible for Windows to dis-organize your icons.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this will happen when a new Windows Update is applied.
<br />
<br />You have to resort to 3rd party tools. I have used a couple myself and collected references to others that I have not tested. 
<br />
<br />My personal favorite was StarDock Fences. I used the free version, but I’m too broke/cheap to pay for the current version. Right now you can get it bundled with 3 other utilities for US$15 with this code: AYEQ-FSNV-CXID   (this worked in March 2018)

<br />I (Ron) tried V4.93 on Win 1709 on a 4K monitor. It didn’t work properly.  It didn’t save icon size or location. After trying a couple of refreshes, it messed up the icons. I had to refresh them.

<br />I (Ron) used the earlier free beta version of this tool and really liked it. 
<br />
<br />Win10 Start Menu itself.  If you think of the Start menu as a “desktop” you can use it that way.  You can arrange the icons on the start menu, select from 4 icon sizes and group icons and name the groups. It is just a &lt;win&gt; key flick away, so it is not as inconvienent as it sounds.

<br />DESKTOP ICONS POSITION AND FOLDER VIEW SETTINGS PROBLEM IN WINDOWS 10
<br /><a href="http://www.askvg.com/fix-desktop-icons-position-and-folder-view-settings-problem-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.askvg.com/fix-desktop-icons-position...</a> 
<br />If you put icons on Desktop in a certain order in Windows 10 and restart your computer, Windows 10 forgets the icons position and always puts the icons at the extreme left corner of the screen. Same thing happens with folder view settings. When a user changes a folder view to thumbnails, list, large icons, etc and closes Windows Explorer and then re-opens the same folder again, Windows 10 automatically changes the folder view to details.

<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />You don’t use your Start Menu much, do you? Besides the casual search for a program, most users don’t. Instead, it stays discretely nestled within the Windows UI never to meet its full potential. That is, until now! Read on to turn your Start Menu into a one-stop repository for almost anything you’d need to know from your PC.

<br />2. Folder and Program Organizer

<br />Windows 10 finally brought back the Start menu, and it’s more customizable than ever. Here’s a quick rundown of all the different ways that you can make the Start menu your own.

<br />2017 10 25- STOP WINDOWS 10 DESKTOP ICONS FROM CHANGING LOCATION AFTER A SCREEN REFRESH – DELETE PERSONAL ICONCACHE

<br />&lt;SNIP&gt;
<br />Do you like a personalized Windows 10 desktop with your shortcuts, files, and other items organized in a specific way? If so, you might have noticed they can change location when the screen is refreshed. For example, it tends to happen when you modify the screen resolution. It can be quite frustrating after organizing your desktop icons, only to have them disorganized when you connect a second display or refresh the screen. Here is how you can fix that.

Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

<p>So, IMO, you should first try to speak with your bank and see if they can get your money back.</p>
<p>And file a complaint at bbb.org.</p>

            Hi Angi03, try accessing the Windows Recovery Environment and see if you can access the Admin account form Safe Mode or even restore your PC to an earlier date . .. 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system doesn't have any Restore Point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, in the safe mode as well I can't access the admin account. The BSOD appears with same error. Hence, I'm unable to access the admin user files from any local account either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The priority is still to backup the admin user files. Any other suggestions are welcomed.</p>

            How old is the Printer? Sounds like it has been rendered obsolete by windows 10. The way they make printers nowadays. Your lucky to get 3-4 years service out of them.&nbsp;Time between updating my last three printers not because of parts availability, but because
 the electronics would not work with new system (couldn't accept new drivers) was three years for 1 one month and current expect 3 years max out of it.&nbsp;I am about a year and 1/2 into this current printer I use.&nbsp;And fully expect with another year and 1/2 to
 2 years and 1/2&nbsp;I'll have to purchase another Printer. &nbsp;In fact this printer I am using replaced a brand new one That I'd had one month and when new OS come out for computer it would no longer work and manufacturer&nbsp;<span>said
 Printer was end of useful life. Fortunately the store I bought from was nice enough to take back and received the one I have now. &nbsp;My first Inkjet printer even though it only used Black ink lasted 10 years. I ended up giving it away to someone that could still
 use it.&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Minimizing Windows in Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello all. I have a simple problem for which I'm sure there is an easy fix, but I can't find it. I cannot minimize a microsoft document or a website download so I cannot work with multiple windows concurrently. On the top right screen, the 'minus' sign
 works, as does the 'x', but the little window only wobbles the document; it does not create a smaller window. Is there a fix to this. Thak you :)

            It sounds like you might be in Tablet mode. Click on the Notifications at the end of the taskbar and click on the Tablet mode box, that should switch it off.<br />

<br />First check you are not in tablet mode.
<br />If not, try this

            Hi David
<br />
<br />Are you in Tablet Mode - on your Desktop, do you see Square tiles instead of Desktop icons?
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + A to open the Notification Bar 
<br />If you cannot see the Tablet Mode button, click 'Expand' 
<br />Then click the Tablet Mode button

<p>Hi again, all. Frustrating as the program still will not let me minimize a window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am definitely not in tablet mode, my desktop shows icons not square tiles, and nothing happens when I right click on the minimize/maximize top right button. I have launched all Microsoft updates and have re-booted. Ugh. Still wobbling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, I have two users on my computer: User #1 allows me to minimize documents and therefore work with multiple windows open, while User #2 does not. User #2 is my academic/research so I use it most frequently (without multiple windows!)</p>

            It may just so happen that the Restore Down is the same size as the Maximize, full screen. When you click on it does it change from the little double box to the single box (or vice versa)? You want the single box. Then move the mouse to the top or left
 or right edge and a little arrow should appear, hold down the left button and drag it to re-size the window.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Sleep Mode Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesgalarneault  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sleep Mode Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have been having issues with my machine for awhile now. I upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro (64 bit). &nbsp;I have a few issues with sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) When clicking the screen to wake the computer, the login credentials and password text box completely disappears. &nbsp;I have to hard shut down my PC in order to get it to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Or I have issues with Google Chrome opening new tabs or windows. I get the wait/kill option and after about 15 minutes the window will eventually open (after hitting the wait button a few times).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.) I cannot open task manager or CMD for admin. I will eventually get an error saying my PC cannot find the .lnk file for command prompt. &nbsp;Because of this I cannot run the 2 commands I have seen suggested as possible fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system reset to see if that would fix the issue and I had no luck on that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try and turning off the fast restart option to see if that might fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other options?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like you need technical support as there has to be serious issues. Check in Settings (BIOS/CMOS)<br />
as you boot up -- usually F2 - to see if the drive is recognized there and that it is 1st in the boot order.<br />
<br />
Not good news I am afraid,<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

    <title>Mouse not working after Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christiane ehrlich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse not working after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>I have recently run several Windows updates manually, as the automatic update does not work and I cannot fix the Problem. After the last update, my mouse stopped working, however the touchpad is functioning perfectly. First I thought the mouse (cable) was
 broken and I bought a new one. The new one does not work as well. I tried to plug the mouse into other USB ports, no success. So I ran Troubleshooter for Hardware and got the following error Messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ralink Bloototh PCIe Adapter has a Driver Problem ==&gt; not fixed</li><li>USB Input Device doesn't have a Driver ==&gt; not fixed</li><li>Hardware changes might not have been detected ==&gt; detected</li></ul>
<p>Might this be the reason for the mouse not working anymore? How to fix this? Please help! Thank you!</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide
 you with better assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh Kumar,</p>
<p>thank you so much for your advise! I have done my "homework" now, unfortunately the mouse is still not working :-(
</p>
<p>Here are my details:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>no, I am not getting any error Messages when connecting the mouse to the Computer</li><li>I checked the device drivers, the are updated.<br />
However, I have issues with Windows updates. The updater is not working automatically since quite a while, I tried but could not fix the Problem. This is why I am doing the updates manually in the following way: I go to Windows Updater, select "check for updates"
 and then search for the Downloads on the Microsoft Websites. When I chose to start updates directly in Windows Updater, the process gets stuck at Status "preparing to install". In general the manual updates work, with some exceptions. These are:<br />
KB2267602 =&gt; there are 5 files to download, file 1: already installed, file 2 -5: not appplicable on this Computer<br />
KB2976978 =&gt; there are 6 files to download, file 2-6: already installed on this Computer<br />
KB3003667 =&gt; 3 files to download, all 3 already installed on this Computer<br />
KB3035583 =&gt; 3 files to download, all already installed on this Computer<br />
KB3123862 =&gt; leads to KB2919355, 6 files to download, all already installed on this Computer<br />
KB3119142 =&gt; no file found to download<br />
KB3001652 =&gt; no file found to download<br />
Optional updates:<br />
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.3 - AMD Radeon HD 7310 Graphics ==&gt; no file found to download<br />
HP - other Hardware - HP Wireless Button Driver ==&gt; no file found to download<br />
KB2976978 =&gt; no file found to download<br />
KB3013769 =&gt; already installed on this Computer<br />
===&gt;all These updates Pop up in Windows updater again and again, after run the function "check for updates".<br />
===&gt; could it be, that they are only partly install? This question Comes to my mind, after I tried to install an quite new update, KB2267602, recently from the Windows Updater, but had to cancel, as it was again stuck in "preparing to install". If this is true,
 what can I do to install those updates completely?<br />
<br />
</li><li>Yes I have tried to pug in the mouse at all other USB ports, but the mouse did not work.<br />
=&gt; The other USB ports are working properly, I have the Printer and the Internet stick connected there<br />
=&gt; I also connected the Printer to the USB port where I usually plug in the mouse. The Printer worked.<br />
===&gt; so this does to me definitely look like an Hardware issue.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I don't think I am logged in as Administrator. However when I want to do so, I am not asked for a Password.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Now let me tell you what happend when I executed Method 1 to 3, as you advised:<br />
<br />
Method 1:<br />
I got a message: "Reinstall Ralink Bluetooth PCIe Adapter". <br />
I applied the fix, but the Problem could not be solved. Message: "Ralink PCIe Adapter has a Driver Problem".<br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
I checked all Drivers SW was up to date for all of them. I deleted and reinstalled the Drivers.<br />
==&gt; still no Change, mouse not working<br />
==&gt; maybe it is interesting to mention, that in the device Manager, under "Mice and other pointing devices" there is only the touchpad visible, no mouse, though the mouse is plugged in.<br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
Done, however I did not know what to do with 6. "Battery - select disabled" There is no "disabled", there are various Options on how the Laptop should react, when the battery gets low.
<br />
==&gt; I rarely work on battery, my Laptop is connected power most of the time.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for this Long mail and lots of issues. Please can you help me again to get my mouse up and running again?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and best regards!</p>

            <p>I also tried Method 1, but got an error message that MS was unable to download the necessary components. I tried this on two different computers, using both the HD and USB drives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that after doing a Windows Update on my laptop with Windows 8.1, the Logitech M185 mouse will not work. Windows won't recognize the USB radio or the drivers and insists on installing generic "USB Receiver" drivers from Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried Method 2, but as noted, Windows insists on installing the generic drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 isn't applicable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also contacted Logitech tech support, but their first response was for me to try everything in Method 2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions or can someone fix Mr Fix It so that it downloads?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Windows updates are still not working automatically. This includes now also the Microsoft Office updates :-(. Updates show up, but automatic installation always fails.
</p>
<p>On top I an now receiving constant notifications on the task bar, that Windows wants to install something, a few minutes later another message that something went wrong. This appears continuosly every 20 minutes when logged in. It is there since I switched
 to Windows 10. It is an issue with the German and English language pack. I managed to install the English one, but the German one still fails.</p>
<p>I contacted the technical support because if it some days ago. The number of the call is 1363417737. A lady was trying to help me, got deep into my system, several rebooting, at the end the notebook came back with an screen unknown to me asking me to log
 in as a different user. Internet connection was not possible under this screen.</p>
<p>Another colleague tried to help me to get back to my own screen, but the notebook got completely frozen. He told me to contact a local technician. I contacted the company where I bought the notebook. They solved the problem within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>I can now work with the notebook again, but still the issue with the automatic updates is unresolved.</p>
<p>My only way to get updates regularly is through the vulnerability scanner of my McAffee software. There I can see the updates and download them. I am not sure if I can really get all updates this way. Also it is a pretty time consuming exercise to download
 manually.</p>
<p>The lady from Microsoft technical support who helped me first said it could be, that my notebook is not available for Windows 10. I will now check this with the producer. However I have doubts, as the issue with automatic updates already exists since Windows
 8.1. The notebook was delivered with Windows 8 preinstalled.</p>
<p>I will let you know as soon as I have an answer from the producer of the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards!</p>
<p>Christiane</p>

            <p>Please see below the response from the producer of my notebook. So incompatibility with Windows 10 is not the problem. I will now bring the notebook to a local technician. Maybe Windows needs to be set up completely new .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, please could you let me know, if my notebook Compaq CQ58, Product # 5CB2362TXC is compatible with Windows 8.1. and Windows 10? The automatic updates of Windwos do not work, always fail. I spoke to the Microsoft technical support and they could not
 help. They said the reason might be that the notebook is not compatible and I need to check this with the producer of the notebook. I bought the notebook with Windows 8 on it. The problem appeared first under Windows 8.1 and continues under Windows 10. I am
 using Windows 10 home, 64 bit. Thanks for help and best regards!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Same problem" as Christiane here, after updating to Windows Update 1703, but since my mouse isn't working, and I have tried several brands and types of mouses (both bluetooth, wired and using Logitech unifying tech.), but they all show that they are connected,
 but they simply do not work. (Thus this message has to be written from another computer :-) ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g. the Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse, which is very simple, but always works when other mouses don't. I have tried removing all USB "controllers" and "hubs" from the laptop. But when reinstalled, the same issue occurs. It is difficult to give details
 on the problem since manoevering is made rather difficult due to the missing mouse.</p>
<p>
