<p>Hi DnStudios,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing is wrong with your Windows Update, you might try re-registering the</p>
<p>Windows Defender DLLs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Command Prompt (admin) by selecting start and type CMD.</p>
<p>Select "Run as Administrator" and you will go to the command prompt screen</p>
<p>Type the following items, one at a time, and press enter after each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regsvr32 wuaueng.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 wucltui.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 softpub.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 wintrust.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 initpki.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 wups.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 wuweb.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 atl.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 mssip32.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Regsvr32 wuapi.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>Exit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to access Windows Defender again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,&nbsp; Glen</p>

<p>Hi DnStudios,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that you still have your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not mention whether or not you tried MalwareBytes . You should do that</p>
<p>at least, for one more test to identify malware. Your description of unusual activity on your internet suggests that there may be some. You can download a</p>
<p>trial version at <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.malwarebytes.com/trial/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you said the activity occurred even though Windows Update was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
off</span>.</p>
<p>Windows Defender is dependent upon Windows Update in order to function. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into Windows Update in "settings" and select "view update history". Scroll down to "Definitions" and open that. If you do&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> find that the topmost definition is at a fairly recent date, Windows Update is
 not functioning, and neither will Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen shot of your failure indicates that you are missing the "service" for Windows Defender. When you checked for, and tried to start&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that</span> service as you indicated earlier, was the service named "Windows
 Defender Service" or "Security Center"? If it was "Windows Defender Service", your W10 OS is down level.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on start and type "winver". Open "Winver" and you will see your W10 version number. At this late date, if it is not v1809 there is something wrong.</p>
<p>You have either&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">delayed</span> the implementation v1809, or some incompatibility to</p>
<p>your hardware exists, or your Windows Update program is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program is not working, try using the "Windows Update Troubleshooter"</p>
<p>in settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot. Allow it to fix any problem</p>
<p>that it finds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,&nbsp; Glen</p>

            <p><span>Hello George,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur if the Windows Update database is corrupted or third-party application conflict. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;What is the model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Which security software are you using?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What is the build version of the installed Windows 10 Insider Preview?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Notes: </span></em></strong></p>
<p><em><span>1. Disconnect all the external devices connected except mouse and keyboard.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>2. To&nbsp;boot the computer through&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10 installation disc, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included
 with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>3. Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>4. If you don't have Windows 10 installation disk then y</em></span><em>ou may
<strong>download Windows 10 ISO file and burn it on a DVD to create a bootable media</strong> from a different working computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Refer the link:</span></em></p>
<p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-create-an-installation-dvd-or-usb-for-build/94ed9bb0-e638-4d7e-9678-7f45c8666013%20?OCID=WIP_r_Apr_Body_Wiki"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How
 to create an Installation DVD or USB for build 10074 - Multiple Language downloads now available</span></a></span></span></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Perform an Automatic Repair</strong> through&nbsp;Windows 10 installation disk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so,&nbsp;follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you don’t see the message, you might
 need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>b. If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. In the<strong> Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d.&nbsp;Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>". Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span> </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the automatic repair doesn’t work, then&nbsp;<strong>perform System Restore</strong>, please restore the computer to the date when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><span>1. Boot the computer using Windows 10 installation media.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. In the “<strong>Windows Setup</strong>” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Click on “<strong>Repair your computer</strong>” from the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. From the “Choose an option screen”, click on “<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Click “<strong>Advanced Options</strong>” in the “<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>” screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. In the “Advanced Options” screen, select “<strong>System Restore</strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. Follow the on screen instructions to restore the computer to an earlier state when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8. Now check if you are able to boot the computer successfully.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em>&nbsp;</strong><em>The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers
 and also reset the recently changed settings on the computer.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>

                    I want to print out a powerpoint presentation that has 3 slides per page, but i want to remove the blank notes next to it because they annoy me. I cant find a way to do it and the only suggestions i have read are different because they are suited to earlier
 Microsoft powerpoint programs. Is there a way i can do it on the 2011 model?

<p>If you are ambitious, you could make something similar for the Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The automation process could be something like this: Save the presentation as pictures (that's already a built-in feature), then import 3 pictures per slide into a new presentation using a custom slide layout.</p>

            There are two products that you might consider taking a look at to see if they help meet your needs. With full-disclosure, I am the author of both and they are products that you license from my company.
<div><br />
<div>The first is called <a href="http://www.greatcirclelearning.com/ppt-publisher-mac_convert-powerpoint-to-word-on-a-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ppt-Publisher</a> and its purpose is to replace the standard Print Handouts/Notes function of PowerPoint. It gives you more layout choices. Maybe there is one that better fits your needs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other product is called <a href="http://greatcirclelearning.com/leaderguide/elements/pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LGPro Elements</a>. It purpose is to build professional looking Facilitator/Speaker or Participant guidebooks/handouts quickly and efficiently. It will produce documents from PowerPoint and even Key Note or any type of image file supported by Microsoft Office
 for that matter. The documents are formatted as two or three column tables. PowerPoint slides and their corresponding notes can sit side by side in the same table row.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Both products are Free to download and try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

    <title>My Mail goes into a Blackhole - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmalcom  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Mail goes into a Blackhole</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I acquired a brand new server with four IPs. But my newsletter never reaches the recipients' inbox. Knowing that I have never used this server, although, the delieverabilty team informed me that this IPs are not qualified for mitigation. The problem
 is that I don't get any error messages telling me that this IP is blocked or bounced. In the contrary, it says that all of my mail was successfully delivered. But in reality, not a single message made it to somebody's inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW COME THAT NOBODY RECEIVED MY NEWSLETTER BUT THEY ARE STILL MARKED AS SPAM?! SO WHO REPORTED THEM AS UNWANTED?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not qualifying them for mitigation automatically means that they are blocked by Hotmail. So how did these messages got to these "users" who marked them as unwanted?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 100% that all of my mail is blackholed. But at least, they should identify the problem and find me a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This case raises many exclamation marks in my head!</p>

<h2>            How can someone track my computer activity and access&#47;read outgoing emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This subject may not be one for the Microsoft community but hopefully someone can recognize the problem and provide a solution. By way of explanation, I know that someone is tracking me when I'm on my computer and then sends me spoof emails or makes spoof
 phone calls. I know for a fact that the person can receive or access my emails which are not sent to him/her because they will send me a spoof email or phone call on my land line immediately upon me accessing my computer. Moreover, I know that he/she has obtained
 my cell phone no., which is known to only a few people, because several weeks ago I gave my cell no. to another party via email. In that same email I also provided the&nbsp; phone no. of another party and that other party is now receiving spoof phone calls. I have
 also received several spoof calls on my cell phone. By spoof phone call I mean my phone rings and displays UNKNOWN NAME&nbsp; and a garbled&nbsp; phone no. Sometimes I have checked the displayed phone no. on the internet and it is valid, however, it is a name with which
 I am not familiar. The bully is obviously displaying valid phone numbers at times probably expecting that I will call the party. On the few occasions that I picked up the phone there was no one on the other end of the line. I know these calls are not from
 telemarketers. Over the past year I have perhaps received over 300 of these phone calls. I called my ISP who also provides my landline phone service and they are unable to trace the origin of the phone calls or emails.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the bully has hacked into my computer because I have not noticed any apparent changes to files or other behavior which would indicate any malicious intent. However, he/she is likely tracking me by some type of program or GPS tracker which
 allows him to read and/or receive emails which are not intended for him/her.&nbsp; Moreover, he/she also knows when I'm on my PC and can likely monitor my computer activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In fact, he/she is likely watching me author this narrative.<br />
<br />
I have McAfee anti-virus installed as well as Windows Defender so I feel I'm protected, however, he/she is somehow monitoring my computer activity. On several occasions I have changed my IP address and the bully still can monitor my computer activity.
<br />
<br />
My OS is Windows 10 and I use Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
Can someone in this knowledgeable community provide some suggestions and/or a solution to this problem?&nbsp; Is there something amiss in my settings? Should I look for type of program that has been installed through an unsuspecting email or other method of implant?
 Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have likely not posted this message in the correct category, however, I could not find a security category.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey Elmer,
<br />
<br />Short answer: they can't. What you do online these days are encrypted in transmission, and there can't be a man in the middle to see it (unless if the site you use in question is not HTTPS or through a secure transport server). The calls? Everybody gets a call from an unknown caller, could be a cold caller like a scammer or someone who wants to try to solicit business from you.
<br />
<br />Basically the only way for them to track your e-mails is if they have your account details, which they shouldn't. But to add to a piece of mind, consider adding two-step authentication which when you add a password, you also need your smartphone to also generate a code for you to enter, so it's unique to you only.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps a bit -- good luck in your situation.

<p>Hi Ethan. I thank you for your reply however the spoof phone calls are coming over my land line with only the occasional one over my cell phone.&nbsp; Moreover, I know how to recognize a cold call or a spammer as they at least may utter a word, but in all the
 spoof calls I receive whenever I answer one there is complete silence.&nbsp; Moreover, I can get as many as 2 to 4 calls a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insofar as your stating that no one can track my on line activities due to encryption, is it coincidence that on the day I sent an email to my phone provider and included lists of past incoming spoof calls, the calls stopped about a day thereafter.&nbsp; However,
 about 10 days later when my service provider replied by email that they could not trace the origin of the calls, the spoof calls then resumed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that this reply feature does not allow for attachments as I would otherwise send you handwritten records of the spoof phone calls that I have recorded during July and August. Can you trust me enough to provide me your personal email address
 which would enable me to attach copies of those handwritten phone records? If you can't provide an email address due to privacy or security concerns I will understand.&nbsp;</p>

            Elmer,
<br />
<br />Believe me, I get these spoof calls on a daily basis as well, using the first 6 digits of my phone number, even one that uses +40 as a country code (the first two digits of my area code) and they do a *horrible* job of it. Best I do is ignore it... but then again to be fair I don't get them as frequently as you do probably.
<br />
<br />I would be bold as to say it might as well have been a coincidence. These kind of calls can come and go.
<br />
<br />Respectfully I would have to say no on the e-mail, but going forward maybe you could change your phone number to deter the spoofing behavior, perform your usual online activities, and see if this behavior persists?

<p>Hi Ethan,</p>
<p>I respect your reluctance to share your email address and do not want to appear argumentative but changing my phone no. is not an option after 31 years. For illustration purposes I will show what displayed on some of the incoming spoof calls I have received
 and not one of those calls displayed my phone number. Here are some examples:</p>

            Elmer,
<br />
<br />I appreciate that -- thank you. Also I understand, it is a significant move to change your phone number and it's not without its complications.
<br />
<br />That being said, scam calls are indeed a nuisance. I'd like to reinforce that they really have no way of tracking your activity online and that their calling versus e-mails you've sent are mutually exclusive, so to that end you should be at peace there.
<br />
<br />What I do in this case is if you get a call from the same area code and exchange (for example 678-359-XXXX) or an erroneous international call, ignore it. It's annoying and difficult to manage calls like that, but you are not alone in this. Since this is a landline service you're using, it may be harder to manage and curb these calls as opposed to a smartphone, but see if your provider has options to do that, you never know.
<br />
<br />Anyway I hope this helps, please let me know if you have any additional concerns and I'd be happy to assist further.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure you can track login history to see if someone is actually loging into your mail account, if it's gmail/office 365 mail account.</p>
<p>Your mobile phone number can be leaked from a website, when you bought something or added your details to receive newsletters etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of my friends also receive phone calls from random people, mostly companies that are trying to sell stuff through the phone.</p>
<p>When you buy a simcard sometimes this number is already used by a person before you, i know some providers use this method, to disable and resell the numbers like a provider named lyca for example. If you won't top up for 3 months your number wil be disabled
 and resold to someone els as a new simcard..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend to fully wipe your computer and reinstall to make sure there are no keylogger malware, that tracks all windows activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is some usefull information for you.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi Gold,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In most case there is no way to some one to spy about your computer without your involve. Be able to some one to spy on you, you must firstly accidently install any harmful software that support to the spy party or you must enter your
 email address, phone number and password on a unsafe website/application or you must set some website permission on your browser<span>(like pop up or notification permissions)<span>/</span></span> in your email account to monitor you</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So to be safe, stay away from unsafe websites and applications. Don't click on any massage that prompt to you without reading them. Also you must use a firewall and a internet security. Check
 your security software to know whether it has internet security and firewall capabilities.(Normally McAfee has these things).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; As you are a McAfee consumer you can contact McAfee customer care to check your pc's safety by security experts from this link&nbsp;<a href="https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp?_adf.ctrl-state=yny6kjyzz_4&amp;_afrLoop=133998338925851#!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp?_adf.ctrl-state=yny6kjyzz_4&amp;_afrLoop=133998338925851#!</a></p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After securing your computer change all of passwords of your accounts and enable two step authentication. Also your internet service provider and telephone subscription provider must be able to protect you from those
 scammers. Please inform about this to local authorities. However as now they had your information they can call you and send emails as they want. So the only way to stop this these scammers is they must be captured by the police. You can report about this
 thing to Federal communication commission and get to know about robocalls from this link

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also you can blacklist these phone numbers &amp; set your email software to automatically backlist these unwanted spam mails.&nbsp; Don't answer for those calls or open emails from scammers. Just delete them. Maybe they left you after
 they considered that they lost your attention.</p>

<p>Barb,</p>
<p>Unlike a small handful of truly unfortunate individuals with stalkers or malicious ex-whatevers, the scammers simply don't or won't take the time to spy on those they attack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is simple, it doesn't make them any money and so they'd be better off to just move on to the next thousand fake calls or popup messages, which result in the next 10 who take the bait and the one whom actually gives them the money, access or other
 personal information they're looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is that of the literally millions of such calls daily, only a small percentage actually answer and a much smaller group pay, but since the robocalls are automated and the scammers typically give up quickly on those who don't seem to be fooled,
 the time spent on the few who do is still worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why the many calls a day are to be expected, since literally hundreds of such scam call centers are operating out of countries all over the world, all trying to access the same rich fools in the US and a few other developed countries where the level
 of wealth far exceeds the mental acuity of many of their citizens, whether due to age or other factors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this is rocket science, it's relatively simple computer science, but since only a small percentage of US or other developed countries' population are trained in computer technology, it's relatively easy to trick most people into doing things they
 know they shouldn't if they'd just stop and think for a few seconds.&nbsp; I know, I did some of this professionally for businesses at all levels from small banks to large defense contractors and could often get even bank presidents or other important&nbsp;individuals
 to give up information they never should, all with mostly simple false emails,&nbsp;web pages, and follow-up telephone calls to numbers found online or that they provided themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I mentioned being paranoid, it's a two edged sword, since it's always good to be paranoid that someone may be out to get you in this worldwide malicious environment because they definitely are.&nbsp; The only thing though is that it's typically not for
 the reason(s) that the individual might think and more often it's simply for the money or other information that can easily be turned into cash as well.</p>

    <title>Mailbox 100&#37; Full - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> severseike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mailbox 100&#37; Full</h2>
                    <p>I have an msn email account. I am no longer able to send or receive emails due to my mailbox being 100% full (15GB of 15 GB). I have gone through and deleted emails. I have then gone to empty the deleted and junk folders, but they do not empty. I also need
 to keep changing the setting to keep my inbox all one and not two (focus and other). Is there a step that I am leaving out?</p>

<h2>            Change payment option for transaction</h2>
                    I have just changed bank. I made a purchase on my old credit card. It went through but the payment could not be completed, probably because my old account was closed right there. I now have an outstanding payment on a credit card that's no longer valid
 so I want to change payment method for this purchase, but there is no way to do ithat. My account will be closed as long as I have this outstanding payment (less than 1 Euro).

                    will nokia release any new update for c5 to improve browser and time changing bug. Are we going to get anything above 71.005 . It is said that nokia is changing its phones from symbian to 'nokia belle' tag line. Can c5 expect the same or has the company
 removed c5 from any further improvement list.

            It certainly won't be getting belle, that is a touch only operating system. The C5-00 runs the old pre-touch operating system, S60v3FP2.<br />
<br />
No one here can tell you if Nokia has any plans to release any further updates for the C5-00. It's a case of waiting and hoping.

            <p>Hi Charlene,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming you mean the upgrade (as opposed to a simple update of definitions)&nbsp;for MSE - bringing you to the current production release with all the current definitions.&nbsp; If it's just updating definitions, there's probably a simpler solution (though this
 will work) and you should post back and explain the situation along with the version of MSE you are using.&nbsp; To find out, open MSE and click the down arrow next to Help and click About.&nbsp; Copy the contents and paste them to your reply.&nbsp; It'll look something
 like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Essentials Version: 4.0.1526.0</p>
<p>Antimalware Client Version: 4.0.1526.0</p>
<p>Engine Version: 1.1.8704.0</p>
<p>Antivirus definition: 1.135.1351.0</p>
<p>Antispyware definition: 1.135.1351.0</p>
<p>Network Inspection System Engine Version: 2.0.8001.0</p>
<p>Network Inspection System Definition Version: 11.159.0.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Otherwise (or if you want to do a clean refresh in any case), start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a><span>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.This means not only current ones but any EVER
 (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<b>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a
 scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</b></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the PC and
 like any battery can eventually run down).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now we've confirmed you're pretty much ready for MSE (or, here, uninstalling and re-installing MSE).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>
 or try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a><span> If a normal uninstall does not work,&nbsp;you may need to focus more on the manual procedures in the first link or the
 second link with the Mr. Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</span></a><span>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this
 listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product. You cannot just uninstall these programs - you MUST also use the removal tool - even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn't use a removal tool at the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span> and click on more languages and versions and then
 choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and
 then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is
 as safe as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine
 and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining
 the infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full ESET online scan:</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.
 This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the assisted support or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>********************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If that doesn't work, the preferred support path is via this entry point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you choose assisted support, you will be given the choices available for your region. Further MSE assisted support in the US and Canada is no longer available. It *<strong>is</strong>* still available in many other regions of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If other support is not available to you, post back with as much information as possible about what happened at every step along the way and how you are trying to do this and where you are now stuck and any error messages and/or
 codes word-for-word (especially any that look like 0x80077064 or some other alpha-numeric code) and we'll see if we can figure it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since this is a new phone, you can go ahead and upgrade the phone's software to Windows 10. Then set up your Microsoft account in order to have your contacts and photos. For apps, you have to reinstall it from the Store app. Make sure that you've backed up
 your music through OneDrive or PC with your old phone so that you can still have them on your new phone.
<br />
<br />
We're always here to assist you with your Windows Phone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>9860 install restarting on 9841 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cintra2  say:</h3>
<h2>            9860 install restarting on 9841</h2>
                    <p>I have tried the 9860 Preview Install a number of times, but it simply goes through a few minutes of action, I restart it when asked, and it reboots to 9841.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I am restoring a pre-9860 image, and may try downloading 9860 again in case my download was faulty in some odd way, but my real question is whether or not I will be able to (attempt to) upgrade from 9841 to a future build?</p>
<p>

            <p>Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 10 build 9841 first.</p>
<p>Make sure you have full administrative privileges</p>
<p>If you are connected to a domain, switch to a local account</p>
<p>Disable your Antivirus utility before attempting the upgrade</p>
<p>Do a clean boot and try again</p>
<p>Close all open programs and make sure that PC Settings is the active window while the download completes, I notice if you switch to something else, the download will time out and fail</p>
<p>If you are updating over Wi-Fi, try switching to a Wired Connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 9860 is optional, so, yes, you will be able to upgrade a build after 9860 from 9841.

<p>
</p><p>I restored the T91MT ok from Macrium, and today downloaded 9860 from a wired connection OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took about 30 minutes spinning on "Installing the new Preview build" before getting to the Restart Now window, just as I started to type this post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to Restart, and it looks a lot better than the previous attempts, ie it has reached Setting up 19%, so I'm crossing my fingers it will complete OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this tells me is that the original 9860 download over wifi must have been faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Edit this with the final result.</p>

            Hi Sarah,<br />
<br />
We got your concern. You can install Windows 8 on your Lenovo Ideapad 6, however you need to purchase a licence key for Windows 8 since your device was pre-installed with Windows 10. To troubleshoot Edge or other Windows apps, kindly run the troubleshooter
 from this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a>. Another browser that you can use is Internet Explorer. It's pre-installed in you device and all you have to do is type Internet Explorer in Cortana.
<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<h2>            Right Click disabled in Excel published on Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an excel 2010 file, which has pivot tables and pivot charts, published on Sharepoint 2010. When I open in web, I am able to use slicer, change data and even referesh data from sql query. However, right click is disabled and I am not able to see menu
 on right click. I have admin permission, so I don't think there is any issue with user permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I download file to open in excel 2010 on desktop, every thing works perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to get is fixed so that people can right click (to select "Show Details" in pivot tables)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Torey,<br />
<br />
We can access Video portal by access the following site collection in SharePoint Admin.<br />
https://<strong>contoso</strong>.sharepoint.com/portals/hub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or access one video channel by access: </p>
<p>https://<strong>contoso</strong>.sharepoint.com/portals/<strong>channel name</strong><br />
Please check if you can access these two links. <br />
<br />
Also, please help confirm the following information to narrow down the issue:<br />
<br />
1. A screenshot regarding <strong>“The page does not open”</strong>. Is there any error message?<br />
2. Which browser are you using? Please try another browser to check the outcome, e.g. Chrome.<br />
3. Do any other users in your organization have the same issue?<br />
4. Do other apps in Office 365 portal have the same issue?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda<br />

            <p>Hi Torey,<br />
<br />
Please perform the following steps and share the results with us at your convenience:<br />
<br />
1. Contact your IT admin and let him refer to the <strong>Office 365 Video </strong>
section in the following link to connect to the required endpoints for Office 365 Video.<br />
 address ranges</a></span><br />
<br />
2. If possible, can you try another network to check the outcome?<br />
<br />
3. When you click OneDrive tile or other app tiles in Office 365 portal, can you access successfully?</p>

<h2>            Office 365 icon shortcut extention filename got chagned</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 icon shortcut filenames are changed from Word.lnk to Word2016.lnk ?
</p>
<p>We have observed that on some machines when we install Office 365 Pro Plus it creates shortcuts with names i.e. Word, Excel, Power Point in start menu.</p>
<p>However on some of machines it creates shortcuts with 2016 appended in the name. i.e. Word 2016, Excel 2016, Power Point 2016, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Target file for in both the scenarios same and same application is being used for installation.</p>

<p>Hi Veersen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tested in our end but failed to repro this behavior. Could you please try to rename the application to see the outcome? The following are the detailed steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right click the Start menu tile/item you wish to rename.
</span></li><li><span>C</span><span>lick More</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>Open file location</span><span>, t</span><span>his will open the Start
 menu folder</span><span> conatins the shortcuts for all the menu items.</span></li><li><span>Then you can rename the application shortcuts. For example, rename "Word 2016" to "Word".
</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Migrating data&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosalinebara8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating data&#33;</h2>
                    <p>The Windows phone, I think people will agree, is frustrating to use with the way settings are hidden (and hard to find).
</p>
<p>I have been using said phone for a year now. Not once, have I received an update of 'migrating data', been told about it in the introductory leaflet, located it in 'my settings' (despite the usual exploring a phone user will do to understand their new phone),
 or shown to me during the step-through of personalising my settings on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 12am, I was awoken by my screen, which had turned itself on (despite 'Quiet hours' being activated, with no chances of call-throughs...etc), that turned itself from 'darkest' to 'brightest'! I daren't sleep until I knew what this was- when the cog symbol
 eventually disappeared (which was long in itself), the progress bar then came up. What was written under the progress bar wasn't much to explain why it was happening, until I could use my phone again to search 'Migrating data' up, I thought it might hacking!
 I was thinking 'Where is it being migrated to?'</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main concern and critisism is that I didn't have the option to give permission for this transfer to happen, or delay it for a reasonable time. But the second concern would easily dealt with if any&nbsp; 'hidden' updates and settings like these were gone through
 when first using the phone, if not in the introductory leaflet. Nothing should be left hidden! And please, explain in full as to why you wish to do this update, and what it means- two lines is not enough!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>And why is it so difficult to contact Windows for complaints? I don't want to download an app! What if I don't have space for it, and I haven't always got complaints; it's an unnecessary use of space on my phone! I don't want to call or contact a
 'online agent' who do not represent the company itself. It is not the individual who I have complaints against. I want to write my ideas in full in an email which I know will be received and be replied to!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>And what the hell is up with abandoning your customers that they can't access apps that are avaliable on Andriod (and Google)- most organisations like uni's use Andriod to provide an easy way to access maps and timetables. Yet, despite the whole point
 of a smart phone is to access apps too, I can't do that! The lack of avaliability and efficiency of apps (excluding yours) in your app store makes me think that there shouldn't be Microsoft/Windows app store at all!</em></p>
<p><strong>If you've made a product, you follow it through! And if customers by your products, then you should make it easier for us to contact you- I'm even giving free 'critisim' to improve your phones!</strong></p>

<p>Assuming you have the cd</p>
<p>1) buy an external cd drive</p>

            <p>Interesting question! I did a Google search and found quite a few irrelevant hits, but at least one that seems on target:

<p>I'm sure it will make some difference if you're entering narrative text into Memo fields, versus selecting individual values from (say) a combo box.</p>
