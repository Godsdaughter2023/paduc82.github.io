<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having problems connecting to a hidden network. I am a student and I live in a students residence, where only hidden network is availible. When I write name of the network, and then username and password it says that spot is not in reach. Although it
 works perfectly on my Omnia 7 (windows phone 7.5) with the same settings (only thing I cant set is certificate stuff which is not neccesary)...and I have full signal...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise connecting to visible network works perfect...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read of some similar problems, but couldn't find any solution...</p>

            you will have to check with your student's residence as to what wireless network protocols they are using. it should work, but if it is an ad-hoc network, then Windows Phone 8 doesn't support connecting to these types of networks (and a lot of newer Androids
 and other platforms don't either).

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
We are having the same problem. Our Nokia Lumia 920 just can't connect to a Wifi network with a hidden SSID. We've already downloaded the latest updates from "Phone Update" under System Settings. The phone just won't connect to the hidden Wifi network.<br />
<br />
Any hints please?!?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
regards.</p>

<p>I just discovered this issue yesterday on my Nokia 928 as well.&nbsp; I have successfully conntected my Nokia 928 to my WIFI daily when it is broadcasting its SSID name.&nbsp; However, if I turn off the SSID broadcast&nbsp;to hidden while phone is still connected&nbsp;(same
 SSID name) it loses the connection and will not reconnect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I switch it to broadcast the SSID name it automatically scans and then reconnects.&nbsp; You would think that since it already succesfully connected when the SSID was broadcasting that it would not lose the connection when it is switched to hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure seems like a bug...not sure if its in&nbsp;Nokia's or&nbsp;Microsoft's court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it works when ssid is broadcast then hardware is fine so issue is probably with software so Microsoft. I am however surprised in this day and age people are still hiding ssid's and router manufacturers persist in including this option on their products.
 From personal experience, it offers very little, if any additional security but potentially causes connectivity problems. Perhaps the solution here is to get the router manufacturers to remove what is an unnecessary option which pretends to be something it
 isn't.&nbsp;</p>

            Security is like having a locking front door, locks can be defeated and there are more than one entry point in any environment unless you live in a missle silo.<br />
<br />
That is why I like to use "layers of security" to make it as tough as possible on any hacker looking to infiltrate my network. My modem's firewall is set to "high", my modem is also set to "stealth" mode, I use "MAC address" filtering restriction, I also set
 hours of operation so at night it is not accessable AND yes I do prefer to use a hidden SSID as well and other security measures...<br />
<br />
Most criminals are looking for an easy target. My job is to not to be an easy target. If my neighbors want to use a modem set to factory defaults that is fine, they become the easy prey.<br />
<br />
Hidden SSID's are very common, regardless of how much security they provide, Nokia/Microsoft needs to fix this. This is the first time I have ever had a device drop a connection and then refuse to connect because an already established connection's SSID was
 toggled to hidden. I am very surprised this was not caught by either company's Product Test Dept. prior to release.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, yep my SSID will have to be broadcast and I lose a small layer of security because I now own a Nokia 928.

            Hiding the SSID is still a useful level of security. Why should router manufacturers dumb down their product to suit WP8? The solution is not to drop it just because WP8 doesn't support it but to pester Microsoft to put another basic feature in.<br />

<p>Anyone who could potentially hack your router or indeed most others who are not capable of doing so already know how to locate hidden ssid's. At best it is no better than locking your front door and leaving the keys under the mat. However, I do agree that,
 if it is available, then the option should be there to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best bet is to contact Microsoft regarding this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK, so here is what I discovered:&nbsp; If your phone is connected to a wireless modem with a
<strong>broadcast SSID</strong> and you change it to <strong>non-broadcast (hidden)</strong> and then go into Settings&gt;Wifi&gt;Advanced and try to add the same SSID name that is now non-broadcast it says:&nbsp; "<strong>Network Already Exists</strong>" and it
<strong>WILL NOT</strong> let you add it since it already has that name registered in the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you must then <strong>DELETE the SSID</strong> name and then <strong>Re-Enter same SSID</strong> name of the now hidden SSID, plus you must also
<strong>Re-Enter your secure password</strong> for WEP/WPA or whatever you use.&nbsp; Then it connects and lists the Known Network as: "<strong>secure, hidden</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have&nbsp;never connected to a hidden wifi SSID to begin with you must manually add the name under the "Advanced" menu by hitting the + and providing the pertinent info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, it says that "<strong>using hidden networks will decrease battery life</strong>" which seems strange since you must provide the proper SSID name in order for the phone to locate it just as if it were not hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did contact Microsoft and log an enhancement request to change the way they handle hidden SSID's on WP 8 as it seems quite silly to have to go through this routine when changing an already&nbsp;known SSID to hidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps others when dealing with non-broadcast (hidden) SSID WiFi.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 auto-complete not in sync with the server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hal_sc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 auto-complete not in sync with the server</h2>
                    <p>So here is my problem. I believe that auto-complete entries are supposed to be stored on the server now since Exchange 2010, and also with Office 365/Exchange Online. However, the auto-complete list is unique on individual PCs, and OWA, when connected to
 the same mailbox. I have the following behaviour for 2 different accounts on 2 different 365 tenants:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Outlook 2016 on a PC - send an email to a recipient, is remembered in auto-complete.</p>
<p>2. Address is not available using auto-complete in OWA. Send an email using OWA, recipient is saved in OWA auto-complete ONLY. Not available in Outlook.</p>
<p>3. Setup Outlook 2016 on another PC, some addresses are available (so synced from server) but latest ones are not. Again, can add addresses but they are not synced with either the other PC or OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, all 3 clients appear to have a few common auto-complete entries, but otherwise addresses are only available to the unique client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not correct behaviour. Please don't tell me this is an Outlook issue and to post there, because I don't have the same issue with on premise Exchange.</p>

            Hi Bobdonkey,<br />
<br />
The auto-complete list in Outlook is not shared with OWA and another PC. You can import AutoComplete list to another computer. Here is one article for your reference:

<p>There isn't a one size fits all answer for this, as the coding will be different in order to correctly copy all of the formatting from the original shape. From where I sit, you probably need to first copy the shape over, and then go through the FillFormat
 methods and match the copied shape to the original manually. Matching RGB values is fairly simple, but matching gradient settings and other advanced options is a little more difficult. This becomes even more sticky if you are importing from Excel. I don't
 work with graphs and tables that often, so I can't offer any example code. I did see some examples in the Object Model Reference under FillFormat for matching Gradient Fill settings between shapes, so that might be a place to start.</p>
<p>In the end you're probably going to have to manually reference the values from the original shape and match them to your newly copied shape. I could be wrong though, so don't take this as the final answer.</p>

<p>A lot, though not all, of the tedious format copying can be done with:</p>
<p>OriginalShape.PickUp</p>
<p>DuplicateShape.Apply</p>
<p>(This is the VBA equivalent of using the format painter)</p>

 row "A2" and insert them in the "Comments" in cell "A3".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal would be to try to find a way to this like so,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By having Excel know that when ever it sees the following set of characters like so "%FirstName%" it would know I want the data from cell "A1". Then if I go down a row it would know that when it sees&nbsp;&nbsp;"%FirstName%" if would autmaically know that I want to
 populate what ever is in cell "B1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example comment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>%FirstName% %LastName% was a great student in class today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in this example I would want Excel to know that %FirstName% means the students first name in cell "A1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusion. My First Names are in column "A" and Last Names are in column "B" and Comments are in column "C".So for example "A1" would be a first name as well as "A2" and so on. I would just like to create a personal string in the work sheet
 so that Excel knows whenever it sees %FirstName% it knows to put the first name of that student that's in that row..</p>

                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've following situation:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm using Office 365 I can't<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">send</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>any
 emails through Outlook from my Home Network<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">anymore</span></strong>. When I checked my IP, I found that it is blacklisted at several servers. I don't have a static
 IP. I called my provider and asked for a static IP, but they wouldn't guarantee that it's not blacklisted, as well. Bad customer service here in Turkey :)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But&nbsp;ironically a friend of mine changed my settings some weeks ago and I was able to send emails again. Unfortunately, I had to re-install office and all my
 settings were gone. So I can't send emails anymore and I can't contact my friend as he's somewhere in the backlands of Australia :)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've tried all variations of setups at my Internet Email Settings, but it wouldn't work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have POP accounts and my setup looks like this (works perfect at my office)</span></p>

<h2>            Excel on Android &#34;Update Available&#34; stuck in a loop.</h2>
                    <p>Not sure this has come up before, sorry if it has.</p>
<p>I've just bought a Lenovo Tab 4 8 with Android 7.1.1.</p>
<p>It came installed with MS office.</p>
<p>I've used Word, and that's fine, but when I open Excel it advised there was an update.</p>
<p>This I carried out.</p>
<p>Now every time I open Excel a pop-up box appears with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Update Available</p>
<p>Show information about the new update?</p>
<p>Ignore Show"</p>
<p>If I select show it says:</p>
<p>"Excel</p>
<p>Version ()</p>
<p>01.01.1970 - 0.00 MB</p>
<p>Update"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a load of Newest Version info.</p>
<p>If I update it goes into a loading screen and goes through the update process followed by another pop-up about doing the update etc.
</p>
<p>If I "install"</p>
<p>it goes through the install screen and tells me:</p>
<p>App installed"&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a big tick above it.</p>
<p>I can then hit Done or open.</p>
<p>When I next open Excel it goes back to the original "Update available" pop-up.</p>
<p>I've cleared all data for Excel and the cache, but i still get the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Rick.</p>

<p>Since you can't open Excel, please open Word and go to the Word menu and choose About Word. Verify you have version 16.14.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other version, then install updates to fix this problem.</p>
<span>Here’s how to install updates:</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates for these programs if you have them.

<p>Hi </p>

<p><br />
Here are some more solutions:</p>
<p>The calling phone number may not match with a contact name and the name is not shown in the following situations when an incoming call or SMS arrives:</p>
<p>The contact is defined twice in the Contacts application (e.g. if both Phone memory and SIM memory contacts have been selected to be displayed in Contacts settings and the same contact is found in both of them).
<br />
The same phone number is defined for two or more contacts. <br />
The phone number in Contacts application is in different format than the number received in the incoming call. The phone number may have been stored in local format while the incoming call number is in international format (including country prefix), or vice
 versa. The number may not be properly matched with a contact name in this situation, depending on the device variant and the length of the calling number. In order to verify the correct format of the contact phone number (local or international), check the
 number which is shown when the call is received and edit the contact details accordingly.
<br />
If the problem persists, make sure your Nokia device is running the latest software. For downloads and assistance, go to your local Nokia website.</p>

<p>I hope this clears it.</p>

<p>Is there any more feedback on this problem? &nbsp;My girlfriend just bought a Nokia C3 and she is having the exact same issue described in this thread. &nbsp;Names don't display when people call her, only numbers. &nbsp;I tried all of the things suggested on this thread

<p>it can be this thing. when you save a number in phonebook it might be without the country code, like here in Pakistan we save it simply as &lt;0333&gt;, this is without the country code. while when i recieve any call it shows the name, while the number is "with"
 the country code i.e &lt;+92333&gt;. my operator treats both as same, might be possible yours treats them differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this. save one contact with the country code prefix, and then ask them to call you, see if their name appears now. if it does, you'll have to edit all the contacts and put in the country code.</p>

<h3> gingerish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 8800 problems with Firmware v 3.60</h2>
                    Hi this is my first post and i was wondering what problems anyone has had with firmware version 3.60 on the nokia 8800, i belive this to be the most upto date software version for the phone.<br />
<br />
My problems are listed below:<br />
* Noise from the speaker when a video is used as a screensaver, or a background.<br />
* Normal handset speaker quiet (its just had a brand new one fitted)<br />
* Phone freezes every now and again<br />
* The Thumbnail pictures for the .m3g type of file (used on the animated screensaves) are messed up<br />
* Memory size reduced, so much for 64MB (i know some of this gets taken up by the phones software)<br />
<br />
If anyone else has anymore gripes about this version of software for the phone please do add your own post below, please note my phone is a sim-free version without any network customisation

            The latest 8800 firmware is 3.78 as of October last. Although some bugs are fixed others remain (the phone still crashes, sometimes randomly..)<br />
<br />
You can get a Nokia Service Centre to upgrade your firmware, a list of approved agents can be found at<br />
<br />
http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,,77483,00.html<br />
<br />
but i'm not sure how much this will help.

<br />Are you running Office on a PC, not a Mac?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Open a new document in any Office Application, go to File - Account
<br />
<br />What is the exact Office licence you are using?
<br />
<br />If that is one of the Office 365 subscriptions:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager, on the processes tab, find that open Office Application
<br />
<br />Right click that and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />
<br />From the resulting File Explorer window, find MSPUB, right click that and choose 'Send To - Desktop (create Shortcut'

    <title>Notes vs. Active Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zal_kindi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notes vs. Active Notes</h2>
                    I have been struggling to synchronize my Outlook notes with my E90 for the past week. PC Sync seemed to go through the sync process but the notes still don't sync in that they do not transfer from PC-to-Phone or vice versa. I found out today that the "Notes"
 which start by pressing the "Notes" button are apparently not the same as the "Active Notes" which are part of QuickOffice. It turns out that the Active Notes are the ones that actually Sync with Outlook; not "Notes". Confused? So am I! Why are there 2 types
 of notes? or am I missing something here? Thanks.

            Active notes is new application, 'old' notes comes with the platform (included to S60)<br />
<br />
In active notes there are features like insert multimadia, view note for call etc. Basically nothing to do with text notes.<br />
<br />
So Notes provides compatibility to older devices,<br />
<br />
Active Notes provides new features / new application<br />
<br />
Why old note is not upgraded? Well. Don't know. Maybe active notes should be called 'Multimedia message editor' but that would be a bit long name..

            Outlook does not support multimedia notes I think. So no would be the first answer.<br />

Outlook does not support multimedia notes I think. So no would be the first answer.<br />

Well. I think it's not useless when you can get multimedia to html format. At least great for me ;)<br />
<br />
I can't think even in PC simple way to create html notes those can include multimedia. It's simple, easy to use and can do quite much with it. Html is good and general for long period (not like doc. And again, txt is just txt. Not supporting nothing else.)<br />
<br />
Compared to doc, html has better linking and nicer usability with multimedia. When I've worked with doc types, just nothing seems to go like planned.. All formats etc are hidden.<br />
<br />
Again, also thumbnails are created automatically with active notes. I just love it ;) (well, maybe a bit too strong word for this..)

;) You are right !<br />
<br />
HTML documents are really usefull, but the main problem is NO SYNC with PC '( !<br />
<br />
Notes (active or not) are more easy to edit/review on a PC.<br />
Having it synchronized, as "old notes" are, is a must, not a "nice to have".<br />
<br />
This is also, for me, one of the most interresting part of a PDA/Smartphone/... on which you can create a draft document, finaliizing it on a PC and reviewing it back on your pda/...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is not possible :(<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Qwest may have only branded it with their name or there may be some sort of added feature which<br />
leads to their site and possibly their provided email. Its possible, though very unlikely, that Qwest<br />
has done something to cause IE8 to not function as expected. The normal customization in IE and<br />
add-ons should still be available so you can set it up to work as you could the non-branded IE.<br />
<br />
You can change the branding back to Microsoft if you wish.<br />
<br />
The "Title Bar" can be changed to anything you would like it to say such as :<br />
<br />
"Customized for gbbay" or anything you wish.</p>

            <p>No, you will not have to reinstall your programs. Windows 10 is a full install and supports in place upgrades from Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>

            HI Chantele,
<br />I am in Independent Advisor in this community helping where I can, a user such as yourself. 
<br />If you emails are coming into your JunkMail folder and not your inbox that is a problem.
<br /><a href="https://support.teamsideline.com/hc/en-us/articles/208531146-Emails-are-going-to-junk-folder-not-inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.teamsideline.com/hc/en-us/artic...</a>
<br />
<br />Junk Mail folder is a default folder in Outlook with the sole purpose of placing the below type of emails. If you have personal emails going into Junk Mail please redefine them as not Junk and move them to another folder. 
<br />-Spoofing, in general, is a fraudulent or malicious practice in which communication is sent from an unknown source disguised as a source known to the receiver. Spoofing is most prevalent in communication mechanisms that lack a high level of security. 
<br />- Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.
<br />- Spamming is unwanted emails from companies. 
<br />
<br />Emails in the Deleted Items and Junk E-mail folders are only kept at least for 10 days within these folders then deleted. Emails in these folders are emptied regularly by Outlook.com servers. This folder is doing what it should be doing it is used to store unwanted and unsolicited advertising or promotional material emails. Hence why they are deleted, for most these emails are unwanted and they do not even want to see them in their JunkMail folder. 
<br />
<br />If you would like to keep emails that are in your junk mail folder you need to create another folder and move your emails there.

            Just an update to what Isamis2 said: the duration for items in the Junk Email folder is now 30 days, not 10. The fact that they will be removed from Junk Email after some period of time, however, still stands and is clearly stated when you look in the
 Junk Email folder. So, Microsoft is not deleting them without your permission. You are explicitly telling Microsoft it is OK to delete them by leaving them in the Junk Email folder.

<h2>            Pubisher 2010 send page as email &#40;HTML code&#41; does not keep formatting when earlier versions did</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to send a Publisher 2010 page as an email (not multiple pages, as attachment, or PDF) and when I send a test, the formatting is all messed up (text boxes broken or no color or photos) and fonts look really bad even though they are standard (Times
 New Roman) web-ready fonts. We test sending to addresses with various providers (AOL, Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, etc) to see how it will look. Each different address domain/provider shows the email differently even though it has been converted to an HTML format.
 Why the differences? We did not have this problem with Publisher before we upgraded to 2010 with Windows 7 platform. How can we fix this problem. I have spent days trying to figure out a way to make it work (because it did before)! Please find a resolution.
</p>
<p>Converting to a PDF is a bad option because all the hyperlinks die. The great thing with the html as email was that I could have hyperlinks all through the newsletter. Earlier versions did fine, so I know MS can fix this, right?</p>

            <p>I don't think MS looks at it as a 'weakness' as the changes made were for increased security reasons. That is why lots of people run their email clients in 'text only' mode and/or don't load images in email. Both the images and the html code can hide viruses
 and malware. So no I don't think they plan on making the changes you want to see.</p>

            <p>The problem with sending a publication in HTML is exactly what you encountered. Different email clients will interpret the code in different ways. Also the html coding engine in Outlook has been changed with each version of Office and is likely your culprit,
 not Publisher.</p>
<p>You can deconstruct your email message to the most basic plain text information with no formatting&nbsp;until the message works in all email clients.&nbsp;Then add design and formatting elements one at a time, testing as you go to find out what works and what breaks
 the message. </p>
<p>Some things that can break a message:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Tips and troubleshooting for sending a publication page as an e-mail message (2003):</div>
<div><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/HP010390591033.aspx?pid=CH062524821033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/HP010390591033.aspx?pid=CH062524821033</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By the way, hyperlinks do survive the conversion to pdf files if you use the Office PDF add-in to create your pdf file, or at least that has been my experience.&nbsp;Most free&nbsp;3rd party pdf tools such as primopdf do not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom line if you want your newsletters, flyers, messages&nbsp;etc to be consistently delivered with the formatting and designs intact you should use PDFs.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I found this particular discussion on the EW forum relevant to this issue of sending html formatted email messages:
<a href="http://social.expression.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/web/thread/fc614838-5c8a-43e6-8055-9369a935a259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are committed to html formatted email, you might want to consider constantcontact or some other more specialized software.</div>

    <title>Outlook.com, Aliases Issues and Privacy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glange01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com, Aliases Issues and Privacy</h2>
                    <b>Outlook.com and especially the Alias function is BROKEN!</b><br />
<br />
I switched over to Outlook.com in the early days because...<br />
<ol>
<li>I really liked the interface.&nbsp; Clean, simple, no nonsense.&nbsp; Still do</li><li>Connecting separate accounts was easy and you could switch back and forth in a second</li><li>The "concept" of alias accounts sounded appealing, since I MUST (for various business and security reasons) use several email addresses</li></ol>
<p>Let me state now and to be clear.&nbsp; for MOST people....the entire point of having and using another email address is to send and receive email FROM ANOTHER EMAIL ACCOUNT.&nbsp; The reasons are many (separating professional from personal, extra security, protecting
 your primary and device connected accts, etc)&nbsp; and in the end, don't matter.&nbsp; To make this work, the other email addresses must display their own name (of the owners choosing), and absolutely must appear to the receiver as actually coming from that address.&nbsp;
 THESE ARE BASICS AND REQUIREMENTS!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook.com is broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>All alias accounts are displayed with the name associated with the primary account.&nbsp; WRONG!&nbsp; This should be my choice and changeable<br />
</li><li>All alias accounts should appear and be sent to the receiver by the email address I'm sending it from, regardless of the software or app I'm using.&nbsp; I discovered this by accident when my business emails were getting all screwed around...&nbsp; Any and all alias
 email I sent using a mobile device (android or iPhone), a different email application (I tested many of the most popular), or even my PC Outlook....all are actually sent by your primary (or default) email address.</li></ul>
I'm a mobile person and on the go constantly...I require to be able to send email from a specific email addresses from my devices, regardless of the device or email application I choose.&nbsp; The ONLY email app that worked correctly was the "official" outlook.com
 app...but I DON'T WANT separate apps for all my email, AND the outlook.com app on Android is extremely buggy, crashes constantly (in the middle of writing long replies).&nbsp; In short, the app is a failure too.<br />
And the fact that Microsoft's own software, my PC Outlook can't send correctly either makes me laugh.<br />
<ul>
<li>Microsoft eliminated attached or connected accounts.&nbsp; Some lame excuse about increased security, which in IT terms means..."we found a problem and aren't going to spend any time or resources finding a fix other than turning things off".&nbsp; Without this easy
 "switch" between accounts (on a PC), it makes handling different actual accounts a pain.&nbsp; And to add insult to injury...when you "log Out" of you account, the landing page DOESN'T HAVE A LOG IN FUNCTION.&nbsp; Just a "sign up".&nbsp; You have to go "back" in the browser
 or use a bookmark, whatever...to go back to a log-in screen.&nbsp; <br />
</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly...the "official" outlook.com mobile apps will let you connect or log in to multiple outlook.com accounts at once.&nbsp; Since it shuts down at using (or soon after) the security reasons weren't a problem, but the original security issue of needing
 each account to sign in periodically should be a simple fix.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've also noticed lately that the information provided up front about options, functions, and services has become very scarce...for example, there is nothing mentioned or stated in ANY of the support information online or when setting up/managing alias accounts,
 that mail sent from a device will be "sent" via the default email address.&nbsp; This is only mentioned in a completely different setting for managing all accounts; at the bottom when you are asked to set a "default" address.&nbsp; I read that to mean...the address
 that pops up automatically when I compose new mail, not that I was actually SENDING from that address.&nbsp; In fact, much of the Help and Support has become over-simplified and in most cases, incomplete.<br />
</p>
<br />
As I started this message with, there are basic requirements that many people want and need, including myself.&nbsp; I want and need them for:<br />
<ul>
<li>Business reasons</li><li>Separating personal from business, keeping different life roles in check</li><li><b>Most importantly...my own security and privacy</b>.&nbsp; I can't manage my privacy and online security without email I have control over<br />
</li></ul>
<p>I have always been a Microsoft fan in the past and I really wanted these new services, applications, and interfaces to work and be successful.&nbsp; I still do.&nbsp; But until Microsoft addresses these issues, or even begins to acknowledge them...instead of the very
 heavy-handed "do it our way" approach of late, I find myself looking elsewhere.&nbsp; I'll be keeping the primary account for now, because switching everything is problematic, but outlook.com is no longer my primary email of choice.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't expect (nor desire) any "official" response from anyone at Microsoft or a moderator.&nbsp; My simple hope is that SOMEONE up there reads this, understands it and sparks some change.&nbsp; I doubt it, but I remain hopeful.</p>
<p>I don't really care if anyone else responds either.&nbsp; If you disagree with anything, that's your business and your opinion doesn't influence me.&nbsp; If you are enraged...get a life and leave me out of it.&nbsp;
<b>If you agree and have had the same thoughts or issues...then repeat this or any other message, as often as you can wherever you can.&nbsp; Change and improvements are possible if we relentlessly keep asking</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Ciao<br />

            I am aware an Alias is not officially a MS account, but the word account is relatively appropriate to explain what I mean.&nbsp; Additionally...in the outlook.com settings, you find your Aliases (along with other email accounts) under the "Manage your Accounts"
 section.&nbsp; Even Microsoft must consider an Alias as a "type" of account.&nbsp; Just semantics.<br />
<br />
If you read the post carefully...I was referring to the connecting of different outlook.com and hotmail accounts and the simple switching between accounts as the app/service used to do.&nbsp; Eliminating that was another issue but compounds the overall problem with
 the service.<br />

            I agree totally.&nbsp; I am so bummed that Microsoft has taken away the functionality that was more or less working, and substituted something that does not and apparently cannot meet my needs.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; If you leave Outlook, what are your options as to another
 e-mail provider?<br />

            I second your point of view <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d551804a-e57c-44a2-b06d-93e8fbb5b9ad">
glange01</a>. I have been banging my head to find a way of using outlook.com alias over iPhone. My Hotmail account is synced using "Exchange." I can receive emails sent to my alias but I can't reply them using same alias from iPhone. I have tried all possible
 workarounds such as adding as IMAP account or POP3 account which allow me to choose my alias while sending email but recipient receives that email from my default address not the alias.<br />
<br />
My nature of business requires me to use alias for different projects and my default email is used for my personal communication which is currently messed up all together. In addition to that, i added few email addresses from my domains via POP3 to outlook.com
 and i can't send emails using those addresses from my phone unless they are added separately as POP3 accounts on phone.<br />
<br />
If i can send emails from my alias and other email addresses using outlook.com website why is this functionality not allowed with "Exchange" or IMAP. I regret to leave hotmail services as i was a part of it since 1997 but Gmail is allowing far better features
 for both these issues.<br />
<br />
I have to migrate my accounts to Gmail which are configured using IMAP over my iPhone and emails can be replied using appropriate alias except for my outlook.com alias which I think I have to let go for better.<br />
<br />
Get a life Microsoft!! Current market is user driven. Don't impose. Listen to your customers and solve their issues. Be creative and&nbsp; be innovative to address these issues else you will loose your loyal customers soon.<br />

            Apart from Push functionality, Gmail is offering variety of services with far less hassle. If you require emails to be pushed to your device as soon they arrive, using Gmail App can solve your issue.<br />
For substitution of Outlook Alias feature, I am using Gmail Accounts forwarded to my main Gmail account using IMAP and other domain accounts using POP3. Everything is working smooth.<br />

    <title>Office 2013 Home and Business - Adding Publisher 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2013 Home and Business - Adding Publisher 2013</h2>
                    Recently we purchased Office 2013 Home and Business for a new PC - it's been installed and working fine for more than a month.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The user of the PC has since decided that she needs Publisher 2013 as well - we have purchased a license for publisher however when attempting to install publisher it gets to the point of entering the key - which I did - and then it tells me 'this product
 key is for Microsoft Publisher 2013 - install this product instead' - I'm unable to proceed past this point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did click on 'install instead' however this completely breaks all of the other office products (outlook in particular stops working all together). &nbsp;And I had to re-install office to get back to the point where the user could work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I go about adding publisher into the install?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            <p>x86 is 32-bit and isn't a misprint as it is the proper way to indicate a 32-bit processor. x64 is 64-bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The one you need depends on which bitness of Office 2013 you have installed.<br />
File-&gt; Office Account-&gt; About Microsoft Outlook should tell you directly after the version number at the top.</p>

<h2>            CELL&#40;&#34;filename&#34;,&#36;A&#36;1&#41; giving SharePoint reference on a local file stored locally in a folder that is OneDrive synced</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit hard to explain but hopefully the Title makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel file I am working on that is stored in a folder locally that is also synced to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a time, CELL("filename",$A$1) was giving a local reference e.g. C:\reporting\ etc. but it suddenly (perhaps after after a Save Copy) now refers to something like https://companyname.sharepoint.com/personal/user/documents/ - this is whilst the Excel file
 is still open. I can understand why it might refer to the OneDrive web URL but there doesn't seem to be any control over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to get it to refer to the local file path? It is breaking my import due to relative file path (rather than absolute) and is now trying to import something like "https://companyname.sharepoint.com/personal/user/documents/subdir\file.xlsx"
 instead of "C:\reporting\subdir\file.xlsx".</p>
<p />

<p>Hi ChocFactory,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been having this issue sporadically, I can't work out why sometimes it would show the "directory address" and other times the URL, with a seemingly random pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you get to the bottom of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
