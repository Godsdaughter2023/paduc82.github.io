<h2>            Outlook 2010 draft e-mail message disappeared&#47;missing - I found it &#40;the next day&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook Office Professional Plus 2010.&nbsp; In <strong>Options | Mail</strong> settings,&nbsp;items which have not been sent are set&nbsp;to Auto Save to the Drafts folder every 1&nbsp;minute.</p>
<p>Last night (4/9/14), I drafted a message; literally for hours in an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;perfect it prior to sending.</p>
<p>I went to an Inbox to check for new messages and when I attempted to go back to the&nbsp;draft message, it was gone.&nbsp; The draft was nowhere to be found.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It was&nbsp;not in Drafts, not in Sent, not in Deleted, not in Recover Deleted, not in any other folder that exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching for about 25 minutes, I&nbsp;went home for the day.&nbsp; This morning I started searching Microsoft.com for answers, but mostly found additional complaints of this same issue happening to others with no solution.&nbsp; The majority of explanations provided
 by the experts were just as&nbsp;frustrating as losing the message, because it seemed that they were not reading the complaints fully to understand that...NO the message was not manually deleted, NO the message was not manually sent, YES the message was saved in
 Drafts, YES the Sent, Deleted, Recover Deleted folders were searched, YES other folders were searched as well and this saved draft message was still simply missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one expert response, I did note the suggestion to search using Advanced Find, although others experiencing this same issue did this without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to conduct an Advanced Find as well.&nbsp; My search criteria was very broad in scope (<strong>Look for:</strong> ANY type of&nbsp;Outlook item,
<strong>In:</strong> subject and note fields, <strong>Sent to:</strong> used only&nbsp;one recipient's e-mail address (because I knew that I had not sent many messages to that specific person).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SUCCESS!</strong>&nbsp; The Advanced Find search located the lost draft message.&nbsp; Strangely, the results stated that&nbsp;the draft&nbsp;was in the Sent folder and was sent @ 7:37PM which is around the time that the message went missing.&nbsp; When I double-checked
 the Sent folder;&nbsp;the message was still NOT in that folder.&nbsp; There was no message with a Sent time stamp of 7:37PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to the Advanced Find results and double-clicked on the 'sent' draft message to open it and promptly copied the contents into a blank Word document for safe-keeping and then forwarded the 'sent' the message to myself for good measure.&nbsp; I&nbsp;asked
 my co-workers&nbsp;if they received this message that was 'sent' from me last night and no one had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have performed the Advanced Find search again&nbsp;and the row showing that the message was sent @ 7:37PM is no longer in the results.&nbsp; One would think that if it was truly sent&nbsp;@ 7:37PM, the Advanced Find record&nbsp;would still exist (regardless if I forwarded
 it to myself the next day).&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be two Sent records, one from yesterday @ 7:37 and one from this morning when I forwarded it to myself...very strange behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what Outlook did or how at one point the Advanced Find results show that it was sent @ 7:37PM.&nbsp; There was never a record&nbsp;@ 7:37PM&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Sent folder, the recipients of this 7:37PM message did not receive it and when the same Advanced Find search
 is performed again, the 'sent' message is no longer in the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever occurred, I feel fortunate to have located the message after the 'normal' searches failed to produce it.&nbsp; Perhaps, I was lucky but I hope that documenting this series of events&nbsp;might assist someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to anyone that has a saved e-mail &nbsp;draft disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind regards, jb</p>

<p>So grateful for this suggestion (why didn't it come from Microsoft) -- this just saved me hours of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, through Advanced Find I was also able to learn the root cause -- I could see internal sync resolution reports that revealed there was a sync problem between the server and my laptop, with the decision in each case that the "Remote" copy of the
 message was the "winner" -- the result being that my local copy was not being updated to the server copy of "Drafts."&nbsp;&nbsp; My computer ran out of battery power and when I restarted it synced with the server and placed in the Drafts folderan old pre-sync-problem
 version.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Advanced Find, I "Looked" for "Any Type of Outlook Item" and simply sorted the results by time, and there it was -- the much newer -synced version.

            Do you know if you hit Enter at any point? I remember hitting enter to create a hard return and suddenly the mail was gone and nothing was in the Drafts folder. After reading your post I checked my Sent folder and there were all the drafts that had mysteriously
 disappeared. I must have triggered 'Send' when pressing the Enter button. I'm careful now to press Shift + Enter when creating a hard return in Outlook.

<h2>            Excel 2016 Using SUMIFS and trying to copy formula for a row&#47;column</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to copy a formula to rows and columns. &nbsp;I have tried every combination of paste option to get this to work - everyone I ask advises to just 'drag it across and down', but that doesn't work for me. &nbsp;I had a similar sheet last year that was done
 in Numbers, and I followed the same sequence but this time in Excel. &nbsp;I know this isn't rocket science, but I have been trying for days to sort this out! &nbsp;Any assistance you can give would be appreciated. &nbsp;Oh, and Excel didn't seem to like it if I tried using
 the $ sign instead of the ! if that helps? &nbsp;I have read countless posts, but ....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a screenshot of where I am at presently.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f75ab98-e665-487b-b359-b2329dca1d2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f75ab98-e665-487b-b359-b2329dca1d2c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and this is what worked for me in Numbers (which I can't get to work now either, hence trying in Excel which I am slightly more familiar with)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3920dd65-d815-403d-be8a-a8f3cd691bb5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3920dd65-d815-403d-be8a-a8f3cd691bb5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and this is what the information looks like on the Accounts worksheet (obviously it contains much more information!)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2196442-43f8-4508-8b40-60c1e287c9c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2196442-43f8-4508-8b40-60c1e287c9c4" /></a></p>

            Hi Hettiemow,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to deploy a formula in Excel 2016 for Mac. I would like to share with you the information that when you copy a formula without changing the reference condition, it cannot adapt to the new criteria range automatically.
 You need to edit the sum range, criteria range, and criteria for the formula manually. You can refer to my example below:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Go to Formulas&gt; Name Manager to add new name range for column AMOUNT, CATEGORY and MONTH.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce4b393e-9918-44ea-8c12-93bc88aeaee5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce4b393e-9918-44ea-8c12-93bc88aeaee5" /></a>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Use the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SUMIFS-function-c9e748f5-7ea7-455d-9406-611cebce642b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SUMIFS function</a> for the worksheet. The ! Symbol refers to reference worksheet, and the $ symbol refers to reference type for the criteria. In this formula, I would like to calculate the amount which satisfies the condition: Category is the Bill in the same
 row, Month is the month in the same column.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe1aab78-bf91-4773-a725-c5beef9016b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe1aab78-bf91-4773-a725-c5beef9016b7" /></a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. In this case, you can just drag it across and down to deploy the formula for the whole worksheet.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

<h2>            Cortana only opens apps not programs</h2>
                    It is super annoying that when I say "find (insert program here)," Cortana opens the browser. I have found that if I say "open (program)" it will work, but ONLY if I have the app.
<strong>Example</strong>: I <em>had</em>&nbsp;Evernote Touch&nbsp;&nbsp;AND&nbsp;Evernote (which I prefer). "Open Evernote" opened Evernote Touch... so I deleted&nbsp;Evernote Touch and asked Cortana to "Find Evernote." She opened a Bing search finding it. Then, when I said "Open Evernote"
 she couldn't find it and said "Open what program?" ANNOYING!

<br />
I have a 1Gb card in my phone and all pictures and videos are stored on that. My phone keeps saying the memory is full and will not allow me to send text messages.<br />
<br />
I have tried deleting any unwanted files and got rid of pretty much everything I can think of. Everything my phone needs is on the memory card.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer any advice on what the problem could be?<br />

<h2>            windows 10 mobile root</h2>
                    hi,i am just coming from xda fourms ,where they are discussing ""interop unlock for windows 10 mobile"",lets assume that these guys are able to get full root access to windows 10 mobile devices,<strong>does that mean people can write malware,spyware programs
 for windows 10 mobile </strong>or are we consumers safe because apps are sandboxed by default ?,is it theoretically possible to spy on or take control of windows mobile devices if people gain root access ?,they are talking about ""OEMs, getting a special OEM
 Developer Unlock (300 apps or more) which gives them the ability to use much higher-privilege app capabilities than the standard ISV unlock permits."<br />

            I don't think there is any solution for your problem. 2003 is no longer supported, so MS probably won't be any help. They REALLY want your money for Office 2010!

The thing is, there is no way for a user to "deactivate" an installation. You are supposed to uninstall before transferring a license, but that doesn't actually deactivate it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You could also try doing a phone activation and see if they can help you. You almost certainly will have to ask to speak to a supervisor.<br />
<br />
<div><b><span>Transfer an Installation, Phone Activate</span></b> </div>
Uninstall it from the "old" computer (a dead computer qualifies as “uninstalled”) then simply install and activate on the new computer. If internet activation does not work, do a phone activation. When you call in, don't enter any info (you already know it
 doesn't work), just wait until you are offered the option of talking to a "service" rep. Explain that you have uninstalled from the old computer and are transferring to a new one. They should re-enable your product key to complete the activation.<span>&nbsp;</span>

<h3> valerie dewitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using IF and OR functions to determine if a date falls on a weekend or holiday.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone could help me determine how to write a function that would populate a cell with a specific note, letting employees know the date they put in falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday so that they must notify customers that the prior business
 day is the final day they have to submit payment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give some background, on our sheet we have a cell to enter the renewal date on a policy, which when inputted determines what date is exactly 30 days before then, naming it like this: Saturday, May 5, 2018. What I am hoping is that I can develop a formula
 that will show them an alert/note if that date falls on a weekend or holiday, so they know to tell the customer that the payment must be received the prior business day. I was able to develop a formula that would alert them with a note of "Holiday/Weekend"
 if it falls on a Saturday or Sunday relatively easily, but when it comes to stating the same for a holiday I'm stumped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten this far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in cell A16 is the renewal date of "Thursday, April 5, 2018," in B16 is the payment must be received by date of "Saturday, May 5, 2018," and I developed the formula of " =IF(OR(B16=F24,F23),B16,"HOLIDAY/WEEKEND") " with F23 and F24 containing the words
 "Friday" and "Saturday respectively, but I think I may have already made this more complicated than it needs to be, and now I'm stuck on the holiday part.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to simplify it a bit and do a formula of " =IF(B21=F23,HOLIDAY/WEEKEND,No) " so that the cell would know either to display the "holiday/weekend" note or just state no if not, but that still leaves out the holiday determination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help me out it would be so very much appreciated. This would help out my employees tremendously and save them time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Valerie</p>

<h3> daphoenix555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have OneNote screen clipping with designated size of image&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I go through lots of video tutorials and take notes during videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my format of my onenote like this:</p>
<p>http://snag.gy/kZeZg.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have two a column table. The first column is just general notes on what I'm learning in the tutorial. The second column is a snapshot of what the 1st column was referencing to</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue I'm having is that my screen clippings are all different sizes (based on how much of my screen I'm clipping
</p>
<p>(http://snag.gy/eyWbE.jpg)</p>
<p>Then the 2nd column's width has to increase to adjust for larger screen clippings. It makes it hard to read through my notes this way&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I have it set so that the 2nd column has a fixed width, and the onenote screen clipping automatically fits in the alloted space of the table's cells? (with Fixed ratio on X:Y scale on image)&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p><span><span>I don’t believe that you can answer that question without some kind of context.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, if you have an example of canonical VB.net code, or any other reference to other programming languages in which you place the question in a context that allows one to answer
 your question, then that would help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am not familiar with such a term and I not seen it used for say c++, or vb.net, or c# code that is “canonical”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, I don’t believe the term Canonical applies to vba, or c# or any particular programming language.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So this is perhaps like asking:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is a flying Ford car?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since Ford cars don’t fly, don’t have wings, then the question would not make sense.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have to provide further context here, since I don’t believe the term can apply to VBA code unless some kind of context is given.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Usually the term Canonical in terms of computers applies to repeating data (and compression), or data that is unique in some way.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So a group of functions in VBA that are the SAME as say the JET-SQL data engine syntax might be a limited example of the term Canonical (a set of unique “common” functions exists
 between VBA and JET-SQL) . However I don’t think canonical is correct term and better would be “intersection” of functions in VBA and JET-SQL.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So I don’t believe the term applies to VBA code unless it means that you can write some VBA source code, but when compiled to achieve the SAME task, the compiled code is the same,
 and thus the unique and final representation of such code.</span></span></p>

    <title>Value Field Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Value Field Settings</h2>
                    I am creating a pivot table and need the values to be cumulative and afterwards do a yoy comparison. I did a value field setting to show running totals and now I want to incorporate another value field setting to show %difference from. How can I do this?
 Thank you.

            <p>To show "% differences" there are 2 ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st is -&gt; By adding a new column in the source data table and then add the column under Pivot Table range.</p>
<p>2nd is -&gt; By adding a "calculated field" in Pivot Table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add "Calculated Field" in Pivot Table:</p>
<p>- Go to "Analyze &gt; Calculations &gt; Fields, Items and Sets"</p>
<p>- This will show a "Insert Calculated Field"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83dd825e-38c0-4af4-80e9-db7883b0c757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83dd825e-38c0-4af4-80e9-db7883b0c757" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Type a name for your calculated field in the "Name:" text box. Example: "Ach%". This will add in your Pivot Table Field's list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Select a field name from "Fields:" list box and click on "Insert Field" to add it in "Formula:" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Assume that, you are trying to show a "Achievement %" where "Column B" is Achievement amount and "Column A" is Target.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The settings of the dialog box as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/216e3613-2ad7-4671-989f-291980b6fc7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/216e3613-2ad7-4671-989f-291980b6fc7d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Click on "Add" and "Ok" button to add the new "Ach%" field in your pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now simply drug and drop it under "Value" portion</p>

<p>Simple Piero, Windows XP is unsupported by Microsoft and has been for a few years now.&nbsp; Since they stopped supporting the use of Microsoft Security Essentials on the XP platform roughly a year after extended support for the operating system came to an end,
 it's likely the only reason this continued to work until now is that some of the point-of-sale (POS) versions of Windows XP were still supported until last month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're finally experiencing the end-of-support effects that you should have a few years back.&nbsp; Microsoft always had these dates well published, so there's no reason for you to be surprised or even a justification for being disappointed.&nbsp; You've already
 received support for several years beyond what Microsoft had originally published as the end-of-lifecycle date for Windows XP, which if I recall correctly was sometime in 2011-12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give up and move on, it's time to get out of the dark ages.</p>

<p>Dear Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>your "office defense" of Microsoft struggles my heart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the applications I need, the sunshine started with Windows 7,&nbsp; the dark age is set by the ridiculous&nbsp; Windows 8, wrt to which, Win10 is just a candle in the empty space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will continue to use WinXP, installing a third party antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS wants people upgrade to new OS's, should start to think that there are persons that don't buy PC to watch movies, chatting, or doing other free time uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a PC and an OS useful to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enjoy the shining age of toy OS's.</p>

<p>Piero,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, you have it backwards, since Windows XP was the toy OS for consumers and Windows 2000 the serious one meant for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vista re-merged these and the&nbsp;Windows 7 re-release waited 2 years,&nbsp;long enough&nbsp;for the foot-dragging hardware driver and application software vendors to catch up, while&nbsp;Microsoft also&nbsp;added a few pretty features to convince the consumer that something had
 actually changed, when little truly had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 like Vista changed the interface too fast for many, so with Windows 10 they rethought this and returned some familiar items, while seriously changing the security model again as they had with Vista.&nbsp; This is now the most secure version of Windows
 that's ever existed, but since Vista broke lots of outdated app software anyone trying to jump to these newer versions&nbsp;may have trouble with some of these older apps&nbsp;if they hadn't kept up along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove 3rd-party apps or even some included with Windows itself that's possible, I've done it myself and will soon remove a few more from Windows 8, as support for the included&nbsp;MSN apps is ending in June.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows 8 and later 8.1 for business purposes with no issues and though I haven't used Windows 10 in a business, many do so that's not an issue either.&nbsp; Just because a few apps are included for video or games&nbsp;doesn't mean you have to use them and
 in most cases these can be removed or hidden.&nbsp; Buying the upgrade to the Pro version allows some additional control over certain features, but I never cared enough to bother, since you can so easily hide these on the home versions that it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AV for Windows XP is basically pointless, since the lack of operating system security updates for the last few years means it's full of holes, so it's game over before the AV can even react.&nbsp; Keeping XP around in a business means you don't care about your
 customer's data and if you were breached your business could be sued into oblivion, whether AV was installed on not wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>Piero,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I responded in that other thread since I was already involved there and so saw your post there first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be absolutely clear, there's simply no way to make Windows XP secure anymore, whether antivirus is installed or not.&nbsp; That's due to the fact that&nbsp;operating system security updates haven't been provided for it since
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support for Windows XP ended on April 8, 2014</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is that even with AV installed, if malware attacks via websites or a file you've opened, the vulnerabilities that haven't been patched would be exploited before the AV could even react, likely disabling the AV and performing whatever other malicious
 operations it wishes without any warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why Microsoft officially stopped providing updates for Windows XP a year after the End-of-Support date mentioned above, while 3rd-party AV vendors will happily continue to sell updates to the foolish people who continue to use an operating system
 that can't truly be secured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 improved the things most people didn't like in 8 and Windows 10 has been accepted widely, recently accelerating the replacement of Windows 7 worldwide as the End-of-Lifecycle support date for that nears in January 2020.&nbsp; Both are heavily used
 in business of all sizes and are far more secure than any previous version, even without AV installed,&nbsp; However, since both Windows 8.X and 10&nbsp;have Windows Defender AV included free with the operating system, that's no longer an issue for those who've kept
 up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one using Windows XP truly cares about their personal data&nbsp;security, so it's time to replace that aged operating system and get caught up with the rest of the modern world.</p>

                    My husband sent me an invite to install office 365 after purchasing the $99 / year plan.&nbsp; The 1tb one drive portion of the invite seems to be working, however whenever I try to download/install Office I'm told my account is not associated with an office
 product.&nbsp; The account was created after initially accepting the invite!!&nbsp;

<h2>            N8 some Qt applications stuck in &#39;preparing to install&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>I've noticed some qt applications get stuck in 'preparing to install' stage after download. I purchased 2 - cute piano and myexplorer. Both get stuck in this status, when i press cancel, the phone vibrates strongly for around 5 seconds and the phone reboots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also happens for some other applications (QT). I wanted to put all QT applications but there are some that can install with no problems. Most of betalabs qt apps work without a flaw. Only some from ovi store seem to give me problems. Its a problem as
 I don't have any other way to redownload as verfication for sms is an issue for me, seems my phone number is not able to receive sms from ovi services.(still working it out with my provider).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can list some more but at this point and time seems ovi store is under maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really like to know if anyone has this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Do you have the nokia bubbles beta installed? It installs a beta Qt version that is know to cause trouble with other apps. The link below gives instructions on how to remove the beta Qt to see if it allows your other apps to work:<br />

<p>Actually thanks for reminding me, I forgot to tell you that I've already eliminated the bubbles theory. I've uninstalled bubbles tried to download another qt app and the same thing happens. So it is not bubbles causing it. For good measure anyway since there
 are issues until qt 4.7.2 release I've kept bubbles out of my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't seem to receive sms from ovi services (verify) or from Nokia customer care considering I'm with DIGI in Malaysia. I'm wondering if anyone has such issues? The customer care was able to send sms to my friends maxis number though. When such issues
 happen its such a b*tch as neither one wants to do anything about it. Its much easier for nokia to blame the provider and the provider to say they don't block anything rather then just both of them looking at the problem together. Its sms, its not rocket science
 to trace the sent sms to your sms gateway and for digi to trace if there is any sms to my number. *sigh*</p>

<p>Seems to be having rather wildly different apps have different behaviours. I didn't keep track of everything but some QT apps install fine, others just refuse and restarts the phone. With ovi store update some of those which couldn't install earlier installed
 fine, while some others still fail. Now I tried installing qt 4.7.2 however still getting mixed results. I thought it is supposed to be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. Nokia N8. Some Qt applications install just fine, while others hang up on "preparing installation." If I cancel, the phone vibes a long time, then reboots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OviStore doesn't work on this phone, either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Qt is one of those technologies that will save Nokia? Not based on my experience.</p>

<p>Same problems here. I'm Canadian...but I think the location doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>You Tube downloaded, Google Apps Browser and Wellness Diary beta are a few of the Qt apps that are getting stuck at "Preparing Installation". I have a feeling that is either Bubble or the new CNN app that's causing this. I didn't have this problem before
 installing those.</p>

            What is the file extension of the photos that you have transferred. I haven't faced this issue with my Nokia 5800. Try transferring again coz if it's JPEG then you should be able to view them easily. May be they are corrupted.

            It sounds like you have the thumbnails instead of the actual images. How did you move the images? Try connecting in Mass Storage mode and browsing for the images.

<h2>            OneDrive for Business&#58;  See all files I&#39;m sharing</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking for a way to see all files or folders I'm sharing on OneDrive for Business. &nbsp;In general, I like to keep a close eye on what's being shared, and I'd like to remove sharing for any files/folders that no longer need to be shared. &nbsp;(For comparison,
 I'm looking essentially for what Dropbox does with the "Sharing" tab.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do that in OneDrive for Business?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mirage,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can check the sharing condition in <strong>Sharing</strong> column in new experience user interface as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c1382c9-a478-4bf9-987c-ef577422bff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c1382c9-a478-4bf9-987c-ef577422bff5" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we have shared the files in your OneDrive, you will see the <strong>Shared </strong>
sign. Otherwise, it will show <strong>Only you </strong>if we don’t share the files to other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can see more sharing details if we return to classic OneDrive interface follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Return to classic OneDrive. </strong></li><li>Click <strong>Eclipse&gt;Create View&gt;Standard View.</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/150184a8-68e2-4a2a-8854-faa82da94d43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Type a name for the new view and tick the column related with sharing. Then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>

            HELLO tlutzow<br />
<br />
Was there any new program or software you dowload before this started happening?<br />
<br />
<br />
A file with the CGI file extension is a Common Gateway Interface Script file. <br />
<br />
The easiest way to open a CGI file is to double-click on it and let your PC decide which default application should open the file. If no program opens the CGI file then you probably don't have an application installed that can view and/or edit CGI files.<br />
Of course if you don't have a program that opens CGI files, a third-party file conversion tool.&nbsp;
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party
 Software is at your own risk</span></strong>.<br />

There is a TINY chance you can convince MS to replace it:<br />
<b>How to obtain a new product key for a Microsoft Office 2010 suite, Lost Product Key support – lost key</b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823570</a>
</p>
<p>You need 2 things to install Office, your unique personal 25 character “Product Key” and the generic Office installation file / disk for the matching Office bundle.</p>
<p>The above link describes the formal MS support available.</p>
<p>To summarize the article, it depends on how you bought Office:</p>
<p>If you have a 1-computer (online download), “PKC” (Product Key Card), “MLK” (Medialess Kit), “OEM” (factory installed and Activated) type license you cannot transfer the license to a new computer. It is only good on the first computer
 it is installed on and stays permanently with the computer when it is sold or scrapped.</p>
<p>If you have a 2-computer or 3-computer for Home and Student only (online download), “FPP” (online download), Boxed retail CD/DVD (which is usually the”FPP” type), these types of license may be transferred to new comptuers as required.</p>
<p>All licenses available to the general public that I am aware of may be re-installed on the same computer, even after limited upgrades like adding RAM, new HD, re-installing Windows, upgrading Windows version etc.</p>
<p>The link above describes where to look for Product Key numbers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you still have a computer that Office was installed and activated on, which you have NOT re-installed or upgraded Windows on you try one of the following tools to extract the key from the HD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your purchase was through the Microsoft Store, You can contact them at 1-877-696-7786 or login using your credentials in the link below:

<h2>            College Email on Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I was in a time crunch to set up a work computer with Office 365 and used my personal (college) email address to do that.&nbsp; Ever since then I have not been able to access my college account and when I log in using 365 there is nothing in the inbox at all
 and I know there should be because friends and family ask why I haven't responded to any emails lately.&nbsp; All I get when I try to log in the old way (outlook.com/collegeemail.edu) is that my password doesn't work and when I try to reset it, it says I need to
 contact the admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this/get this back to normal?&nbsp; My college account ends in .edu and I've tried looking for a solution myself and have come up empty handed so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Jess,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, your college may have Office 365 plan and give you a student account. Since Office 365 is paid service, you may not allowed to keep the account when you leave your college. In this situation, it is suggested to contact IT support
 in your college and confirm the detailed scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I misunderstand anything, please provide more details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>
