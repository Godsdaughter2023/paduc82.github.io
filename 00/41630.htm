<h2>            Xbox One Controllers Keep Disconnecting&#47;Incorrect Battery Readouts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently, my Xbox One controller kept disconnecting. At first, I just thought it was due to the battery level as normal, and the dashboard said my batteries were low, so I changed the batteries. However, the dashboard didn't update the battery readout, and
 my controller continued to disconnect even with new batteries inside. I thought this meant my controller was broken, so I bought another one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the batteries ran low on my new controller, I replaced them with new ones, only to find out that the dashboard also failed to update the battery level again. I turned off my Xbox and turned it back on using a hard reset, but the battery levels were
 still low. I unsynced the Xbox controller, but not it won't sync anymore and I can only use it with a USB cable. I tried to use my old Xbox controller but it also won't sync anymore. I also unplugged my Xbox's power cord and then plugged it back in to see
 if that would fix it, but neither controller will sync to my console.</p>
<p>I don't know whether this is a firmware or software issue. The batteries are in place correctly and I doubt I bought a broken controller when it worked fine for a few weeks. This is an annoying issue. I would appreciate help.</p>

    <title>Verification Email Address - Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Verification Email Address - Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I've been using my Skype account for over a decade and never had such issues until Microsoft took over! Why in the world is impossible to contact in anyway customer service? How can I contact you when I have a problem signing in, you cannot call anywhere,
 send email, or contact anyone, send a work request, report technical issues or anything like that, and only way how to ask a question on this ridiculous and obscure forum is to SIGN IN???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been invited in a group chat on GroupMe where I didn't have an account. I did not want to link my account from Skype and wanted to start a separate, unrelated one for this application. Which, due to unbelievably sketchy account creation process, resulted
 in singing me off of my Skype account and changing my contact email address to some bogus non-existent one. Every time, I try to sign in into my Skype account it says that a verification code has been sent to this inaccessible email address and ask if the
 address is correct. When I say no and try to change it back to the previous one it crashes and says that the account was already renamed and come back later. It's been month and a half now. Guys, this is serious stuff. I have to contact my parents! You are
 playing with peoples' lives here!!!</p>

<h2>            CANT REMOVE OR ADD FRIENDS</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a very big problem. i cant seem to add or remove friends from/to my friends list! Also, some people on my friends list can not even hear me talk! I have the setting so that I only hear people on my friends list, so I dont know why this is happening!
 I really need some help, as I cant even talk to some of the people I talk to in real life and from xbox live. This has been going on for so long! I really need some help!</p>

<p>ps i also did see the service alert, and it currently has nothing to do with the friends from what I can tell.</p>

<p>Hi there Striker!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issues!</p>
<p>Have you tried adding or removing friends through Xbox.com? If not, head over to&nbsp;your
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/Friends?xr=mebarnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Friends list page</a>&nbsp;and try it through there.</p>
<p>As far as the party chat issues go, it could be related to a NAT issue. Let's begin with our
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/networking/connectivity-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 Connection Support </a>page and&nbsp;be sure to follow each of the steps.</p>
<p>If the issue persists,&nbsp;post&nbsp;back&nbsp;with your Network Hardware information such as your router/modem info so we can get you back up and running!

<h2>            Windows 8 Hangs at &#34;Failure configuring Windows updates Reverting changes Do not turn off your computer.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have the HP Pavilion g6 2244sa that originally came with windows 8. I then upgraded to windows 8.1 when it cam out. But I got board of windows 8.1 so i used my downgrade rights and installed windows 7 on my laptop. After a while, i though I'd like
 windows 8.1 back so i factory reset my computer and all is fine, I install some programs and other things. I went to use windows update, and after a bit of waiting it eventually worked. I restarted the computer for the updates and it freezes at 12% and after
 a while it says restarting and trys again, but then after a few goes, it restarts and comes to "Failure configuring Windows updates Reverting changes Do not turn off your computer." and it has been stuck like this for about an hour. It was installing 122 updates
 120 important and 2 optional. I can't reach the login screen and it always starts up into that screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please helps me :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel</p>

    <title>Update, Store, Defender unable to update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebecca6789  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update, Store, Defender unable to update</h2>
                    <p>I'm running 8.1 with Bing&nbsp;on a Winbook tw802 tablet.</p>
<p>I had Norton and then Spybot Search and Destroy on my tablet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>FIRST: I had an error I couldn't fix I tried to keep my files and refresh Windows. After I did this my search charm broke. Search was unable to find anything anymore. (such as control panel, etc. NOTHING.) After struggling for a week or so to find a fix
 for that mess: I did a clean install from the Winbook recovery? OS?&nbsp;partition that holds the copy of my Windows 8.1 with Bing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran update and it installed a bunch of things then stopped updating defender first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Avast! Free edition (used uninstall in windows to remove, but it may not be completely uninstalled since I didn't use a remover tool. no viruses were found though. Currently windows defender is the only virus protection&nbsp;thing on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling Avast! nothing will update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a help post here and thought my BITS service is probably corrupted? I opened command prompt, clicked run as administrator, ran a cfc /scannow and nothing was wrong.&nbsp;then was going to stop BITS.. opened prompt clicked run as admin typed: net stop
 wuauserv</p>
<p>"The windows update service is stopping........................"</p>
<p>"The windows update service could not be stopped."</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I didn't write down the error box word for word because I couldn't copy paste it.) review system event log. &nbsp;service-specific error code -2147024894</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't looked at the log details but under windows logs Application 1857 events, security 5193 events, setup 555 events, system 3006 events?</p>
<p>
</p><p>last kb that was successful before the first failed update is impossible to provide due to fail spam: only successful one visible on the 21 of July 2015:&nbsp;kb3079904 preceded by
</p>
<p>Fail of kb2267602</p>
<p>99 updates say they are successfully installed in "installed updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to provide the posting info required, as well as what I did. but if anyone needs those thousands of log files let me know how to copy/paste! there's no way I could type that with 1 finger on a on screen microscopic keyboard. Thank you in advance for
 your help!</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay in answering. Yes I let Spybot remove temp files and other non essential junk but I didn't allow it to remove anything essential that I was aware of before I uninstalled it before the clean wipe. I also ran Spybots restore when you uninstall
 it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember what it was but during the uninstall it said it was restoring any changes the program made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spybot was on before the clean install btw, I was able to get 99 updates after the clean install. It appears one of the recommended or essential updates may have done this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first update to fail was a defender kb after some were successfully installed. now I can't start BITS. I did not have Spybot on my tablet after the clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm willing to provide any information you may need if I possibly can.</p>

<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. When (exact date, preferably) did you do the Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Did you backup any personal data (e.g., to an external hard-drive,&nbsp;CD, DVD or flash drive)&nbsp;before you did the Reset and then restore it to your hard-drive after you did the Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you install Avast before or after you did the Reset? Assuming after, when (approx. date) did you uninstall it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Did you run the Norton Removal Tool before you installed Avast &amp; Spybot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. Had you run the Norton Removal Tool at any time prior to doing the Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Is Spybot still installed or...?</p>

            Hi LegendarRoyale , to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

 is in when the computer is turned on then it will say new hardware found but it can never find a driver for it. Why is it not working now but was last week and how the heck can I fix it. I dont have any software for my digital camera I have always just took
 the memory card out stuck it in the memory card slot and it was fine. It is just a cheaper memory card (Lexar) I have a 2Gb and a 128 Mb and neither will work anymore. Thank you for any help!

            Hi, I hope you can follow this. Remove the storage card from the computer, then go to control panel<br />
then<br />
device manager<br />
expand portable devices <br />
the type of memory card slots should be listed if your type has a yellow triangle by it,<br />
right click on it and choose uninstall.<br />
It should the reinstall automatically or when you put the storage card into the slot.<br />
this type of fault is quite often caused by not using the safely remove hardware application on the taskbar.

<p>Hello iemad,</p>
<p>I suggest your run&nbsp;SFC /scannow&nbsp;to see if there are any corrupt system files.<br />
</p>
<p><span>First, let's run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now run chkdsk:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if this helps.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Jesse310,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When do you get this error message?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Are you able to boot to desktop?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This may mostly occur if the user account is corrupted or missing some files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First I would suggest that you run an online virus scan on the computer to scan and remove any virus or malware infection
 on the computer and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the below link to the online virus scan and perform a full service scan on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are unable to boot to desktop in the normal mode I would suggest that you boot the computer to Safe mode with
 networking and try the online scan.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps to boot to Safe mode with networking</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer if it is powered on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should see drivers loading, and then Please wait.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step does not fix the issue would suggest that you perform clean boot procedure and
 check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Perform clean boot and check if you have the issue</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>User Account Control permission</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given
 below:</span></span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
 Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></p>

<p>I search the internet for solutions, what is found is delete the bootcat.cache file. I did, but this didn't work.</p>
<p>I try to repair it with sfc and dism, but there also errors.</p>
<p>Does someone know an solution?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Here is the official MSFT explanation...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559142%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559142%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>Bug Check 0x6B: PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED</p>
<p>
</p><p>=== Quote ===</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any part of the disk subsystem can cause the PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED bug check, including bad disks, bad or incorrect cables, mixing different ATA-type devices on the same chain, or drives that are not available becuase of hardware regeneration.</p>
<p>This bug check can also be caused by a missing file from the boot partition or by a driver file that a user accidentally disabled in the
<strong>Drivers</strong> tab.</p>
<p>=== EOQ&nbsp;&nbsp; ===</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - it could be hardware or software at fault. Here is one thing to try...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/981833/-stop-error-code-0x0000006b-process1-initialization-failed-error-message-during-startup-on-a-computer-that-is-running-windows-7-or-windows-server-2008-r2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/981833/-stop-error-code-0x0000006b-process1-initialization-failed-error-message-during-startup-on-a-computer-that-is-running-windows-7-or-windows-server-2008-r2</a></p>
<p>"Stop error code 0x0000006B PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED" error message during startup on a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says to delete a file (which still exists in Win 10) named:&nbsp; %SystemRoot%\system32\codeintegrity\Bootcat.Cache</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c59f79b-6957-415d-a8cb-35cd98965bf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c59f79b-6957-415d-a8cb-35cd98965bf0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>DIR shows it exists. DEL would delete it. If it cannot be done while booted to Windows, then do as the article says &amp; boot to a Rescue DVD or your Recovery USB drive ==
<strong>OR </strong>== try to boot to your Recovery Partition this way: SHIFT+Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, at the "Choose an option" screen, select "Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: I pulled that cure out of the thread...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/process1initializationfailed-blue-screen-stop-06b/18250508-4ef2-4ddd-9599-ee1b11e32a32">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/process1initializationfailed-blue-screen-stop-06b/18250508-4ef2-4ddd-9599-ee1b11e32a32</a></p>
<p>PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED Blue Screen STOP: 06B after System Mechanic defrag and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth reading the entire thread. Also, there are multiple other threads for "process1_initialization_failed". BING it, if necessary.</p>

            <p>I've had two lapses of mental fitness in this thread so far. I offered you a fix you had already said failed, &amp; (as you say) an Inplace-Repair can't be done w/o booting Windows first. I can only count to seven; so, when I get that high, I promise to&nbsp;stop
 offering solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Does that "process1_initialization_failed" error ever show up when booting the new instance of Windows?</p>
<p>(2) If not - &amp; the&nbsp;new installation&nbsp;otherwise runs well -&nbsp;&nbsp;why not dispense with the bad one &amp; keep the good?</p>
<p>(3) Can you see bad Windows (D:) in File Explorer &amp; copy important files off it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) What shows up at: "Ask Cortana for MSConfig, hit ENTER, Boot tab"...?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a dual-boot situation,&nbsp;you'd see "<strong>D:</strong>\Windows" there. Also, you'd've been seeing Windows's boot option menu each boot. Have you tried booting it to Safe Mode from that screen? Select it in the window, put a check into "Safe
 boot"; then, put a bolt into either "Minimal" (no internet) or "Network" (you get the net). I guess put a check into "Boot log" as well. If it boots to Safe Mode that way, try those SFC &amp; DISM commands (but without redirecting them).</p>

<p>
</p><p>(5) I'll look into why SFC &amp; DISM won't run when you do redirect them. So far, I've found something by Brink here...</p>

    <title>Cannot join homegroup in Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredbk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot join homegroup in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have three computers running Win 10. I cannot join the homegroup on any of them. I have tried deleting the idstore.sset file and resetting winsock and recreating the MachineKeys folder, setting the permissions on the new MachineKeys folder to Users full
 control and also adding myself with full control. None of these have worked on any of the units. When I go to Control Panel/Homegroup I see the invitation to join the homegroup. I click on the Join Now button, set the sharing options and then the Verifying
 password progress box just sets there with the green bar cycling continuously. I can access the files on each computer from one of the others&nbsp;using "File Explorer".</p>
<p>I have identical accounts on each of the computers. All three of the peer services are running on each computer.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>The link given does NOT address the problem in question. It is a generic help file designed simply to get one started with homegroups. I do wish people would read posts more carefully and then restrict themselves to answers that apply to the problem in question.</p>
<p>I did see on another thread that IPv6 may be involved. It stated that Homegroup in Win 10 uses IPv6 to connect with the other computers. If this is the case then MS needs to make this known and publish some guides to working with it.</p>

            When I ask about creating a homegroup in Win 10 you point me to a Win 8 article. When I select Win 10 from that article it points me to a bunch of generic articles on Win 10 having nothing to do with my issue. How long do I have to wait to get decent help
 or is that up to the public to do because Microsoft doesn't do help anymore. Sad.

            Before doing all this, make sure that the computers on the home network are logged in with your Microsoft Account, and not as a local account. This may solve the "problem" right away - it did for me.<br />
<br />
Both my Desktop and Laptop are running the latest build of Windows 10, with x64 Pro on the Desktop and x64 Home on the Laptop. I had both logged in to a local account with the same name and password. I created a HomeGroup on my Desktop, then went to my laptop
 There was an invitation to join on the Laptop's HomeGroup page, but when I tried to join using the password generated on my Desktop during HomeGroup creation, Windows reported that there was no longer a HomeGroup on the network.
<br />
<br />
I then logged in to both computers with my Microsoft account, and I was able to join the network without any problems.<br />
<br />
If this "problem" is caused by deliberate software engineering to force people to log in with their Microsoft accounts, then it likely should be added to the list of issues in the next class action suit against Microsoft. The very local HomeGroup should work
 on local accounts, but it doesn't. Forcing us to use Microsoft accounts in order to join a HomeGroup is clearly an invasion of privacy, similar to Microsoft's previous bias towards it's own Internet browser over competitors' browsers.<br />
<br />
At the very least, this "fix" should be the first thing listed. It should also be incorporated into the HomeGroup wizard, so that people don't have to spend hours to trying "fix" a "problem" created by Microsoft in preferring Microsoft accounts over local accounts.

<h2>            Security Update</h2>
                    
<p>So I haven't logged on to Xbox Live in about a month, signed into profile and it asked me to sign in with my microsoft live email and password. It work, says I've signed into Xbox Live and asks if I want to remember my password...But the option of Remember
 Password and Next are greyed out because on the right side the loading circle or whatever its called just keeps spinning and spinning, I can't back out except but hitting the home button but that takes me back to dashboard without having signed in to a profile.
 Any ideas on how I can start playing?</p>

            You cannot rename. That would have been easy. I was able to fix it by shortening up the names of folders in the directory path to free up character space to allow the file to be opened and saved.

<h2>            Skype sign in - going round in circles</h2>
                    I used to use Skype quite often usually for work (in pre-Microsoft days), then there was a pause post-retirement.&nbsp; Coming back to it recently I signed in once and it looked different without my old contacts. And then I couldn't get in again - no matter
 what I have tried. Microsoft wants to use my old work email - which can't be done. It wont let me start a new account because my phone number and home email seem to be on the system and it says an account already exists. If so, it won't accept my password(s)
 and wont let me change them. I can't provide it with enough information on its recovery form to let me start up again. Can I delete everything and start over? Or should I just leap from a high building?

<h2>            Windows Disc Image Burner Is Missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm running windows 8.1 pro w/media center edition, this morning I download an ISO file from Microsoft, now I need to burn the&nbsp;iso image file to a dvd. The problem is..when I right click&nbsp;on the iso image file, I'm not given any option to burn the file using
 the 'supposedly' built in software that's supposed to be included in windows 8.1. Is there any way to download that file &amp; reinstall&nbsp;the disc image burner again ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply..I found the problem that was causing my issue, there wasn't any&nbsp;program associated with the .iso file type. I fixed it via the registry, now when I click on the .iso image file I want to burn to a dvd, I'm offered to use windows disc
 image burner once again.</p>

    <title>Screen Resolution wrong &#43; other issues after Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anne sedai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Resolution wrong &#43; other issues after Windows 10 &#34;Creators Update&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Where to begin?&nbsp; I downloaded this "Creators Update" back in September and discovered that it broke several parts of my computer, mainly my screen resolution and I lost a couple programs.&nbsp; Since it failed, I instantly reverted back to the previous version.&nbsp;
 Now a month later I find that Windows has forced me to update (it didn't even say "Shut Down and Update", it completely hid this update happening from me until too late) and I cannot roll back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue I am having is that my screen resolution is wrong.&nbsp; It won't let me customize leading to oversized blurry desktop icons and a stretched horizontal appearance on my screen, especially when I am gaming or watching videos.&nbsp; The eyestrain caused
 by this is causing me to feel I cannot use my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened my new Start menu, I discovered that several of my Active Tiles were deleted and I couldn't create new shortcuts.&nbsp; In addition, some of them have become smaller in the sense that while the tile size itself is still medium, the image on the
 tile has shrunk to occupy the tiny upper left corner of the box equivalent to a size small.&nbsp; If I decrease the tile to small, the image also decreases becoming an itty bitty speck in the corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is also running slower on boot up and in general.&nbsp; While recently attempting to fix an issue with one of my games, I found it was a lot more laggy and given it is an older game, I have more than enough processing power to run it at max specs.&nbsp;
 I have never experienced issues with it before this update and I was literally playing it hours before the update occurred.&nbsp; I did disable game mode to see if that would help to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have updated all my graphics and screen drivers, through Windows and through the publishers (i.e. Nvidia GeForce).&nbsp; Yes, I have restarted my computer numerous times.&nbsp; Yes, I have tried every suggestion I found on the internet for all these issues.&nbsp;
 Nothing works.&nbsp; This update broke my screen resolution, slowed down my computer, wrecked my Start menu, possibly damaged some of my game programs/saves, and now I can barely use my laptop.&nbsp; All because of an update I had zero say in whether I wanted it or
 not.&nbsp; It seems ridiculous that Windows forces users to get the "all or nothing" package with updates now.&nbsp; What's worse is I can't even go back.&nbsp; I'm stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help.&nbsp; I need a fix Microsoft.&nbsp; Please do not give me a copy/paste response that tells me to do things that I have already tried and stated I've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone in the community has any ideas for what else I could try or has experienced something similar, I would very much appreciate any insight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>1. Updating screen and graphics drivers, trying to manually find a work around for the resolution through programs like the Intel Graphics Control Panel and Nvidia Control Panel (which this update had uninstalled along with Nvidia GeForce Experience so those
 had to be reinstalled), restart computer, update drivers from the website, roll back (unable to), uninstall and reinstall graphics drivers, rollback drivers to previous versions, check for additional Windows Updates, run compatibility mode for programs affected
 (no help), disable game mode, reenable game mode, check for incompatibility, ran dxdiag to check for listed issues (no problems found),&nbsp;check all drivers related or not for updates in case I missed one....I am going to be honest when I say this ate up quite
 a bit of my time on Sunday and Monday and I don't recall every little solution I tried.&nbsp; One solution I didn't try was to see if I could reinstall the Windows files for a manual downgrade back to before this "creators update", but I believe that would be pointless
 since it would probably just automatically upgrade me again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It says that all my past version of Windows files have been removed -- this is something I did not do, so it must have done it itself.&nbsp; This was after the forced hidden update.&nbsp; Windows 10 Update Assistant installed itself without my notice or approval
 then when I tried to stop it (since I knew if it updated my computer would experience issues) it continued updating in the background without my knowledge and when I shut my computer down it updated on me with no "Update and Shut Down" message at all.&nbsp; Completely
 without any prior notice.&nbsp; I have a feeling this program is what deleted my prior files because it was forcing me to update.&nbsp; There is no error message that specifically says the word "error", just a message that says "We're sorry, but you can't go back. The
 files we need to take you back to a previous version of Windows were removed from this PC."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. As I noted above, I did check that I'm compatible even though there should be no reason I wouldn't be.&nbsp; This is a relatively new laptop (late 2015) that came with Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; It has an Nvidia GeForce 930M graphics card as well as Intel HD Graphics
 5500 integrated graphics both of which have the latest drivers installed from the manufacturers themselves and checked through Toshiba that they are the best drivers for this laptop as well.&nbsp; Intel, Nvidia, and Toshiba all state that my laptop and the related
 graphics drivers are compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I posted yesterday, a new issue has emerged.&nbsp; My computer screen shifts brightness drastically rarely, but periodically (like every hour).&nbsp; I have had before where my display gently fades from slightly darker to slightly lighter and usually that happened
 for a day or two after an update signalling I needed to update my graphics drivers and was immediately fixed upon updating them.&nbsp; This is different -- this is dark to immediately very bright to very dark again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my computer and I cannot keep living with fear of what the next update will do to what should be a safe, mostly modern laptop!</p>

<p>So if I understand you correctly, you are saying that this update did indeed corrupt or break something on my system.&nbsp; And the only solution is to manually go back to a previous version.&nbsp; I will go ahead and do this.&nbsp; However, how do I know that the computer
 won't update itself again?&nbsp; I have tried that link to temporarily prevent an update before and it failed (I was trying to prevent this update after originally noticing it was causing issues).&nbsp; I have uninstalled this Windows 10 Update Assistant before and
 it just comes back.&nbsp; It seems that whatever that fix it, I'll now be in a constant cycle of manually downgrading which I worry could cause more damage to my laptop, my new and expensive laptop.&nbsp; I'm on my fourth day of lost time to this issue and I don't have
 much time to sacrifice during my day to constantly manually downgrading just to keep my computer running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, will I be able to get security updates this way?&nbsp; I know that there are several issues out right now and while I have a good anti-virus, that's not going to help much if it's a vulnerability in Windows 10 itself.&nbsp; I'm trading a broken computer for
 one at risk!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a known issue or something others are having trouble with (which I have seen some threads other places as well), will there be a patch or something to prevent this so I can eventually update my computer so I am not vulnerable long term?</p>

</p><p>The best way to keep your PC up to date with the latest security updates is to turn on automatic updates. With automatic updates, you don't have to search for updates online or possible miss critical updates or device drivers for your Windows PC. Windows
 Update will automatically install important updates as soon as they become available.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please, don't copy/paste to me an answer about security that is completely irrelevant to my situation.&nbsp; Clearly I can't turn on automatic updates.&nbsp; If I do, the whole fix you gave me will be nullified!&nbsp; I need a way to get security updates without getting
 the updates that are causing me these problems!&nbsp; How can I do that?&nbsp; If I update, my computer breaks because it installs it as a giant package.&nbsp; If I don't update, I don't get the security updates.&nbsp; I need security updates separate from the Creators Update
 that has broken my computer twice now (previously when I installed in September which I rolled back and now again -- this isn't a one time bad install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very disappointed that the best you can offer me is "rollback" which will just automatically be undone even if I block it and "check out this long article that may or may not be relevant".&nbsp; I thought Microsoft would have better solutions or a tool at
 least to help me.&nbsp; Microsoft has always been able to help me better in the past with much more difficult issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will take these suggestions into mind and see what I can figure out myself.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</p>

 gave me.&nbsp; It will not allow me to download any version except the latest - no option but the Fall Creators Update is available.&nbsp; Apparently this was known.&nbsp; So how is this a fix for my computer if all versions of Windows 10 Anniversary Update are gone and
 inaccessible unless you knew ahead of time to make a backup of the files (something Windows did&nbsp;<em>not</em> warn me about)?&nbsp; Is there a way for me to get these files?&nbsp; If not I seem to have three options -- don't use my computer until hopefully it is hopefully
 fixed with a future update, repeatedly reinstall Creators Update hoping it fixes itself, or downgrade to Windows 7.</p>

<p>I posted it now (or rather, over a week ago) because when I downloaded in September, I was able to roll back and I was planning to hold off on updates as long as possible.&nbsp; To be perfectly frank, I also have a lot of personal things going on in my life right
 now that I needed a working laptop, not something that I was working on fixing.&nbsp; The download and update occurred the second time without my knowledge or consent.&nbsp; I realized it was trying to update again about a month later so I took action.&nbsp; I had killed
 Windows Update Assistant and thought I had temporarily disabled Windows Updates as well as blocked the update.&nbsp; A few days or so after doing this, I hit shut down on my computer, perfectly normal, but instead of shutting down it said it was updating and there
 was no way to reverse it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main concern is the resolution, yes, but the boot time, the removal of several programs (and loss of saved games), the strange formatting on some Live Action tiles on my start menu, and the general lag in attempting to use my computer are all also issues
 that came with this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Toshiba Satellite L50-C.&nbsp; I bought it late 2015 with Windows 10 installed on it.&nbsp; I have never changed the OS, reinstalled the OS, or missed an update until this Creators Update and Fall Creators Update.&nbsp; It was premade and has an Nvidia GeForce
 930M graphics card as well as Intel HD Graphics 5500 integrated which is what the display is connected to.&nbsp; My screen size is 15.5" diagonal, 13.5" wide, 7.625" high.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resolution it is sitting at 1366 X 768 which sounds about right, but it does not display correctly and any lower options just make it worse or reduce the size of the screen (currently using 1024 X 768 zoomed in which makes it smaller but tolerable on
 the eyes).&nbsp; Everything is stretched wider and squashed vertically.&nbsp; For everyday use it is only partially noticeable and most noticeable when looking at the desktop and at the desktop icons/shortcuts which are disproportionate.&nbsp; However, it does cause eyestrain
 much faster and everyone that has looked at it immediately says that something looks off.&nbsp; The main issue I've noticed is with videos and games, especially games.&nbsp; When playing, things like menu blocks will be a whole inch wider than they used to be and the
 character models will look squashed and fat.&nbsp; If I try to change the resolution in the game itself, it absolutely refuses and stays locked in this bizarre resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are updated and I have reinstalled them by downloading drivers off the manufacturer's website (for Intel, they told me to go to Toshiba so I got the latest version of the Toshiba Intel driver from there).&nbsp; I also checked for updates for basically
 every other driver on my computer, related or not, just in case.&nbsp; I've checked for additional updates every day as well as for new Windows Updates every day.&nbsp; I've restarted my computer many, many times -- I'm just at a loss and can't keep losing time like
 this.&nbsp; My life has other things that require my attention as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other issues I've listed already and in my main post.&nbsp; Mainly my computer just lags along like my old 2010 one before I replaced it.&nbsp; For a two year old comptuer that I regularly maintain, update, clean up, etc...&nbsp; it shouldn't be this slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking interest in helping me out.&nbsp; If you need more information let me know.</p>

<p>Ah yes. Very intriguing. Your computer fully supports Windows 10 Creators Update, yet there are issues, a lot of it actually. I've read through Intel regarding their graphics card drivers and Windows 10 Creators Update, I've read that you don't need an updated
 driver for Intel since the existing driver for Windows 10 Anniversary edition would still work for Creators Update. Mind if I recommend that you roll back your Intel driver to, let's say, a year ago? or maybe to a version where it worked perfectly in the Anniversary
 edition before updating to Creators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this while researching issues that are the same as yours, <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Intel+hd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the Microsoft Update catalog</a>. It has all driver updates for Windows 10, I saw the driver for your Intel graphics card, however, it is dated back 2016. Could you try installing it on your computer? Before you install or do anything to your computer, make
 a system image first. This way if it complicates things, you would have a backup. Bookmark this link or take note of it to know how to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
backup and restore Windows</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the other issues, let's try to work on that some other time. Late's focus on your resolution.</p>

<h2>            Unable to install WMP 11, or 10, or reinstall WMP 9</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to get WMP to work on a 9 year old HP Pavilion.&nbsp; I reinstalled the OS, ( XP Home ) did all the HP updates so I could get all service packs and updates done.&nbsp; Windows Media Player 9 worked.&nbsp; Today, I try to upgrade to WMP 11 and it will not complete.&nbsp;
 Version 9 will no longer work.&nbsp; I uninstall Version 11 from Add/Remove programs and rollback to version 9 but 9 will not work.&nbsp; I search and look for all updates/fixes and do not know what to do now.&nbsp; I did try upgrading to WMP 10 but it always as version
 9 says that it is not installed right and asks me if I want to go to Microsoft to get the latest version?&nbsp; IN all of this, I get a message that says, DRM Migrate EXE needs to close.&nbsp; I did go to see if that folder existed after reading about deleting it and
 it is not there.&nbsp; Can you help me get ANY version of WMP to work?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Samhrutha</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.&nbsp; I have done as you asked and this is the results:</p>
<p>You asked... [<span><span>Do you receive any error message or error code when you try to install Windows media player 11?]&nbsp;</span></span>Upon trying to install WMP 11, I believe I recieved
 the same error message as for WMP 10, "DRM Migrate EXE has encountered a problem and needs to close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to open WMP 9 I get a message saying it was not installed propperly and the message asks me if I want to go to the Microsoft web site to get a fresh copy.</p>
<p>The same message box appears when trying to run WMP 10 and 11.&nbsp; Actually, the install goes to the last screen where you can pick the file types WMP will open such as DVD, or wave, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no DRM folder in the AllUsers folder but the registry key was there for DRM and I deleted it.&nbsp; I went to install WMP 10 as you instructed and it went as usual and in the middle of the instalation the message box "DRM Migrate EXE" message box pops
 up.&nbsp; Last night, I uninstalled SP3 wondering if that would have any effect and it did not help.&nbsp; I down loaded a copy of SP3 today but am waiting to see what you have to say before I reinstall it.&nbsp; WMP worked fine a few days ago until trying to upgrade.&nbsp; I
 wish I had not tried to upgrade!&nbsp; I went to the WMP folder under program files and in the Installer folder found a file to install WMP 9.&nbsp; There were actually 2 files in there... One was wmp9xp.exe at 9.66MB and the other file named mpsetup.exe was 13.3MB
 in size.&nbsp; Neither of these helped.&nbsp; Instalation goes completely through until you choose file types and then the next message is "Windows Media Player is not properly installed."</p>
<p>Please tell me what to try next.... and thank you!</p>
<p>Glenn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wanted to add...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could not upgrade this computer to SP2 until I did many HP file upgrades and then finally I ran a batch file that did something with cryptographic services and it renamed some dll's and other files and then I thi9nk it restarted cryptographic service and
 then I could do all the security fixes and service packs.&nbsp; I had read on the HP web site what needed to be done before applying service packs but even after doing all they said, it was this batch file that did the trick.&nbsp; I will copy and paste it's contents

            That batch file seems to do a lot of fiddling with system DLLs and the system catalog, so it definitely wouldn't surprise me if this is the cause of your problem. I suggest that you use System Restore to roll back the system to a restore point from before
 you ran the batch file.

<p>I hear what you are saying. However, before running this batch file I could not upgrade past Service Pack 1.&nbsp; All file updates in HP did not help.&nbsp; Today, I am up to all updates and Service Pack 3 and with only half a gig of ram this old computer is running
 great.&nbsp; Windows Media Player worked through all upgrades until trying to upgrade to WMP 11.&nbsp; So, I hate to think of it, but I might have to go all the way back to the beginning and spend days of updates and service packs and then avoid WMP11.&nbsp; I am still hoping
 someone will come up with a fix.&nbsp; Seems this has been buggy to many people besides me.</p>

<p>Hello gwoiler,</p>
<p>I found this suggestion on another forum where the user had the same error message as you and was able to correct the issue.&nbsp;You might try and see if it helps.<br />
From briguy: Remove the drm folder and delete the registry keys associated with it and then uninstall windows media player. And then reinstall the media player and update the video card driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helped to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion.&nbsp; I saw this post already and went to delete the DRM folder.. or tried anyway.&nbsp; It was not there.&nbsp; I did however delete the registry keys.&nbsp; It is impossible to uninstall WMP9.&nbsp; I did however uninstall WMP10 and also WMP11 one
 at a time after installing trying to find any combination that would help.&nbsp; I have been to the HP site and followed all their upgrade suggestions. I will see if I can upgrade the display drivers.</p>
<p>Thank you!<br />

<p>It's the way they have the system set up. I'm not sure why, but as long as your card is attached to an active gold subscription you can't remove it. You have to wait until the account reverts to silver.</p>

<p>I suggest you choose the .ISO file option, since you can reuse it for multiple options. Click
<strong>Next</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>USB flash drive</strong></p>
<p>If you have a thumb drive with 3 GBs of available space, you can use that to create a bootable copy. Thumb drives are very cheap these days, so pick up a couple and create one as your first backup option. This is especially recommended for persons using
 Ultrabooks which do not include optical drives (DVD) or Netbooks. There are some desktop systems that do not include one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>ISO file</strong></p>
<p>An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank DVD. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO and burn it using the built in Disc Image
 utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.
