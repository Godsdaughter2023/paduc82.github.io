<h2>            screen time limits in microsoft family</h2>
                    i am having a terrible time trying to set up screen time limits for my child in windows and his xbox one.&nbsp; i've signed in and out of my account and the child's account a dozen times, sending the email invite to join the family and otherwise following the
 instructions.&nbsp; ultimately though it's not adding the child and letting me set the screen time limits.&nbsp; advice?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi  ag63ag 
<br />
<br />It would suggest one of two things, the account if a Family Account or the NTUser.dat file is corrupt.
<br />
<br />If the other account is setup as a family account, sign into your Your Family at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> 
<br />
<br />Under the account, click More options, click Remove from family.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can sign into the account again.
<br />
<br />Change the account privilege 
<br />
<br />It is possible there is a profile issue, you could try changing the account privileges to Standard User from Administrator to see if it logs you in.
<br />
<br />In your current account
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Users tab
<br />Select the account, then click Disconnect
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the other account
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Group Membership
<br />Select Standard user
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK again
<br />
<br />Restart the machine, the try logging into the account. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, then it suggest NTUser.dat might be corrupt. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type view advanced system settings
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under User Profiles, click Settings
<br />For the affected profile, click Delete
<br />
<br />Select your user profile or another user profile that is able to log on successfully. 
<br />Click Copy To..
<br />Click Browse then save it somewhere on your drive
<br />Rename it to something else
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; system drive where Windows is installed
<br />Open the Users folder
<br />Open the troubled profiled
<br />Go to the View tab, then check off Hidden items in Show/Hide
<br />
<br />The NTUser.dat with backed up earlier, copy it into this folder
<br />
<br />Restart, then check if you can log in.

    <title>Forza Horizon 3 is only Loading a JPG image not the game when i press - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 is only Loading a JPG image not the game when i press play</h2>
                    <br />

<p>Forza Horizon 3 is only Loading a JPG image not the game when i press play, ive followed the steps provided by microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted profile data associated with the game and availability of updates for the game are two of the primary factors that we have to take into consideration when troubleshooting issues with launching a game on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are troubleshooting solutions that you may perform to resolve this concern:<br />
<em><strong>Solution 1: Run troubleshooter</strong></em></p>
<p>The Windows apps troubleshooter can help resolve issues with apps and games downloaded from the Windows Store. Click this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>&nbsp;to
 run this troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Solution 2: Check for updates</strong></em><br />
If you've downloaded the game from the Windows Store, you may manually search if there are updates available for the game. As for the steps, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/b5e4e2e4-cc9d-47ef-8782-7a1c81e735ef/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check
 for updates for apps and games from Windows Store</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also recommended to keep your device up-to-date. This can help resolve common issues with games on Windows 10. See&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/c4a6d3df-d0d4-42b6-0018-ca48577f9909/update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update
 Windows 10</a>&nbsp;for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Solution 3: Reset the game from the Settings menu</strong></em><br />
Resetting the game from the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;menu can help restore corrupted game installation files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Find the game and click&nbsp;<strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device so that the changes can take effect. Launch the game and check if you'll encounter the same issue.​​</li></ol>
<p><em><strong>Solution 4: Delete Temporary files</strong></em></p>
<p>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may also cause issues running games on Windows
 10. To resolve this, we suggest that you perform the following steps on how to remove temporary files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click<strong>&nbsp;Start&nbsp;</strong>and click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>This PC</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Temporary files</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Temporary files</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Remove files</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device so that the changes can take effect. Launch the game and check if you'll encounter the same issue</li></ol>
<p>that **** dont work, ive reinstalled the game couple of times and still nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then the installation was at fault,or youre user account isn't a administrative account,edit,+ remove</p>
<p>parental software..Also,if installation was ok,try R.clicking on the game start-up icon/properties,</p>
<p>compatability tab,run in older Win OS,XP would be ok..</p>
<p>Also,temp files get accessed by going to run,or cmd,type:&nbsp; %Temp%&nbsp; select all,delete all,exit.Also,type:</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\Temp&nbsp; select all,delete all,some will not as they are in use,next run diskclean-up</p>

<p><span>I recently installed Windows 7, Home Premium as a single user. Apparently the “automatic upgrade” is changing my settings. In OUTLOOK, I cannot “hyperlink”:
 clicking on a hyperlink I get this message: “This operation has been canceled due to restrictions on this computer. Please contact your system administrator”. I am a single user, I have never set up any “restrictions”. What can I do to fix this and get back
 to operating “hyperlinks???”.</span></p>

                    <p>Just wanting to know why I can get a communication ban for swearing on a game that's 18. I mostly play Call of duty and Friday the 13th and those games have lots of swearing and violence but when&nbsp;I&nbsp;try to swear in frustration or anything like that I get banned for 2 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>It's annoying that the Xbox one's code of conduct doesn't let you say anything without it being reported.&nbsp;They're censoring people and taking away they're freedom of speech.&nbsp;I know that hate speech and racism shouldn't be allowed,&nbsp;But can swearing get you banned when the game you where playing was meant for people who are over the age of 18. I'd also like to say that being banned for 2 weeks is too long why not just 1 week for the first 2 suspensions and if you keep getting reported then it should be added up to 2&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Not being able to talk to your friends in anyway is also not fair.&nbsp;If I was suspended by some random player I met online then

            <p>I also upgraded from the Xbox One to Xbox One X, but after using it for a while (on the same games), i also have the problem that sometimes the screen turns black, and comes back on again.

            <p>I found my problem: At some point i have checked the option&nbsp;"Allow YCC 4:2:2" at Display &amp; sound/Advanced video settings. After unchecking, my 4K/HDR games work fine, and no more connection loss with my TV. So be sure to see if it is checked. When you select this option, the Xbox explains that this option will help out 4K problems with some tv's. Since mine has no problems with this option unchecked, it does not need to be turned on.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I hope this info&nbsp;also helps out other gamers. So if your tv does not work properly with 4K HDR games with this option unchecked, you might try to turn this option on, and see if that helps.</p>

<p>I also have an Xbox one X with a 65” Samsang Nu8000 tv. origanial hdmi cable that it came with. Work fine for me for about 4 months then flickered and got black screen and eventual stayed black. I returned it for repair and got it back but it was a different
 xbox one x. Set that one up no issues, then it ran its update and returned to the home screen started flickering and then eventual turned black again with no signal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I messed with settings to try and fix it before it went black again. Turned off freesync, i turnen ycc 422 off and on, changed to 10 bit color, none of this worked. I also switched back to my original xbox one and it worked fine with the same hdmi cable
 i used for the X. I tried hooking up the xbox on a different tv still same flickering and black screen. I have &nbsp;a feeling it is a software problem. I think the updates ruined my xbox. But why did 2 different xbox one x’s do the same thing?&nbsp;</p>

I solved my flickering by trying diff cables. I believe the cable that stopped the fluttering was the supplied cable that came with the Xbox.

            Hello,
<br />I'm Samuel, I'm a Microsoft expert. I will help you in this case today.
<br />
<br />1. Back up
<br />
<br />Before starting the modification process, we recommend making a backup copy of the files, since a problem may occur and it is better to be alert. Whenever you are going to modify something preset of the System, you must make a backup of your Windows 10 to avoid losses.
<br />
<br />2. Change default font in Windows
<br />
<br />Step 1
<br />
<br />The first step to take is to enter the control panel using one of the following methods.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Step 2
<br />
<br />In this window we select the Appearance and personalization option.
<br />
<br />step 3
<br />
<br />There we choose the Sources option and we will see the following. As we see we have a large number of font options and we must define which font we want to set in Windows 10.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />Step 4
<br />
<br />To adjust the new font we will open the notebook and enter the following.
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />&nbsp;
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ Fonts]
<br />"Segoe UI (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)" = ""
<br />"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)" = ""
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ CurrentVersion \ FontSubstitutes]
<br />&nbsp;
<br />"Segoe UI" = "New Source"
<br />Step 5
<br />
<br />In this case we have chosen the Comic Sans MS font.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />Step 6
<br />
<br />Proceed to go to File / Save as and there select the option All files, assign a name to the file and indicate that the extension should be .reg
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Step 7
<br />
<br />We can see that our file has been created on the desktop, in this case called the source. You can find the source.reg file inside the compressed file source.zip at the end of the tutorial to download it.
<br />
<br />Step 8
<br />
<br />Double click on it to apply the changes. We will see the following message which we must accept.
<br />
<br />Step 9
<br />
<br />We see that the change has been satisfactory.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Step 10
<br />
<br />We restart the system to apply the changes made. We can see the changes of the source in the entire Operating System environment.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have any other questions, feel free to write again. Thank you!
<br />
<br />I sincerely hope I have been useful.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />Samuel

            Hello JoeyBlur 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. 
<br />
<br />Important: Before you go through this guide, it's worth noting that modifying the registry is risky, and it can cause irreversible damage to your installation if you don't do it correctly. It's recommended to make a full backup of your system before proceeding. Alternatively, you can create a system restore point, which will also help you to revert the changes you make using this guide.
<br />
<br />* Open Control Panel.
<br />
<br /> Open the Fonts option.
<br />
<br />* See the font available on Windows 10 and note the exact name of the font you want to use (e.g., Arial, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, etc.).
<br />
<br />* Open Notepad.
<br />
<br />* Copy and paste the following registry code into the text file:
<br />_______________________________________________________________
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts]
<br />"Segoe UI (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)"=""
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes]
<br />
<br />"Segoe UI"="ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME"
<br />_______________________________________________________________
<br />
<br />* In registry code above, make sure to replace ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME with the name of the font you want to use like Courier New.
<br />
<br />* Click File.
<br />
<br />* Click Save As.
<br />
<br />* Under "Save as type," select All Files, and name your file anything you want with the .reg extension.
<br />
<br />* Click Save.
<br />
<br />* Double-click your new .reg file to merge into the registry.
<br />
<br />* Click Yes.
<br />
<br />* Click OK.
<br />
<br />* Restart your computer to complete the task.
<br />
<br />* Once your computer restarts, you should see the new font family throughout the elements, including on File Explorer, message box, taskbar, and apps that make use of the default system font.

    <title>Can I transfer Points from one Gamertag to Another&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomdawg28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I transfer Points from one Gamertag to Another&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so I set up a GOLD XBOX LIVE membership on my wrong account (incorrect birth date).&nbsp;On that account is where my points are from a gift card I received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1.&nbsp; Is it possible to move Points from one GamerTag to another?&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to change my WINDOWS LIVE ID associated with my gamertag, and the points remained, but now its obvious to me that the age didn't change on my new GamerTag even though my new WINDOWS
 LIVE ID birthdate (age) is correct.</p>
<p>#2.&nbsp; How do I know....BEFORE I DO IT, what the Birth Date is associated with each of my Gamer Tags?&nbsp; I thought it tied directly to the WINDOWS LIVE ID associated with the Gamer Tag, but this isn't correct as I realized last night.&nbsp; Because I created a new
 WINDOWS LIVE ID with my correct Age, then changed the WINDOWS LIVE ID associated with my Gamer Tag, and then purchased GOLD XBOX LIVE, and still, it is not recognizing the new age.&nbsp; Before saying NO YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR AGE....can you give advise on what
 to do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize the AGE question is asked over and over here.&nbsp; The folks on this forum are probably frustrated with it.&nbsp; But....it is obviously an issue at sign-up. There must be more emphasis placed on the importance of AGE in sign-up.&nbsp; Because, I rarely ever
 use my correct age when signing up for anything.&nbsp; And, obviously, thousands of others are in the same situation.</p>
<p>Advise outside of one word answers would really help me, as all I want to do is play EA Sports--MADDEN.</p>
<p>Thanks again,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player only recognizes song titles when imported from - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Player only recognizes song titles when imported from itunes, imported as wav files.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have imported/ripped music as wav files using WMP first and imported them into itunes so that I can sync them w/ my ipod, but itunes only recognized the first few words of the music info (usually the song number, title, ect). Itunes would not allow
 me to edit the info. So I decided to import my 7,000 plus songs again using itunes, with the hopes of WMP finding the songs via monitored folders. Well, it did, but it only identified the song number and title. Now I have a long other/unknown list.</p>
<p>I can get the information in WMP via "Find album info", one song at a time, but that would take forever. I've imported 318 songs thus far. I'm using wav files to maintain sound quality.&nbsp; Can someone tell me an easier way?</p>

<p>WAV has very poor tagging support. WMP only adds some tags to WAV files when ripping, which can't be changed afterwards, and which iTunes probably doesn't read. See&nbsp;<a href="http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/WAV.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/WAV.htm</a>
 for more info.</p>
<p>If you want to tag the music without any problems, you should switch to another format, such as MP3. If sound quality is a concern, use a high bitrate (like 320 kbps). If you really want to keep it lossless, then you can also switch to lossless MPEG-4 (ALAC).</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me know. Currently, the option to change the PIN remotely or by afar is not yet available in Windows 10. You can only change the PIN of a computer through the Settings apps and when it's physically available. Though, since you've changed
 your Microsoft account password, there's a possibility that your computer may ask to verify the new password first before they can use the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I encourage you to submit your suggestion using the Feedback Hub so. You can either vote on an existing submission or submit a new item. When you submit a feedback item we gather additional details and information about your issue that will
 help determine what’s causing it and address it. Feedback items regularly receive Microsoft responses on the submissions in the Feedback app so you can see what we are doing about your feedback. Please revisit frequently to see the status of your feedback
 items. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in Cortana search, then launch the app.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press + Add new feedback.</p>
<p>3. Select the Problem, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.</p>
<p>4. Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done.</p>
<p>5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click Submit.</p>
<p>6. Click Continue using Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>7. Click My feedback at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).</p>
<p>8. Open the item you submitted, then click Share.</p>
<p>9. Click Copy link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/ link&gt;)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Windows update issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a HP Touchsmart Desktop computer with Windows 7 Home Premium with SP1 (64).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a total novice to alot of this stuff!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen errors in the Event Viewer pertaining to Windows Updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just discovered that I have some issues dating back to January 6, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, my computer's hard drive was replaced&nbsp;&nbsp; and
 I notice that the very first error in the event viewer happened during this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just went through the event viewer from that time until today&nbsp; and saw several errors with the WUSA.exe file. &nbsp; I understand this is connected to windows updates? &nbsp;&nbsp; It
 looks like I am missing some updates from what I can tell.&nbsp; Below, is the first error I saw in the Event viewer dating back to Jan. 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think changing the hard drive had something to do with it but, I am just now discovering these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason
 I say that is because&nbsp; this all started on the same date.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>January 7, 2016</strong>&nbsp; - Event ID 3&nbsp; - Under Windows log in Setup:</p>
<p>Windows update could not be installed because of error 2359302 " " (Command line: " " C:\Windows\Sys WOW64\wusa.exe " "</p>
<p>C:\Users\Sharon\App Data\Local\Temp\Windows 6.1 - KB2919469-x64.msu&nbsp; " ")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is the last one ending <strong>January 30, 2017 </strong></p>
<p>The same type of problem only </p>
<p>Error:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2149842967</p>
<p>Command line:&nbsp; WUSA.exe C:\program files(x86)\microsoft office\root\integration\windows 6.1-KB 2999226 - x86.msu</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have seen several of these error since Jan. 2016&nbsp; up until now.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Do I need to do a system repair? &nbsp; I noticed if I understand correctly in the Microsoft windows update catalog&nbsp; there are some driver updates for the win 7 but, I don't know how to recognize
 what is for my computer and what I need to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I am looking right,&nbsp; it looks like I may have to reinstall windows?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I AM CONFUSING!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THERE ARE ALOT OF ERRORS AND WARNINGS IN THE EVENT VIEWER.&nbsp;&nbsp; CAN SOMEONE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I have a Dell 5523 that started life with Win 8, now Win 10.&nbsp; The problem is that the Cumulative Updates keep failing with errors like "2017-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4019472) - Error 0x8e5e0147".</p>
<p>Restarting it is useless, it just fails again.</p>
<p>I have tried updating manually with Windows Update Standalone (wusa.exe) but it fails every time at the very end.&nbsp; I have tried a number of things but nothing seems to work.&nbsp;
<br />
This is what I am seeing in the Event log<br />
16/05/2017 08:30:33<br />
Windows update "Security Update for Windows (KB4019472)" could not be installed because of error 2388525383 "" (Command line: ""C:\WINDOWS\SysWoW64\wusa.exe" "C:\Users\SysName\AppData\Local\Temp\windows10.0-kb4019472-x64_dda304140351259fcf15ca7b1f5b51cb60445a0a.msu"

<p>
</p><p>In view of the recent threat I would really like to get this one resolved, hopefully without resetting the PC.</p>

    <title>SOLVED - Windows 8 upgrade on dual boot machine with Ubuntu 12.04.1 - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SOLVED - Windows 8 upgrade on dual boot machine with Ubuntu 12.04.1 - Windows 8 installation has failed</h2>
                    Hi, I have Windows 7 dual booted with Ubuntu 12.04.1.&nbsp; I started to upgrade to Windows 8 after buying the upgrade offer. I uninstalled un-compatible software (MS Security Essentials) and started to upgrade and the installation failed with error ' Windows
 8 installation has failed. I looked at C:\windows\setuperr.log and the file was empty.<br />
<br />
GRUB is currently being used for dual boot for Win7 and Ubuntu12.04.1. My laptop is new Lenovo P580, i7-quad-core, 8GB Ram, lots of free hard drive space.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to upgrade to Windows 8 from windows 7 if the machine is currently also has Ubuntu 12.04.1 on other partition? Are there any other installation logs that I can look at?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            In case this helps anyone the above didn't work for me, but the following did.
<div><br />
<div>Details: Brand new lenovo t430, dual boot with Ubuntu 12.10 &nbsp;and the stock install Win7SP1.</div>
<div>I tried everything both on this thread and in the helpful summary here:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/using-the-windows-8-upgrade-assistant-to-download/0ba09714-38f2-4ca1-b629-638f36c0808f
<div><br />
<div>(ie. I reflashed the BIOS to the latest version, removed *all* installed programs, used a clean boot, tried both the legacy mode and 'both' mode on the UEFI BIOS. &nbsp;Tear out hair. Curse MS. No luck.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Solution: Then I realised that on my GRUB loader screen there were *two* Win7 boot options. &nbsp;One on /dev/sda1 and on on /dev/sda2. &nbsp;I'd always booted into /dev/sda2, because the 1st time I'd tried sda1 it had gone through some sort of windows check-disk
 process and I'd assumed it was a safe-boot or similar. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In any event, booting via /dev/sda1 and then starting the upgrade process and using sda1 on all the interim reboots during the upgrade did the trick. &nbsp;Win8 installed fine. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if you have two GRUB Win7 boot options that work and you get upgrade failures on one, then maybe try the other.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <u><b>**SOLVED**</b></u><br />
1. Stopped most processes from the win task manager and tried the&nbsp; installed again as suggested on other threads. It did not help. Windows 8 installation has failed.<br />
2. Deleted "Temp" folder from C:/users/ folder and started the install again but it did not help. Windows 8 installation has failed.<br />
3. Uninstalled pre-install Lenovo software (You Cam, and many others) and started the install again after restart. Windows 8 installation has failed.<br />
4. Uninstalled Dropbox, LibreOffice, Office 2010 starter-edition and restarted machine and restarted the install but it did not help. Windows 7 installation has failed.<br />
5. Uninstalled Adobe, JDK 1.7 and others to a point I had no more applications to install. Restarted the machine and&nbsp; finally Windows 8 installation was successful after few restarts as was expected.<br />
6. At this moment I can boot to Win8 or Ubuntu 12.04.1 from my old Grub OS selection menu. The menu option still say Windows 7 however.<br />
<br />
So the answer to my question about is it possible to upgrade win7 to win8 on a dual boot system that had Ubuntu 12.04.1&nbsp;&nbsp; YES.<br />
<br />
System update was done and some of the applications I needed are installed and working so the system is stable now.<br />
<br />
Thanks and I hope this helps someone else.<br />

 type "net user" followed by my login name<span>, &nbsp;and hit enter. &nbsp;After doing that, &nbsp;it shows the following:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a very&nbsp;similar issue.&nbsp; Am using a new&nbsp;Surface Pro 3 i7 8GB RAM 256GB SSD and just got the Netgear PTV 3000.&nbsp; The device works great for mirroring my smartphone but my SP3 doesn't even see it.&nbsp; When I set it up and did the Netgear firmware update,
 the SP3 did see the Push2TV Wifi signal and I was able to upgrade the PTV firmware using my SP3.&nbsp; However, after that, my SP3 fails to 'see' the display.&nbsp; I followed all the directions to "Add a wireless display" and after searching for new&nbsp;devices it says
 'none found'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in device manager, it shows that it tried to connect with the&nbsp;PTV3000 over&nbsp;Miracast (and says it is the latest driver version) but failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP3 has been upgraded to the 8/19/2014 latest firmware update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help???? this is very frustrating and should work right out of the box (just as easily as my Galaxy S4 smartphone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<div>&nbsp;can you go into device manager and DELETE the device (and if it asks, delete</div>
<div>driver). shut down and reboot, what happens?</div>

<p>Upon restarting my netbook, it only asked me to press F2 to go to Setup but it doesn't take me to the BIOS.

            <p>Are you sure your Netbook even supports Hardware Assisted Virtualization. I am not aware of ATOM processors having HAV.

<em>Virtualization</em> Technology List</a>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft had updated Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode last year removing the HAV requirement, make sure you have downloaded this update.
</p>
<p>Both Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC can be downloaded from http://www.windows.com/business/downloads.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Loading BIOS:</strong></p>
<p>Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</p>
<p>Turn on your computer, insert the Windows installation disc, and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>Newer computers often display a startup (or boot) menu. On the startup menu, select "BIOS setup," or "BIOS settings," or something similar.
</p>
<p>Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. Usually, you must press a key (such as F2, F12, Delete, Esc) or a key combination immediately after you turn on your computer but before Windows starts. For more information, check the information that
 came with your computer or go to the computer manufacturer's website. </p>
<p><strong>Enabling HAV</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows do not fit on screen after screen resolution change to 800x600</h2>
                    this is a brand new Dell desktop, using a 19" LCD screen. &nbsp;I changed screen resolution to the recommended setting. &nbsp;Worked fine, however, the person using the screen has bad eye sight. &nbsp;I changed to 800x600, that worked fine, however, now a few windows
 are too large to view, i.e. in the print window the OK, Cancel button are outside the screen area, also the "compose new email" window (Windows Live Mail) doesn't fit. &nbsp;
<div>Yes, I tried moving the screen around. &nbsp;This is a brand new box, so all drivers are good. &nbsp;I am not having this trouble with another new PC that I installed at the same time.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm a little new to Windows 7, are there any additional settings that control the size of individual windows? &nbsp;I can't duplicate this on a Windows Vista or XP machine.&nbsp;</div>

            Put the display resolution back to the native one. Then from the other person's account change the DPI, text size, etc.<br />

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t find volume control&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I got this Xbozone for Christmas. I was able to control the volume until just a couple of days ago, by going to the little settings icon on the left of my home page. A window would appear on the left, with a volume slider at the top. But suddenly, the volume
 of the headphones is deafening, and the volume slider isn't there any more. When I go to the little settings icon, there's another gear that says "All settings". I go into that, and there's an option for "Display &amp; Sound". I go into that, and there's a "Volume"
 option. But nothing in the "Volume" page lets me simply change the volume of the sound coming out of the console.</p>
<p>There is also a "TV &amp; OneGuide" option, which I read about in an article that talks about changing the volume; there's an "Audio &amp; Video" option there, but nothing for controlling the volume.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about controlling my TV volume with the Xbozone. I'm talking about changing the volume of the console output for my headphones, which I was able to do until just a couple of days ago. Thanks to anyone who can advise me.</p>

<p>I know in the recent update they did make some changes to the system but I am sure if you are using Xbox one compatible headsets, meaning that on the connector that goes into the controller it will have three rings on it. If the console recognizes your headset
 you will find the volume controls in the settings menu when you go to settings, it will be right before you click on all settings if the console is actually reading the headset.</p>

    <title>Afterglow Wired Controller not connecting properly to PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viewtifulmatt13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Afterglow Wired Controller not connecting properly to PC</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have a Lenovo Y500 running windows 8.1 64bit and I recently ran into some trouble hooking up my wired xbox controller.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>The controller itself is a PCP Wired Xbox 360 Afterglow and had been running fine for over a month and suddenly stopped working. The controller presently may get lucky and manage to connect properly but stops working within 10 minutes of doing so.</div>
<div>When it doesn't connect properly, I get one of 3 error codes, 10, 43, or 45.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sometimes the controller connects and registers as a controller, other times I get a message with the USB device being unrecognized and I have to manually assign a driver.</div>
<div>I searched all over for different solutions but haven't managed to figure out a working one. I've uninstalled the drivers and re-installed them in a bunch of different ways using the official driver software on the microsoft site. I tried getting older
 driver software and using that with no success. Manually selecting the appropriate drivers, manually installing the driver files, I even managed to do a wipe and got it where the controller automatically had the drivers installed, but that also failed once
 it finished.</div>
<div>I'm confident it isn't the usb port that I'm using since I've tried all three and none of them work with it, not to mention every other device I plug into them works flawlessly.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't think the driver itself is the issue, since I have macbook pro running bootcamp with Windows 8 64bit as well. &nbsp;It was using an older driver so I thought maybe there was an issue with the new version of the driver, but I just updated the driver
 on there and the controller still works just fine, also ruling out the possibility of the controller or its cable being the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The only real difference between the two computers is that I haven't downloaded the latest Windows update on my macbook, whereas my Lenovo I just updated.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm curious to see if anyone help is having controller issues with the latest update or if perhaps somebody may know another cause of this issue within the update.</div>
<div>Presently the controller is assigned to the&nbsp;6.2.9200.16384 version of the driver and will return&nbsp;</div>
<div>code 10:&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Insufficient system resources exist to complete the API."</div>
<div>The system seldom gives the same error twice in a row and cycles randomly between different code 10 error messages, code 43, and code 45.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I unplug it and plug it back it, the system doesn't recognize the device at all and the player lights on the center of the controller will flash for a moment and turn off. Seems I can get it to work again by manually assigning the driver, and the player
 1 light will come on, but it still ceases functionality a short time after and the controller doesn't register any input from the buttons.</div>
<div>I have also been contacting xbox support as well as the microsoft answerdesk and each points me to the other for a solution. I'm getting really tired of this round robin they have me in and would just like to be able to use my controller again.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suspect the issue lies with the driver or the registry keys at this point, but I'm still not certain.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any feedback or suggestions would be welcomed as I am extremely frustrated at this point.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As this is a 3rd party controller, you'd need to contact the company that made this controller.<br />
<br />
Their support can be found <strong><a href="http://www.pdp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They can't provide any support. They have no drivers or software to get their controller working on the PC. They simply point towards microsoft's official drivers to get it to work.</p>
<p>As I said above, their drivers work just fine on my other computer, I don't know why it isn't working on this one.</p>

<p>Ok, so after reading this post I was a little unhappy as I have one of these controllers and I have Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>However, low and behold I managed to get it working. Here's what I did.</p>
<p>I downloaded the XBox 360 driver pack for Windows 7 (Yes, I am quite aware I have Windows 8.1) :
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.microsoft.com/.../xbox-360-controller-for-windows</a></p>
<p>I installed the driver pack and connected the controller. Device manager advised that there was NO driver for the After Glow Controller. Trying to go through the Manual Driver update is fruitless and just hangs device manager.</p>
<p>Here's what I did next.</p>
<p>Leaving the controller connected to the USB port, I rebooted the machine. As the machine booted up, the driver was installed and all was good. If you go to &nbsp;Devices and Printers, the controller shows up as an AfterGlow Gamepad for XBox 360. To test, I removed
 the controller and re inserted it, still good. I unplugged the controller and shut the machine down. Started it back up and logged in, then plugged the controller in, and it's still working.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I suggest regular users not try to moderate. My Afterglow worked fine on my old machine, and when I build a new Win 7 rig suddenly I couldn't get it working. So I'm searching through old threads to see if there is any solution. Is it a 3rd party controller?
 Yes it is.. but my Asus Z97 Pro Intel i74790k and EVGA 780ti SC aren't Microsoft either... and it's good to go back to Xbox forums because I know I'm not the only one who owns an Xbox 360, Xbox One, and a gaming PC that runs Microsoft Windows. I'll try what
 was suggested and see if that works, cause when was the last time you've seen a wired Xbox controller or an adapter for PC?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The compression method used in Windows 10 is NTFS Lempel-Ziv which is a lossless method.<br />
<br />
1. Don't compress your Windows drive (and the OS already uses compression).<br />
<br />
2. Don't compress SSD drives as it causes more reads and writes which will wear out the drive UNLESS space is the real issue and can't be avoided and see 1.
<br />
<br />
3. Compressing music and video is mostly a waste of time and slows the system down to boot.<br />
<br />
4. Computers with older slower processors usually do poorly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>Can you elaborate on this point? Why is writing less data to an SSD and reading less data from it (the compression/decompression is naturally done in RAM) not a good idea?</p>

            <p>It does not write less data it writes more as it has to write to compress any file. And same for read as it has to&nbsp;decompress the file to read it.<br />
<br />
That is a well known issue with using compression on SSD.<br />

            <p>Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you elaborate on the statement about writing more data to compress a file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we are creating a new file, Windows creates a buffer in memory and writes the data there. Then it compresses the data (still in memory) and then writes the compressed data to the drive. Reading, it reads the compressed data from the ssd to a memory buffer
 and then uncompresses the data in memory for the application to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least that's the way it has always worked in the past versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying it writes uncompressed data to the ssd, then reads that, compresses and writes the now compressed data to the ssd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you also explain why Windows would use a different method on an ssd vs a standard hdd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a reference where MS have explained the process(in detailed terms) I'd be happy to follow that up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

Gordon, you took the words right out of my mouth. I mean, it's clear that the very first time the drive's compressed all the data will need to be read and written back compressed, so that's a one-time hit. But subsequently as I mentioned and you elaborated,
 compression should ensure that less data is read and written as compared to the same file(s) uncompressed. I too could not find anything on TechNet to the contrary that might explain why what seems logical to us is actually incorrect.

            You are on the right track. And don't assume that everything will be done in memory. Memory may not be available or have other priorities. File sizes can be huge or there are&nbsp;multiple files. Think about what actually happens when a file is decompressed.<br />

<p>Hmm, I suppose when there's a paucity of free RAM the file will need to be decompressed on disk. However, I'd still be interested to know whether any proper research has been conducted to see whether in real world usage situations the increased writes due
 to lack of free memory offset the advantages of less data being written to disk when file size and memory availability are not an issue. Also, is the advice about not using NTFS compression on SSDs still relevant given modern devices with more than enough
<span>available program/erase cycles? It may well have been formulated back when SSDs had much shorter lifespans.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyway</span>, these aren't doubts/queries specifically directed at you but just those that occurred to me in general. The best solution of course would be to use a larger disk and no compression whenever possible, but IMO a scientific study of the
 real world impact of NTFS compression under typical loads on modern SSDs would be useful before one can definitely say whether it is a good idea or not.</p>
