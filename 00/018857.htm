<h2>            Was I hacked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I received a phone call from Microsoft Help &amp; Support.&nbsp; His name is John Miller and gave me the phone number 1-800-521-0984 and ID&nbsp;&nbsp; JO.0017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He took control remotely with my permission and I also had phone calls concerning a Trojan Horse virus they said was infecting my computer from 2 New York phone numbers 917-387-4691 and 646-544-9292.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?&nbsp; I am still not sure if this is legitimate or not.</p>

<h2>            IE-9 Favorites saved URLs disappear.</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 7 SP-1 and IE-9 browser.&nbsp; The last few days, I've noticed some of my saved favorite sites have disappeared from my Favorites folder.&nbsp; The folders are okay, just the saved favorite site is missing.&nbsp; I have gone back to the disappeared site
 and once again saved it to my Favorites, but they still disappear when I go back to my Favorites.&nbsp; It's random, not all sites.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've run my MS Essentials and found no virus.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking for suggestions.</p>

Other third-party programs are known causes of that symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most common one is an AV; however, I think an indexer was once implicated too.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, use msconfig Startup to change your Statup selectively to try to identify which could be the cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A more complete related tool is AutoRuns (available from TechNet).

<p><br />
I just gave you some examples of some programs which start at boot time and which are known to cause your symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the suggestion is to look at your Startup programs and try selectively eliminating them temporarily to see which ones could be causing your
 problem symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how soon it happens or how much effort you wanted to spend finding a cause an&nbsp;alternative would be to run ProcMon filtering on&nbsp; Path Contains Fav&nbsp; for File access events.&nbsp;&nbsp; A related one which I have seen mentioned but which I have never tried
 myself or know exactly what the results look like would be using File&nbsp;Permissions to set an audit event for a change to a Favorite.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that matter I suppose you could also try using File Permissions to try to prevent changes to a Favorite.&nbsp;&nbsp; There might
 even be a way of doing that in bulk using&nbsp; icacls.exe&nbsp; *.url&nbsp;&nbsp; /T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the syntax for listing them, including ones in subdirectories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't know what specific options should be tried to prevent changes by all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what we could do is use the GUI method to change the permissions of one, find out how that change is reported by icacls.exe and then try to figure out how to duplicate that change to one more item using the icacls command line.&nbsp;&nbsp; And doing that I found
 that this syntax would be equivalent to clicking Deny on Write</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>icacls.exe&nbsp; *.url&nbsp; /deny :w</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but only for Account:&nbsp; BUILTIN&nbsp; (whatever that is).&nbsp;&nbsp; So probably not enough to affect whatever it is that would be doing the changing.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. now I would have to try to find a syntax which would specify the denial should apply to all accounts, not just
 one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I don't know how to do that but one possibility that comes to mind would be putting the command in a for loop with each possible SID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW before doing these experiments I used</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>icacls&nbsp;&nbsp;*.url&nbsp; /save &nbsp; URLACLSaved&nbsp;&nbsp; (I only did it in a bottom level Links directory so didn't bother with the /T switch.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at that file suggests another tack might be possible for changing stuff in bulk, e.g. create a modification of the Save and then "Restore" it.&nbsp;&nbsp; That looks hairy and I still don't know how reliable a Restore will be anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I would go with my ProcMon suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone tried it a while ago and had success...&nbsp;</p>

    <title>One Note 2016 file naming conventions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            One Note 2016 file naming conventions</h2>
                    <p>Forgive my ignorance on three apparent default conventions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is a One Note 2016 "stub" file as opposed to a ".one" as opposed to a ".onetoc2" ?</p>
<p>2. Where is the default location created for a new notebook?</p>
<p>3. Where (and how) are Notebook back ups stored and are backups made automatically?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To start Internet Explorer without add-ons,</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, and select
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>, and select
<strong><span>System Tools.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong><span>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</span></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If your browser appears to be working properly in Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) mode, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing
 the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, go to method 2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Reinstall Java and check.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Refer to the suggestions from this link:</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, go to method 3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Let’s optimize Internet Explorer.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Another formula you could use to apply the CF at one go is COUNTIF<br />
Example, with the list of text entered into F1:F10<br />
select col A, then apply CF using:&nbsp;<br />
=COUNTIF($F$1:$F$10,A1)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Somewhere out of the way create a list of these text items you want to use, I used F1:F10. Then use this conditional format formula</p>
<p>=NOT(ISERROR(MATCH(A1,$F$1:$F$10,0)))</p>

    <title>How do I make an Outlook public calendar into a task bar quicklaunch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgmirkin  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make an Outlook public calendar into a task bar quicklaunch item in Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    Our office runs a mix of Windows XP Pro SP3 32-bit and Windows 7 Pro 32-bit.<br />
We just migrated from Office 2003 to Office 2010. [I know, right?? Yeah, it's like that...]<br />
So, once upon a time, it was possible to simply drag the Master Calendar from Public Folders --&gt; All Public Folders --&gt; Master Calendar1 to the quicklaunch bar. Presto, instant link to our office-wide master calendar. Life was good!<br />
Now, you drag the calendar to the quicklaunch area and it's a circle with a line through it. Is there NO way to do this in Outlook anymore, or has M$ just made it REALLY, REALLY ARCANELY DIFFICULT?<br />
<br />
I found this page:<br />
<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/command-line-switches-HP001003110.aspx<br />
<br />
But, as yet, it has not been terribly helpful, as I can't seem to find the right command line Syntax to get it to actually do what I want. Everything I've tried has just ended up opening the "Inbox" in a new window.<br />
<br />
So, when I right-click the master calendar and go to "Properties" it tells me it's in \\Public Folders - michael\All Public Folders\ and it is named... Well, we'll just call it "Master Calendar1". So, I assume the full path is \\Public Folders - michael\All
 Public Folders\Master Calendar1. Obviously the command line doesn't like spaces, so one has to put quotations around it, rendering:<br />
<br />
\\Public Folders - michael\All Public Folders\Master Calendar1<br />
<br />
I ASSUME this is the correct "path." So, from the previously mentioned page, I assume the correct method&nbsp; to open this path would be:<br />
<br />
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Outlook.exe" /select "\\Public Folders\All Public Folders\SDRI Master Calendar1"<br />
<br />
But, as you may have guessed because I'm here, it AIN'T WORKING!<br />
<br />
I've tried many variants. The page suggested using /select outlook:calendar, which DOES work but instead brings up the PERSONAL calendar and not the public master calendar. So, I assume it SHOULD be possible to specify the PUBLIC master calendar through some
 agency, if one can successfully open a PERSONAL calendar. I'm just not sure of the FULL and CORRECT syntax to get this done... My office mates would REALLY like to know the answer to this. Or at least for ME to know the answer to this so I can return them
 to being LAZY and just clicking a teeny tiny icon rather than searching through a bunch of folders for the master calendar. The fewer clicks they have to make to find something the happier (err, less-annoyed anyway) they are...<br />
<br />
If anyone can help me out on this, that would be lovely!<br />
<br />
Anyone got some WORKING syntax for this?<br />
<br />
Also, when I go to Run and swap in the \\Public Folders\All Public Folders\, it brings up nothing, says it can't find it. But, seemingly, that's maybe just a windows issue of not being able to find the folder.<br />
<br />
I guess my next question might be: Is \\Public Folders - michael\ local or on the server?<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Ohh wait... Eureka! I figured it out after much trial and tribulation. I had tried the correct solution, but incorrectly... Let me explain. I figured that maybe the outlook:calendar syntax might work. But I had been trying (after initial failure) a variety
 of options including just "\\Public Folders\All Public Folders\Master Calendar1" and I accidentally tried putting outlook: in front of that and it failed so I assumed that was the wrong approach.<br />
<br />
In fact it was the RIGHT approach, but the wrong path, since I took out the " - michael".<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Here's the successful solution in case anyone needs it:<br />
<br />
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Outlook.exe" /select "outlook:\\Public Folders - michael\All Public Folders\Master Calendar1"<br />
<br />
Wow, that was a pain in the hindquarters. They really need to bring back the simple drag/drop functionality...<br />
<br />
Now off to test whether I can just create a custom shortcut for it...<br />
<br />
Aha! It works! <br />
<br />
Today, I am full of WIN!<br />
<br />
So, the first path is the path to your copy of Outlook. The second path with outlook: in front of it is the path listed by right clicking your public calendar + the name of your calendar. Both need to be in quotes if there are any spaces in your path(s).<br />
<br />
So, one might say:<br />
<br />
"<i>path to Outlook.exe</i>" /select "outlook:<i>path to calendar</i> + <i>calendar name</i>"<br />
<br />
More or less.<br />
<br />
WIN! Go me!<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, in the process of asking the question, I actually managed to successfully resolve it on my own. See the 3rd section of my original post.<br />
<br />
"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Outlook.exe" /select "outlook:\\Public Folders - michael\All Public Folders\Master Calendar1"<br />
<br />
Or more generically (using the above as a template):<br />
<br />
"<i>path to Outlook.exe</i>" /select "outlook:<i>path to calendar</i> + <i>calendar name</i>"<br />
<br />
Seems to work well enough for what I need it to do... <br />
<br />
Hopefully someone else out there who has the same issue can benefit from my trials &amp; tribulations. :)<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

<h2>            Free Office vs Office 365 - what&#39;s the difference&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK... I'm assuming there must be some differences</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm super dissapointed with the free version you get as part of Onedrive</p>
<p>IMHO: it's the BEST online editor</p>
<p>BUT: it's no match for the Word program on a Mac or PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online one is lacking in sooo many ways in terms of interface</p>
<p>It seems sooo clunky</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>... I've only been using the free version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the paid version *exactly* like the actual Word program??</p>
<p>
</p><p>One annoying thing is no macros &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>OK, so I'm not sure how they could add macros into a web version - but I do use Macros to do specific things&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any replies would be great</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>With the Office 365 subscription, what you get is the "actual Word program." Actually, you get all the parts of Office you want, including language packs. You just download the parts you want, and you can download/install them on multiple systems/platforms.
 Additionally, as long as your subscription is in force, you will get the latest updates, including the next version when it is released. You always have the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, there are pros and cons to this, and if all you need is one copy of Office for a single machine, you may be happier with an Office 2013 local install. (I recommend buying a package that has actual install media, not a download.) You'll still get
 updates for that version as long as it's supported (which will be through the next couple of version releases), but there is no upgrade path: if you want the next version, you'll pay full price for it.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950xl via continuum - can&#39;t connect to an external desktop display&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointed in this device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Lumia 950xl a week ago in an effort to replace my laptop since I do not need all that processing power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I found out that, as a university student, this will not work because the display dock needs to be plugged in to a wall. I bought a large 10Ah external battery pack in an effort to find a solution to this problem but it won't power on the display dock
 with either 3.0x3.1 or 3.1x3.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, even when I am plugged into a wall socket, I can't connect it to any displays other than a TV... I bought the MB169B, MB 169B+ and AOS external monitors and it wouldn't run ANY of them because it won't install the necessary drivers. How am I suppose
 to use this unless I'm at home in front of my tv? Mc just lost a huge market (university students) because this isn't portable. The majority of people now a days need laptops, not desktops, and this is starting to seem more and more like its strictly a desktop
 substitute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time to return all the monitors, external battery, and phone. Hello Apple...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP or I am giving up on MC. They should have thought this through a little more before charging people top dollar for a prototype product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total waste of money.</p>

            Hello LucyinSM,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.

<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser?

<p><span>1. Sign out of the work and school account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. If you are using IE,&nbsp;clear IE cache via Tools&gt;Safety&gt;deleting browser history and&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(85, 26, 139, 1)">reset

<p><span>3. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Re-sign into the Office 365 portal and navigate to the SharePoint home page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, you can use another browser to check the outcome and provide us with some screenshots related to the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Emails to multiple recipients get stuck in Outbox when sent through Outlook.com account.</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed email providers from HughesNet to Outlook.com, and need to notify several hundred contacts of my new address. However when I put a Distribution List with more than just a few recipients in the BCC field the email gets stuck in the Outbox
 of my MS Office Outlook 2007 with Business Contact Manager. The error message reads: "Task *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Sending' reported error (0x8DE00006): 'The operation failed.'" I even added a cell phone number to my Outlook.com account as recommended to
 prevent this restriction of multiple recipients - to no avail.</p>
<p>HughesNet would let me have up to 50 recipients per email. How can I notify all these contacts without sending an individual email to each one?</p>
<p>My OS is Windows 10 Professional 32bit on my Dell Vostro 1400.</p>

<em>Have you tried to access your account using another browser or computer? Does the same issue happen?<br />
First make sure you are using the newest version of your browser.&nbsp; Some older browsers are no longer fully supported like IE 6<br />
</em><br />
<strong>I recommend that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue.</strong><span>&nbsp;This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser. Please clear your browser's cookies

<span>2. Under Other options click on Connect with HTTPS</span><br />
<span>3. Choose Use HTTPS automatically</span><br />
<span>4. Click on Save</span><br />
<strong><br />
If you are using Safari or are on a Mac drop the "s" in https.</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>If that doesnt work try this method</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1. Sign in through this link:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.live.com/ManageSSL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ManageSSL</a><br />

            This has absolutely nothing to do with anybody's local machine or network. It is all server side. This needs to be fixed by Microsoft.

<p>The simplest way is to make a back-up and then</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>U can go in for a hard reset which will turn ur device as it left the factory totally new which will be '*' '3' 'Call Key' and Power button all pressed at the same time after u have removed ur phone battery for at least 5 mins. It wud turn ur phone as it
 was when it left the factory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But wat i wud suggest you as the easiest way is to take the phone back to ur dealer/vendor and ask him to solve it or change ur device</p>

    <title>Publisher 2016 Prints with a Blue Tint on Grayscale Images - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Publisher 2016 Prints with a Blue Tint on Grayscale Images</h2>
                    <p>Publisher 2016 does not seem to be capable of printing grayscale images.&nbsp; They always have a blue tint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The images are grayscale before being brought in to Publisher (created in PhotoShop CC 2018).&nbsp; I have also tried not converting to grayscale and simply de-saturating the RGB image in Photoshop before taking to Publisher with exactly the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Publisher I have tried the Recolor setting and selected grayscale. Same blue tint. Actually I tried several of the Recolor settings and all looked identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I take the exact same image to Word 2016, or even WordPad, and print to the exact same printer (I am using a Toshiba 3550) the image prints as it should (grayscale).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a bug in Publisher but I can't rule out some kind of printer driver issue. Maybe that part of the driver is only accessed by Publisher.&nbsp; I have updated the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only used Publisher for a couple of projects so maybe I am overlooking something in setup (although I would think it would be straightforward that an inserted grayscale image should print out in grayscale).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be a number of people having similar issues in Publisher but there don't seem to be any solutions. Anyone have a similar issue that has been solved?</p>

<p>Since no one has offered a solution, I have a couple questions and perhaps a workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, when you go to File &gt; Print it sounds like you look at the printer properties and confirm that your Toshiba is set to print grayscale? Also under the Publisher print settings you have chosen Composite Grayscale?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible workaround...try Save As a PDF file as an interim step. Also export as a PDF and Win10 has a PDF printer driver that you can try. Do all these produce the blue tint when you print the PDF?</p>

<p>Thanks for taking a look.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to print the whole document grayscale - just certain images.&nbsp; Just for testing I have printed the whole document grayscale from Publisher and it appears as it should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The images are already grayscale when imported but I also tried setting them to grayscale using the Publisher 'Recolor' function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the PDF test and it has the same blue tint (I tried several of the graphics color settings).&nbsp; The same images, printed to the same printer from Word print as they should - no blue tint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It probably has something to do with the way Publisher is handling these images. It is obviously different from the way Word handles them. I have noticed that Publisher looks for the printer (driver) as it is starting up, before it builds the page onscreen.
 Word does not do this (at least not visibly).</p>

<p>I now have a workaround.&nbsp; Buried deep within the printer setup there is a setting for Pure Black and Pure Gray and what they are applied to.&nbsp; I now have grayscale images with full color logos on the same page.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi </span>
Lonlee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Android phone, I tested with the same version of SharePoint app (3.8.0) and I can open .pdf files successfully. When I click .pdf file name, it would take few seconds to load and then will open the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are unable to open .pdf files, I would like to collect following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Please try opening PDF files from another SharePoint site and check if it opens.</li><li><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Since when are you getting the error? Is it after the app got updated?
</li><li>Try connecting to a different network and check the result.</li><li>Open the SharePoint site in a browser on your phone and try opening the PDF file, see if it gives you the same error.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this feature is enabled, add-ons such as toolbars, browser helper objects (BHOs), and extensions are loaded only if they are compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode. If you have to load an incompatible add-on, you can disable Enhanced Protected Mode
 for the desktop browser. This action lets incompatible add-ons load, but it may increase the risk of having malware or other potentially harmful software installed on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform the steps provided in the article and check. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, you may post the query in Lync support forums. </p>

    <title>Updates for Works 9.0 to fix known bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cannonmc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates for Works 9.0 to fix known bugs</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering if there are any plans to update Works 9.0 to fix three well-known bugs (OK, two bugs and something someone forgot to include).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded from XP to Win7. My Works 7 didn't work so I had to buy a copy of Works 9.0</p>
<p>Three annoying bugs show up and have been mentioned in this forum. The only answer from Microsoft seems to be 'try this workaround', not 'we're trying to fix the problem in our software that you paid for'.</p>
<p>1 Copy/paste from Firefox (not IE8) closes the Works word processor completely before it's done anything.</p>
<p>2 The silly message that 'the information exceeds the size' when copying small amounts of some html-coded text. This is caused by Works not liking something in the code and has nothing to do with the size of the data on the clipboard.</p>
<p>3 Where did the Toolbar options go? Previous versions of Works allowed me to customise the Toolbar so that I could have all the regular operations just one click away. Somebody forgot to include it in Works 9. So, for instance, after doing a search in a
 database when I want to show all the records again, instead of clicking one button on the toolbar I have to go Record, Show, All. There isn't even a handy keyboard shortcut for the buttons I used to use.</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>Did you ever find a solution to the Toolbar option customise? I am trying to add the envelope icon to the toolbar to save me a lot of time but I cannot customise the toolbar. Its very irritating espically when previous versions of Works have had better facilities.</p>

<p>This is always the problem with Microsoft Products.&nbsp; They just don't know what they're doing.&nbsp; And they don't even seem to care.&nbsp; Take a look at IE-9.&nbsp; How many years and how many updates, and it STILL doesn't have a built in&nbsp;spellcheck.&nbsp; That's so stupid,
 it's not even funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still use Netscape&nbsp;7 for&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;things and even it has a spellcheck.&nbsp;

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-In Options
<br />
<br />At the bottom, check that this option is turned off - Use my sign-in info to automatically finish setting up my device and reopen my apps after an update or restart
<br />
<br />Restart your PC and see if Access has stopped opening automatically . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />If not, there must be something on your Startup process causing this:
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Look for any mention of Access or an Access database in the list, if you find one, untick it and restart your PC . . .

<p>Thank you for the information, Dave. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all that you suggested (Windows Settings and the Autoruns64 utility). The only startup processes Office-related that I found are below--and none of them related to Microsoft Access. The problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue seems to be related to another issue I'm having with multiple instances of Microsoft Access remaining in memory after I exit the program. I've started a new thread about that problem.</p>

<p>Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked task scheduler and there is no task related to this. As for the current build and other troubleshooting, I think this problem is related to another one that I've posted in a different question. If you could take a look at it, then maybe you'll
 see something more I can do to troubleshoot this: </p>

    <title>Microsoft Access 2016 The database you are trying to open requires a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access 2016 The database you are trying to open requires a newer version of MS ACCESS</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered this issue "The database you are trying to open requires a newer version of Access" everytime i try to open my accdb file. This is never happened before so for me that notification does not make any sense since i built it myself with the
 same access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumption so far, this is because somehow relate with the ODBC or OLEDB that crashed my database. This access file was only act as database that connect with my excel pivot reporting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some other detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total size of the files are various from 600k B to 1,8 GB. (i am using 64Bit version of access)</p>
<p>Inside of the database, there's a table that is using double as data type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and here's my question that I think might be helpful for this:</p>
<p>- Can I delete the table inside the file without opening the file?</p>
<p>- Can I repair or compact the database without opening the file?</p>
<p>- Last option, can i just have the module without opening the file at least i don't have to re-building from scratch (same issue happened with the backup which I've never open before)</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good news, I can now open it but read only version i think it is because unlicensed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply install Access 2010 64 bit .. (my previous version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny when they suggested me to install newer but the fact is I need to install the older one..&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><span>Outlook for Mac cannot import CSV file. You may try the following steps to import your contacts as VCF file:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Import the CSV file in Mac contact. (system contact)</span></li><li><span>Select the contacts and drag them to desktop. (VCF file).</span></li><li><span>Right click the VCF file, then choose “open it with Outlook”.</span></li><li><span>Then the contacts may have been imported in Outlook for Mac. Click contact to check it.</span></li></ol>
