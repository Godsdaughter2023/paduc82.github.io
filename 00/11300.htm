<h2>            Office 365 Outlook web app - send on behalf &#47; send AS delegate shared mailbox, must choose the from field&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have some users that only use Outlook web app for mail, and they access some shared mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook full copy version, when you have Access for sending as / on behalf of a shared mailbox, the shared mailbox mail adress will automatically be the sender when you&nbsp;reply/forward an email that is in the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If im in Outlook web app and have opened a shared mailbox, when i reply / forward a email that is received and placed in the shared mailbox, the sender adress is not the shared mailbox adress. It will default to the user that is logged in mail adress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do we have to choose the "From Field" every time we reply / forward a mail that is in a shared mailbox, when we are working in Outlook web app, if we want the sender adress to be the shared mailbox adress ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Outlook.com creating and keeping several drafts of sent emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vr_77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com creating and keeping several drafts of sent emails</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook.com on Chrome browser on a Mac. I don't use the Outlook client/app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately (since a few weeks), I've noticed that a ton of drafts get saved as I am writing responses to emails. These drafts continue to be saved even after I've successfully sent the emails. This is super confusing and makes me question if the email has been
 sent each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I could just go to the Drafts folders, select the drafts, and delete them. But I want to know how to avoid so many drafts being saved in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Draft emails will appear in the Drafts folder when you forget to send a message, or you close the message windows without sending it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid so many drafts being saved each time, you may follow these suggestions: &nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;A</span>lways ensure that you click the <strong>Send </strong>button properly.
</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Instead of clicking the close button when you decide not to send the message, click on<strong> Discard</strong>. Closing the window rather than clicking on Discard places the messages into the Drafts folder.
</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Make sure to delete the contents of the Drafts folder to minimize confusion, and prevent it from piling up.</span></li></ul>

                    <p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I just want to report and discuss about a bug with the new Outlook 2016 for Mac 15.36 (170702) where the app completely freeze/not respond when the computer is sleeping for a long period (overnight/many hours)!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">First, this is a completely new issue with this version because I have no issues with version 15.35. I also tested a downgrade from 15.36 to 15.35 and issue disappeared completely with older version.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Freezing/not responding issues with Outlook v15.36 (170702) is permanent and happen 100% of the time when my system sleep for a few hours, like overnight or full day when I am away. I tested the issue with
 a short period sleep (like 30 minutes) and it doesn't freeze.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Not only that the app is freezing/not responding and that I had to "force quit" it, but it also refuses to launch thereafter... the app icon is bouncing in the Dock forever and app won't launch anymore except
 if I reboot my laptop. I also check with my Activity Monitor for any "ghost process" related with Outlook but I can't see anything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I know the version 15.36 (170702) isn't official yet (Insider Version - Slow Channel), but we surely need to discuss/fix this issue prior to the official version release very soon I guess!!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">My computer is a MacBook Pro Retina 13 inches (Late 2013) with a clean version of MacOS Sierra installed (10.12.5) and I do not have much software in this computer except for the Office suite and a few goodies...</p>

<p>Hi Simon_C81,<br />
<br />
Glad to hear that the issue has been resolved.<br />
For the insider fast version, as there are newer updates released in this version channel than the normal version, there could be some issue coming with these updates. After we fix these issues or find more stable release build, the updates will then be released
 to the normal version. You can refer to the following article for more information:<br />

    <title>Outlook Calendar not syncing after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerrycampkin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar not syncing after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    I have a windows 7 system, a windows 10 system, an ipad and an iphone. I use icloud to sync these systems. Up until last week they worked fine. Then Microsoft sent out one of its automatic updates to 10. The iphone, ipad and windows 7 systems still sync.&nbsp;
 However the calendar and contacts on the 10 system stopped working. Email still syncs fine.
<p>
</p><p>I spent several hours on the phone with a Microsoft tech and gave him access to my 10 system.&nbsp; He could not fix the problem. Any suggestions gratefully received. Incidentally I have tried many suggested fixes with no luck.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>Mention the type of email account configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or Exchange Server Account)?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the account is setup as IMAP, it will only sync mail and nothing else. You need to setup your account as Exchange active sync or exchange to completely sync all your calendar events. If the email
 account is configured as Exchange Active sync, you may remove and re-add the email account in Outlook and check if it works as expected.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please post to us if you need any further assistance with Office.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            I don't understand why that is the problem. It worked fine until the latest 10 upgrade. It works fine on the 7 system. The 10 system came with Office and Outlook already loaded. I didn't set it up. I don't know how to change the setup. This is a private
 home-based system. I'm not connected to any server.<br />

            Since there are no workable answers to this problem I can only deduce that Microsoft 10 has problems. On another system I upgraded to 10 with Microsoft Office installed and ran into serious problems with that as well. 10 &amp; Office and maybe iCloud have
 some serious issues. Until syncing and Office work together I am returning to 7 and advising everyone else to do the same. All that the Microsoft Help people keep saying is that it's a hardware issue even though both PCs checked out, &amp; 7 is working fine on
 both systems now.<br />

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever find an answer to this problem?&nbsp; I've been synching just fine&nbsp;until the latest Windows update.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried reinstalling BOTH iCloud AND Outlook, and it still doesn't work.&nbsp; I've signed out of iCloud, sign back in, reinstall the Outlook tool,
 and all seems well.&nbsp; It takes about 10 - 15 minutes each time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing:&nbsp; the local outlook calendar syncs with iCloud ONCE (and adds multiple copies of the calendar in Outlook), and then, moments later I look in my trash bin, and see that "c:programfiles(x86)commonfiles\appleInternetservices\aplzod32.dll" is
 there.&nbsp; Additionally, there are no signs of it in my Outlook "Options / add-in" folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know of a fix, I'd greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; All had been going well for about a year, and then once I got the update, it stopped working.&nbsp; Is there a way to switch back, just prior to the last Office update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>

 you click on that &gt; the column expands and a list of folders appears at the bottom. Scroll down and near the bottom of the list is a folder iCloud. Click on that and several calendar names appear. Click on Outlook Calendar and behold your synced calendar is
 presented. If you have trouble opening the iCloud folder you will need to delete iCloud and reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the calendar presented is changed every time Microsoft installs an update (MS are you really listening??) so you have to go through this process every time. Hope this helps. - good luck!<br />

    <title>E52 - problem with lock code and bluetooth connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hlau_99  say:</h3>
<h2>            E52 - problem with lock code and bluetooth connection</h2>
                    
<p>I have an E52 as my work phone, and due to company security policy, a lock code and autolock (30 minutes max) is mandatory. This is giving me problems when using bluetooth headsets, regardless of the make (Plantronics, my Garmin GPS, and latest the built
 in Fiscon in my car). As long as the phone is not locked, everything works fine, I can make and receive calls. But, when the phone locks, I am no longer able to make calls. In the car (both on the GPS, and on the built in connection) I can still browse the
 phone book and select a number, but when I attempt to dial, nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I enter my lock code, I can make calls without problems. However, it sort of defies the purpose of having a rather expensive hands free kit in my car, if I can only make calls the first 30 minutes of my ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a known problem, and is there a solution?</p>

<p>This is not a problem as such, more of a design flaw. &nbsp;It is not possible to make a call when the phone is locked, I guess the only way around the issue is just to press a button on the phone every now and then. &nbsp;Say every 15 to 20 mins just push the menu
 button or any button randomly, that should reset the timer back to 30 minutes until it is locked next.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>We appreciate the response given. Since you mentioned that it is not noticeable in previous builds, and it only happens in the current build, it could be due to the new integrated features in Microsoft Edge. For more information about the improvements in
 Microsoft Edge in the build 17063, kindly see this <em><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/#XEbCBM5RyGqZpZej.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, if you find that the issue is reproducible in other PCs that are running the same build, you may report it to Microsoft so that the engineers may know of it and may investigate it. For instructions on how to send feedback to Microsoft, kindly
 see <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Send feedback to Microsoft with the Feedback Hub app</a></em>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to create separate threads for each separate issues in order to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make/model of your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit your manufacturer's website, install the latest drivers and also install all Windows pending updates.</p>
<p>Check if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have major problems with your PC, suggest you to check if your system meets the Windows 10 requirements.</p>
<p>Also perform a repair upgrade after that and check.</p>

<h3> lukemoorevw  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word Mail Merge via DDE Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with a Mail Merge Document I have created whereby when I complete the merge it throws out the error the Word could not open the data source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this problem only seems to occur when the sheet is loaded with data to merge across. If the excel document is only half-full this does-not occur. There are no other variables and I have tested to high heaven.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can tell it is about to fail because when successful it opens the Workbook and leaves it open in the background, if it is going to fail it opens it but then closes and asks you if want to save any changes even though none have been made?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using DDE because all other MS Excel Merge methods limit the volume of characters that can be merged per field and also the number of fields that can be merged and I have 162 merge fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this problem. It is not a Computer issue because the same issue occurs across multiple machines.</p>
<p>We are using Office 365 for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Your reasons for using DDE are not valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Default OLE DB Database Files method of connecting to the data source does not impose a limit on the number of merge fields.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number of characters that&nbsp;can be merged per field can be restricted by the type (size)&nbsp;of data in the first 6 or 8 records.&nbsp; However there will be no restriction if a the first (a dummy record if need be) contains enough data in each field to set the
 type of data that is expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "half full" limit that you mention is most likely caused by the use of a DDE connection.</p>

<p>Laptop manufacturer&nbsp; were clueless about the problem ... But i fixed the problem by visiting intel official site and scanned my pc for updates from the autoscan utility provided by intel. All my problems were solved in a single shot .....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone having same or similar issues, updating the drivers from device manager may not solve your issue. In such case please try above mentioned method.....Thank you ...have a nice day.</p>

Hi, and thank you for your suggestion. I tried doing that so many times, and it just doesn't work. I've tried several variations, too, with no luck. I know my phone is capable because I created a screenshot once by accident.

<p>Hi Siphesihle OugustinShabalala,</p>
<p>I’d like to confirm whether you have tried to access the group via your OneDrive for Business web app. Some users report that we can access the group successfully via our OneDrive for Business web app. For your reference:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/414621</p>
<p>If the issue persists when access it from the OneDrive for Business, it may due to the provisioning. For further investigation, I need your account information. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect it. You can check the PM
 via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

I am taking exactly the steps Outlook.com&nbsp;provides for:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set Gmail to enable POP. I add the Gmail address into Outlook, enter SSL, the SSL port 995, my Gmail username (with or&nbsp;without the domain name) and password, click okay. It tells me that Gmail POP needs to be enabled even though it is.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you want screenshots?</p>

<b><u>In Gmail</u></b><br />
<br />
I select Forwarding and POP/IMAP in settings<br />
<br />
In POP Download I choose one of the two:<br />
<br />
Enable POP for all mail (even mail that's already been downloaded)<br />
Enable POP for mail that arrives from now on<br />
<br />
I have <i>"1. Status: POP is enabled for all mail that has arrived since xx/xx/xx"

<br />
I enter my Gmail address<br />
I enter POP3 server information<br />
I select the port 995 and Use SSL<br />
I click Leave a copy of my messages on the server (I have also unlicked this and it doesn't work)<br />

Wow. </p>
<p>I naturally assumed that since <strong>pop.gmail.com</strong> <em>is</em> the server address I have to enter, you'd understand that "<em>POP3 server information</em>" was equivalent to
<strong>pop.gmail.com</strong>. I was wrong. I apologize for doing something that was too subtle for you.
</p>
<p>Mr. Tillman, you are precisely the kind of support person that reinforces all of the negative opinions out here in userland about Microsoft. Here I am, a user who loves the new Outlook.com (and Windows 8 -- yes, I've used it), a user who has already referred
 two new users to Outlook.com, a user who wants to migrate his personal email <em>
away from your competitor</em>, a user who, before this, was considering buying a Windows phone for his wife, and what do you do when faced with&nbsp;simple question? You get testy with a user. Not smart.</p>
<p>You know what? No thanks. I think I'll stick with Gmail. I'll also be sure to report you so that other users don't have the benefit of your snarkiness and unhelpful attitude.</p>
<p>P.S., You <strong><u>never</u></strong> answered my question.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 not downloading all Gmail messages in Sent Mail folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> virtuous circle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 not downloading all Gmail messages in Sent Mail folder</h2>
                    <p>I installed Outlook 2013 recently as an upgrade to Outlook 2010. I set it up to sync with my Gmail and Hotmail accounts. Hotmail works fine. Gmail seems to be very erratic. The biggest problem is that only about 150 of&nbsp;the&nbsp;2500 emails in my Sent Mail folder
 download. And it seems to be perpetually sychronising the folder according to what is in the status bar at the bottom. I have to be able to see emails that I have sent so I have reverted to using 2010 which works absolutely fine with all folders complete and
 uptodate. I feel really cheated that I purchased Outlook 2013 and cannot use it. Do you have a fix for this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Office Home and Business 2013 on an HP laptop under Windows 7. I am using version 15.0.4454.1004 which is not the latest version according to your website but I don't know how to get the latest version.</p>

            <p>GMail uses IMAP and the new IMAP service works differently than the same service in 2010. The new service downloads entire messages, not just the headers. If the service encounters an error on the server of some sort, it halts in its tracks, where the prior
 service would just keep on going. I have an old IMAP account that, somehow over the years, developed a "disconnect" between some of the messages and their headers. Outlook 2010 (and every other IMAP client I know about) downloaded the headers fine, but would
 produce an error when the body of one of these disconnected messages tried to open. By contrast, Outlook 2013 stops cold on the first such message it hits. The fix, for me, was to use some other IMAP client to move these messages to a different folder, then
 back again (which, on the server, reconnected the headers to the messages). You might give that a try.</p>

            <p>Hi Hal</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I tried what you suggested using Outlook 2010.&nbsp;I&nbsp;created a new folder, transferred all of the emails in the Sent Mail folder to it and then transferred them back. Then I started Outlook 2013. It looked promising because the number
 of emails in&nbsp;Sent Mail in Outlook&nbsp;went quickly up to 250 (out of 2500) but then it got stuck again. The All Mail&nbsp;folder added about 2000&nbsp;emails and got stuck. I re-started Outlook 2013 several times and each time I got a few more items in the All Mail folder
 across. I then carried out the same procedure of transferring the Sent Items to another folder and back again. This time the number of Sent Mail and All Mail items did not increase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth saying that Outlook 2013 is extremely unstable when it is doing this synchronisation. It goes into "Not Responding" mode quite frequently (eg when I select a different folder) and falls over completely too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is all very frustrating because I seem to waste hours fiddling with it, re-starting it, checking the number of emails. Surely it should be working out of the box, just like Outlook 2010?

            I heard that Microsoft have admitted that there is a problem with Outlook 2013 and IMAP email accounts and that they are producing a fix. But I have no idea when. So I will continue to use Outlook 2010 which works fine with the same email account. Obviously
 I am not happy that I&nbsp;bought Outlook 2013 and have spent an age configuring it only to find that I cannot use it and may never be able to use it. This does not reflect well on Microsoft.

<h2>            Why am I not allowed to group by category, then conversation&#63;</h2>
                    I have a search folder that I wanted to customize the view for, so I opened it up and in the View section of the ribbon, selected "View Settings", then the "Group By..." button, then unchecked the Automatically group checkbox, then chose to group by Categories,
 then by Conversation.&nbsp; I get the error:<br />
<br />
"The sorting or group by operation failed. Either these folders do not support sorting or the conditions are too complex. Sorting and group by settings have been reset."<br />
<br />
Surely two conditions isn't too complex, when it allows for up to four.<br />

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not possible to group by Category and then by Conversation. However you can group by Category and then sort by Conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information provided is helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi there --</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with Brian and find that suggested solution &amp; lack of requested sorting to be unacceptable and frustrating. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The grouping by Category works just fine. &nbsp;In my case (see image) I have 3 categories in use: &nbsp;"High Priority", "Low Priority", and "Pending Replies" (for awaiting a response). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, messages that were once grouped onto a single line via the conversation function now take up a whole new line and waste valuable work space &amp; time searching between individual messages. &nbsp;I've called out such instances within the black boxes on the
 image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, all sorting by Conversation does is place them in alphabetical order. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is not a replacement for the "Date (Conversations)" functionality</span>. &nbsp;This jumbles up the dates of the messages, which is particularly
 noticeable in my "Low Priority" category. &nbsp;Sure, one could sort by the messages' received dates (which is just called "Received" in the drop down list) instead, but this jumbles up all of the individual conversations. &nbsp;In short, either our dates or our conversations
 are a scattered mess. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clutter. &nbsp;It's inefficient. &nbsp;It's 2014. &nbsp;Please fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I appreciate the reply but don't think that is possible. &nbsp;When you create a new page on the mac version there is no option to select from a template that was created. Please clarify if there is something I am missing.

            The My Phone is a free backup service that Microsoft created for windows mobile 6.x phones.&nbsp; My Phone does not have anything to do with syncing email or msn contacts, so those items will still be working just fine after the My Phone service is discontinued.<br />

 of helping them get ready for their release with Windows 10. You may have already noticed that on PCs and tablets we’ve added “Mobile” to the app names (to help distinguish them from the Office desktop suite), while on phones we simply call the apps Word,
 Excel and PowerPoint. We will also remove “Preview” from the app names and in about one week, you will need an Office 365 subscription to edit on Windows 10 PCs and larger tablets.</span></span></p>

<p>I upgraded my phone's software, but there's still a known bug. I can't turn the screen rotation on or off. This is important, because the Silencing calls and Snoozing alarms are very useful things, but I can't apply them without this annoying screen rotation!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let there be a separate option to turn the screen rotation on/off!</p>

<p>OK it's maybe not a bug, rather an incomplete setting possibility. If I use my phone, I can't use the Silencing calls and Snoozing alarms functions without turning the sensors on. But if I turn this on, the screen rotates when I hold the phone vertically.
 That's not useful in all cases, indeed sometimes disturbing. My phone is working perfectly, and it rotates when I keep it horizontally only.<br />
<br />
I would like, if the next fw would allow me to change the screen rotation separately.</p>

<p>What TS means is that he wants to use silencing calls and&nbsp; and snoozing alarms without rotaring screen feature. Yes, I agree with him. There's should be third checkbox there to enabel/disable rotaring screen when sensor activated. Right now, when we activate
 the senseor then rotaring screen will be enabled too and now way to turn it off without loosing silencing calls and snoozing alarms.</p>

<p>I'm glad that we agree with this sensor thing. So yes, there's should be third checkbox to enable/disable the rotaring screen when sensors are activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed these sensor settings could be developed even more. For example we could choose between, rejecting and silencing the incoming calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could mute the music player or step forward the music tracks (SonyEricsson made it already), so there are a lot of usefull ideas, just the developers shoul'd care more with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not impressed with this slow development... :(</p>

<p>Me too updated to this latest version a couple of days back. Do not know what is the difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody seen the changelog for this update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the NOKIA support site still says&nbsp;&nbsp;051.018 is the latest s/w update available!!! (But I updated to ver 052.003 OTA two days back).</p>
