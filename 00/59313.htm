<h2>            NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260 not compatible with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    So I decided to go ahead and upgrade my desktop to Windows 10, but the compatibility checker says that my display is not compatible. &nbsp;Yet Nvidia says that it should be compatible (http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3710/~/which-nvidia-gpus-are-supported-in-windows-10%3F),
 so what's going on?

            I'm stupid. &nbsp;I looked at Device Manager again and saw a weird video adapter listed. &nbsp;Apparently a video editing/playing program I installed at one time also installed a custom display adapter. &nbsp;Once I removed that, the compatibility checker passed. &nbsp;Thanks
 all for the help!

<h2>            Port is being blocked</h2>
                    For context I have used the port in the past on different computers just fine, I have port forwarded in the past with no issue. For some odd reason yesterday my port 25565 was being blocked for no reason, I ended up having the reset my router (ISP instructions)
 and my Netgear NX6200 Extender. I have made a static IPV4, I have forwarded on port 25565. I checked in CMD to see if they IPV4 matched (It did), and I made a inbound rule for the port on both TCP and UDP. I cannot think of a single other thing that would
 be blocking this port, but It is being blocked. If anyone knows how to deal with this issue please let me know.&nbsp;

</p><p>&nbsp;If you're talking about changes to the computer that caused this, I have no clue. I factory reset windows to fix the issue to no avail, I factory reset my extender along with my router. (that was a important note that I left out)</p>

<p>The web activity on the Family Safety website can only show the&nbsp;last&nbsp;2 weeks of activity. If you want to keep records of the web activities, you can set Family Safety to send you activity reports weekly, so you can view it on your email. Please follow these
 steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign in to <a href="http://fss.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://fss.live.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p>2. Under the&nbsp;parent account, click <strong>Edit Settings</strong>.</p>

<p>4. Click <strong>Ok</strong> to save the settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the late response. As of now, we do not have that setting on Family Safety on which you can view reports beyond 2 weeks. What you can do is to save the email reports that were sent to you for possible review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can send feedback for Family Safety so that our product team will be aware of the requests and feedbacks of their product users. Kindly refer to the link below.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t find Windows Vista Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madi1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t find Windows Vista Product Key</h2>
                    I can't find my product key for Windows Vista on my computer, I can't access anything on my computer till the product key is entered. I have no idea where the CD and product key is, my family has 4 Dell computers with Windows programs so my CD and product
 key seems to be missing from the collection of CD's we have saved. &nbsp;Do I have to buy an entirely new Windows Vista CD? Is there a number I can call to order one since I don't have access to anything but this page on my computer?

            The editing tools for trim and volume control only apply when a video clip is selected in your preview area.&nbsp; Are you sure you have picked a video clip?&nbsp; If you select a photo, for example, the only options on the Video Tools | Edit tab should be the photo
 duration.

            Hello Steve. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.
<br />
<br />First must download Skype using the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Second you must create a Skype account following the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://signup.live.com/signup?lcid=1033&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1522959752&amp;rver=7.0.6730.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2flw.skype.com%2flogin%2foauth%2fproxy%3fform%3dmicrosoft_registration%26site_name%3dlw.skype.com%26fl%3dphone2&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=293290&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;psi=skype&amp;lw=1&amp;cobrandid=90010&amp;client_flight=hsu%2cReservedFlight33%2cReservedFlight67&amp;fl=phone2&amp;uaid=431784816448423d88cc23cd10eecc48&amp;lic=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://signup.live.com/signup?lcid=1033&amp;wa...</a>
<br />
<br />Third Sign in into Skype and start using it:

            Well, the first step is to ensure you have an account setup:
<br /><a href="https://login.skype.com/join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.skype.com/join</a>
<br />
<br />After that, sign into Skype:

<br />
<br />If you already have a Microsoft Account (Hotmail, Outlook.com, Live.com or MSN.com) then you can use it to sign into Skype.

Our deposit process cannot correctly determine the primary billable account to deposit into for your Microsoft Account, and thus aborts the process. This is an issue that we are working on resolving with another team, since we are not able to fully access the database containing billable account information.&nbsp; At the moment, we have not received a estimate on when this problem will be resolved. Since we cannot resolve this issue ourselves due to privacy concerns around billable account information, we must wait on the payment team to provide us with their resolution.&nbsp;To be clear, this is a data issue, and not the result of any faulty user input, so adjusting your information will likely not solve this issue. Again,&nbsp;we apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            2nd Monitor in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Unlike other posts on the subject, my system partially recognises the 2nd monitor.</p>
<p>I was running my HD TV thru HDMI as a second monitor under Win 7.1 successfully. I upgraded to Win 10, and the system does not detect the tv. When I boot up, the windows logo appears on the TV, but after logging on I only get a blank screen. I have tried
 various 2nd monitor setting, tried dectecting in the display settings and control panel, with no success. The fact that I get theWin logo suggests that whilst booting up the system is using only the BIOS settings and therefore recognising the TV. After logging
 on it seems to use the windows settings. </p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Thank you very much. The trouble was I was only getting the monitor (no second display).</p>
<p>Anyway the problem is solved (or at least gone away, as I an not sure what I did to fix it!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Since the last reply, I ran windows update and powered off the computer. When I powered back up, it worked! I had previously powered off and up again with the tv turned on&nbsp;(I learnt that I had to do this when I was running 7.1). I had not thought of the
 updates as I had only just installed and assumed that the process would bring down all available updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thanks very much.</p>

<h2>            New Activation Code for Windows 8.1 Pro Pack says &#34;This Key Won&#39;t Work....&#34;</h2>
                    I just bought a brand new Windows 8.1 Pro Pack code for my brand new Windows 8.1 laptop. The activation code was purchased by 100% legal methods from the Microsoft store. I am trying to do the upgrade through the "Add Features to Windows 8.1" page and
 it keeps saying that "This key won't work. Check it and tray again, or try a&nbsp; different key."
<br />
<br />
I have checked it 100 times and I do not know what to do. Is there any reason this would not be working?

The first page you identify presumes&nbsp;one has the product installed and are simply seeking to activate it.&nbsp; We cannot even get to that part as it refuses to accept the product key at the "Enter Your Product Key" step in the "Get more features..." upgrade path.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So far I have wasted a whole day trying to do the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Upgrade to 8.1...nowhere does it mention in the upgrade instructions that you have to run WSRESET.EXE just to get 8.1 to show up in the app store...I should not have to search online to find that out..FAIL!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Buy and install 8.1 Pro...I have gone through the process of "Get more features..." on the System page, bought a license upgrade to Pro...start to download, have it fail, try again and have the Product Key refused...FAIL!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please provide a simple, consistent&nbsp;and easy to use product upgrade path that does not fail.</p>

            <p>Same here. I tried "Add features...", input my Pro pack product key and got the message "Your key will work..."Then the installation failed, I closed the wizard and retried, and now it happily tells
 me "This key won't work..."</p>

I would appreciate some advice on how to proceed now.</p>

I tried that and it did not work.
<div><br />
<div>However, I did find a solution. &nbsp;The system came with McAfee installed as part of the Lenovo/Microsoft bloat-ware. &nbsp;We use a different AV solution, so while I was trying to figure out the upgrade problem I uninstalled McAfee...low and behold, the upgrade
 worked like a charm as soon as I did so. &nbsp;I figure McAfee was somehow interfering with the legitimate upgrade.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be excellent if Microsoft had a simple, effective, and most importantly, consistent upgrade methodology. &nbsp;I have lost two days of my life that I will never get back due to what should have been a simple process, thanks a lot.</div>

<div>Can Microsoft please make it a one click process to upgrade Win 8 to 8.1? Let me see the 8.1 upgrade option, then install the missing updates...not the other way around...making me wait 2hrs for 100+ updates to complete before I can see the upgrade 8.1

            Basith the websites you list don't actually provide the phone numbers, and the phone numbers are not listed when encountering this problem, unlike when doing a basic activation of Windows. I suggest you change the answer on this question to something more
 helpful. thanks

            Hi, I have the same issue. I have also noticed that my certificate for Microsoft Root Authority is also saying it is invalid. I have tried tech support by chat and phone. I tried the phone activation and it said my key was blocked, and all Microsoft did
 was tell me to contact HP, but from my expierence Hp has no idea what they are doing, I have talked to 3 of their techs and they kept giving me the wrong steps. I even did a factory reset because my Bluetooth driver was not updating and a lot of my hp software
 was not working. Ever since I did the reset I have had the same problem. I wasn't even able to update to windows 8.1 at first and then a tech from Microsoft named Ryan B helped me and I was finally able to upgrade to 8.1, but I think it has something to do
 with Microsoft's software. Because even before I did the reset I had to keep troubleshooting my Windows update because it was not checking for updates or installing them, and sometimes when I manually tried to update my software it would

            Thanks for the reply. I've followed the directions but to no avail. My printer is a hp laser Jet 1200 which was printing fine, then I opened a e-mail to print and it just stopped. I went through the entire process and got only two test pages. And those
 were delayed for a couple of minutes. So, I changed printers and set up my Desk jet 2050 with the same results. Test's say all drivers up to date and USB cable connected. Any suggestions?<br />

            Thanks for your response. I did follow the hidden folders instructions you supplied but the folder still doesn't appear in the C drive nor in disk cleanup. The strategies for freeing up disk space &nbsp;unfortunately didn't help me find the folder to delete
 it either.

    <title>Win 10 password for safe mode or stop programs &#40;Trusteer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annoyedusertrusteerrapport  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 password for safe mode or stop programs &#40;Trusteer Rapport&#41; loading</h2>
                    <p>I'm desperate</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Win 10 with automatic updates set.&nbsp; I log in using my pin normally but I know my current MS account password that I haven't changed for a couple of months and therefore many, many logins.</p>
<p>My problem is a cycle of BSODs.&nbsp; These are due to Trusteer Rapport which I presume has updated itself and is now crashing my system.&nbsp; I was forced to download it by one of the UK banks supposedly to protect me against malware and it has given me nothing
 but grief since.&nbsp; I had to switch from using Chrome to Firefox because it trashed that, Edge wouldn't load for ages but recently that was fixed, then a couple of weeks ago Firefox wouldn't load because of a Rapport problem so I had to use Firefox safe mode
 and disable Rapport.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now it's crashing Windows itself with a message that says Stop Code: PAGEFAULT IN NONPAGEDAREA What failed: RapportCerberus64_1919106.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried choosing the option "Disable early launch anti-malware protection" from the startup options that I'm offered from the "you have a problem" screen but that doesn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I hate IBM Trusteer Rapport. Their support tells me that all I can do is enter safe mode and rename various trusteer rapport files to prevent the problem.&nbsp; But now comes the second problem.&nbsp; When I try to log in to safe mode it won't accept my current
 MS account password and there's no pin option.&nbsp; I've chosen safe mode with networking but it's showing a cross next to internet on the log in screen.&nbsp; Searching here and elsewhere it seems I need my password from when I set up windows 10 but I can't remember
 that. I don't know whether I have a win 8 disk somewhere but I upgraded from oem win 8 to win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally my desperate pleas for help . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.If I can get safe mode to connect to the internet I presume it would accept my current password and then I could fix things with Rapport ie delete it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any tips on how I could try to do that?&nbsp; I use a wired connection to a switch and then a router so I don't understand why it's not connecting.&nbsp; I've tried several times.&nbsp; When I click on the internet logo with the red cross, a box opens with Flight Mode
 - I've tried clicking on that but it doesn't change anything so I presume it's just not getting a connection&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Occasionally (although not for a while now) on reboots I was getting in for a few seconds before it crashed.&nbsp; Is there any thing I can do eg key press combination to stop programs ie Rapport loading?</p>
<p>3. Any other thoughts on what I could do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for all help/suggestions</p>
<p>

            Hi,  AnnoyedUserTrusteerRapport
<br />
<br />I can recommend "Hiren's Boot CD or USB", enter your computer with Windows Virtual and with the "Cleaners" you can uninstall or avoid the beginning of "Trusteer Rapport"
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>

<br /><a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>
<br />
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.

            Your system is messed up, I would just perform a custom install.
<br />
<br />You can't remember your password.
<br />Trying reverse whatever damage Trusteer has done would simply make the system unstable anyway, resulting in a required reinstall.
<br />

<p>Thanks both for the suggestions.&nbsp; In fact once I stopped panicking I realised that when I upgraded to Win10 I installed a new SSD and the old hard drive was still installed which had Windows Vista upgraded to Win 8 on it - I changed the boot order, up came
 a dual boot loader for Vista and Win 8, booted into Vista (Win 8 wouldn't boot for some reason) and although the optical mouse didn't work in vista and my screen was at the wrong resolution I was able to navigate to the trusteer folder and rename all the .sys
 files (lots of them).&nbsp; I then rebooted into Windows 10 and all seems fine now.&nbsp; I have now uninstalled trusteer rapport (I see that Which?, the UK consumers association, recommends on its website that people don't use it because of the many browser issues
 that I experienced) and converted my windows microsoft account to a local account that will hopefully mean I can boot into safe mode if I do experience problems in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept it's early days so I may yet experience problems and have to reinstall windows but my system seems stable.</p>
<p>

<h2>            FileHistory - external HardDrives</h2>
                    <p>I try to use FileHistory to backup my files - photos.</p>
<p>File History is set to external 3T HD</p>
<p>As Back up folders I selected entire internal separate HD (Pictures(H:)&nbsp; H:\)</p>
<p>Also all my personal files such as Documents etc are added to back up folders (default setting)</p>
<p>I run it with no problem however:</p>
<p>When I try&nbsp; "restore files from a current backup" I do not see my H drive. I can see all personal folders but nowhere is my H drive.</p>
<p>When I try "to restore&nbsp; to original location" - with no selection of any folder - and got "Interrupted Action - There is not enough space ……."</p>
<p>Can you help me to solve this problem.</p>
<p>My H drive is 1T</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hi Adam,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>File History replicates the folder hierarchy of files which you choose to backup, at target location. This helps you quickly find files from backup locations by only identifying their location in source path.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that the Drive letter will not be displayed during the process of restoring files. File history will display only the contents of the drive. This is the reason you are not able to view the drive letter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you are getting the error while restoring to original location, I suggest you to
<span>perform this task in clean boot and check if you are able to restore without any issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Note: A ‘clean boot’ starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>

<p>Hi; Thx for suggestion.</p>
<p>I have new Dell computer (few days), and it is hard to believe that is something wrong right from the box. Any way - I did clean boot as per your suggestion - unfortunately it didn't help. The error message - not "not enough space" is what confusing me.
 Where is not enough space? On source? or on destination? In both drive I'm sure it is not the case. I have plenty of space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx</p>
<p>Adam</p>

            <p>i have a Samsung laptop</p>
<p>the missing photos were all on my laptop under my pictures before i upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;They are not in Windows.old. &nbsp;i have done a myriad of searches, visually &nbsp;looking in folders and files as well as searching &nbsp;.jpg &nbsp; &nbsp;.jpeg etc. &nbsp;i am concerned
 because it seems that a lot of people &nbsp;have this same issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>they are not in rubbish bins. &nbsp;they are not in one drive. &nbsp;i have deliberately not emptied any bins since upgrade.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox live gold membership not activated. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allfailnowin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox live gold membership not activated.</h2>
                    <p>A while&nbsp;ago I bought a 1 year xbox live gold membership through the self-check out area. However, when I tried to enter the code, it gave me the following message, "This code is not yet active. Contact the merchant to activate this code."&nbsp;After&nbsp;some time went by, I went back to the store where I purchased it (a Walmart) to get it activated, realising that maybe&nbsp;simply purchasing it doesn't activate it. After that when I got back and tried to enter&nbsp;it a second time, it still doesn't work. I know it isn't a&nbsp;problem with my account or something because other codes before and after this one worked fine. What do I do now? Do I go back to the store a third time or is there another way to get it activated?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p><p><br /></p><p>only the store that sells it can activate it as far as I know, sometimes it takes 24 hours for the store to process the activation.</p><p>This is a snippet from the support page</p><p /><p><b>This code wasn't activated by the retailer. Contact the store and have them activate the card</b></p>
<p>All codes must be activated at the point of sale in order to
 be used on Xbox Live. Sometimes there can be a delay at the retailer 
when activating. If you receive this error message, wait 24 hours and 
try again. If the card does not work 24 hours after purchase, take the 
card back to the retailer along with your proof of purchase and ask them
 to activate it.</p><p><br /></p><p>on this link: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/prepaid-codes/prepaid-code-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/prepaid-codes/prepaid-code-errors</a></p><p><br /></p><p>So it seems the only option you have is to return to the store again to have it properly activated.<br /></p><p><br /></p>

            Thank you.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to install Corel VideoStudio Pro X5.&nbsp; The installer quiets with a code of -9.<br />
<br />
I've contacted Corel and they have suggested a few thing and nothing helped.&nbsp; The download of the trial software install also fails.<br />
<br />
I started the install with dependency walker and when the last module it used was&nbsp; advapi32.dll.<br />
<br />
It also listed the following:<br />
<br />
Error: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in an implicitly dependent module.<br />
Error: Modules with different CPU types were found.<br />
Warning: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in a delay-load dependent module.<br />
<br />
Last week I was able to find a dll for CorelDraw X6 with dependency walker.&nbsp; When the older dll was replaced, the software resumed working.<br />
<br />
In this situation, I copied the newer file to replace the older one and the system refused to boot.&nbsp; The recovery process restored the older version and now the system is operating.<br />
<br />
The thought just occurred - try the install again.<br />
<br />
It worked.&nbsp; I had not tried it because the same version had been reinstalled.&nbsp; It did not occur that the old version there may have had a problem.&nbsp; Based on what has happened, I'm concluding the old one had problems that were cleared when the file was restored.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.&nbsp; If you had not let me know that the proper version was the older one... I'm not sure when I may have tried to install the software again because the thought never occurred that the file was slightly corrupt.&nbsp; SFC /scanfile and /scannow
 did not did not identify a problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.&nbsp; Problem solved.<br />
<br />

            It sounds like you have your Windows Screen Saver set to prompt you when you come out of hibernation or screen saver mode.&nbsp; To fix this I would first check your personal settings by:Right Click on the desktop&gt;Personalize&gt;Screen Saver&gt; make sure that "on
 resume display log on screen" is not check marked, if it is then uncheck it&gt;Apply&gt;Ok you should not have any more problems after that.&nbsp; If the "on resume display log on screen" then go into Control Pannel&gt;Power Options&gt;Change plan settings, for which ever
 one you have set.&nbsp; Choose Advance power settings&gt;Make sure that the option"Require a posscode on wakeup" in not check marked, if it is then uncheck it.&nbsp; Click Apply then ok and you shold be ok.&nbsp; If that still does not work then update your post.

<p>I have Windows Vista Premium 64 bit and continue to get the message "Windows cant check for updates" When I ren manually it tells me to install some fix, which also fails.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have disabled firewalls.&nbsp; I have run the microsoft fix it tool. Nothing helps.</p>
<p>The error I normally see is "<strong>WindowsUpdate_800B0100"</strong> and have tried everything on microsoft support and some from other forums.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have run several virus checks and nothing comes up, if it is a virus that is unknown it's managed to survive several months without being caught.</p>

            I used the "Microsoft fix-it center"&nbsp; and ran the one for windows update.&nbsp; It said it found and fixed the issue but when I tried to update nothing occurred.<br />
<br />
I have made no changes to the computer.<br />
The last time it did update though it said I had 3 updates I ran before i went to bed, the 3rd one showed still trying to install when I got hone from work the next day.&nbsp; So it had been trying for 17-18 hours. So i just turned it off since figured if it would
 install 18 hours would be enough.<br />
<br />
I have read both the articles and neither helped.&nbsp; I tried the down load that is supposed to update windows update and it ran fine. but did not do anything and I repeated these steps with the firewall off as well as the routers fire wall. Nada.

            <p>Hello Nada,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may place the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            I went through the steps and it still won't run windows update. Continue to get the same error.<br />
<br />
Can I reinstall Vista without losing files? Or should I? Nothing has worked yet and I spent a lot of time on this.&nbsp; It seems Microsoft is aware of the issue but there fix programs do not work even though they say "successful" at the end.<br />
