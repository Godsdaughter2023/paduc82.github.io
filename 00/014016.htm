<h2>            No Blinking Notification for Call&#47;Message - Nokia N9-00</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Nokia N9 for a while, but unlike other Nokia models I have used, there is no blinking notification whenever there is a missed call or a message.<br />
Can anybody help? Thank you.</p>

    <title>Hyperlinks have stopped working in Excel but only on some computers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hyperlinks have stopped working in Excel but only on some computers</h2>
                    <p>I am using formulas such as the following in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=Hyperlink(W85,U85&amp;""&amp;V85)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a web link.&nbsp; The concatenation is just creating the label for the link.&nbsp; These links have worked for years.&nbsp; There was an update that was pushed through yesterday and now the links are no longer working on that computer.&nbsp; The link goes out and finds
 the file (a pdf file) but then says that the specified file cannot be opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I emailed the file to myself and opened it on another computer, the links still work fine.&nbsp; If I cut and paste the link from W85 into a browser it opens fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a number of other comments about links breaking like this dating as far back as 2010 and as recently as 2019, but no answers to the problem.&nbsp; I have to assume that it has something to do with the update that was pushed to that machine since it no longer
 works while others do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I send this file out to hundreds of clients and I have no way of knowing which ones have or have not received the update, and they work for organizations that are not going to let them roll back a Windows or Office update because this
 file no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a solution to this problem and I need it quickly.&nbsp; I have tried a few suggestions like unclicking the "update links on save" option but nothing is working (and that option is clicked on the file computer that DOES open the links so I think that advice
 is bull.&nbsp; It looks like it is part of a scheme to sell some software (at best) and malware at worst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know why this works on some computers and not others.&nbsp; What changed with the update (security settings?) that could have caused this bizarre behavior?</p>

            Hello John!
<br />I am Ofir an independent adviser willing to help.
<br />I suggest you disable the Office add-ons that sometimes have these effects:
<br />1- Try opening Outlook in safe mode:
<br />close the Office application
<br />Press the Windows + R key and type excel / safe and click OK.
<br />
<br />2- Disable add-ons:
<br />Go to file&gt; options&gt; add-ins, select COM and unmark the first marked add-on, close Excel and perform your test. If the problem persists, repeat this step until you deactivate all add-ons.
<br />
<br />If this does not solve your problem, you should perform a repair of the office before verifying and installing the operating systems and office updates.
<br />
<br />Repair steps:
<br />go to the control panel&gt; open programs and functions&gt; click on office&gt; click on change&gt; and try the quick repair. This will take a few minutes.
<br />If this does not work, try the online repair.
<br />Go to the control panel&gt; open programs and functions&gt; click on office&gt; click on change&gt; and try the online repair. This may take around 10 minutes or more.
<br />
<br />If you have another question, I am here to help you.
<br />Greeting.

    <title>Cannot open password protected Excel file even after removing password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgreen10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open password protected Excel file even after removing password</h2>
                    <p>I have a password-protected .xls Excel file that I regularly open, read, and write to using Excel 2010 on Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64-bit. All of a sudden, I can no longer open the file. When I enter the correct password, it is accepted without any error
 message but the Excel window is blank (no grid of rows and columns, no data). I can open other Excel files without password protection. This is the only file I have with password protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open the protected file on my other Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64-bit computer running Excel 2010 (same OS and Office version). I removed the password protection on the other computer, saved the file, and transferred it back to the first computer.
 When I try to open the file, there is no error message but the Excel window is blank (no grid of rows and columns, no data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be related to not updating Windows for many months. My Windows Update stopped working many months ago and I have over 100 pending updates but cannot download them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how I can open the Excel file on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>How long have you been facing the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To resolve the warning that a site is trying to load from your contents list follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer 9 and select
<b>Tools</b> and go to <span>&nbsp;</span><b>Internet Options </b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Security</b> Tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Trusted Sites</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Custom Level</b> Button</span></p>

<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <b>Ok</b>, Apply, <b>
Ok</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This should stop the warning from appearing; just keep in mind the warnings are there for protection against any unwanted action.&nbsp; If you do need to be aware of this type of issue occurring, remember to change the setting back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to run an online safety scan; it could be due to spywares</span></p>

    <title>Linked Charts in PPT from Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhishekadhikari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linked Charts in PPT from Excel</h2>
                    <p>I am using linked charts from excel in ppt in Office 365. </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c9da89a-79fe-4cc1-915c-9cfe75348da0" /></p>
<p>I have kept them on auto update and the charts get updated when the excel data is updated. For simplicity I have placed the respective excel file and the 14 ppts (one for each branch) in the same folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a consultant I am going to send out the Branch MIS for some more days post which it will be taken up by a client team member.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried a pilot run and gave the folder to the client. When he opened the ppts and clicked on update links, none of them got updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the links were still using the entire path as in my PC and didnt get converted to the path in his PC. I was under the impression that since all the ppts and excel files are in same folder they are portable and can be used anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b431a6d1-f3c6-4294-9184-49c27e9b7449" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i have to re-edit the links then it will be nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Try editing just one or two of the links to fix the source path. &nbsp;Verify whether or not the edited links then work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will help determine whether it's indeed a link problem or something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory and sometimes in practice it really does work as you expect it to, but that's been on-and-off, depending on Office version and, as near as I can tell, phase of the moon and which trouser leg the end user put his or her leg into first. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the edited link works, there's a bit of code on my PPT FAQ site that you/the end user can run to do a search/replace on all the links in the file.</p>

            <p>Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try the first part. Second part I need some help with since i am not very comfortable with Macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can understand that the macro will ask for the substitution directory path in case of folder changes. Which is fine for me but was thinking that wont it be tedious? since it still needs to be done for each ppt file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A solution would be great where it says that the link to the chart exists in this particular folder would be great. Doesnt matter where the folder is. It would great to get something like in some websites where if you upload a file from one of your folders
 on your PC, it creates a fake path right up to the folder where the file resides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>best regards,<br />

<p>Yes they are all in the same folder. I basically moved the entire folder from my laptop to clients laptop and placed it on the desktop. Except for his name in the path C:\Users\&lt;his name&gt;\Branch Mis... everything else was the same.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 University Renewal</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>my Office 365 university subscription is about to expire, I was told. So I bought a new subscription for another four years, using the same account. Do I actually have to reinstall Office or will my current installation continue to work without further ado?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Facebook notifications from being delivered to my account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>when I set up a face book account a couple of years ago I did it using my live.com e-mail address.&nbsp; Face book never accepted that account so I went to my aol.com e-mail account and again signed up and this time face book accepted it.&nbsp; Then I started getting
 notifications at live mail but when I tried to open the account using live.com e-mail address it would not let me sign on.&nbsp; I grew weary of this and the changes face book would make with out telling people that is closed out the account using the aol e-mail.&nbsp;
 That ended the aol notifications but did not stop the live.com e-mail notifications.</p>
<p>My question now is how can I stop or block any e-mails at my live or now outlook account from face book, which never accepted the live.com account?</p>
<p>thank you any help I could get would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; My live or outlook address is **removed email for privacy**.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 One other note my live or now outlook account is working fine just would like to eliminate these unwanted face book e-mails</p>

            Try downloading Nokia Xpress. This basically does the same thing as Opera Mini, ie. a proxy server compresses the pages before sending them to you. Also, if you are lucky enough to have been granted access to Datasense that has a more universal compression
 feature.

    <title>Emails blocked by SmartScreen, Microsoft won&#39;t help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_519  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails blocked by SmartScreen, Microsoft won&#39;t help</h2>
                    <p>I run our company's email server, and I was notified by a customer that an email to him went straight to his junk. I did some testing, and any time I send a message to my own live.com email address, the messages always go straight to junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're already in the junk mail reporting program, but haven't had any reports recently (in over 6 months), and our IP reputation is good. I contacted Microsoft support, and they confirmed that our IP wasn't blocked, but that our emails were being put straight
 into junk by SmartScreen. Unfortunately they refused to explain any more, saying that SmartScreen uses heuristics to determine what is spam. However the problem is that *all* emails are going to junk, no matter what the content. Even emails that were successfully
 delivered to live.com email addresses in the past are now being filtered. It looks like they are in fact filtering our ip address because emails from our server are junked even if I change the domain name in the From address, but identical emails get through
 when sent from gmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their conclusion is: "</p>

<p><span>Unfortunately, after reviewing the information you provided and in compliance</span></p>
<p><span>with our mail policies, we are unable to offer immediate mitigation for your</span></p>
<p><span>deliverability issue. However, we have some specific recommendations for you to</span></p>
<p><span>consider that can help you to improve deliverability over time."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>But we are already doing everything in their recommendations. So unless someone can unblock us, we will have to advise our customers not to use hotmail/live.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Bear in mind that no spam has ever come from this server. We only ever send emails to customers who sign up for our products, or who email us. We have a newsletter, but customers only receive it if they deliberately
 sign up (we don't auto-subscribe them to it), and it has an unsubscribe link that works.</span></p>

<p>This is the same problem we are experiencing. Outlook deliverability support keeps trying to send us copy and pasted replies and suggesting that we sign up for Return Path extortion program to ensure emails are delivered to the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you we've got proper SPF, DKIM and DMARC settings. Even reviewing the headers of the emails, everything passes all of the outlook.com filters except for one final filter which immediately shunts the email into the junk folder. These problems do not
 occur with gmail.com nor yahoo.com. Only outlook and hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels like Microsoft is trying to extort businesses now by sending legitimate business emails (one on one communications with customers) to junk mail boxes and trying to extort thousands a year from return path to guarantee they'll reach the inbox.</p>

            I don't disagree with that, but Microsoft needs to provide better support for this. That deliverability dept that the form goes to only knows how to copy and paste a single reply. The issue that OP and myself have need to be escalated but searching through
 the forums I think Microsoft emails are just broken anyways. So many people reporting junk emails even order emails from Amazon and the likes.

<p>Solar-Eclipse: yes, I already filled in that form, and that was how I got the response from Microsoft. They have confirmed that our IP address isn't on their blacklist (and I can see myself that it isn't, as we're in the junk mail reporting program). It's
 the smartscreen filter that's doing this, but it seems to have a separate ip block as well (from what I can determine), with no way to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the market share of outlook.com/live.com/hotmail is about 5%, and only a handful of our customers use it. I'd prefer to support those customers, but if this isn't fixed I'll just recommend that they use another service. They can still get the emails
 if they mark one or two of them as "not junk", but that's just silly and annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not changing our IP address.</p>

<p>David, trust me when I say it's not just you. I manage a large network and we're seeing it across an enormous swath of our customer servers. No rhyme or reason. Good reputations across the board on the IPs, non marketing emails, many just personal emails
 going to junk folders. Even our main corporate domain and server which have had the same IP for the last 10~ years and is on a private range so no bad neighbors is impacted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems they want to extort people to signup for ReturnPath and pay a ridiculous amount of money to white list their domain name which is not going to happen. They need to provide better support for these issues not copy and paste emails.

</p><p>I've been fighting the very same thing. Every reply is a copy and paste from one of three standard replies they've given. Regardless of the evidence, headers etc that is provided they ignore you and just keep passing the ticket on to the next entry level
 tech. Once upon a time years ago I actually got someone from that department on the phone, but it seems that is completely gone now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also have a support ticket open directly from my outlook.com account and they just want me to add my corporate email to the safe senders list which is a garbage excuse. I pushed them for escalation and more details but haven't heard back yet so we shall
 see although I'm not very hopeful.</p>

<h2>            Yammer topics tags gets small caps</h2>
                    In past, when you add topic tag to your post which is basically some abbreviation like "MSFT" it gets posted correctly like "MSFT" to post. But now, when you add such tag, it&nbsp;gets small caps after first letter like "Msft". I&nbsp;tried to turn of autocorrect
 in browser, but it looks like, that this is not the case (Edge). Do you encounter something similar?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for delay in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I checked at my couple of test yammer home network when I posted MSFT it was done successfully, but when I tried to add any random word as ABCD as well it was getting add in topics<span>&nbsp;
</span>as #Abcd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it seems to be in topics only one word can be typed as capital and rest would be in small letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please let me know if you have any further query or concerns. Please to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Sharepoint library sites not syncing</h2>
                    
<p>My Office 365 OneDrive for business is syncing successfully, but my Sharepoint is not syncing. I can see the name "Sharepoint" in my Windows Explorer, but no files in it. When I sync individual libraries, I open the library on Office 365 Sites online and
 click on Sync above all the documents in the library. A pop up window appears stating that "Sync this library to your device for easy access" and I click on "Sync Now". After I clicked on "Sync Now", either nothing happens or a pop-up screen comes up that
 says that my files are busy being synced, but no files appear within my Sharepoint folder and when I click that it must show me my files whilst they come in, nothing happens.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled both one drive for business and sharepoint to no avail. I do not know what else to do - please assist.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Annelize,</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, could you let us know some information?<br />
1. The version of your OneDrive for Business sync app.<br />
To check it, you can go to Task Manager-&gt; Microsoft OneDrive for Business-&gt; Properties-&gt; Details.<br />
Please note that if you are using <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Meet-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-7af500d9-a18e-4abb-8450-b94f4e52c1a0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client </a>(version 17.3.***), currently it doesn't support SharePoint library sync. This feature will be added in future releases.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;it is not the case, please share a related&nbsp;screenshot&nbsp;about the error for our reference.<br />
To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong>.</p>
<p>2. You may try manually sync a library to see if there's any difference:<br />
Right click the OneDrive for Business icon in taskbar-&gt; Sync a new library-&gt; input the URL (e.g.
<a href="https://domain.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx</a>)</p>
<p>3. Make sure you have read the sync limitations:<br />

<p>4. Does the issue happen to a newly created team site library?</p>

    <title>Taskbar resizing on dual monitor setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dante_undefined  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar resizing on dual monitor setup</h2>
                    Original title: Taskbar resizing<br />
<br />
I LOVE the new Taskbar options. I am especially happy with dual Taskbars on dual monitors. I've noticed one strange "issue" though. When I unlock the Taskbar and resize it on the primary monitor, it&nbsp;always returns back to the one level default setting when
 I reboot. When I resize the Taskbar on the secondary monitor it stays put.... I'm running Build 9860.

    <title>5230 problems with setting downloaded song as ringtone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aliesher01  say:</h3>
<h2>            5230 problems with setting downloaded song as ringtone</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I have done a search for an answer to this but I cant find one, apologies if its already been asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;just got a 5230 as my N95 finally gave up and I have managed to transfer&nbsp;everything and set up the 5230 as I want it apart from the ringtones.&nbsp;I just cant set a song as a ringtone on my nokia 5230 it says file is protected but it plays in the music
 player.</p>
<p>All songs I have downloaded have been purchased from Nokia music store and transfered to the 5230 via usb cable as I realised that doing it via bluetooth doesnt transfer the licences aswell so I re did all that. they are the same songs that I had set as
 ringtones on my N95 with no problems, what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any advice.</p>

<p>The music is right protected so you can't use it ! Either rip a cd and transfer an mp3 file you want to use, or go here and get 1000's of free ringtones :smileywink:</p>

    <title>Attn&#58; BingAds charges triple or sometimes quadruple for single - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pleasantnews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attn&#58; BingAds charges triple or sometimes quadruple for single click. Legal fraud</h2>
                    <p>History:</p>
<p>few months I noticed that 1 impression can (!LOL!) fire 2-3 and even 4 clicks. How? How CTR can be more that 100% ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very easy - each click charged so they don't bother with Network Performance or whatever - and just charge TRIPLE !!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to chat with the support, but since it is outsourced somewhere in South Eastern Asian country and they don't really up-to-standard of what they support I had to communicate with "semi automatic copy-paste cyborgs"&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok. I got tired and stopped using BingAds as it was daylight robbery - yes., taking money and telling its "ok" is robbery. or Felony. Whatever,</p>
<p>Yesterday I thought - well, probably they improved or kicked some out and got better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deposit small $ and watched. Yeah! Again the same banana -&nbsp;</p>
<p>the keyword I didn't bid on&nbsp;</p>
<p>caused 1 impression in 1 city (I got Apache log as well as BingAds dimensions report) and SHINY THREE (3!) CLICKS!
</p>
<p>Hooray, CTR = 300%</p>
<p>the girl far far away in Manila (wannabe customer cater) &nbsp;named Ciara (what a wierd name, it is not - it is Nickname) told me she cant see what wrong ..</p>
<p>Ok. I got back within 8 hrs. I thought it was early morning staff and went to sleep - but no - they are still there, this time it was some Cookie (even better name, right?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one told me it is "ok" to pay for CTR.,&nbsp;</p>
<p>They don't refund&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engineers already looked at my issue and they said all clicks are valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now funny part - she called it "back clicks" with some Alice in Wonderland story about customer open notebook,. close it, switch it and click again and again ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>complete nonsense from sick imagination of the person which has no clue how PPC works, cookies and unique code of clicks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I said I have Apache log to prove onle 1 visit - she said --- Apache log is a third party tracking and they don't count it as legit.</p>
<p>So, please if you have a chance to avoid BingAds, or use it very carefully - once you deposit your money, kiss them goodbye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>shame, really shame to those who employ such low quality staff for such a big name company.</p>

<h2>            iOS shows inbox and junk folders with mail, but there is none</h2>
                    <p>On my Apple devices, hotmail folders, in box and junk show a count of new mail or unread mail and there is none. It has been this way for several months. I checked all unread and flagged mail but there is none. Any one have any idea why hotmail thinks there
 are 2 in my inbox and 1 in my junk folder, when there aren't any? Thanks</p>
<p>btw, it shows this on my iPhone, iPad and Mac book pro.</p>

            Like I said in the problem description, I am using Apple devices, iPhone, iPad, and Mac Book Pro for my hotmail accounts. &nbsp;I have used this for many many years without seeing a problem like this. Using these devices does not offer to change the VIEW to
 FROM. &nbsp;Junk mail is being sent to the junk folder and trash is going to trash folder just like they should. These are emptied out several times a day, test for several months now, hotmail thinks I have 2 emails in my inbox, and 1 junk mail in my junk folder,
 yet there are no new ones in either. Hotmail is confused because it appears this way on all devices.

            <p>Thank you for your response. I am checking my hotmail account through iOS on my iPhone and iPad, and also through my mac book pro which uses a different OS. I don't think you can actually "uninstall" the iOS Mail app on the iPhone. I can delete the hotmail
 account from Mail, contacts, etc on the phone, however, then it has to be rebuilt pointing to all the incoming and outgoing servers to make sure all my folders are present, then all mail has to be downloaded again. This seems like a drastic measure when three
 different devices all show the same problem with extra counts in inbox and junk folders, which are not new. Sounds like something wrong with hotmail (outlook)' not the apple devices. Thank you, however, I will not be following this suggestion.</p>

            <p>This is a problem with iOS Mail App I can assure you. I have it also as do many other users, whether they are using Microsoft email accounts, gmail, iCloud mail, aol, you name it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happens to me with my Exchange account that I have on my domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inevitably, the bug kicks in and the Mail app will show unread messages when there are none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no permanent fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can "clear it out" and cross your fingers by either disabling Mail (switch the slider off) on your email account in settings. Close the Mail app. Power cycle the device. Restart and re-enable the mail app. Unread badge should be gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes that does not work and you need to delete the entire account and add it back after a power cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes that does not work and you need to continue through the two aforementioned processes until it finally sticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once all is back to normal, cross those fingers because the problem may resurface quickly after a few uses. My problem always seems to regenerate in my junk mail folder not updating properly when swiping to delete a message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is 100% an Apple issue and as far as I am aware, it is unacknowledged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to one other thread about this, but there are more. <a href="http://appletoolbox.com/2015/11/ios-mail-app-shows-unread-emails-when-there-are-none-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="click here">
LINK</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This one is not 100% the same as mine, but very similar. This issue has apparently been around for years. I have been dealing with it on and off for at least a couple of years. Very annoying.</p>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>thanks for all the info. Yep, I've done all those things you mentioned, for years now, and it keeps coming back. Sometimes even worse. I'm up to 8 new inbox emails, when there are none. I hate to have to turn off the hotmail account in iOS, because I then
 have to download again the thousands of emails I have in 20 folders. Not fun. Wish Apple would fix this once and for all, but it won't happen.</p>

            <p>Amen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my push settings for that Exchange account set to manual so it only pulls the sub-folders back down that I need on demand. I also set No Limit on Mailbox Days to Sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Junk folder is my biggest offender. Sometimes I can even delete the account completely and the ghosted cache messages still show once the account is re-added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last time I forced it to refresh has held up so far. I took extra steps to make sure it was cleared out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I deleted the account. I made sure the Junk folder was empty on my email server (easier on Junk than Inbox I am sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I power cycled the phone. Opened Mail app and it gave me the default screen since no accounts were there. Force quit the app. Power cycled the phone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I added the account back and made sure Push settings were set to manual and days to sync No Limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not go into the mailbox yet. At this point I turned the Email off on the account, leaving only Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Tasks selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went in to app and made sure it was defaulted. It was. Force quit app. Power cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I switched Mail back on, verified settings were still as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back into my mailboxes and have not had the issue come back since. I am hoping that my repetitive and redundant steps flushed the offenders out of the cache memory or wherever they were being stored and fingers crossed it does no occur again has it
 has in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you as well.</p>

            I unfortunately encounter this all the time. What I have done is go through the steps of encrypting the memory card and creating a key file for it. After it has saved the key file to the phone I back out of the encryption menu without actually encrypting
 the card. But I leave the menu option for encryption turned on. Every so often my E71 will say the memory card is corrupted. when it says that I just go back into the encryption menu and it will ask about the key file and passphrase. After I enter the phrase
 the card works just fine. I think its some kind of bug causing the phone to set random encryption keys.

<p>Had exactly the same problem, there appear to be a number of different issues that can cause this.&nbsp; For me it was the&nbsp;SIM card (manufacturer design fault, hope you are still under warranty!).</p>
<p>Cause 1: SIM card test.&nbsp; Remove the phone SIM card, &amp; see if the problem still occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><font color="#0066cc">/discussions/board/message?board.id=topfaq&amp;thread.id=119</font></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cause 2: Formatted with encrypted key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick fix: Backup data on SD card to PC, then reformat SD card using PC, you lose data on the card but at least the problem goes away.&nbsp; Alternatively try the steps outlined in

http://attahun.blogspot.com/2009/06/nokia-e71-problem-memory-card-corrupted.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cause 3: MicroSD defective.&nbsp; Try another card.</p>

<h2>            I have some viruses that won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    Hello everyone I have some trojans on my computer that no matter what I do don't seem to go away.<br />
<br />
The threat level is severe for now they are suspended, but when ever I do the removal procedure then reboot they just show up again<br />
<br />
Here are their names:<br />
<br />
Trojan:WIn32/Sirefef.AB<br />
<br />
Trojan:Win64/Sirefef.P<br />
<br />
I tried going to their locations that were listed on the descriptions but they "don't exist"<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_32\Desktop.ini<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\assembly\GAC_64\Desktop.ini<br />
<br />
My firewall has been disabled by these viruses, and they destroyed my restore points<br />
<br />
The symptoms are that when I use google or any search engine really some of the time it will redirect me to shopping websites, also these two trojans bring 3 others with them, I am able to delete the 3 others unlike these two but they show up again when they
 do I recently got rid of another virus known as Ping.exe after I got rid of that one these ones showed up<br />
<br />
I am running a 64 bit copy of win 7 <br />
<br />
Any help would be very much appreciated. <br />

            <p><strong>Ahaap</strong> gave you good advice to try.&nbsp; If MSE won't&nbsp;remove the malware&nbsp;by all means try Malwarebytes Free, Superantispyware (might try Superantispyware Portable)&nbsp;and TDSS Killer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the following: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/trojanwin32sirefp/2b0641ba-0273-4839-b254-eead42bcdacb">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <strong>may</strong> have to disable System Restore then reboot and reenable System Restore if the malware is in the System Volume folder.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com e0mail, Thunderbird &#38; 2-Step Authentication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_rexpert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com e0mail, Thunderbird &#38; 2-Step Authentication</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Thunderbird (v 52.9.1) to check my various e-mail accounts (outlook, gmail and Yahoo). All was going well until I decided to turn on 2-step authentication on my Microsoft account. This was not unexpected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into account settings, entered my display name, e-ddress and password (generated using the password app from Microsoft). I have tried both IMAP and POP3 settings, but each time it attempts to verify my login, I get the error "Configuration could
 not be verified - username or password wrong?".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this question on the Thunderbird forums and was asked if my Anti-Virus software had a password vault that could be interfering - it does not.</p>
<p>I have used this same app to configure my gmail account which uses a virtually identical process, as does my Yahoo account.</p>
<p>I have been able to use this process to configure my outlook mail on my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, speaking with Microsoft they blame Thunderbird...you know the story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any ideas to solve this issue? Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>I don't know the first thing about Thunderbird, but I can say that you don't generate a password with a password app. I think you're referring to an Authenticator app, which is a different thing altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've set up two-step verification for your Microsoft Account, you have to generate an
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
app password</a> to use in your mail client program instead of the account password. This is because the program has no way to submit the code for the second step of the verification process. When you access the security page of your Microsoft Account, you'll
 probably have to enter the code from your authenticator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding insolent, I believe that is what I said I did. I also mentioned that it is exactly the same process I followed for my Yahoo and Gmail accounts. Those both work fine.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 hours later...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have taken another half a day to fight with this issue, it turns out that the problem (as my other post suggests) was not with Thunderbird after all - the problem was with Muckrosoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to use any program other than theirs, one must go into the security configuration and set it to allow access by other apps to the IMAP and POP3 servers. Once I discovered this precious nugget of information I was able to get my e-mail configured
 in about 90 seconds.</p>
