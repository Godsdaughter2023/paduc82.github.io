                    I have Windows 7. Lately When I try to open pages on internet it takes forever to load. And the screen gets a white haze over it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Update Code 57A MS Office updates fail and Code 643 Silverlight update fail</h2>
                    
<p>First, I am running Windows Vista SP1, have MS Office 2007, and I assume MS Silverlight intalled as well. &nbsp;Interestingly, I installed or attempted to install Silverlight, MS SDK Package and MS Visual Studio about the same time as my problems first popped
 up. &nbsp;I stress attempted to install. &nbsp;I don't think any of the above actually properly installed, this being the same day or the day before the update issues started happening. &nbsp;I have always wondered if there was a connection. &nbsp;It was a bit of a messed up
 install from the beginning (this was a full year and a half ago, so bear with me, I'm not 100% certain that the Silverlight was among the things I installed that day, but the SDK and Visual studio, yes, I'm 100% certain and that it was the day before this
 started or else the same day)... I was installing them direct from my university at the time, which is a public four year institution that happens to use live email as the university email now, in case you might wonder if this is just some community college.
 &nbsp;Their install directions were exceptionally unclear, and honestly they have a pretty sad IT department, so I wound up having to attempt to install the software about 4 or 5 times, with different versions nonetheless. &nbsp;I would say its entirely possible that's
 a cause of the effect of my update problems, which I admit I have yet to get to. &nbsp;Backstory is important, though. &nbsp;I've found that people just give you the problem without backstory. &nbsp;What can you fix without knowing where the problem came from?</p>
<p>Anyway, I originally had 18 updates that wouldn't install. &nbsp;I've narrowed that down to 7 over today through various fixes and things. &nbsp;Just for thoroughness, I reinstalled .NET Framework 1.1 SP1, on the off chance I messed that up somehow. &nbsp;.NET Framework
 1.1 SP1 updates are installing just fine now, but I can't tell if that's why or if it was the other things I tried. &nbsp;I also checked the box for "allow updating for all users". &nbsp;This seemed to unblock 11 of the 18 blocked updates. &nbsp;This leaves 7 updates that
 were blocked and continue to be blocked. &nbsp;Those updates have to do with MS Office 2007, starting with the service pack 2 update on the same day as the previously mentioned issues with installing Visual Studio and related software, and escalating into other
 updates all of which have to do with MS Office 2007. &nbsp;All of these have the now infamous code 57A. &nbsp;I have tried most, but not all, of the various fixes prescribed on this site to solve this. &nbsp;The only one I haven't tried is uninstalling and reinstalling my
 Norton Antivirus (or else, preferrably, uninstalling Norton and reinstalling Webroot, I swear, I HATE Norton). &nbsp;The only other solution I haven't tried, but of course I seriously doubt it won't just get me to square one, is a clean install of Vista or Windows
 7. &nbsp;I have done the registry fix for MS Office (on another note, MS Word crashes upon exit some of the time, however my data always is perfectly fine and its not like it crashes in program... I also think Powerpoint does this too and more frequently)... I
 have also defaulted the settings on Windows update, in case that would work, which it didn't. &nbsp;I've also messed with my firewall to try to get things to work. &nbsp;Nope, none of this works with those updates. &nbsp;I also should mention that I installed Open Office
 on my computer about the same time as these problems started happening. &nbsp;I don't know if that would cause issues too. &nbsp;I also have problems with updating Silverlight, which runs into issues with a Code 643 (yes, I seem to get all the anonymous codes on these
 problems). &nbsp;But in any case, I'm not even sure I have Silverlight completely and fully installed. &nbsp;On that matter, I am running into a slightly unrelated (possibly related, possibly core to the issue) problem whereby certain programs outside of Windows update
 are not installing or updating either. &nbsp;Adobe isn't updating... Flash will, Reader won't. &nbsp;In fact, Java itself won't update (it will install, but just not update). &nbsp;I did install Netbeans IDE with all the bells and wistles, which required installing Java
 SDK kit, among other things. &nbsp;This, well guess, was on the same day as things stopped working with these updates and such. &nbsp;I know, I'm throwing everything at you, sorry. &nbsp;But at least I am giving you every piece of info I can find. &nbsp;That's better than 99.9%
 of people on here. &nbsp;You've got to give me credit for that.</p>
<p>I also used a registry cleaner during this whole process but the timing is off (by a few months), and I fixed registry problems through it and through Microsoft's fix it solution. &nbsp;My default webbrowser over this time has hardly ever been Internet Explorer,
 if that makes a difference (Firefox or Chrome). &nbsp;Currently its Firefox. &nbsp;That's about all that I can think of at this time.</p>
<p>To summarize core issues:</p>
<p>Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB974561) 8.8MB</p>
<p>The 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2) 202.4MB</p>
<p>Security Update for the 2007 Microsoft Office System (KB972581) 1.0MB</p>
<p>Security Update for Mircosoft Office Word 2007 (KB2251419) 8.9MB</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 (KB982158) 3.8MB</p>
<p>Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB2416427) 6.0MB</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB978464) 4.7MB</p>
<p>A short note, the most recent time when I had just applied the MS fix it to default Window update and had these updates downloaded, it registered only 23 MB or so downloading, instead of the close to 230 MB that is actually there. &nbsp;I don't know if Microsoft
 runs a compression and that is to be expected, but I read somewhere that with this code 57A part of most of the file should be missing. &nbsp;Perhaps that's the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>

<p>I tried to run an update log, but it was horrendously long due to me updating to Vista SP2 last night. &nbsp;I might have remove the update log software and then reinstall it, wait a day or two, see if that cuts down on the size of the log file. &nbsp;I tried copy
 and pasting it, but it crashed Chrome and froze up Explorer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no change in situation, even after installing SP2 for Vista.</p>

            I also have been able to install every update for .NET framework, suggesting fairly strongly that I've done nothing at all to it. &nbsp;I think what happened was I looked at it and thought about doing something with it, but thought better of it. &nbsp;I may have
 even clicked on it but got scared off by Microsoft's warnings and such. &nbsp;Still, something's going on... at the very least, it'll most likely be fixed when I upgrade to Windows 7 around the end of the year.

<p>Read that first post before posting here, btw. &nbsp;Actually went through tons of them. &nbsp;As it turns out, the thing that has popped out in my mind with all that I read is the statement "Norton/Symantec can mess up the updating process severely" or something
 along those lines. &nbsp;I've done some experimenting with that and I have just one more option before I officially call whatever "easy" options with Norton dead. &nbsp;Essentially, nothing I'm doing that's an "easy" fix with Norton is working, so far. &nbsp;I have yet to
 try one more thing, and honestly I have more faith in that than anything else I've done so far. &nbsp;Will update Y/N on working once I complete that. &nbsp;Otherwise, I suspect I may have to pull the plug on Norton at some point for various reasons and install a different
 AV software package... there's about a hundred different reasons to do it, I just don't feel up to the hassle today, which is why I'm going with the easy route on this first.</p>

<p>Not to sound precocious, as if to solve my own problem. &nbsp;I am like that though...</p>
<p>Went on HP's support forums, mostly to check about upgrading my video card. &nbsp;I happened upon the following thread on there:</p>
<p><a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Monitors-and-video/hp-m8120n-os-upgrade-video-card-geForce-7350LE/m-p/332443#M7864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Monitors-and-video/hp-m8120n-os-upgrade-video-card-geForce-7350LE/m-p/332443#M7864</a></p>
<p>Which talks about a problem I'm experiencing and didn't even know it, regarding my video card fan accelerating out of control and then halting for times. &nbsp;This happens every time I install a new piece of critical (Microsoft, for instance) software, really
 when I install any software. &nbsp;It doesn't really happen otherwise, unless of course a AV scan is going on, or some other system process is triggering it. &nbsp;The fact of the matter is, this got me to wondering, is the problem with the video card (GeForce 7350LE)
 the key issue here, and not something software related. &nbsp;I've had issues with this computer before this round of updates, heck, I've had worse issues than this. &nbsp;Is it possible that my problems are hardware related and not software related. &nbsp;So, on that note,
 I also wonder if a good chunk, if not all people experiencing similar problems to me have similar hardware as well. &nbsp;I'm running Vista Home Premium SP2, though I suggest that won't matter much, and I'm running on a HP m8120n Media Center PC, which has a Basswood
 3G/Asus P5BW-LA Motherboard, and a GeForce 7350 LE video card made by NVIDIA. &nbsp;I suggest that perhaps most people will have the same motherboard configuration and video card as I have with this problem. &nbsp;It's a bit early to tell, though. &nbsp;My point is, short
 of uninstalling and reinstalling my AV software, this is about the only issue left and really the only cut and dry issue that actually really exists for sure. &nbsp;I also have had glitches and bugs with my computer the entire time I've had it, attributing them
 to Vista, but its entirely possible that a Video card that occasionally has blurts where it goes hyperactive or gets sluggish or even switches off for a very brief moment might be the problem. &nbsp;It could account for certain updates going through and others,
 that might update onto graphics intensive platforms (Powerpoint, Word, Silverlight, these being the only programs not updating), well, they won't update, will they? &nbsp;It also would explain a whole host of problems on graphics intensive platforms, including
 Word crashing upon exit, sluggish performance from a 3 GB quad core computer, plenty of CTD on various extremely graphics intensive programs, strange graphics failures on certain programs, things of that nature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess my next step is upgrading my video card. &nbsp;That should solve the problem. &nbsp;Hopefully my self-solution will help others who are having the same problems.</p>

<p>I took a printscreen log while I was having an issue with Norton Internet Security running up 25% of my CPU... Windows Update was the next down on CPU usage, indicating it was at least somewhat active during that fit by Norton. &nbsp;I thought Norton might be
 scanning but it seems that's not the case. &nbsp;I had disabled the Idle Timeout Scan on Norton and as such there should be no major scan taking place... in fact, when it does scan, it takes 30 seconds to do a quick scan and that barely budges my CPU/memory usage,
 maybe by a percentage point or so. &nbsp;It doesn't nor should it make a 25% hit like that. &nbsp;Which brings me to the conclusion that it has something to do with Windows Update... perhaps a conflict of some kind.</p>
<p>I've tried doing about as much as I can short of uninstalling Norton and installing a different antivirus. &nbsp;Please help with this.</p>

<p>Norton wasn't the problem at all. &nbsp;I did fix Norton by upgrading to Norton 2010... there was a .exe running with Norton 2009 that used up pretty much one core of my quad core processor (as it turns out, that's exactly what that .exe did). &nbsp;But it also turns
 out that's completely unrelated to this thread, the issue at hand being Code 57A for MS Office Updates and Code 643 for MS Silverlight updates. &nbsp;I haven't tried the hotfix for code 643 yet... I've been focusing all my energies on fixing Code 57A.</p>
<p>Just from what I've gathered on these forums... Code 57A should be solved by inserting MS Office DVD into drive while running Windows Update. &nbsp;Don't ask me why this is the case, and I haven't tried it because I fear my MS Office DVD got lost in a move a
 couple of years back (I'm still looking for it, though). &nbsp;Code 643 I suppose the hotfix should work but I haven't tried that yet. &nbsp;I'll attempt that tonight and hopefully we'll see where that goes.</p>

<p>With regards to me loosing my MS Office DVD, I don't suppose there is any way I can get another copy of that DVD sent to me along with my already existent subscription information, given I let Microsoft scan my computer for said subscription information
 and I'm not asking for anything other than the actual DVD I lost (and, I'll add, hopefully at worst I'll just be paying something like a shipping and processing charge?). &nbsp;I had MS Office 2007 Home and Student.</p>

<p>OK... the problem has been located, I think its a common source. &nbsp;A registry cleaner I apparently misused which each time I used it corresponds to some sort of mishap with Windows Update and also with various other issues. &nbsp;I don't suppose anyone else did
 the same and this is why everyone is having those problems... it might be safe to say you all need to put a warning out about these things.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 Display Screen Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with the Surface Book 2 which was just unboxed today. I found a vertical pink line on the right side of the display screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that it may be due to display graphic card issue and tried to uninstall and reinstall the driver, also tried with update hardware change on the device manager, but failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other alternative as I am in Singapore &nbsp;and there is no support centre here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p />

<p>Hi DotNetEngineer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display adapter may be the reason behind this issue. We suggest that you install the recommended firmware and drivers for the Surface Book 2 to make sure that you have the best software packages running on the system. You can open
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> to download the file package. Choose the file that corresponds to your Windows version and OS build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</h2>
                    <p>I created a modified layout for my keyboard. I was able to select it in my keyboard settings page, but it doesn't show-up in the task bar language options, so I can't select it for may keyboard.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone knows what the problem could be.</p>

<p><span>Hi Muddled2000,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install your network adapter driver</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: To re-install network adapter driver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before you uninstall the network adapter driver, I would suggest you to download the latest network adapter driver from your computer manufacturer
 website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to uninstall network adapter driver</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type ‘devmgmt.msc’ and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Network adapter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the network component and click on uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you completely uninstall the network adapter driver, double click on the network driver setup file and follow the installation instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you successfully install the driver for your network card, try to uncheck the box “Allow Computer to Turn Off this Device” and test to see
 if the box remains unchecked even after restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

It is always sad to see a developer close but I'm not really surprised.<br />
<br />
The game had great ideas but never clicked for me and it joined that list of games that I stopped playing but really couldn't tell you why.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great game.</p>

<p>Looked excellent and besides the Memory scenes the ability to build your own combos was briliant for those who figured out how to use it for maximum effect.</p>

<p>One of the last truly innovative games on the 360.</p>

<p>The 'building your own combos' bit sounds like it was influenced by God Hand. That game needs some sort of XBLA overhaul for 360.</p>

<p>Hi the JANI,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that this has happened to you but you would need to contact phone support by clicking this link
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#0:0:6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. In regards to your question about your points and such being returned, if the investigation that the XBOX Live Enforcement Team conducts via the Unauthorized Use Ticket turns
 out in your favor (in other words if they can see that you weren't the one that purchased these items) they will return the points back to you. But this totally depends on the outcome of their investigation.<br />
<br />
Along with changing your password, I also recommend that you check this page <strong>
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile/Protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>, it lets you see other consoles that have recovered your profile and require them to enter in a password when they next login. Once you do this it should make you download your profile
 again to access the content on your account which should be fine since the other person that had access the account won't be able to access it anymore.<br />

            Hi JosephSanders60,
<br />
<br />You can search for notepad within the Windows start menu. 
<br />
<br />You can open Run (Windows key + r) and enter: notepad
<br />
<br />You can browse to C:\WINDOWS\system32\notepad.exe
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<h3> davelovell  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I access My Documents&#63; I need to get the the files I put on my computer</h2>
                    When I got this new Windows7 computer I set up 2 users: myself - whom I set up as an Administrator - and my wife - a standard user. I copied all the files from my old computer into My Documents into places like My Music, My Pictures etc.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now - how do I get back to them to actually USE them? If I click on My Documents I get an error message: Access is Denied.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I clicked on properties and security - according to this Administrators have access to this folder. I AM AN ADMINISTRATOR.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried granting administrators access to various files on this computer but it will not let me - I get access is denied.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to add access to My Documents to my user directly rather than by using Administrators - which I guess is the microsoft version of groups - and it gave me access is denied - but then when I go back in it lists my username in the list and shows that
 user - me - has full control. But if I click the folder I get access is denied.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had this crazy idea that being an administrator on a Windows machine was like being root on UNIX. Everyone knows Windows "security" has always been extremely problematic or non-existent but I cannot even imagine any security system that would prevent
 a user from accessing their own stuff (unless you specifically protect it) and certainly not one that prevents an administrator from changing permissions on things or even accessing them to do so.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've logged off and back on - shut down restart ect. Nothing changes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on how to get to My Documents on a Windows 7 machine? It would be nice if I could do that.</div>
                </div>

            <p>"My Documents" is a Junction Point not a folder. A Junction Point is to enable legacy software to use the new folder structure in Vista/Windows 7.</p>
<p>There are several Junction Points in Windows 7, here's a list of them and the real folders they point to.</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings - C:\Users\{user name}\Documents<br />
&nbsp;Application Data - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming<br />
&nbsp;Cookies - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies<br />
&nbsp;History - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\History<br />
&nbsp;Local Settings - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Local<br />
&nbsp;NetHood - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Network Shortcuts<br />
&nbsp;PrintHood - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Printer Shortcuts<br />
&nbsp;Recent - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent<br />
&nbsp;SendTo - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo<br />
&nbsp;Start Menu - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu<br />
&nbsp;Templates - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Roaming<br />
&nbsp;Temporary Internet Files - C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary&nbsp; Internet Files</p>
<p>More info on Junction Points:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.svrops.com/svrops/articles/jpoints.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.svrops.com/svrops/articles/jpoints.htm</a></p>
<p>To access your Documents:</p>
<p>Open Windows Explorer and click on Documents under Libraries.</p>
<p>Or click on Start&gt;Your User Name&gt;My Documents. (Confusing? That "My Documents" is not a Junction Point!....)</p>
<p>And a tip to avoid future grief:</p>
<p>If you are using Windows 7 on a daily basis as an Administrator (and there's absolutely NO reason for you to be doing so - you need to forget everything to do with XP and understand that Windows 7 uses User Account Control which enables you to execute Administrator
 tasks in a Standard User Account) then you really need to create (and test) a second passworded Admin account to keep for emergency access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Windows 7, the built-in Administrator account is disabled by default and although it is possible to enable it, that process may be beyond what you feel comfortable with.<br />
&nbsp;WHEN, and not IF,you have problems accessing your ONE Admin account, you will have tremendous difficulty if you only have ONE Admin account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Create a new User Account with Administrator privileges, (call it Admin or similar) and give it a password. Keep this account for emergency access and for elevation purposes only.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Paypal payments won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t authorize - have more than enough positive balance</h2>
                    


<p>For some stupid reason, my paypal payment won't authorize. I tried it this morning and saw that Xbox Live was having billing issues. I tried just a few minutes ago and it still won't auth. I just want to purchase $19.99 worth of points. I've had this problem
 before. Sometimes it will work fine. Other times it just declines for no reason what-so-ever. Is there some reason why paypal payments only go through maybe one time out of ten? I have more than enough money in my paypal balance. My name/info is the same on
 both accounts. I've used this paypal billing agreement to make purchases in the past without incident.</p>

<p>Update: I did remove and re-add my paypal account. That didn't work either. I got this message when I tried to order points: "Your payment instrument could not be authorized. Please contact your provider, or try a different payment option." Again, with my
 paypal balance there's no reason what-so-ever for this not to have gone through.</p>

            Hi Christine
<br />
<br />See if temporarily disabling Controlled Folder Access stops that error.
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />in later versions
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Ransomware protection
<br />Toggle off Controlled folder access

            The icons on the screen shot don't look squished up to me. I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10 and have an external monitor run off the Microsoft docking station. On&nbsp;the external monitor, starting last week, the icons really look squished
 up. At Medium size setting all the icons are bunched up on the left side of the screen.&nbsp; The labels are almost invisible, covered up by the icons. Again my external monitor used to display the icons just fine, but now something changed and they are all squished
 up.

Mark from Virginia, I am having the same problem. I kept trying to change the size and it just kept screwing up the icons more. I also have a Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10. I'm currently updating the laptop, so hopefully that will help. If you figure it out,
 let me know!

            This is extraordinarily cumbersome. You have to go to the control panel which you can find if you right click the start window icon. Then scroll down to find control panel, click that open, then find hardware software, then open printer, then wait for
 that to load (took a while) then find print pause/cancel etc. Then tell it what to do? Why isn't this in menu when you click to print? Shouldn't it take one click and not five or six and all this waiting with everything hidden?&nbsp;

<p>Yup, not good instructions for Windows 10.&nbsp; What I did was muck around and fell into this:</p>
<p>I clicked on the New Notifications icon that's next to the date &amp; Time on the Task Bar, then I right clicked on the message that indicates a printer problem.&nbsp; That brought me to the old familiar Printer Status window and I went in and marked the print job
 for deletion.&nbsp; it takes a few minutes for the job to disappear, but it did.</p>

<p>I have a laptop running Windows 7 Professional and when I look under the base system device area it shows this driver is missing.</p>
<p>PCI bus 2, device 6, function 4</p>
<p>The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.</p>
<p><br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.</p>
<p>I have tried finding the specific driver on the HP site but no luck and also did the auto search for a driver. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Many issues are due to current macOS permissions or other faults that are negatively affecting Skype and other programs (lag/improper execution); not necessarily Skype itself. Here are a few possible solutions that can resolve this type of issue
 and other issues. <strong>Many people are successful with #2.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>1. Create a new macOS user, log into that account, try to use Skype. If this works, this proves an issue exists with the other account, possibly permissions or a startup program.</p>
<p>2. Attempt to repair any permission problem in the failing user's account home folder.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/HT203538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolve issues caused by changing the permissions of items in your home folder [apple.com]</a></p>
<p><span>Once repaired, try to use the latest version of Skype.</span></p>
<p>3. Attempt to remove every trace of Skype so that the latest version could be reinstalled without permission or other issues. This would include trashing and emptying any Skype named files located in the Application folder, ~/Library/Preferences,
 and what Finder could find. Be sure to retain a copy of any history files (main.db file and its folder), if you want to ensure exportation of older history.</p>
<p>4. Manually Install the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/mac.preview.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Preview version of Skype for Mac</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/mac.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Standard

<h3> jamaltariq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Read Only Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all i will tell you all that i am a computer shop owner. I do troubleshooting and installation of windows and softwares. My Problem is, i have 1 hardisk in which i have stored all the necessary softwares. When the customer demand about a specific
 software, i use my external Hardisk to connect to his PC/Laptop. Some customers computer's are infected with virus. Is there any way that i protect my hardisk from their computer's virus.</p>
<p>Is there any way that i make my haridisk read only so that whenever i attach it to the other pc/laptop, nothing gets inside it. I mean nothing can go inside my hardisk but i can access it to install softwares. So that my hardisk remains secure and their
 virus wont enter in my hardisk?</p>
<p>I tried to make my hardisk read only using the windows. I mean by right clicking on the hardisk drive and making it read only in properties but that didn't worked. I need something else so that i make my hardisk read only so that no one can use it or modify
 it (especially viruses) without removing read only from it.</p>
<p>Thanks :)&nbsp;</p>

            Nothing out of the box, meaning Windows 10 does not have that capability.
<br />But you can use 3rd party products.
<br />I haven't tested any myself so I can't say for sure which ones are the best.
<br />But this site has some suggestions, and they are normally  a reputable site that well use here at MS community.

            The link you shared contain the 3rd party softwares to Protect my PC from the USB viruses by disabling my Usb ports (making them read only). But i want the utility tool that will make my Usb read only not my PC ports so if i plug it to the infected Pc
 then it wont harm my usb data

            What really should do is ensure you are running the latest Windows 10 version and have features such as Controlled Folder Access in Windows Defender enabled. 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it on
<br />
<br />That should greatly minimize the impact of things like malicious code from infecting or maliciously modifying files. 
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do is look into using is a feature that prevents USB thumb drives from utilizing Autoplay to write data to the drive. I believe its only in Pro, its called secpol.msc 
<br />

<br />Setting External drive to Read Only using Security permissions would only work on the PC it's set for:  <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-1627149/set-external-usb-hdd-read.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-1627149/se...</a>
<br />
<br />Since you want the volume to be Read only on any other PC it's attached, then you need to assign the Read Only flag using Diskpart to the external volume:  <a href="http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/answer/Yes-you-can-make-a-Windows-disk-partition-read-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/a...</a>.  You can do this by determining the volume in Diskpart to run the command, or use the script the author provides.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Did you read the article all the way through?
<br />"At your place, you formatted the Flash Drive and added some files to it. Then for some reason, you have to plug it into someone else’s computer. If that computer is infected, the malware would detect the new drive and replicate to it. It means that in addition to whatever you were doing on the different computer, a “write operation” is also being performed where the malware is replicating. If you stop this “write operation”, the virus cannot copy itself to the USB Flash drive. Thus, when you make USB Drives read only, you are literally stopping any unwanted “write operation” to that drive."
<br />"When you install Phrozensoft Safe USB, it sits in your system tray. You can right click it and make your USB drives read-only"

<p>The link you posted, it contains the information to block access of my Usb on just my PC, i done the steps and i wasn't able to formate it or write anything to it, but when i connected to the other pc, i was able to formate and write on it. This didn't helped
 me with my problem. I want to block the access of the hardisk on the other pc so that the other person cannot change my files in the hardisk.</p>

            yeah but it will keep my Pc secure as it will make my ports read only. But i want to make the hardisk readonly so that if i connect it to the other pc then the other user can't change anything in it or format it. I need help to make the hardisk just readable
 so that when i connect the hardisk to the other pc then no one can change data in it.

            As i mentioned earlier that i am a computer shop owner and i have to install the softwares and stuff in other computers, so i had to connect my external hardisk into their computers. But they can't do anything to my hardisk as i dont give them, but the
 thing is, the virus in their computers infect the files in my hardisk, if my hardisk is write protected or just read only then it wont infect my hardisk. i will just install the softwares and thats it. the virus in their pc wont effect my hardisk. Thats why
 i need to know if there is possible to make my hardisk readonly to every other pc that i connect it with.&nbsp;

    <title>Bring back &#34;Snap an App&#34; from 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctorgames101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring back &#34;Snap an App&#34; from 2016</h2>
                    Microsoft Xbox Support should bring back the 2016 and earlier feature on the Xbox One call "Snap an app." This is where you can watch Youtube and play video games at the same time or watch TV(like WWE wrestling) and play games at the same time on the same
 screen. Youtube/TV will be on the smaller screen while you play video games on the bigger screen on the TV. This works perfectly of having xbox ones with this feature in living rooms with no computer. Thank you.

<p>They have moved away from the snap feature on the console, and have made many changes with background apps and other features.&nbsp; It was a pretty cool feature, but if you'd like to see that option come back, your best bet would be to provide feedback at the

<p>
</p><p>That way, others that also want to see that idea can support it, and let the developers know that it's a popular feature they would like to see back.</p>

            A picture-in-picture feature would be pretty nice to see added, but they removed the snap feature as it wasn't used much and they didn't want to devote development resources to something that wasn't used and would free up system resources for game developers.

            Was a good app but its never coming back. It was used by the minority of users and was taking up resources on the console that could have been used better. That is why it was removed to make the console better&nbsp;
