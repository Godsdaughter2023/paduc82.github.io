<h2>            Windows 10 Lost and corrupted games</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Win 10 my Zuma's Revenge and Zuma Deluxe have problems.</p>
<p>Zuma's Revenge will play but it has a "zoomed in" look so I am unable to really play the game, exit,</p>
<p>or move about in the program.&nbsp; How do I back off - make content smaller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zuma Deluxe has both above issue and some other problem but since I can't move about in the program</p>
<p>or control anything, I can't describe the problem.&nbsp; At one point it seemed say something about an Xbox.</p>
<p>I don't have one, don't want one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I miss all those quick and easy to use Win 7 games.&nbsp; All the MS community suggestions were either too</p>
<p>complicated or required me to download from an unfamiliar (and therefore risky) site.&nbsp; And even that</p>
<p>was really simple.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Code 43 implies that Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>Hello, greetings, and all that good stuff;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have a few CDs from way back in the Windows 95-98 era that I'd like to run in Windows 10. I am given to believe that they would be incompatible.
<br />
&nbsp;How does one make them compatible? Is there a software patch of some kind to amend Windows 10 with?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks a bundle and keep me posted. </p>

            <p>Hi Tomasz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you tried running these discs with Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>3. What does the CDs contain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a game or a program that you are trying to run from the CDs, you can try running them in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Right click on the game/program icon in the menu, and select "Open File Location"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the folder and show the games/program with&nbsp;.exe highlighted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then try compatibility mode on it, or right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>
<p />

            <p>I have tried all the measures you advised before posting this question and conclude that a patch or an amendment to the Windows compatibility configuration is required.
<br />
&nbsp;When I attempted to troubleshoot and affix a version of Windows to operate the discs under the most antique version available was XP(Service Pack 3).
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I hope the people at Microsoft are able to read this thread so as a to be able to provide, possibly, a universal service pack of some kind.

<p>

            <p>There is no such thing as a "universal service pack".&nbsp; A lot of things have changed in the last 20 years, and there is no way that Microsoft can keep ever program that ever was created to keep working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One big stop might be that you might be running Windows 10 64-bit (note there is a Windows 10 32-bit version too, but it will be limited to 4 GB of memory).&nbsp; A 64-bit operating system can run 32-bit programs and 64-bit programs.&nbsp; A 32-bit version can run
 32-bit and 16 bit programs.&nbsp; Windows 95 was a 32-bit operating system, and it is entirely possible the program you want to run is a 16-bit program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just have to run these old programs, your best bet would be to use some virtual machine software to run say Windows XP, which should be able to run that Windows 95 program.</p>

<p>My console has three red lights</p>
<p>Okay, your console is showing three red lights, but don’t worry! We’ll work through this together. The first thing to check is the light on the power supply unit (the brick that plugs into your wall or power strip). What color do you see?</p>
<p>The light on my power supply unit is green.</p>
<p>If the light on your power supply unit is green and your console is showing three red lights, then your console will need to be repaired. You can check your warranty status and set up a repair using our Online Service Center.</p>
<p>The light on my power supply unit is orange.</p>
<p>Check your power supply cables</p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug the power supply from your console and remove the power cord from the outlet and the other end of the power supply. Reattach the cables, making sure everything is plugged in nice and snug. Also, make sure you’re plugged directly
 into the wall, and not into a surge protector. Turn your console back on. If the light on the power supply is still orange, continue to the next step.</p>
<p>Try a different outlet</p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug your power supply from the console and the wall outlet, and then take the power supply and console into another room. Don’t worry about the video cables for now.
</p>
<p>Plug the power supply into an outlet in the room, and then plug the power supply into the console. When you’ve made sure everything is nice and snug, turn on the console. (The console will flash four red lights, but that’s because the video cable isn’t attached,
 so don’t worry.) </p>
<p>What color is the light on the power supply now? Is it green? If so, then the issue is with wall outlet, and not the power supply or console (be sure not to plug into that outlet until the outlet has been repaired, or until the power strip on the outlet

<p>If the light on the power supply is still orange, the power supply will need to be replaced.</p>
<p>The light on my power supply unit is red.</p>
<p>Check your power supply cables </p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug the power supply from your console, and remove the power cord from the outlet and the other end of the power supply. Reattach the cables, making sure everything is plugged in nice and snug. Also, be sure you’re plugging directly
 into the wall, and not into a surge protector. Turn your console back on. If the light on the power supply is still red, continue to the next step.</p>
<p>Try a different outlet</p>

<p>Let your power supply cool down</p>
<p>Turn off your Xbox 360 console. Unplug the power supply from its outlet and from the console, and let the supply cool down for one hour. Once cooled, reattach the cable to the console and outlet, make sure everything is nice and snug, and turn the console

<p>My power supply is showing no light at all.</p>
<p>Check your power supply cables </p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug the power supply from your console, then remove the power cord from the outlet and the other end of the power supply. Reattach the cables, making sure everything is plugged in good and snug. Also, be sure you’re plugging directly
 into an outlet, and not into a surge protector. Turn your console back on. If the light on the power supply is still orange, continue to the next step.</p>
<p>Try a different outlet</p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug your power supply from the console and the wall outlet, and then take the power supply and console into another room. Don’t worry about the video cables—they’re not important right now.

<p>
</p><p>These two images were taken at the same time. &nbsp;As you can see the ram usage is just incredibly stupid and seems so be tied to some invisibly background process that the task manager cant see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what could cause this or how to mitigate it?<br />
<br />
I thought it might be due to an inordinately large fire transfer i was running or a large export on a video project. (the first two times this happened) but the third time I wasn't doing anything more than surfing the net and chatting on skype.</p>

<p>Hello Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>winver</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK.</strong></em></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you check the running background processes or programs on Task Manager that may possible cause the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, let's troubleshoot the issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows built-in troubleshooter</strong></p>

<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. On the left pane, click <strong><span><em>View all</em></span></strong><em>.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. In the list of options, click on <em><strong>System Maintenance.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Click on <em><strong><span>Next</span></strong></em> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run the System File Checker tool</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Click on <em><strong>Start</strong></em>, type in <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em>, right-click on it and se</span></span><span><span>lect
<em><strong>Run as administrator.</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Enter the command below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em></span></span><span><span>(note the space between "sfc" and "/").</span></span></p>

            Ultimately I got it back to normal by running a system restore.<br />
<br />
Just as a question is it possible to see the ram usage of windows background services? &nbsp;Task manager doesn't seem to count them and I seem to remember seeing it in windows 7

<h2>            Where can I safely access Windows XP SP3 driver updates&#63;</h2>
                    I have a home made Gameing PC with Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed as the Operating System.
<div>I have two persistent problems and wonder that they might be linked. Firstly, I very frequently get the BSOD 0x0000008E, though with differing bracketed sub numbers. These can occur randomly, and on several occasions when the PC was doing nothing! I also
 get another BSOD, though only when in a Game, that is just a blue screen, no info, but can only be escaped by turning off the PC!</div>
<div>Secondly, every time I start the PC now, I get a 'New Hardware' prompt and small window offering to search for software needed for Net. When I choose the search option (via the web) it always comes up blank, suggesting that if I have a CD with the software
 on it, to use that. However, as I have no idea which software may be required, I don't know if any of the CD's that came with the PC will help.</div>
<div>When I have researched the BSOD's, it's often suggested that drivers may be at fault, so this makes me think the two problems may be linked. I have checked that 'Auto Update' is enabled, so you'd think that if a more recent driver version was required,
 it would happen automatically.</div>
<div>On the Gameing side of things, I have Nvidia GeForce installed, which automatically tells me if I need a GPU driver update, supplying me with the relevant download. I have also checked manually and I am currently up to date on that front.</div>
<div>Which leaves me with the title question. I often get pop up windows on You Tube vids, offering me XP driver updates, and have seen Ad links on forum sites offering the same. However, despite having very good anti virus software installed, I make it a point
 of never clicking on Ad prompts, or indeed any other form of unsolicited advice/help.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, if you good people of the Microsoft Community could advise me as to where I may safely access either a scan tool to ascertain which, if any, drivers may need updating, or perhaps a generic drivers download that would cover all eventualities, I would
 be extremely grateful.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I should further add that as the prime function of this PC is Gameing, it has no printer or other such more common hardware attachments. The only things I have attached to it are, mouse, monitor, keyboard, speakers, and two remote Hard Drives, all of which
 are recognised by the PC, and are working well as far as I can tell.</div>
<div>Thank you for your attention, and hopefully your assistance.</div>

Phil, <br />
<br />
Check in the BIOS to see whether your system has lost time and date. This would indicate that the battery needs to be replaced.
<br />
<br />
Usually, when that happens the BIOS reloads defaults. If one of those is something you would have disabled like onboard sound for example if you installed your own sound card, then Windows will find the onboard sound when the machine boots up.
<br />
<br />
Check the BIOS anyway for something similar even if time and date hasn't been lost.
<br />
<br />
Also, the NVIDIA drivers may not be WHQL-certified. This can cause system instability. To check whether there are any non-WHQL drivers installed, do the following.
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt, type <b>CD\</b> abd hit Enter to take you to the root.</li><li>Next, type: <b>sfc /scannow</b> and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p>When you run that command, the operating system may request the Windows installation CD so have that ready to hand.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If System File Checker finds a corrupt protected system file which it can't retrieve from the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\dllcache repository, it will extract it from the Windows CD. This may take place a number of times. The process isn't automatic and you'll need
 to click the "Retry" button each time. The last time I ran it, it took over an hour to complete.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can hit Enter instead of clicking the Retry button with the mouse, but if you accidentally hit Enter after the "Retry" button disappears, the "Cancel" button which is enabled by default may cancel the operation without prompting you first so do bear
 that in mind. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If SFC finds non-WHQL graphics drivers, it replaces them with the standard VGA drivers. This means that when you reboot, or shutdown and then power on again sometime later, the screen resolution will revert to 800x600.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To address that issue, you'll need to uninstall and then reinstall the NVIDIA drivers.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The current WHQL-certified drivers for most graphics cards running on Windows XP is version 327.23</p>
<p><br />
</p>

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315335/en-gb</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know about the blank one though. You could check in Event Viewer | System menu for clues.

            Thanks J, but I'm pretty sure it's not a temperature problem. My PC's liquid cooled and the cooling control panel has only ever read a maximum of 34 degrees C. While I appreciate that the coolant system readout is a relatively crude measurement of actual
 cores specific temp., given that the general guidelines for my Intel dual cores is 60-75, I think I can be pretty sure I'm not stressing it.

            Thanks Xircal.
<div>You are probably right about the Nvidia driver not being WHQL, but that was always true on my old PC, which was Windows 7, and I never saw so much as a glimpse of a BSOD.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm not happy with XP anyway and intend to upgrade shortly to W7, which I was very happy with, and as one of the links you provided states that XP will soon be unsupported, it makes sense to modernise.</div>
<div>I'm also toying with the thought of replacing my internal Hard Drive at the same time because some of the major Game providers insist on installing their games on the main drive, despite seemingly offering a choice option! So, I could upgrade to a significantly
 larger Main Drive in order to keep a healthier portion of it free. Also, my current Main Drive occasionally makes a noise that sounds like it's struggling, so I suspect it may be safer to renew it. However, if I can find the necessary down time, I will have
 a go at your advice. Thanks again.</div>

Ok...it was just a thought because I've seen it so many times.<br />
I have to blow the dust out of my computer about twice a year <br />
to prevent overheating.<br />

<p>Recently I got a cyber power desktop and every time I started it I would see the Windows logo and the loading circle. It would then just cut out to a black screen. I have recently tried to go back again. It sometimes would say it has no recovery. I could
 either try again or try advanced options. I hit reset my info and it rebooted. Then it says installing Windows. After a while it just goes black again. Anyone help? I checked to make sure all cables are in the right spot in the computer.</p>
<p>One cord I'm not so sure but I have no knowledge as this is my first computer</p>

            I somehow got it up and running. When I restart from now on it shows the motherboard info but then it just starts and works again. It must've just been a bug. My system is working fine now. Thank you for the info!

<p>It is part of the Microsoft Indexing Service.</p>
<p>Here are some copy/paste words about it:</p>
<p><span><em>This process builds and updates the Index catalog and typically uses a lot of CPU time. However, cidaemon .exe is also set to run at a low priority, so it usually doesn't degrade the performance of the system even if it's at a high CPU level.</em></span></p>
<p>It is true that t runs at a "Below Normal" priority when viewed in Task Manager, but since most people seem to want their systems to run faster, I will usually disable it in the Services Applet and consider it an annoying&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;running background service
 (one of many). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm always trying to speed things up, &nbsp;not slow things down!</p>
<p>Some Google searches will tell you more about how it works.</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp;tells you a little about it and one method to disable it here:</p>

    <title>Problems installing &#38; playing Civilization IV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blacksheep1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems installing &#38; playing Civilization IV</h2>
                    I recently bought Civilization IV for my Windows Vista. After installing it, I clicked the "play" button, I received an error message regarding my DirectX version, and the message reads verbatim "This application has failed to start because D3DX9_32.DLL
 was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem," (Re-installing doesn't actually fix anything). The game itself requires DirectX9.0c to play, which is included with the game. I have the required version of DirectX necessary to play the game,
 however it still does not play. <br />
<br />
I called the game manufacturer's tech line three times in search of answers. They, among other things, had me download the March 2009 DirectX 9 Redist, practically every form of DirectX 9, and a new driver, yet I receive the same error message when I re-install
 the game. <br />
<br />
I called Dell, my computer's manufacturer, and they couldn't give me any solid answers either, other than that installing a new driver probably wasn't essential. Dell couldn't help me.
<br />
<br />
Please, help would be intensely appreciated. Installing this game (which used to run fine on my XP four years ago) has proven to be an insanely frustrating process. If any other information about my PC is necessary, just ask and it shall be supplied. Thanks
 again.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Blacksheep1,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I checked if the game is compatible with vista, looks like it is.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ref:
</span><span><a href="http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/support_msr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/support_msr.htm</a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>D3dx9_32.dll errors typically appear when a software program, usually a game, is started. Occasionally, d3dx9_32.dll
 errors will display after a game is loaded but right before game play begins.<br />
<br />
</span><span>This application has failed to start because d3dx9_32.dll was not found.</span></span><span><span>
<br />
</span></span><span><br />
<span>These are all optional components to DirectX that may not be installed with the version of DirectX you already have on your system.
<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span>The d3dx9_32.dll file is one of many files contained in the DirectX software collection. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows based games and
 advanced graphics programs, d3dx9_32.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.</span></span><span><br />
<br />
<span>Usually these will be installed when the game installs DirectX, however these optional components will be provided in the directX SDK, and as such may not be installed with the version of DirectX present on your system.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to fix this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>Restart your computer if you haven't yet done so.<br />
</span><strong><em><span>It's unlikely this will fix the problem, but restarting is always a good first troubleshooting step.</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>Click here to install the
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=24a541d6-0486-4453-8641-1eee9e21b282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>latest version of DirectX SDK</span></a><span>. Chances are, upgrading
 to the latest version of DirectX 9 will fix the d3dx9_32.dll not found error.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>If latest DirectX SDK doesn't fix the d3dx9_32.dll error, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or
 DVD. Usually, the software developers will include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc and is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>You can also try to restore the file “d3dx9_32.dll “ by extracting the DirectX files to a separate folder.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>Copy the DLL file to the system32 folder located in your Windows installation folder. On most computers, that will be
<em>C:\Windows\System32</em>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>Restart your computer.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks, just on the spur of the moment before trying those ideas I tried something so simple based on my original post and the error report at the end. I simply took the driver stusb2ir.sys file from system32\drivers and copied it into
<br />
"C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\stus2x64.inf_amd64_ca896a7a5ddcf390</p>
<p>
</p><p>reran the driver update and it flipping worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presumably then MS? removed it or updated that repository folder without it. </p>
<p>I guess thanks to sysinternals for writing ProcMon.exe (since the Windows message didn't say what file was missing from where) plus Mayank for his suggestions too :-)</p>

    <title>Xbox One streaming to Windows 10 has no video - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim20111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One streaming to Windows 10 has no video</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 on my PC.&nbsp; One of the first things I wanted to play with was the streaming function with my Xbox One.&nbsp; I made sure the Xbox preferences were set to allow streaming.&nbsp; Launched the Xbox App in Windows 10, logged in and it&nbsp;found
 my Xbox and connected.&nbsp; I ran the streaming test which gave me green checks for all qualities.&nbsp; Then I selected stream, a blue window screen comes up briefly saying connecting to Xbox, then it says connected and reverts back to the previous screen, but it
 is slightly greyed out view of what the PC was already showing with a header at the top.&nbsp; The header goes away if I don't move my mouse or appears when I do.&nbsp; It has the unmute microphone, video setting, and stop streaming options.&nbsp; I can hear the Xbox One
 sounds when use the left/right arrows on the controller (both the one connected to the PC and the one connected to the xbox).&nbsp; However I don't get any video stream from the Xbox.&nbsp; I adjusted the video all the way down and all the way up with no difference.&nbsp;
 Both devices are hardwired via 1gb Ethernet.</p>
<p>My PC&nbsp;video card is an AMD Radeon 5450 with VGA, DVI, &amp; HDMI out.&nbsp; I am using the HDMI with 1920x1080 resolution.</p>
<p>Please provide some suggestions of things to try.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Try power cycling your console by holding the power button for 10 seconds or until the console turns off, then reboot your PC, turn your console back on, open the Xbox App, remove the Xbox Console from the list, then click the Add a Device option again
 and re-add the Xbox One. Try streaming again and see if that works.</p>
