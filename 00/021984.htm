<h2>            Lumia 930 &#40;Denim&#41; WiFi 5G problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've received the Denim update for my Lumia 930 a few days ago, after that the wifi started acting weird, so i've tried to figure out what's going on. The problem is on first connect it works fine, but after wakeup from standby the connection is still alive,
 but nothing works. What i have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have zyxel dual band router, initially configured the same SSID on both bands (2.4 and 5GHz). For testing i've changed it to different names, to test them independently. The result is, that on the 2.4GHz band it works perfectly, even after wakeup, but
 in the 5GHz band it's connecting to the AP successfully, but after that nothing loads from network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 5GHz AP is fine, 2 other devices using it without any problem. This problem occured the next morning i've installed Lumia Denim fw, before that it worked as it should.So far i've tried to restart the router and delete the wifi settings from the device
 then gave it a soft reset. Same as before, connected but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea or suggestion or?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS version: 8.10.144226.359</p>
<p>Fw version: 02540.00019.14522.26003</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Had the same problem, but found another factor:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only a hard reset WITHOUT restore was required to get 5GHZ WLAN stable.</p>
<p>I also had to reduce the channel bandwidth from 40/20 down to 20. Two other Lumia 925 connected to the same WLAN did not have the problem, so it's probably a bug with 930 on Denim.</p>
<p>(Vigor 2120 router, quality ware).</p>

<h2>            Received triplicate emails in Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Triplicate emails recieved</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am receiving triplicate emails.</p>
<p>On a semi regular schedule I receive (three emails all 1 or 2 minutes apart) every 1, 2 or 3 hour intervals.</p>
<p>The every email is exactly the same.&nbsp; Additionally this email is an email I sent to myself initially.&nbsp; When I check my sent folder it shows all of these emails as being sent from me.&nbsp; essentially from me to me on the same account.&nbsp; When I first created this
 email I was logged in to the Outlook.com site using IE10 browser.&nbsp; I am not receiving any other emails in triplicate.&nbsp; Only the one email from me to me about a week ago.&nbsp; My inbox is now filed with about 100 duplicate emails sent from my outbox to my inbox.&nbsp;
 This occurs when I am both logged in and out of the account.&nbsp; I even shut the laptop down over night to see it still occurred, and it did.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help please.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync to Exchange when connected to network</h2>
                    
<p>I can't sync to exchange when connected to the network through my PC. I can sync wirelessly OK but when my PDA is in the cradle it won't sync with exchange and gives me an internet_31 error. I think this may be a
 certificate problem but have no idea how to check it out. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I insert a Pie Chart &#40;or any kind&#41; into an Excel Worksheet that is a template&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First of all, thanks for your patience. I am learning to make Excel Worksheets and have had no problems, inserting Pie or Column Charts (or charts of any kind).</p>
<p>However, I decided to take a shortcut tonight, as I'm pressed for time, and instead of making my Worksheet from scratch, I chose a template from Microsoft's Library, called<u><strong> "Event Budget",</strong></u>&nbsp; which made life much simpler for me. However.....when
 I went to 'insert, etc' ., to insert a Pie chart ?&nbsp; I received a message that stated:&nbsp; "<strong><u>Some type charts cannot be combined with other chart types. Select a different chart type</u></strong>". And so I did ! I went thru every single chart and keep
 getting the same message. Please help. I have to hand this work in tomorrow, &nbsp;or&nbsp;I will fail the class. Thanks again ! Elena</p>

            <p>It sounds like you had another chart activated when you did Insert &gt; Chart.</p>
<p>The message you got ("Some type charts cannot be combined with other chart types. Select a different chart type") is shown when you try to combine incompatible chart types within one chart.</p>
<p>Try selecting your data that you want to plot, then do Insert &gt; Chart.</p>
<p>Does that fix it?</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

    <title>No dialog box opens in Microsoft Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No dialog box opens in Microsoft Word 2007</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got the creator's update for Windows 10. Word worked properly for some time. From today, no dialog boxes are opening in Word 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More elaborately, when I click on 'Save' or go for Save As, no dialog box opens for the Explorer so that I can choose the location and save it. Also, when I am closing Word, the obvious dialog box appears - 'Do you want to save the changes to the document?'
 But even when I select Yes, no dialog box opens. The same&nbsp;'Do you want to save the changes to the document?' appears again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, I can't insert any Picture as for that as well, the File Explorer has to open. An important note, this is happening in all the Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking help from other replies in this forum, I tried to search for any plugins causing the problem. But there were no entries in the COM add-ins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One important thing - I use Avro Keyboard for Bengali typing. It is a separate program with a keyboard. Today, I got an error from Microsoft Visual Basic when I opened Word, that Avro Keyboard isn't working. I had to end the Avro Keyboard program process
 from that error box itself. My problem started from then on. I checked the add-ins list and found Avro there. So I deleted the plugin. But still the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joesatch,</p>
<p>I would explain that, in Office 365 for business plan, once we deleted an Active User at the admin center, the assigned licence would be released automatically.</p>
<p>We do not need to manually remove the license from the user.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<p>Hi Joesatch,</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, in Office 365 for business plan, the deleted user is not licensed, as the licenses have already been released when we delete the user.</p>
<p>The designed cmdlet we use for removing licenses would only apply to active users instead of&nbsp;the user whose license has been released.</p>
<p>However, since, due to the design, Office 365 would re-assign&nbsp;the released&nbsp;licenses to the user who we deteled but try restoring, we are able to restore the user first, then remove the licenses and delete the user again, which is doable by PowerShell cmdlets.</p>
<p>After you connect to msolservice, run the following cmdlets:</p>
<p>Restore-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em><br />
Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> -RemoveLicenses
<em>"organization:ENTERPRISEPACK"</em><br />
Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName <em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> -Force</p>
<p>You may run the below cmdlet first to see which licenses are assigned to the user before being deleted:</p>
<p>Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName<em> *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em> -ReturnDeletedUsers | Select UserPrincipalName,Licenses</p>
<p>In addition, if you intend to reduce the license from your Office 365 subscription after the user is deleted, PowShell is not what we use in this case. Please find the information at
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-licenses-from-your-Office-365-for-business-subscription-9c64d127-e2dd-4ecc-81f5-2f87e5a74803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Not sure the Restore-User command will work as the Accounts are managed from on-premise AD. The AD account has been deleted and we will not restore it. I want to remove a license for a deleted User. If there is no such command than that is the answer. It
 is still unclear to me whether it can be done or not. </p>

    <title>Mail Merge using ODBC data source - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrknowles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge using ODBC data source</h2>
                    <p>I want to do a mail merge using data accessed using odbc. When I select my source, I see a list of the tables in my database that looks like this:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9bdf3af-a3ef-45fc-b840-2168dcd6d014" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I pick the JCCost table, I can use all the fields from that table. However, I also need to use&nbsp;a "Vendor Name" field which is not stored in the JCCost table, but in a related table. The VendorID field in the JCCost table ties to a record in the APVendor
 table. Is there any way I can read related tables from within the Mail Merge function without having to create some kind of a View in the data itself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>You do not say what the original source of the data is, but if it was Access, you need to create a Select Query that links the two tables o the VendorID field and includes in its output the desired fields from each of the tables.&nbsp; You would then use that
 Query as the data source for your mailmerge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing that, you could export both of the tables to Excel and use a lookup function to include the Vendor Name field along with the data from the JCCost table.</p>

            AFIK, there is no official MS "Excel 2010 Home and Student" version. Please provide a link.<br />
<br />
There is "Office 2010 Home and Student" which includes Excel for at a guess around the price you mention (doing a rough pounds to dollars conversion in my head), and a simple stand alone version of Excel, again for around the price you mention.<br />
<br />
OOPS, I humbly abase myself and eat my words. I found the MS online store and it does include both versions:<br />
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/list/parentCategoryID.37286600/categoryID.50726400<br />
Make sure to confirm you are pointed to the right country to get the right prices<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the partial name "home and Student" I would say this copy is cheaper because it is intended for non-commercial, aka "Home" use ONLY. So they discounted the price slightly. Or in other words, they are charging an extra USD$20 for the license rights
 to use standalone Excel in a business setting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is another link to an Office MS online site which does not have a standalone Home and Student (go figure):<br />
http://www7.buyoffice.microsoft.com/emea1/default.aspx?cache=163877802<br />
<br />
Here is their Excel page, price 120 pounds:<br />
http://www7.buyoffice.microsoft.com/emea1/product.aspx?sku=10234376&amp;cache=163877802&amp;action=buy&amp;culture=en-GB<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure the right country is selected to reflect the local prices<br />
<br />
<br />
 on ONE computer. PERIOD.&nbsp; When the hardware dies, (even the same day you install it!) so does the license!&nbsp; The retail license, for slightly more allows installs on 2 or 3 computers at the same time AND it allows you to transfer installations to new computers.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As a further refinement, buying the "Retail Boxed CD" edition is a better deal because you usually pay exactly the same price for the retail online download without the installation disk. You have to pay roughly an extra USD$25 to buy the "backup' disk. Save
 your money and buy the boxed retail version right away.&nbsp;&nbsp; You want the installation disk because in to very many years you will no longer be able to download the 2010 installation files from MS. There have been a couple of reports of problems getting 2007
 downloads. Many people have been asking for 2003, 2002 even 97 installation files. All of which are hard to get.<br />

 me a problem has caused the program to stop working windows will close the program.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3c994265-d00a-40a7-a2ee-65ce9eb27bcd" title="Konrad Aleskret">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>Is there any F* chance to recover my old friends from facebook's skype?
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer</strong>: Unfortunately, transferring of contacts from <em>Skype accounts created using Facebook log ins
</em>is&nbsp;no longer available as of <strong>January 10, 2018. </strong>This is aligned to the deprecation of all Facebook sign in wherein all Skype logins have been streamlined to Microsoft accounts, allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in, unlocking all
 your Microsoft services – including Skype, Office Online, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, and more – in one experience, with just one password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the scenario, if you failed to transfer the contacts before the date provided, I am afraid we cannot transfer them anymore. As a workaround, you can manually re-add those contacts to your new or other Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps!</p>
<p>

</p><p>It is included in the&nbsp;office 2011 for Mac. I want to make sure for the 2016 before I buy it.</p>

            <p>It should be. Just recently we've fielded a question from someone in Poland who couldn't access the East Asian Languages Control Panel that gives you access to Japanese proofing tools, but we're not sure yet whether Canada is affected by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can download a <a href="https://products.office.com/en-ca/try" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
30-day free trial of Office 365</a>, which will install Office 2016 for Mac on your computer, so you can test. Your Office 2011 is unaffected by this, you can use both versions on the same computer, except for Outlook. Don't use Outlook 2016 until you are satisfied
 with the results, it will do a one-way import of your address book.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Scammer - Remote Access to my Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t1r027  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Scammer - Remote Access to my Computer</h2>
                    <p>My dad was using my computer when he clicked a link, which caused a red screen to pop up with a phone number to call Microsoft, threatening saying your computer has been infected by a virus, etc.&nbsp; Typical scam.&nbsp; Well my dad actually did call and gave them
 remote access to install files onto my computer.&nbsp; Obviously, it was for a fee which we already took care of with the credit card company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have two questions:</p>
<p>1. I did a factory reset of my computer, but after reading, it seems like there could be a chance that hidden files that "may" have been installed in the background could still linger.&nbsp; Should I take it to Geek Squad to wipe out my hard drive?&nbsp; Or should
 I try and format my hard drive and reinstall everything?&nbsp; If so, how would I go about doing that?&nbsp; Or am I safe by just doing a factory reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My computer and my laptop share the same Microsoft username.&nbsp; I know they are linked but not entirely linked (such as the backgrounds will change together, but downloaded files don't appear on both the computer and laptop.&nbsp; Since the scammers got onto
 my computer, could my laptop be affected too?&nbsp; My laptop was not on when they had remote access to my computer, but it shares the same wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you!</p>

<br />
<br />You should format your hard drive, but first you must backup your files. Check these links, I hope it helps.

            Hi T1R027
<br />
<br />This is very common these days, these scammers are not technically proficient and rely upon an innocent user to give them remote access
<br />
<br />If you have Reset Windows 10, you have done the right thing, you have nothing to worry about and no need to clean install Windows
<br />
<br />These Tech support scammers typically add software to remote to the PC, they then deliberately corrupt Windows in order to scam money from the user. 
<br />
<br />Once you have Reset Windows, anything they have done to that PC will be removed, there is no need to re-format and re-install

    <title>When closing a workbook sometimes the VBIDE&#39;s Project Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjasmith4  say:</h3>
<h2>            When closing a workbook sometimes the VBIDE&#39;s Project Explorer still shows its project&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet with VBA, and the running code opens several files -- spreadsheets and text files -- and closes them, each time specifying
<strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong> after the <strong>Workbooks(<em>whatever</em>).Close</strong> to avoid any prompting of the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after the code finishes running, whereupon only the spreadsheet with the VBA is open, the VBIDE's Project Explorer shows a whole bunch of projects that correspond to the CLOSED files!&nbsp; In fact, if a certain file is opened and closed twice, the Project
 Explorer shows TWO entries for it.&nbsp; None of them are add-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And thereafter, if I switch back to the UI and simply do <strong>Ctrl-N</strong> to create a new file and then
<strong>Ctrl-W</strong> to close it, that new file's project is there in the Project Explorer.&nbsp; I can do those keystrokes repeatedly, and the Project Explorer window will simply fill up with projects!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going on here?&nbsp; And in general, when will Microsoft ever make any improvements to the at-least-15-year-old VBIDE?</p>

            <p>I added this to that thread.&nbsp; The bottom line is, it's still a problem that dear old Microsoft hasn't addressed, since they haven't bothered to change the VBIDE in over ten years!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yep, here it is late 2013, and I've gotten this all the time, as in DAILY,&nbsp;for years, with Excel 2003, 2007 and 2010 (haven't tried Word, Access, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real solution I've found is to ream out your TEMP folder, and there's a great utility, WAY better than Disk Cleanup, which does just that.&nbsp; And Dell recommends it!&nbsp; It's call ATF-Cleaner -- as in All Temp Files -- and it's at
<a href="http://www.atribune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.atribune.org/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close Excel, run ATF-Cleaner -- with admin privileges if possible -- and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, FYI there's Rob Bovey's Code Cleaner at <a href="http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/CodeCleaner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/CodeCleaner.htm</a>, a utility that removes all code objects and replaces them, sort of like compacting an Access database.&nbsp; It makes workbooks with macros not only smaller but more reliable; I use it every day.</p>

<h3> barry_s2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft assigns &#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42; address in place of custom domain from input address</h2>
                    <p>I am the domain administrator for a domain.&nbsp; Mail is hosted at outlook.com under the 'premium' domain program.<br />
<br />
A user uses Microsoft Outlook 365 on his Windows PC. It was setup multiple times via the standard account setup wizard. (Assume Exchange/Active Sync) At the ONLY opportunity to enter an e-mail address, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was inserted. The installation wizard
 took over from there.<br />
<br />
When that user goes to Outlook.Comm Connected Accounts in the web GUI, the default FROM account is set correctly.<br />
<br />
Outlook does not provide a mechanism within the software to ignore the Microsoft assigned *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address. I have no additional controls like I would have under POP/IMAP.&nbsp; Microsoft controls all configuration parameters.&nbsp; Unless
 manually selected during a message composition, the default FROM addresss is the outlook_ address.<br />
<br />
How do I make the custom e-mail address the only from address?&nbsp; (Hide the outlook_ address)<br />

<p>To be pedantic, there is no "Outlook 365". You are referring to Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Outlook.com Premium address as well and when I select the premium domain address as sender, it comes through correctly. How did you set up the account in Outlook 2016? What credentials (the regular @outlook.com address or the Premium address) do
 you use to log in?</p>

<p>I am unclear on Microsoft naming nomenclature.&nbsp; I do not use any version of the Office suite. &nbsp; I am merely the domain administrator for the domain in question.&nbsp; POP and IMAP work fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the accounts were setup I verified that the connected account on outlook.com were set to the correct custom domain.&nbsp; The accounts were setup automatically in Outlook.&nbsp; The user@customdomain entered their correct user and password, and Outlook took it
 from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been reading online and it sounds like the mailbox must be configured manually as an Advanced Setup with Exchange/Activesync and the server set to m.hotmail.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not near the devices in question so I'll need to try to reset them when I can physically access them.&nbsp; I expect to have to re-install the accounts and want to pull the NK2 files before I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice as to how to setup a custom domain in Outlook 2016/365, based at outlook.com, that does not result in the default outlook_@outlook as a possible return address?</p>

<p>You said, "<span>A user uses Microsoft Outlook 365 on his Windows PC." How is this not using "any version of the Office Suite"? Maybe you yourself don't use Outlook 2016, but the person for whom you're asking does. So, although
 I referred to "you" in my previous post, it should be easy enough for you to turn that into the proper reference to the other person.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your primary alias must be an @outlook.com address in order to avoid the outlook_xxxxx @outlook.com value. The article I cited tells you that. So, create one, then set our default From address to be the non-Microsoft
 address you're using. You also mention a connected account. That implies that you have an address on another service. So when you create the account in Outlook 2016, use that service's SMTP server for the outgoing server and you shouldn't have any issues at
 all. In other words, don't try sending through Outlook.com's server.</span></p>

<p>A user of the domain uses Outlook 2016/365 on his Windows PC.&nbsp; Again, I am merely the domain administrator.&nbsp; This user uses Exchange Activesync to sync his calendar and mail.&nbsp; He does not use SMTP or IMAP in order to keep his calendar sync'd across devices.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no "linked article that you cited " in your responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>That implies that you have an address on another service. "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Connected Accounts, the primary alias is selected to be the correct FROM custom domain address.&nbsp; I am not referring to the additional options to include outside mail sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service was setup in Outlook 2016 via whatever Wizard that took over when the custom e-mail and password were provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question remains:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you manually setup an e-mail with a custom domain that is hosted by outlook.com, utilizing Exchange Activesync, and specifically prevents the utilization of the outlook_ @outlook.com from appearing anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest answer I've been to come up with has been this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/outlookcompersonaladdress.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>under Adding an Outlook.com account to Outlook 2013</p>

<p>The underlying issue appears to be that a secondary outlook.com address was not defined for these users..&nbsp; This is apparently required so in the event that the custom domain went away, the @outlook.com address would remain accessible so the users could get
 their mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, should anyone else encounter this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create an @outlook.com alias address to go along with your custom domain.</p>
<p>2. Under connected accounts, make sure your custom domain is the default selection, not the aliased address.&nbsp; (the outlook_xxx address will disappear)</p>
<p>3. Re-install account in Outlook</p>

<h2>            Strange behavior Excel 2013 and 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple computers with these same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Professional SP1 64-bit</p>
<p>Some running Excel 2013 64-bit</p>
<p>Others running Excel 2016 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that this happens quite frequently:</p>
<p>When I have a file open and attempt to open a second file, the file will open but the Window doesn't "draw". So it's there but not visible. If I click what would be the minimize button, I can tell that something happens (it minimizes the "hidden" window)
 and then I go to the task bar and pop the window back up, it draws and I can work with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I copy a cell and then work my way down the sheet and paste it as I go, at some point Excel will stop responding. CPU usage will jump as high as 55%. If I wait long enough, it will start to respond again, but it will *not* have pasted into the last cell
 and the clipboard is emptied. If I copy a cell again and start the same process to continue, it will happen again but it will happen more quickly on subsequent attempts. So while I may get 5 or 10 done the first round, subsequent attempts will only get me
 2 or 3 before a hang.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a large workbook (say 20 columns and 100,000 rows) and I try to sort, it can take *forever* and appear to hang, but again if I am just patient and give it time, it will eventually become responsive again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point there was an update for Excel 2013 that appeared to improve these issues, but it never totally went away. However a subsequent update brought all of these issues back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing Excel versions (upgrading to 2016) but continue to see the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a machine with Excel 2010 32-bit that does not demonstrate these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

            <p>Prior to posting in the forums, I had tried to "repair" my office installation. this had no effect on my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue the tool found is that I have Hardware Acceleration turned off. I disabled that while troubleshooting my issue.

    <title>Easiest way to update a Bibliography&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Easiest way to update a Bibliography&#63;</h2>
                    I am using MS Word for Mac 2011. I am working with a complicated document that was in .doc format, was converted to a Google Doc format, and needs to be converted back into .docx format now. There are over 120 citations in the document and I don't want
 to have to enter each citation manually. I can copy &amp; paste the bibiliography to the end of the document, but the numbers do not link back to the original references, in the body of the text. Is there a way to backtrack/relink the 120+ entries in the bibliography
 back to their original references (the superscript numbers)?
<div><br />
Thank you!</div>
                </div>

            The bibliography at the end of the document is entirely "generated" text. &nbsp;The "actual" text that is placed into the bibliography is contained in the Reference Character in the body of the document.
<div><br />
<div>The Reference Character contains a link to text in your Sources file (on your computer) or in the document itself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We can hope that the Sources are still present on your computer (although if the document did not start out as a .docx, that's a bit of a large "hope). &nbsp;To find out:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, follow the instructions in the Word help topic "<b>Add or change sources, citations, and bibliographies",&nbsp;</b>Step 3-2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will either get a perfectly collated and numbered bibliography, or a prompt telling you that no Source was found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you get the latter, you will need to follow the rest of the instructions in the help topic to re-create the sources file. &nbsp;Given that you converted out to Google Docs, there is a risk that the references themselves have been stripped. &nbsp;If that's the
 case, then I am afraid you will also need to re-add all of the citations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>
