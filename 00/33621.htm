                    I have just received a call form someone stating that they are calling from Microsoft Legal team to tell me my computer is infected. I was told that I could turn on my computer and be talked through how to fix this problem. I refused to do this as I didn't
 trust the person who contacted me. He gave me his name - Calvin Martin - and contact tel no of Microsoft Legal Team - 020 881 9804 - and his ID - MSST872461. I have not contacted him and don't appear to have an infection on my computer. Has anyone been contacted
 by Microsoft in this way and for this reason before?

            <p>Hi epdon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>

<h2>            Bleached&#47;bland display with Windows</h2>
                    <p>**********Original Title********Why Does Windows Look Bleached / Bland?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new laptop with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be poor contrast on the color schemes.</p>
<p>For example, it's often hard to find the scroll bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I use Gmail, it's hard to scroll down my different tag folders (on the left) because everything is a bit whitewashed.</p>
<p>When I use Excel, the buttons on top are all kind of light or bleached and I've found it takes more time to select a specific button b/c of poor contrast between them.</p>
<p>I'm assuming this is a result of themes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get the theme from like Windows XP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The choices I've seen are either super over the top (like black / white contrast) or have to do with pictures.</p>
<p>I just need something that's a bit stronger....I mean what I see on regular desktops at work.</p>

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have an issue with Windows which looks bleach. This might be an issue with the incorrect or outdated display driver which is installed on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better I request you to provide the details below.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the laptop?</li><li><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I request you to uninstall the display drivers via device manager by following steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> and <strong>R </strong>key simultaneously and type in
<strong>“devmgmt.msc</strong>” without quotes in the run command box.</span></li><li><span>Find and double-click the category of device whose driver you wish to uninstall (for example, the graphics card would be listed under Display Adapters).</span></li><li><span>Right click the device, and click <strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></li><li><span>Windows will prompt you to confirm the device’s removal. Click <strong>
<span>OK</span></strong> to remove the driver.</span></li><li><span>After the uninstallation is complete, reboot your computer as soon as possible.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>And try installing the latest display drivers from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p>

            I'm not having problems signing into a website with my Microsoft Account. &nbsp;It's when any app or any part of Windows 10 needs me to sign in with my Microsoft Account. &nbsp;Like the Store for instance. &nbsp;I'm perfectly able to sign into websites with my Microsoft
 Account. &nbsp;I posted the original topic post from my Windows 10 partition. &nbsp;The issues described in &nbsp;my original post above started directly after I installed the Anniversary Update.

                    I'm having a Windows 7 problem that when I have a few open windows for different programs minimized on the taskbar and I try to maximize them again, they won't maximize.&nbsp; Sometimes they appear to maximize off the right side of the desktop, and sometimes
 they won't maximize at all.&nbsp; I have to close the program down and then re-open it.&nbsp; When it happens in Internet Explorer I can get it maximized again if I right click on the taskbar icon and select Open New Tab.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?

<p>To turn off Aero snap:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp; Type <strong>snap</strong> into the search box.<br />
3.&nbsp; When <strong>Turn off Automatic Window Arrangement</strong> comes up, click it.<br />
4.&nbsp; Check the&nbsp;<strong>[ ]</strong>&nbsp;next to <strong>Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm not confident that this will solve your problem, but keeping fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Can you be more specific about what you're trying to do, exactly?&nbsp; In re-reading your original post, I am wondering if you're not using the term "Maximized" as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, when a window is on screen, and doesn't cover the entire screen, that's considered a normal windowed view, sometimes called "Restored".&nbsp; Maximized", by contrast,&nbsp;is when the window covers the entire screen.</p>
<p>Are you saying a window&nbsp;<em><strong>Restores</strong> </em>off screen?&nbsp; If so, it may be that the coordinates of the window have been stored improperly (I've seen this happen before).&nbsp; There's a way to "get hold" of those windows, and move them back on-screen.&nbsp;
 To do so, try this:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Restore</strong> the window you want to see (e.g., by clicking on it on the Taskbar).<br />
2.&nbsp; Press these keys:&nbsp; Hold down <strong>Alt</strong> and press the <strong>space bar</strong> once.<br />
3.&nbsp; Now press the <strong>M</strong> key (for "Move").<br />
4.&nbsp; Now <strong>move your mouse</strong>.&nbsp; You should see a 4-way arrow cursor.<br />
5.&nbsp; Now press <strong>any of the</strong> <strong>arrow keys</strong> on your keyboard, and you will find you have hold of the window and can move it anywhere you like.<br />
6.&nbsp; Close the window and it should remember where you left it for next time.</p>
<p>FYI, you can also access additional Window manipulation features by holding down the shift key when clicking on a Taskbar button.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            I think I found the problem When I opened the task manager there was something called tiworker then when I clicked end process the C stopped taking away GB from and the game worked fine without any FPS drops and the CPU was good so is it safe to delete
 this? Tiworker thing?&nbsp;

<p>I wouln't try deleting it. <em>&nbsp;&nbsp; t</em><em>iworker</em> is a function of Windows Updates.
</p>
<p>Windows Updates downloads updates in the background while you are on line, and installs them either when</p>
<p>the download is finished (if you have not setup to prevent this), or when you shut down or reboot</p>
<p>(if your setup prevents auto reboot).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"then when I clicked end process the C stopped taking away GB "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- This would be GB's of RAM ? GB of disk space don't normally just disappear by ending a process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The safest way to prevent Windows Updates using your system resources when you need full system resources</p>
<p>is to run Windows Updates manually every few weeks.</p>
<p>I believe MS has a routine of releasing general updates on the second Tuesday of each month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"I refresh the C is being used like it was 145GB"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>-When doing a version update such as 1709 Windows will download around 4GB data to your computer.</p>
<p>When the update has finished you will also have copies of your User data that the update creates in C:\.</p>
<p>These backup files can also amount to many GB's.</p>
<p>If you are sure you won't need to try and roll back to the previous Win10 update version you can run Windows</p>
<p><em>Disk Cleanup - </em>Select the <em>Cleanup System Files</em> option, and Disk Cleanup will delete the backup files.<br />

<h3> b.cornelius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Popup box test size is too small</h2>
                    <p>E.G, If I open Process Explorer (procexp.exe) and click on help the popup that opens
</p>
<p>has text that is about half the size of the text on the main Process Explorer window.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with many popup windows when they open.</p>
<p>Another example, is when I run HWiNFO64v4.30-2060, that is HWiNF064.EXE.</p>
<p>Most of the postings on this forum are inquiring about the size of a window or the text in other places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the small text opens it would be about one half to one third the size of the text on this page.</p>
<p>About like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93679c25-3810-4c6b-b292-04a14b41f896" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also why are the formatting options that should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11686860-db0f-4877-aaa8-195d6e229772" /></p>

    <title>KVM switch &#43; Windows 7 creates monitor switching nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdorais  say:</h3>
<h2>            KVM switch &#43; Windows 7 creates monitor switching nightmare</h2>
                    I have a problem with Windows 7 and my KVM switch (Iogear model# gcs1764) which is makes switching via KVM an absolute nightmare.&nbsp; The iogear KVM does not use drivers nor are any available on their website.<br />
<br />
Here's what happens:<br />
I switch from Win 7 (2 monitors) to XP (1 monitor) via KVM.&nbsp; When I switch back to Win 7 (2 monitors) sometimes Win 7 will throw my desktop to the 2nd monitor (1st monitor goes blank) and opening up display settings only shows the 2nd monitor as existing.&nbsp;
 It's as if the 1st monitor is now unplugged which it isn't.&nbsp; At this point I have to go into display settings, click Detect, and then it re-detects my 1st monitor and "extends" my desktop back out over 2 monitors.&nbsp; All windows have now been thrown to my 1st
 monitor and i have to rearrange all my work back across 2 monitors.&nbsp; This is why KVM switching in Win 7 makes my work life a living nightmare.&nbsp; This isn't all of it either...<br />
<br />
When everything gets thrown to my first monitor, it takes any windows that were maximized and resizes them to about 1/4 my screen size.&nbsp; Due to compatibility issues between Win 7 and SQL Server Management Studio, Management Studio has a redraw bug that doesn't
 "re-size" the query window correctly.&nbsp; So even though I maximize the app, when I start typing in the query window my text disappears about 1/4 the way across the whole window.&nbsp; The only way to fix this is to save all my work, close the app, and then re-open
 the app with all my work.&nbsp; So basically every time I switch computers there's about a 1/5 chance I have rinse and repeat everything I just typed above.&nbsp; Fun times.<br />
<br />
So are there any future fixes planned for this?&nbsp; I have tried everything and nothing fixes this problem.&nbsp; I have all the latest Nvidia drivers (my card: Nvidia GTS 250).

<p><span><span><span>Hi mdorais,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>It is a<span>&nbsp;
</span>problem found with those KVM switches which did not pass the console display's EDID and DDC information to all the systems connected to the KVM switch.</span></p>
<p><span>That explains when you switch/select to other channel of connected system, the connected system simply cannot recognize what display
 had been connected, so end up with setback to system default (normally is 800 x 600).
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 checks display and display card constantly different from what XP and other operating systems did.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>To solve this issue, just replace the KVM switch with those KVM switches supporting FULL TIME/ Active DDC function.<br />
Please check ConnectPRO new UR or PR serial KVM switches which support Active DDC function to all the ports.</span></p>

            Afzal, thanks for the official answer, and I appreciate mdorais for asking this first. I've been following threads on this same topic because I have the same issue.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't know of a KVM switch that'll fit my configuration and has "FULLTIME/Active DDC", which is used to switch between my Windows 7 machine and my Mac Pro. In addition, the KVM switch was costly to begin with, so price is a big issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is there simply a way to revert to older behavior or ignore this annoying resize problem?</strong>

            I have a co-worker with the exact same computer, KVM switch, and Windows 7 and he says he did something and it fixed the problem (Unfortunately he can't remember what he did).&nbsp; I have verified that to be true and I've used his KVM and I still have this
 problem.&nbsp; This seems to prove that there IS a way to make this work in Windows 7 with my KVM switch.&nbsp; If Microsoft's only answer is buy a new switch, which is quite expensive, then it's more feasible for me to install my previous version of Windows that worked
 fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7 isn't worth buying a new KVM switch for.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway.<br />
<br />
P.S. I just checked out those KVM switches that were recommended and the only ones available have VGA input/output instead of DVI which my current switch has.&nbsp; Definitely not acceptable in 2009!

            You're answer is buy a new switch? You're kidding, right?<br />
<br />
Can't MS put out a patch to stop the polling of the monitors for EDID info (which is
<br />
what I think is happening with my system)&nbsp; I have a DVI monitor connected directly, and
<br />
a vga monitor going thru an old Belink OmniView KVM which is set up for extended desktop,<br />
and whenever you open a window&nbsp; (ie for example) on the VGA, the system moves the<br />
window back to the DVI and flashing of both monitors start happening. Can't work with this and I<br />
haven't seen a 4 port KVM with DVI for less than 250$ (Belkins SOHO, but not sure if that's w7 compatible)<br />
Thanks<br />
Gary<br />

<p>I too now suffer from this annoying affliction as a result of upgrading (re-installing) 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise from 32-bit Vista Business. &nbsp;Exactly the same hardware (machine, screen, KVM) as I was running under Vista where the problem never occurred.
 &nbsp;Now whenever I switch to my Win7 computer on the KVM my desktop windows are all resized to 1024x768 and shifted to the top-right of the screen. &nbsp;Very frustrating.</p>
<p>For the record here's my setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gefen DVI KVM (EXT-DVIKVM-241) </li><li>nVidia GeForce 7900GT </li><li>Dell 24" LCD @ 1920x1200 </li></ul>

            This is a ridiculous answer "Buy new hardware".&nbsp; I have a single monitor (HP 2408) and a $200 KVM from IO Gear that is only about a year old.&nbsp; When I switch between my devices the Windows 7 device reverts to 1024 x 768 and I can't override it.&nbsp; I used
 to be able to just go to device manager in Vista and tell it to scan for hardware changes and then the screen resolution would allow me to switch the device back to 1920 x 1200.&nbsp; Now I can't do that in Windows 7.&nbsp; I really just want to know if there is a way
 to force Windows 7 to let me try a higher resolution that what it thinks is possible. Any way to do this?

            All, I found a <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">workaround</span>
</strong>for my situation.&nbsp; It is a crummy workaround, but it works for me.&nbsp; When I switch back to Windows 7 I reach back and pull the power cord on my KVM.&nbsp; When I plug it back in Windows 7 picks up the change and switches the display resolution back to my
 full resolution.

<p><span><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The resolution you can use depends on the resolutions your monitor supports. CRT monitors generally display a resolution of 800
 × 600 or 1024 × 768 pixels and can work well at different resolutions. LCD monitors, also called flat-panel displays, and laptop screens often support higher resolutions and work best at a specific resolution.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The larger the monitor, usually the higher the resolution it supports. Whether you can increase your screen resolution depends
 on the size and capability of your monitor and the type of video card you have.</span></span></span></p>

            Afzal - this response is much less than helpful and is a regurgitation of rubbish I have seen elsewhere.<br />
Apologies but if your only suggestion is 'buy new hardware' then I have an alternative suggestion - use OS X.<br />
<br />
Again I'd like to re-iterate that this problem _did not occur under Vista_ with _exactly_ the same hardware.<br />
<br />
<br />
@Truth Telling Fool - I found another super crummy but slightly less inconvenient workaround as well.&nbsp; Minimise all windows to desktop (Windows-D) prior to switching on the KVM.&nbsp; When you return to Windows 7 simply hit Windows-D to restore all windows (size
 and location) as they were before you dared to try and use your KVM.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How great is Windows 7.&nbsp; How much better is Microsoft Support.&nbsp; Count them on one finger.

            OK just quickly so I don't come across as a total Microsoft hater.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 is by far superior to Vista and is a landmark release along the lines of XP.&nbsp; Apart from this one minor issue I am more than impressed by it, and enjoy using it.<br />
However - it's the little day-to-day things like this that end up leaving a real bad taste in the mouth and can really spoil everything, so I'd encourage Microsoft (and their driver partners as necessary) to fix issues like this so we're not all left hanging.

    <title>Keyboard issues -- garbage letters, vanishing drivers, tons of fun. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjpo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard issues -- garbage letters, vanishing drivers, tons of fun.</h2>
                    I challenge you to solve this problem, because I've tried everything I can think of.<br />
<br />
So one morning after waking my computer and using the keyboard for the first time that day I noticed strange characters were appearing in the address bar as I was typing keys. "z" produced "z`", "g" produced "ghy", "s" typed "s" and toggled capslock, one key
 thought it was F7, etc etc. As you can imagine typing a sentence was a real pain filled with garbage letters.<br />
<br />
After hours of browsing, every solution I searched online didn't help. Numlock is off. This is a desktop, so there is no function key. Combinations of ctrl + shift to change regional language settings are ineffective since they are correct to begin with. There
 is no liquid residue, the ribbon is intact, and there is no other mechanical faults, confirmed when another keyboard was used to the same effect. Restarting doesn't help. A driver search update hangs idle "searching" at least for hours, if not forever. Manually
 downloading drivers is impossible since this is a brandless, very standard USB keyboard. Virus scans are ineffectual, no software has been changed anyway (and none of my software updates automatically), and the computer was working fine in the hours before
 I put it to sleep. Safe mode doesn't change anything, and all text-accepting programs display the same output.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, after trying the above, keyboards now refuse to work altogether, even though the BIOS continues to recognize a keyboard is present when the system boots. No more grabage letters, just nothing. Navigating to the driver section of the control panel,
 I discover the driver has vanished. For no reason. As though it just got tired and shuffled out the door.<br />
<br />
After sixteen years of PC use I've never been so lost. To my understanding of operating systems the occurance is bizzare and undeserved. I hate asking for help but I'm pretty crippled without the full use of my PC so I'm kinda dessperate. I don't want to mess
 with the registry or anything scary alone but the system simply refuses to accept any notion of keyboards or drivers and I'm wondering, short of a full reinstall, why and what and how. Things are happening that have no cause. Apologies for being difficult
 but if anyone out there has any suggestions for me I'd really appreciate it, because I'm at the point here where I'm thinking my computer is just being vindictive. I'll send you a muffin or something. You pick the flavor.<br />
<br />
Boo-hoo, me. For the love of Zeus please humble me with your insight.<br />

Do keyboards work in the BIOS?<br />
If you boot from an UBUNTU Live CD or USB stick, do the keyboards work?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You could have memory, power, or USB chipset issues (motherboard) - which would be hardware related.&nbsp; You need to attempt to use the keyboards in something that is not the currently installed Windowsto make sure you are looking at the right thing.&nbsp; A UBCD would
 work.<br />

So even when booted in a different OS on the same hardware - it does not function?<br />
(If so - that points to a hardware issue.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
How much stuff do you have plugged into the USB ports?<br />
Unplug everything except mouse and keyboard and change what ports those are plugged into.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Unfortunately - especially if the booting to the other operating system (Ubuntu?&nbsp; Windows UBCD?) showed the same signs - this is likely a power issue, motherboard issue or something else that I just have not come across before - but definitely hardware (or
 some strange BIOS issue - tried resetting the BIOS to defaults?)<br />

            Although the problem isn't solved I've managed to dig up an old PS/2 keyboard to hobble by on, thanks to my landlady, and -- praise be -- it works. Not ideal but functional, big thanks for you help. I found your input useful.. even if the prospects of

Back to the issue.. in the unplugging and replugging of hardware I've only now realized what I think could be the problem -- my audio manager errenously believes all USB attachments are audio devices, indicated by it asking me what type of audio device has
 been inserted. To me this explanation would satisfy many of the symptoms my PC displayed, including how I am able to avoid this issue by simply using the PS/2 socket. When necessary I'll research the solution to that but for now I'm content enjoying the ability
 to type again in a state of happy delirium. Naturally.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help and hopefully this topic will help those with the same problem.<br />

So I must ask again - did you ever boot to another OS (even Windows) via a CD, DVD or USB stick?<br />
(Making this type of media is fairly easy - especially Ubuntu Linux or other.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; *If* you did (implied by one of your answers to me) and the USB keyboard still failed to work properly in the alternative OS - the motherboard is dying and it will not be log until you have many more issues.&nbsp; Backup NOW and keep a good and consistent backup
 from now on.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; *If* I misread your responses and you did not boot to an alternative OS or the USB keyboard *did* work fine in that alternative OS - then your issue could well be with the installed operating system.&nbsp; I would suggest the following...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
1. Use SFC /SCANNOW to look for corrupt system files and fix them.<br />
2. Locate the manufacturer(s) for your motherboard chipset, audio device, video device and networking device(s) and visit each of their web pages.&nbsp; Figure out the MODEL of each device and while on each of the manufacturer's web pages, locate the proper driver
 for the model of the device and operating system you are running and download it (saving it to disk) and install it.<br />
3. Just to be extra safe...<br />
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">MalwareBytes (FREE)</font></a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</font></a></li></ul>
<p>Removing <i><b>everything</b></i> they find.&nbsp; Restarting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">eSet Online Scanner</font></a>. Remove <b><i>whatever</i></b> is found.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Come back and keep everyone apprised of your status.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Oh - and no matter what - keep the backups current!<br />
</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In IE - VIEW - Toolbars - check Command Bar<br />
<br />
or hold ALT and touch V - same thing<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Right Click the TaskBar on bottom of screen&nbsp;(what you are probably calling the Start Bar) - Toolbars - uncheck
<br />
Address Bar.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
I found a potential solution that you might want to try.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard that this might be caused by an update&nbsp;released this week, on Tuesday, August 25.<br />
<br />
Here are some steps:<br />
<br />
1. Uninstall KB 973879 from Programs and Features / Installed Updates<br />
Potential Issue:&nbsp; You might get a blue screen&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;uninstalling the update.&nbsp; If so, disconnect any devices from the system like printers, scanners, usb disk drives, etc.&nbsp; Also disable Wireless and Bluetooth on laptops and retry.&nbsp; If you are unable to uninstall
 the update try step #2<br />
<br />
2. Use System Restore and restore your computer to a date prior to Tuesday, August 25 (PST time).&nbsp; Please remember that after your have used system restore you may need to install updates again to keep secure.&nbsp; You can try to upgrade to SP2 before doing this
 last check for&nbsp;updates, then when SP2 is installed check for updates again and install whatever is available.&nbsp; If you are unable to use System Restore, please try step&nbsp;#3<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Use a Windows PE boot CD&nbsp;to boot into the Windows&nbsp;Pre-boot Environment (Retail Windows Vista DVDs have this functionality) and uninstall KB 973879 from within this Windows PE environment.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if any of this helps!<br />
<br />
Thanks,

            Hey CLJ3,<br />
<br />
I also heard mention of KB972036 update potentially causing issues like this in certain regions but I haven't confirmed it yet.&nbsp; If you don't see the KB973879 as an update to uninstall check to see if you have KB972036 instead and try removing that one to see
 if it resolves the issue.&nbsp; Please make sure to post back with your results.&nbsp; If it does not resolve the issue please make sure to reinstall the update that was just uninstalled to keep secure.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

<p>I tried what you said, but it still says "you need permission to perform this action". I have access to everything on the drive. It is only the autorun.inf that i no longer have access to and because of that when i rename the drive it shows the new name
 in disk management but it stays the same in my computer. I am using windows 10 pro.</p>

<h2>            HP photosmart ink cartridges</h2>
                    <p>How can I check printer cartridge ink levels in an HP photosmart C4280 Printer using Windows10? I'm able to print color sections but black and white doesn't print. With Vista I was able to check ink levels of color and black but I don't see a way to check
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You need to open the Printer Assistant. To do this, make sure your printer is turned on and can be found by your pc. If you have your printer on your desktop as an icon then right click on it and click to open this will open the assistant, from this you
 can select Ink levels and much more. &nbsp; If you don't have an icon to click then find you printer in the apps list (probably under HP) and right click on your printer from the options and then click on File Location then right click again and click open this
 will open the assistant. From the assistant click on Set Preferences then on Advanced to choose black ink only printing.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25600366-b657-4bad-ae65-f45a017d4722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25600366-b657-4bad-ae65-f45a017d4722" /></a></p>
