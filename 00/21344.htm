<h2>            Need Help Recovering Word file I opened through onenote</h2>
                    I may be using onenote incorrectly, but...&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I opened onenote and attached a Word document to it... and the next day I went into the word doc by opening onenote and clicking on the document... and proceeded to make changes to the document. &nbsp;I though I had autosave set on Word... and I also really
 thought I hit save... however, I went to print the document, which it did, came back and closed it (again, I don't remember if I hit save, certainly thought I did), but the next day, the doc changes were gone (I went into the doc again via onenote). &nbsp;Fortunately
 I have a printed copy, but there were lots of changes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot figure out where in the heck this file went. &nbsp;I don't really understand onenotes procedure of saying. &nbsp;I, along with several people in our group, have tried to find the doc with no luck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today I'm starting to type the doc back into word (this time I am opening word from the app and not via onenote).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone offer any insights?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

This handling makes me nervous ;-)<br />
<br />
If you "attach" a Word document to Onenote, Onenote creates a COPY and inserts this copy into the current section file (*.one file).<br />
<br />
If you change this copy by opening from Onenote the original Word file remains unchanged. So if you open the original with Word you'll see (naturally) no changes.<br />

            Thanks Bernd.. &nbsp; but I understand that it makes a copy. &nbsp;I was working with the copy making the changes. &nbsp;Then I closed onenote for the evening (like I said, I printed everything out before I closed, so I definitely had the changes made, I have them on
 paper).
<div><br />
<div>The next time I went into the COPY that was in onenote, the changes weren't there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I assumed that if I worked on the copy, that word would act the same as it does if you go directly into word. &nbsp;However, for some reason it doesn't seem to be the case. &nbsp;I would have thought that I should find some type of backup of my changes... especially
 since I had the paper copy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I hadn't of printed, I would start thinking I was nuts and didn't make the changes or anything...</div>

            Halo,<br />
<br />
<br />
I can find the MSWord attachments (the original and the modified one) in my Onenote cache folder:<br />
C:\Users\DL\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\14.0\OneNoteOfflineCache_Files<br />
<br />
Have you tried accessing your onenote cache folder?<br />
Use MSExplorer and see if there is/are file/s with .docx extension.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
addition:<br />
[... I don't really understand onenotes procedure of saying....]<br />
As far as I have experienced, Onenote saves all my modified versions of the identical docx in the cache folder, provided that I "save" the changes I have made.<br />
In MSExplorer, to make it easy for me to see, I sort the files by date or by file-type.<br />
<br />
..<br />

That's the crucial point. If you close Onenote before "save" then the changes are lost. Relying on "autosave" can provoke this.<br />

<h2>            how to remove mix.dj</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to get rid of this mix.dj thing? It was a toolbar, which I disabled and deleted, but when I open my browser, it still shows as my homepage. So I'm guessing it's not REALLY deleted. It still slows down my computer a LOT, and makes a
 bunch of adds pop up. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's not in the add/remove programs list, and my antivirus software doesn't pick it up as a threat so I can't delete it that way. I have Windows 8, on a new computer.</div>

            <p>HI tony</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Met with installation issue while you were trying to install the trial version of VirtualDJ Home FREE on your Windows – the ESET NOD32 AntiVirus and/or other virus protection you installed just disabled the VirtualDJ auto-installer’s attempts to complete its
 express installation?! Encountered a warning box from VirtualDJ, informing “Warning! The skin you are trying to use has a higher resolution than your screen (.)”?! When you attempted to uninstall and completely remove the expired version of VirtualDJ Home
 FREE, the Windows Add/ Remove Programs or Uninstall or Change a program informed you that it just could NOT load its required installation log file?!
<p>To successfully install the FREE MP3 mixing program on your Windows device, you can first disable the current active Internet connection and then you temporarily exit or shut down the installed malware protection and/or other third-party firewall program,
 after you complete the above directions, you then re-run the downloaded official installer program for the VirtualDJ Home Free.
</p>
<p>Secondly, to run the installed VirtualDJ program properly, please ensure that you have set your Windows screen resolution as
<strong>1024×768</strong>. For more official wiki tips, please pay a visit to the provided knowledge base below.</p>
<p>Here comes the complete uninstall issue associated with the potentially problematic VirtualDJ software: how to completely
<strong>uninstall Virtual DJ Home FREE</strong>? Then, you can get or review the quick tips from the following YouTube video via simply clicking the
<strong>Play</strong> button in it and then, you can learn the detailed instructions that are provided below to complete standard uninstall of VirtualDJ Home FREE program. Should the typical method just does NOT help you uninstall Virtual DJ Home FREE successfully,
 you now should try and launch the below force uninstall option for that VirtualDJ program by downloading and installing this &lt;Removed&gt;</p>

            I recently downloaded a program labeled MXIDJ which was supposed to have a toolbar that could be deleted after installation. It did not go away even when I supposedly deleted the entire software download from my registry. I have no registration number
 because it was a free trial and no support phone number to contact the creators of the software with. when I type in the name MIXIDJ I consistently get to a site that discusses how to get rid of MIX MEISTER and even that isn't helpful because in the sole incident
 where the manufacturers seem to have responded to complaints their cure has been flagged as removed and can not be reached. I saw numerous complaints about this problem with the undying MIXIDJ&nbsp;but no cures. Does anybody know how to ditch this thing?

            What are you saying/ I installed Google Chrome only as a means to an end: Get rid of MixiDj, Not to replace it with another unwanted browser bar. I was perfectly happy with Internet Explorer but then MixiDJ took over and not only took Internet Explorer's
 place it eliminated MSN as my home page. I want MSN back, I can live with having Google Chrome if I can get MSN back. Your advice is really not useful to me at all.&nbsp;

            Part of your answer has been removed and the two web sites listed are totally worthless. I got no report of my installation of MIXIDJ&nbsp;being blocked with a option of allowing its installation. I would have gotten such a notice if my anti-virus/anti-malware
 program had thought it was a suspicious software program. The problem apparently is not in whether or not it is installed completely it is in how it is written. There is some similarity to a malware virus in its software that keeps me from ridding my computer
 of it but it is not similar enough to other malware for my security system to tag it as&nbsp;malware and try to alert me to it or delete it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p>I downloaded the ISO however when I try to run it on my windows 8.1 pro machine I get the following message come up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>This app can't be run on your PC. To find a version for your PC check with the software Publisher</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to install it over my windows 8.1 pro system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is this another drawback of installing the 81. Pro version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi thanks for info unfortunately no DVD as pc is a NUC. Still somewhere I think I have the instructions for creating a bootable mem stick. However if anyone out there knows where I can get the instructions let me know. Thanks</p>

            <p>I don't think you want to install pre-release software over a working and stable operating system. If you really do want to do this, be sure to keep a back up of all your important files on another PC or external hard drive.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you really want to do this, follow the following steps, but remember that all your data, installed programs, etc. will be lost once you arrive at Windows 10 Tech Preview.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a USB drive of at least 4GB (8GB or more preferably) that does not have important files on it.<br />
</li><li>Format the USB to FAT32 with default block size and give it a name like "Win10Build9841", you can choose yourself. Keep in mind that all the files on the USB drive will be deleted.<br />
</li><li>Double click the .iso file you downloaded, it will now mount as a 'fake' DVD in This PC. Open it and select all files.</li><li>Copy these files to the USB drive you just formatted and wait for it to copy all the files.</li><li>Now shut down your windows (do not hibernate or sleep, shut down).</li><li>Boot from the USB drive. For some computers, just booting while having this USB inserted will boot from USB, otherwise you'll have to select that in the boot menu (one of the F-keys while starting the computer).</li><li>Once you see the install program, follow the instructions. Be sure to select "Custom Install", remove the old Windows 8.1 partitions and create a new one for Windows 10 Tech Preview.</li><li>Now complete the installation, this will take about 10 minutes to an hour, depending on the speed of your USB drive and computer.</li></ol>
<p>I am not responsible for making your computer unusable. You should know the risks that come with installing a new OS without much technical knowledge:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your computer may become unable to boot properly if you do something wrong.</li><li>You may lose more data than you were anticipating (e.g. by deleting a wrong partition)</li><li>You may not like the new OS and going back to your old OS means installing the old one again.</li><li>Getting help from a professional may cost you money.</li></ul>
<p>If you really want to test Windows 10 Tech Preview, but you don't want to give up your current operating system, I'd suggest you download VMware Player (free software):</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a Virtual Machine (a simulated computer running e.g. Windows 10 Tech Preview).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps to do this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install VMware Player (the free software) from https://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer</li><li>Open VMware Player and create a new virtual machine.</li><li>Select the Windows 10 iso and select 'Windows 8' or 'Windows 8 x64' depending on whether you downloaded the Windows 10 Tech Preview 32-bit or 64-bit version.</li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen.</li></ol>
<p>Once you're done, the machine will boot and the Windows 10 Tech Preview install will start. It will not overwrite anything on your computer. You can quickly stop and resume a virtual machine by 'suspending' it. This is sort-of a hibernate, but the operating
 system will not notice, unless you change any hardware of your own PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the amount of resources (RAM, CPU, etc.) the virtual machine can use, shut it down completely (do this after the installation is complete!) and select 'Change virtual machine settings' or something similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have fun testing!</p>

            <p>Hi JK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info. As for the PC, its new and doesn't have anything on it yet, so I could overwrite with no problems, however I might give the VMWARE a try so I don't have to reinstall if I have any issues with 10.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Tangent curve - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vijayakumarchary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tangent curve</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hi ! &nbsp; :-) &nbsp;&nbsp; Charts of Sine and Cosine trigonometric functions look good enough because however many data points you add, these curves don't get better. But the chart made with Tan(x) data is a set of spikes that don't mean anything at all. Can this
 Tangent curve be improved upon in an excel chart ?&nbsp; Is accuracy the limitation of excel charts that makes Tan(x) other than representative of the trig function ?<br />

            <p>It's in the nature of the tangent function.</p>
<p>When x goes from 0 to pi/2, tan(x) increases without limit to positive infinity; at pi/2, the function has a singularity, tan(pi/2) does not exist.</p>
<p>When x goes from 0 to -pi/2, tan(x) decreases without limit to negative infinity; at -pi/2 there is a singularity again.</p>
<p>This pattern repeats itself with intervals of pi.</p>
<p>Excel cannot represent pi exactly, and it cannot represent "infinity" of course, so it's difficult to create a satisfying graph of the tangent function.</p>
<p>It's best to use fractions of PI() in the x-values of the chart and to clear the very large values that Excel computes for the tangent of -pi/2, pi/2 etc.</p>
<p>See this sample workbook on SkyDrive (open it in Excel or download it to your computer first):

            <p>If you look at column A of the sheet that I uploaded, you'll see that the X values compute multiples of 10, that is multiples of 10 degrees, and converts those to radians using the RADIANS function.</p>
<p>180 degrees correspond to pi radians, where pi=3.141592..., so all the RADIANS function does is multiply the angle in degrees with pi/180.</p>
<p>This ensures that 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees etc. will be in the set of X values. Because the tangent function repeats itself every 180 degrees, this will make the chart look (reasonably) good.</p>
<p>You can experiment with the X values, of course, to see how the chart changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and the chart type is an XY&nbsp;(scatter) chart where the data points are connected by smooth lines (curves).</p>

<h2>            Misspelled primary Hotmail account &#61; BLACK HOLE&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My girlfriend has a Samsung phone with Windows Phone 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The company's system admin has set up the phone, set an outlook account (working good) and a Hotmail account (the email address was misspelled, but we did not recognized it for a while) and the Hotmail account is the primary.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The phone works well, outlook emails were sent and received, and when she has entered a new contact the default account was the Hotmail (because it is the primary) and she has saved to it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It was good for years, but now we need to change the phone. Outlook accounts are synchronized with outlook, but the primary Hotmail account was not able to sychronize, and we can't change it (the email address) because it is the primary.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So it seems the misspelled primary Hotmail account acts like a black hole. We have entered information (new contacts) but we can't get it back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea, how can we export contact data (stored to Hotmail account) from the phone?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Gabor</div>

<h2>            Adding sharepoint to another app as an option to save</h2>
                    <p>Hey All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a program called Fulcrum that allows you to build an app that asks certain questions &nbsp;and develops a report based on your answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I’d like to do is, within the Fulcrum App generate a .PDF report and have Sharepoint as an option to save the report to.</p>
<p>Right now, theres many options to save my .PDF too, like. Email, Note, Bluebeam, Onedrive.. etc. But I can’t get sharepoint to pop into that list of options.</p>
<p>I’m wondering if there’s a place in sharepoint I can add that fulcrum should recognized as a valid location to save a file.</p>
<p>thinking it was on the Fulcrum side of things, I’ve asked them, and the thought it sounded like a sharepoint issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Don Savage,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like Fulcrum app do not have any integration with SharePoint online. I tried looking for Fulcrum app in SharePoint store, but there’s nothing. You can check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-an-app-to-a-site-ef9c0dbd-7fe1-4715-a1b0-fe3bc81317cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to know how to download an app from the SharePoint store</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Fulcrum is a third party program, you may contact Fulcrum support to confirm if they provide integration with SharePoint online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry but I am unable to accept e-mail addresses in the forum. I understand your frustration, but again the support team in China would be the best to send this to you.&nbsp; I cannot understand what I see on the screen&nbsp;after I select Traditional Chinese
 because the entire screen is redirection to a website in&nbsp;Chinese and I can not tell what I am clicking to&nbsp;a download copy. One thing that may be happening is that a security could be blocking your download. May I recommend using a browser with no add-ons?</p>

<p>
</p><p>6- Reset Windows Update via Services panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>7- Rebooted, asked WU for updates, tried again, failure again.</p>

    <title>Multiple Office 365 Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joannadodd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Office 365 Accounts</h2>
                    
<p>I recently went back to uni to complete my Masters and set up an account with OneNote using my university email address, which worked fine.</p>
<p>However, I wanted access to my notes when I was away from my computer, so I downloaded OneNote for my iPhone and iPad, which wouldn't sync as I didn't have an Office365 account on OneDrive.</p>
<p>So I went to Office365 and registered as a student with my university email address, at which point my notebooks created on my computer were able to be synced with my iPad and iPhone. So far so good.</p>
<p>The problem is that now, when I use my computer, it refuses to connect to OneDrive and keeps saying that my email address is "used with more than one account from Microsoft". It asks me to select which one I want to use, and when I select work or school
 account and put in my password it signs me in, goes back to my homepage and then immediately asks me to sign in again, over and over and over.</p>
<p>Now I can no longer use OneNote on my computer at all, I can't create new notebooks and I can't open any notebooks created using OneDrive.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this issue?</p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help. Unfortunately doing all of the above did not resolve the issue. I cleared all of those folders from the Group Containers folder, and also cleared all of the application passwords listed above, and it was still refusing to let
 me open new notebooks etc. In terms of the further information you were after, I was still able to sync my notebooks to other devices, such as my iPhone and iPad, which I had signed into using my university's credentials.</p>
<p>In the end, on the basis of your above note that it is possible to add multiple accounts to OneNote, I simply ended up adding two profiles for my university email address. The existing credential was listed under Connected Service as "OneDrive - cam.ac.uk",
 so I added an additional credential "OneDrive - personal" using exactly the same email and password, and that seems to have resolved the problem.
</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Joanna</p>

<h2>            Do I need these IE9 add-ons from MS &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS strives to an IE10 without add-ons in Windows 8</p>
<p>And&nbsp;in Windows 7 - IE9 I see&nbsp;the following MS add-ons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know if I really need them, and if I could them disable eventually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, I do not know what they are needed for</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can somebody explain to me in laymen terms what will happen (and when or where) if I disable them ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I get rid of MS&#39;s useless &#38; messy collection of templates in Office 2016 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Office 2016 puts templates somewhere completely different. Having finally tracked them down (~Library&gt;Group Containers&gt;UBF8T346G9.Office&gt;User Content&gt;Templates), I can't see any way of deleting the MS provided templates for Word and PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are useless for my work, ugly to look at, messy when I want to select from my own working ones and all-in-all a perfect eyesore and mental irritation. Can anyone help me with how to dump them out permanently please?</p>

            Thanks, Mohan. That's dire news for me. There are so many horribly useless templates making such a clutter and not even the ability to hive them off into a folder. Combined with the fact that I can't make folders for my own work, I will be driven to remain
 with Word 2011 until MS changes the way templates are displayed.

            Well on my computer you certainly can't see the MS templates in order to drag them out. You can only see the ones I made. As Mohan says above, there is no visible function available for finding the MS templates in the "Containers&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Templates" folder.
 If yours are visible please let me know where they were and how that came about.

            <p>Forgive Mohan:</p>
<p>
</p><p>He's new (still on L-Plates...). &nbsp;Actually, I don't know how he even got his learner's permit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built-in templates are here:&nbsp;/Applications/Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to right-click and "Show package contents" to see inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are in a folder whose name ends in .lproj and whose first two characters are the abbreviation for the language. &nbsp;So en.lproj for English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you drag any files anywhere, make a copy of that folder and keep it outside the Applications folder. &nbsp;Word has a mechanism that enables it to check itself for tampering before launching. &nbsp;If you make a change it doesn't like, Word will crash a few
 seconds after launch each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drag one or two .dotx files out of that folder and test by re-launching Word. &nbsp;If it does not crash when you do a File&gt;New&gt; From Template, you can do the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously: a word to the wise -- make sure you touch ONLY .dotx files :-) &nbsp;The other files in that folder are quite important. &nbsp;They do things like "enable Word to run" &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>John, thank you. I was glad to be able to locate those .dotx files, and I managed to drag them out, but the templates didn't disappear when I reopened Word. Then I put them in a temporary folder and moved them out to the trash bin to try and firewall them
 off from Word. I even trashed identical files that were in the other variations of English language (en_AU/GB). Far from wrecking Word after quitting, restarting computer and then opening Word, the 'blessed' templates still show up when I go to File/New from
 Template....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think there might be a preference or similar thing running in the background which I should also throw out after trashing the dotx files in order for these things to stop reappearing in the Templates?</p>
<p />

            <p>You can try removing the png images of those templates and see what that does to the template listbox. The images are stored in ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.word/Data/Library/Application Support/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine right now since you have removed the template files these listbox images link to, if you click one of them that nothing happens... is that correct? Or does Word crash? I also imagine that when you install the next update of Word, that all of the
 templates you painstakingly removed will return... just a heads up! :-)</p>

            <p>Thanks Rich: I learnt something from this. When I removed the .dotx files (as per John's advice), the templates continued to appear upon opening Word, and they worked 100% indestructibly. There was no corruption and they operated as expected. That seemed
 weird. However, following on by removing the .png files as per your idea, definitely caused Word to crash and couldn't open it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I restored the.png files, and now Word opens again, and those pesky templates are opening and functioning as normal. I guess there must be another component within Word that is driving their function.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am expecting that any future update is likely to bring back everything else I have dumped out, in particular oodles of completely unnecessary font files. Whether fonts or templates, I just want to see the minimum functioning set and not have to spend
 so much time dropping down huge long menus and hunting for the specific things that I want to use or work on, hidden amongst the dross.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks to both Rich and John - and when you have another idea about this issue, please let me know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I left my laptop for about 30 minutes. &nbsp;When I returned it seems to have got itself into an endless loop of "attempting to repair" and rebooting. &nbsp;There had been no indication of anything wrong before I left the laptop. &nbsp;Can anyone advise a way around this

<strong>keyboard</strong>, or an input method, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />
4. Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.<br />
5. Choose the option <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>and select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Now try the troubleshooting steps mentioned below to resolve the issue.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div>Run <strong>Startup Repair </strong>from the Windows Recovery Environment and check the issue.</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If still the issue persists then try performing <strong>System Restore </strong>
from the Windows Recovery Environment and check the issue. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>

                    The operating system is Windows 10. It was working perfectly. Suddenly, while I was trying to shut down, I noticed that the start menu is not expanding to be able to click on Shut Down menu; also noticed I can not write anything in the search box beside
 the start menu. But the other applications in the Taskbar is opening when clicked.

            If you do win + x you will get the entire alternate menu and each item has a letter underlined.&nbsp; Win + the letter takes you to that item.<br />
If you have the menu up all you have to do is to hit the letter and you get the item.

<p>
</p><p>That can be a symptom that you are working on a monitor which is being detected as a secondary.&nbsp; To check, you can try setting Project, Duplicate.&nbsp; E.g. assuming that you are currently set to External press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter.&nbsp; Note that under the hypothesis
 you would not expect to be able to see the Project dialog, only use it.&nbsp; However, if you wanted, you could first start Narrator for its aural assistance while you used the Project dialog blindly.&nbsp; Press Win+Ctrl+Enter for Narrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you are now reporting seeing the Run... dialog when you press Win+R makes the secondary hypothesis less likely but not impossible.&nbsp; However, in case there is just a problem with the Taskbar you could try restarting explorer.exe.&nbsp; E.g. use Task
 Manager to do that, right-click on explorer.exe and select Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another workaround that I use when this happens is simply to press Win+Tab and then Ctrl+Esc.&nbsp; There are also keyboard shortcuts related to the Search specifically. &nbsp; Win+Q&nbsp; and if enabled Win+C. &nbsp; Apparently Win+S invokes Cortana in a different context
 too.&nbsp; Who knew?</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone has trouble logging in into wifi behind a firewall</h2>
                    One of my friends has a Nokia Lumia 710 . We have a browser based firewall login for access to wifi where we stay. Internet Explorer will display a warning when the login page comes up dissuading from continuing to the page which every browser including
 Android phone browser does. However, even if we opt to continue to the page IE keeps reloading the warning. At times it is possible to reach the login page. Isn't Internet Explorer on the phone the same one as that on the desktop? This problem doesn't occur
 on the desktop IE.<br />

            Try going into the settings for IE and changing your website preference to Desktop and restart the phone and connect to WiFi again. I have a feeling the browser page is misinterpreting IE Mobile.<br />

<h2>            Outlook picks wrong email address to send calendar invitations, updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to understand a weird issue with Outlook 2010 calendar:</p>
<p>I send an event invitation to another Outlook user, connected to the same company OL2010 server.</p>
<p>In my&nbsp; own Outlook contacts this user has a Contact Card with two addresses: the primary email is the company Outlook address (marked as "Email" and "IM address") and another Hotmail address marked as "Email 2".</p>
<p>The invitation and updates arrive to the Hotmail address.</p>
<p>Whenever I send normal emails to that person from Outlook, they arrive to the Outlook address, as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the user name in the Outlook appointment item, a contact card opens with the Outlook address, nowhere I can see the hotmail address except in my own Contacts.
</p>
<p>When I type that user's OL email address manually in the appointment, it is automatically resolved to address entry&nbsp; which looks perfect: the address, name, picture, job title - but still the message is sent out to the Hotmail address. Verified by viewing
 the message as hex dump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question: is this an Outlook bug, or some glitch between my chair and keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any *useful* idea</p>
<p>Of course as a workaround I can delete Contacts entries and scribble alternate emails of people somewhere else...

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have RA2 and Yuri Revenge installed on my PC at the moment while running Windows 10. There are a few things you'll have to do. After installing it, go to the folder you installed it to (default is&nbsp;C:\Westwood\RA2
<strong>OR</strong> C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Command and Conquer Red Alert II if you're running it through Origin) find the following .exe's</p>
<p>
</p><p>Game.exe and gameMD.exe right click them, select properties, and under the compatibility tab select run this program in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP2, also check off the box that says "run as administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That alone will allow the game to run, but it will be pretty laggy in-game. To help with the lag find the .ini files in the same folder listed above, they are "ra2.ini and ra2md.ini" open them with notepad and under section titled [Video] add the following
 line"</p>
<p>
</p><p>VideoBackBuffer=no&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>optionally you can also change your resolution to a higher one, as the game forces you to play on a lower resolution because its so old, but you can play on 1920x1080 if you monitor supports it. below is an example of my ra2.ini video section:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Video]<br />
ScreenWidth=1920<br />
ScreenHeight=1080<br />
StretchMovies=no<br />
VideoBackBuffer=no</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to note is, you cannot minimize once the game is loaded or it will crash. I'm not sure how to fix that yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if you want even less lag in-game there is a third party patch to speed up in-game graphics, you can find it on the RA2 Online ladders website (xwis)</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://xwis.net/forums/index.php/topic/173459-graphics-patch-to-speed-up-tiberian-sun-red-alert-2/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps to apply that patch are located in that forum post, as well a a download to the patch itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as a last thing, in windows 10 the MS Xbox DVR app forces VSync to be turned on. I have a 144hz monitor and it was forcing my refresh rate to 60 which made the game feel sluggish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't use the Xbox app, you can remove it using powershell by opening powershell as an administrator and pasting in this line:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-Appxpackage *xbox* | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will allow the game to run in whatever your monitors refresh rate is set to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have fun.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change input language on Outlook 2003 email message &#39;To&#39; field</h2>
                    <p>When creating a new email message, the 'To' field's default input language is hebrew.</p>
<p>The input language cannot be switched to english - not by pressing Alt-Shift nor by selecting English from the language bar.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Assaf.</p>

    <title>OUTLOOK 2007 not sending emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            OUTLOOK 2007 not sending emails</h2>
                    <p>I've just installed OUTLOOK 2007 and it has a strange problem.</p>
<p>When I first start the program it will send any emails that are in the outbox. It will also send any new ones that I create, but after a few hours (haven't timed how long) it stops sending emails until I stop and restart the program.</p>
<p>I'm using IMAP.</p>
<p>I've checked the SMTP settings and port numbers are all ok.</p>
<p>I've tested the account from the Tools&gt;Account Settings and test emails are sent and received correctly without any delay, but the ones in the Outbox remain there without being sent.</p>
<p>It's as if outlook forgets to check the outbox. If I force a send/receive all nothing happens.</p>
<p>I've uninstalled Outlook and re-installed it and I've run Office repair all to no avail.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a good solution?</p>

<p>Outlook 2007 went out of support in late 2017 and so there are no udates/fixes since then.</p>
<p>If when you first start Outlook you hold the Ctrl key to force safe mode, does that help?</p>

<p>Office/Outlook 2003 is not compatible with win10, and is also out of support.</p>
<p>The current Office/Outlook versions that are still supported are Office 2010 and later</p>

            It might be out of support but it's the last version to work in an understandable way with a proper drop-down menu system. So I'd rather stick with it than pay to upgrade to a product that I don't like.

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>Well it worked ok for a few hours last night, but this morning when I tried to send an email it got stuck in the Outbox.</p>
<p>I shall have to restart the program to get it to send.</p>

<p>Out of support means no updates/critical or not/no bug fixes and if using win10 is prone to problems after a win update</p>
<p>There are no upgrade versions of Office since v2007, all later versions are full versions</p>
