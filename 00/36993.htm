<h2>            Security Component Upgrade the upgrade button is greyed out </h2>
                    
<p>Am trying to download a digital copy of a movie I purchased. When directed to download a Security Component Upgrade the upgrade button is greyed out and I can not find a solution to this. Please help.<br />

<p>This was emailed to me by Universal Digital Support. It worked</p>
<p><span><span>If you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7 and the Upgrade button is not active when you go to the security update page at http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp,
 you may also need to disable protected mode in Internet Explorer to get the page to load correctly. Here's how:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Launch Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Tools from the top menu, and click Internet Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the panel that pops up, select the Security tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck the option for “Enable Protected Mode (requires restarting Internet Explorer)”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Apply, OK, and close the Internet Explorer browser.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart Internet Explorer and go to the address http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Upgrade button should now be operational.</span></span></p>

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 8 and had the issue with the upgrade component being greyed out.&nbsp; I did this, but also in addition
<b>had to make sure compatibility mode was enabled </b>on Windows 8 (clicking the little shredded paper icon in the address bar).&nbsp;&nbsp; This made it possible for me to click upgrade.<br />
<br />
I know this is very old but if I came across this as a top result, others may too.

<h2>            Hacked a 3rd time</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if there is anything that can be done. My son has had&nbsp;his 3rd gamertag stolen and deleted. Our&nbsp;internet and phone get shut down for 30 minutes 4 times a day. We have had pizzas ordered to our house and harassing phone calls at 3:00 AM.
 My son has been being hacked by a guy named( Mod Edit ) for about 2 years and nobody has helped us. My son removed him because he was trying to get him to do a naked video kinect, after that he started hacking us.I have contacted the police 4 times and they
 said they couldn't help me. I can't afford to keep buying him Gold memberships if they are just going to get hacked.

<p>1. Phone your ISP, explain what's going on and have them look into it. If it's a Denial of Service attack then it's a matter for the police, if not then your ISP will fix it themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. One for the phone company this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. This is definately a police matter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. They should be. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. You can't be hacked over XBL despite what these people claim. If your son has had his accounts stolen three times already that suggests there's a hole in your security that's allowing this person to get in. If you're reusing the same WLID &amp; password for
 each account there's the problem right there. Also what seems like a strong password to you can be extremely weak. For example you may think using a school name is a great idea for a password but that becomes a liability when you say you attended said school
 on Facebook especially if your e-mail address is something like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>VernierSlake is correct phone your ISP and let them know and they can change your IP and do other things, because the gamer has your IP and can shut down your internet temporarily. &nbsp;And as VernierSlake said you can't be hacked on Xbox your son had to give
 out some kind of account information that gave the gamer access to it. &nbsp;File a complaint against the gamer and block communications. &nbsp;But please do not call out any gamers on the Forums.</p>

<p>Call support and open an unauthorized access case</p>
<p>@op</p>
<p>Ok maybe it's time to sit with your son and talk to him about reviewing his security</p>
<p>First stop giving out emails etc or using funny websites because his friends suggested it</p>
<p>Teach him to never enter account info on sites other then official live sites</p>
<p>This includes free or cheap ms points sites</p>
<p>2nd make sure after the last investigation change all password reset options and trusted pc and phone number are added</p>
<p>3rd</p>
<p>Replace the windows live Id with a new one </p>
<p>Worst case maybe use a windows live Id you only know and you managed the password</p>
<p>Make sure there is capital letters and numbers mixed in with regular letters</p>
<p>If your son knows who hacked his account he gave the info to thee said person</p>
<p>I suggest you set contact info to friends only and parental control </p>
<p>If he is an adult account add him to a family plan </p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You should seriously sit down with your son and find out how these people are getting his personal information. If he got compromised THREE times then the issue lies with him. You may even want
 to consider giving him a child account if he is under 18 years so you can control more of what he can andcan not do while on XBL as well as using the Family Settings on the console.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro on MacBook Air Bootcamp - Intel HD Graphics 6000 driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabrieldeak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro on MacBook Air Bootcamp - Intel HD Graphics 6000 driver causes blank screen in applications</h2>
                    <p>I have recently started experiencing issues with Visual Studio 2017 running on Windows 10 Pro through bootcamp on a MacBook Air. Visual Studio is starting with a blank screen and to get it working I have to open the options through key shortcuts and disable
 hardware acceleration. Uninstalling the graphics driver fixes the problem but when Windows updates the graphics driver the issues occurs again. VS2017 is not the only app affected, I have discovered at least one other, Nord VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got in touch with Intel and they told me to get in touch with the device manufacturer, which I did, but I was pretty sure they will say it is Windows, so, not our problem. They only told me to get in touch with the OS manufacturer :). From my perspective
 this is a driver issue, unfortunately I do not know if the same graphics driver was installed before the latest Win 10 major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what the fix could be? Disabling the hardware acceleration does not seem right to me.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>I was able to pin down the issue after uninstalling every extra driver/application that I have installed after the Windows 10 reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be caused by a 3rd party application called Duet Display, DuetSetup-1-5-2-1.exe. This application allows you to use your iPad as a 2nd monitor.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure Duet Display is what is causing the issue as after uninstalling it everything works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally have an answer to this and it is nothing to do with the graphic driver or the Windows 10 April update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your replies and help,</p>
<p>Gabe.&nbsp;</p>

 is crap there are too many restrictions on us the GAMERS i dont know if it is because you let publishers decide what goes into the console or what but man you guys messed up, i always played on the original xbox , and the 360 , was going to get the 720 untill
 i actually found out what you guys have done with the xbox. Just stop microsoft stop no one is happy with the x1 and you guys keep making it worse. I leave you wth this microsoft this how many xbox fans and other gamers feel abou

<h2>            MS Flight Simulator X Gold edition wil not work properly in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Despite Compatibility saying it is compatible, I cannot get FSX Gold to run properly. I have 2 questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I am very tempted to revert back to Win7 SP1 where FSX worked pretty well. If I do, can I use my upgrade to Win10 again when you have got things sorted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, and to give Win10 a chance, I'd like to explore every way to get FSX to run on Win10. How? I am running an Intel i7-3770 @ 3.4Ghz&nbsp; system with 8Gb of RAM in a 3 monitor setup through an nVidia GeForce GTX 750 Ti. Whilst I can get some sort of virtual
 FSX window on each screen, the right part of the left screen is repeated for 2 or 3 inches on the extreme left of the right screen, which reduces the size of the virtual window there. At first I could not re-size the virtual windows until I discovered that
 I had to do it on the central screen before dragging them into position on the left or right screen. Once in position, I cannot re-size them again. Despite the 3 monitors having the same native resolution (1920x1080) and ensuring that FSX is set to this resolution,
 the images on the 3 monitors all look like different resolutions: the left is just a grey fuzzy mess; centre is lower than 1920x1080; and right looks to be correct. When attempting to play in this setup, the game has developed a fault each time where the controls
 no longer respond, the mouse then moves slowly and beeps with each juddering movement and this persists if I close down FSX (using the keyboard). If I try to reboot the PC, it gets stuck on the 'restarting' message with the circle going round and round. I
 have left it for an hour before having to use the reset button. All Windows updates have been done, and I have got the latest graphics driver according to GeForce Experience. What can you suggest?</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your comprehensive reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I attempt your suggestions, you did not answer my question about whether I can revert to Win7 and use my free upgrade to Win10 at a later date. I forgot to mention in my first message, that I had trouble with the initial upgrade to Win10 and experienced
 a crash during the latter stages when things were being set up. I wonder if I can attempt the upgrade again in case something needs repairing in Win10. For example, I cannot get my monitors to go to sleep whatever setting changes I make. I have made the changes
 in Windows and GeForce Experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I effect a repair by creating a bootable DVD from an ISO file?</p>
<p>

<p><br />

            <p>Hello again Jayant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't received a reply to my response of 23 August regarding the ability to use the free Win10 upgrade a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I have tried some of your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 (safe mode): FSX requested activiation under Safe Mode. Why? - I have already been using it for several years under Win7. I declined activation and continued a trial flight. Firstly, the screen resolution was nowhere near 1920x1080 but I suppose
 the proper graphics driver hadn't been loaded. This also meant that I couldn't run FSX with multiple screens, which rather defeated the object. I continued with a flight just on the one monitor and it ran very slowly and I was unable to alter any settings,
 so I exited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 (Clean Boot): FSX opened in a small window on the centre monitor of my 3 monitor setup. I couldn't open the main menu or really do anything. A message kept saying that the suggested resolution was 1920x1080 which is what my 3 monitors are all running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I exited FSX and rebooted the PC and removed the Clean Boot settings and rebooted again. I restarted FSX and firstly went into the settings and changed the screen resolution to 1920x1080x32. I then undertook a flight but when I tried to operate the Saitek
 trimwheel, the mouse stopped responding. This made me think USB conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following Saitek USB devices attached for use with FSX: Cessna Flight yoke, rudder pedals, Cessna trim wheel, 2 x throttle quadrants, radio panel, switch panel and flight instrument panel. I disconnected all the devices and rebooted the PC. I
 then added the Saitek devices one by one and rebooted. I was then able to complete a flight without the mouse freezing when I used the trim wheel. It appeared that all controls worked correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have a problem when using the 3 monitors. I can create a virtual cockpit window on the centre monitor, resize it and move it to the left monitor where it displays properly. I can create another virtual cockpit window on the centre monitor
 and resize it, but when I move it to the right monitor, it no longer fills the right monitor but leaves a blank black gap of approximately 3 inches on the left side of the right monitor's screen. If you have an email address, I can send you a screenshot. It
 looks like FSX is not recognising the full size of the centre or the right monitor. What do you suggest? Has anyone else out there had a similar problem?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard Sanders</p>

            <p>Well, I still haven't received a reply to my original question as to whether I can revert to Win7 and then re-use the free upgrade to Win10 at a later date in the hope that the issues have been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to my second question, I tried what had been suggested by Jayant but with no success. I have, however, partially resolved the issues with FSX myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image on the right monitor was somewhat fuzzy and couldn't be made to fill the entire screen. In the end, I discovered the CFG file for FSX and noticed that where the 3 screens were listed under graphics settings, only 2 of them showed the correct resolution
 of 1920x1080. The other showed a lower resolution. I amended the CFG file using a text editor so that all 3 monitors showed a resolution of 1920x1080 and restarted FSX. This cured the monitor problem and I now have 3 full screen images. FSX ran just fine,
 until I tried to adjust the trim. Then my mouse promptly stopped responding. I never had this trouble with Win7 and appears to be a USB conflict. Sometimes, if I disconnect the trim wheel USB lead before booting the PC and reconnecting it once I have started
 FSX, the problem doesn't happen. Sometimes. Currently flying without using the trim wheel :-( .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Win10 issues have come to light since my last report:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender ('WD'): twice in the last couple of days, WD has stopped working. There has been no error message or warning that I am not protected. I have only noticed it when I go into WD to scan a downloaded file (why is there no option to do this on
 the right mouse click menu any more?). This is a serious problem and leads me to think that I should ditch WD and move to a more reliable AV program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get Office: What is this annoying program? I am not using it, yet it keeps stopping according to messages in the reliability monitor. Searching for a solution to the error produces no answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power and Sleep settings: One of the first things that I did after installing Win10 was to request that my monitors are switched off and the box put to sleep after a certain length of time. I thought that this would have been one of the setting that was
 migrated in the upgrade. Power and Sleep did not happen until a couple of days ago, when it worked as I had set it up - for a day. Now nothing happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows crashes: Nearly every day, I return to my PC to find that it has rebooted for no reason. My reliability score doesn't move off 1 and I have had critical issues occur every day. I realise that this was a free upgrade, but is this a case of Microsoft
 putting a product into general distribution for mass fault testing? If I had wanted to do this, I would have signed up for the beta testing programme.</p>

<p>b) you can find/download the necessary Driver as it's unlikely to be Plug-and-Play. Windows Device Manager (Scan for Hardware Changes) should be able to assist the setup once the Drive has been attached.</p>

            <p>This is a real mess. The store PC uses a 3.5 inch drive. The original business software is on a 5.25 inch floppy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to install the program on a newer machine via the 5.25 floppy and then copy all of the files on 3.25 disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to locate a 5.25 USB drive to initiate the installing of the old&nbsp; program, which is another potential problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wont get paid for my time if it doesn't work.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Start and Modern UI apps not working in Windows 10 November Refresh &#40;th2&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I recently upgraded my Surface Pro to the latest version of Windows 10, only to find that Start, Cortana and universal apps are not working (with the exception of PC Settings). I thought this may have something to do with my antivirus, so uninstalled
 it but still no luck. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then decided just to ditch everything in a desperate attempt to get it working and installed a clean copy using the media creation tool only to find that the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) crashes every time and restarts my surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed a clean copy of Windows 10 10240/th1 and tried to upgrade to&nbsp;th2, but again found that start was not working again, so rolled back to th1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now exhausted all options I can think of and are stuck with th1. Is the Surface Pro just not compatible with the November Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated, as this has completely thrown me and quite frankly wasted a lot of my weekend :/.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks! :D,</p>
<p>Ryan.</p>

            Finally found the issue, it was somehow caused by BitLocker (possibly due to a new type of encryption introduced in Windows 10 1511). The start menu and Cortana started working after decrypting my drive and creating a new user.

<h2>            Look everywhere but no solutions&#33; Network&#47;internet is very good but 1 red bar in game&#33; Fully detailed situation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am kinda new to the forums because I don't really have anything to say. Now, I have a problem and I need some help so I am posting on the forums.
</p>
<p>First, I have searched and tried every solutions I can find but nothing works!
</p>
<p>Basically, my problem is my internet connection is good, everything is working fine but I have only 1 bar in a MP match! It lags so much! I played MW2 and BO. It is very annoying and frustrating and this has gone on for days. I tried setting up a static
 IP, reset the router/xbox, everything but nothing works.&nbsp; My NAT is open. 4 bar connection, and yet, 1 bar in game. So frustrating! Just to let you know, I have to have a wireless connection because I don't have an ethernet cable for my xbox. And my xbox is
 in another room so I don't have a long wire. Please don't tell me to get one. I live in Canada and Rogers is my ISP. I hate it but I have to live with it. I have Linksys WRT160N version 3. I tried so many things like enable/disable UPNP, tried dmz, Qos, nothing
 works! Changed the network type like mixed, or wireless-g only, nothing works! I changed the MTU many times even to the value of 1364 and nothing.</p>
<p>I bought xbox live gold for 3 months and now, I can't even play, I am wasting time! I don't make money at all, I am only using money from grants and loans. Hope this issue is resolved because I don't want to waste my gold! And I want to play online! I never
 played the xbox before and now it is my first time and first time playing online!
</p>
<p>Below is using the format.</p>
<p><b>What Country/State/Province do you live in? Ontario, Canada<br />
Modem brand &amp; model number:&nbsp; Scientific Atlanta - from Rogers<br />
Router brand &amp; model number:&nbsp; Linksys WRT160N version 3<br />
Network Connection Type: Wireless<br />
If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using? Tried many kinds, using WEP at the moment<br />
Things you have tried: <br />
Is UPnP Enabled? Tried it on and off.<br />
Is NAT Type Open? Yes, NAT is open.<br />
Any Error Codes you encounter: No errors.<br />
What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G? I have cable.&nbsp; 17.14 mbps. About 1-2 mb/s, it's fast.<br />
Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? Rogers. I hate Rogers and no, I can't switch ISP.<br />
When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen? No error messages, everything works fine.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Please help! I need this fixed. I don't know what to do anymore!<br />
</b></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem could be in a few places, the first thing I'd do is look at your wireless. And the easiest way to find out if its your wireless set-up is to go wired. I know you said you don't have a cable to do that, but what about as a test is it possible
 to go wired? If the problem goes away when wired we know where to look next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or&nbsp; you can go straight to changing your wireless setup. I would recommend changing channels as per the Tips for improving wireless here:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, it's not possible. My xbox is in another room and I don't have a long wire. I don't think I can do a test. Oh yeh, my xbox wireless adapter is wireless G. This adapter has worked in the past.</p>
<p>I guess I can try changing the channels again. Thanks, but more help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Well.. try changing the channels first <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-5.gif" /> and if one channel doesn't work any better try another one. Changing channels can work wonders, but if you don't want to take the advice, its up
 to you of course.</p>

<p>I never said I won't. I am trying it now and also changing the wireless type mixed, bg-mix, wireless-g only, wireless-n only, wireless-b only. I have like 11 channels, I will try some of them. I will get back to you on this.</p>

<p>Ok, I fixed it! &nbsp;I just changed my network mode and channel width and it worked! It didn't work before but now it worked. Rather strange but it's fixed!
</p>
<p>Here is the setting:</p>
<p>Network mode: Mixed</p>
<p>Channel width: auto(20mhz or 40mhz)</p>
<p>Channel: auto</p>
<p>upnp: on </p>
<p>MTU: 1364</p>
<p>Ports forwarded as well. Single port, just the 4 ports.</p>
<p>This setting may help out others.</p>
<p>Well thanks. If you didn't tell me to try changing the channels, I would never have thought to do it. Thanks! It definitely answers my question. Now I have a 4 bar connection and 4 bars in game. Thank you!</p>
<p>If I have more problems, I will post here!</p>
<p>Thank you again! :D </p>

<h3> gann54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Destination Directory</h2>
                    Trying to download Hoyle Puzzle and Board games. A window pops up saying the destination directory doesn't exist. Do you want it to be created. Click yes and it downloads and it will come on the screen. When I exit the game there is no icon on my desktop
 so I can go back to it. Click no and nothing happens. I will go to my programs and&nbsp;it will be there. All my updates are to date. I have&nbsp;Windows Vista. HELP!&nbsp;

<p>Hi gann54,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for using answers.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The download destination directory it creates;<span>&nbsp;
</span>would you let us know the path it shows it is creating it to in the forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you can take note of the path it is creating it to, such like; <span style="font-weight: bold">
<span>&nbsp;</span>C:\Windows\Downloaded Programs\Hoyle Puzzles</span> then you can find where the download is by using Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above path is where the game, when you download it, shows it is creating the directory then the way to go back to it would be</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>C:\Windows\Downloaded Programs\Hoyle Puzzles</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows Key and Hit the letter E - it should bring up Windows Explorer</span>
</li><li><span>Click the C:\
</span></li><li><span>Click the Windows folder underneath it find the Downloaded Programs folder Click on it.</span>
</li><li><span>You should see the program Hoyle Puzzles</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember this is just a for instance, after you attempt the next download and directory create of the game you should get the file path it is downloading to and should be able to follow
 it through similar to above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when you locate where the program is---say in our instance in the Downloaded Programs folder you can right click the program and select CREATE SHORTCUT and send to Desktop.---this
 way a shortcut icon for the game will be on your desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the information you are looking for.</p>
<p><br />
Please let us know of further assistance we may provide.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Setting your network type to <strong>Private </strong>is helpful if you only want to let your trusted users to connect to it. The easiest to change your network type is by changing it through the registry. You can refer to the steps shared by
<strong>mds99 </strong>on <strong>April 2, 2015</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_web/any-way-to-change-network-from-public-to-private/6ca4a5ff-e692-465f-b6e2-b5abfaeecf43">
thread</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:&nbsp;</strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more
 information about how to&nbsp;back up&nbsp;and restore the registry, refer to this Microsoft Knowledge Base

            I as well am having much the same problem. I have even tried restoring my PC to a precious date. But when I do that it comes up with the error, (windows was unable to complete restoration) and when I try opening certain places like control panel the screen
 freezes and I have to refresh home with ctrl+alt+del and open task manager. I tried going the bios to restore my computer by starting my disk&nbsp; drive first and found that instead of opening bios esc opened something calls docc. My main loading screen when the
 computer is first turned on now says that F12 opens bios, but when I try that it again takes me to docc with the option of pressing F12 for bios again, when I do this it requires a password which has never occurred beforehand. These ways are all of the known
 fixes to Audio. The option to refresh audio through "manage devices" says that the Audio button is a duplicate. and every 3 days I have to open command prompt as an administrator and reset my browser then restart&nbsp; my compute

<h2>            New Remote Desktop in Windows 10 won&#39;t allow me to print or see my drives from the remote connection</h2>
                    <p>i attempted to use the REMOTE DESKTOP application that comes with Windows 10.&nbsp; Version 10.1.893.0.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is the one with the Red desktop Icon.&nbsp; I see nowhere that i can set up to use "Easy Print" or any printers actually.&nbsp; Nor can i set up any LOCAL RESOURCES such as is with the older version of Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody point me to those features in the NEW REMOTE DESKTOP application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you in advance,</p>

<h2>            Publisher not printing Wingding</h2>
                    <p>Publisher will not print wingding characters even though it has before.&nbsp; Also, text boxes in Publisher are showing up completely black (never did before.)&nbsp; I had an update to my computer, then the problems started.&nbsp; I uninstalled the updates thinking this
 would solve my problem, but it didn't work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wingding Regular, 2 &amp; 3 are all in my font list.</p>
<p>The characters print just fine in PDF form, as do the text boxes.</p>

            Hi Alison!
<br />
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, an independent advisorr, and I am glad to assist you today. 
<br />
<br />Regardless of whether you always use fonts or not, they all load whenever you start Windows. Additionally, many types of applications access and load fonts when you start them. Word processors, editing programs and desktop publishing applications load all of your system fonts including the Wingdings typeface. Being accessed so much, fonts are easy targets for data corruption, and the Wingdings font may become corrupt or damaged even if you never used it previously. If your system does have a corrupt Wingdings font, you can reinstall it in the Appearance and Personalization section of the Windows Control Panel. Look for the Fonts link, then highlight and uninstall the Wingdings font. After you uninstall the font, you can use the same Fonts utility to reinstall the Wingdings typeface.
<br />
<br />In the Devices and Printers window, right-click the printer device name to open the Properties window. On the Advanced tab of the Properties window, you can click the “More Options” button to access the Fonts settings. Try enabling or disabling the “Print as Graphics” and Substitute Printer Fonts” options to see if that improves the printing of the Wingdings font.
<br />
<br />Could you please tell me if it works?
<br />
<br />There is one more thing to note: If you've tried everything else still can't get the Wingdings font to print properly, the problem may not be with the printer at all, but rather with the source document. If you're relatively sure your printer settings are correct and you're not having any other printer problems, try creating a new document with only a few lines of Wingdings font characters and then try to print it. If you're able to print the new document, there is a good chance that the source document may be corrupt or have formatting errors. If the original document is corrupt, you can recreate it or try saving the data by copying and pasting it into a new document.

            Do you have (or did you have) a version of Network Magic installed?&nbsp; Generally, the complete message would be:<br />
<br />
The Pure Networks Platform Service must be running in order for Network Magic to function. If you have manually shut down or disabled the Pure Network Platform service, restart it now.<br />

See this FAQ:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.purenetworks.com/support/faq/195.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.purenetworks.com/support/faq/195.html</a>&nbsp; (the site may be quite slow to load)<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Windows Installer Cleanup Utility is no longer available from Microsoft, apparently because it sometimes removed more than it was supposed to.&nbsp; You can still get it, however, here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html</a><br />
<br />
If you use the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility, make a Restore Point first (or back up the registry using
<a href="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Erunt</a>).<br />
<br />
If you feel uncomfortable using the ICU, download and use <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free Revo Uninstaller</a> to uninstall the same applications listed in the FAQ<br />
<br />
Personally, I would skip Step 3 "Download Network Magic."&nbsp; There really is no need for this application and, as you have seen, it can cause problems.<br />

<p>You can only have a profile on 1 xbox at a time. So you would have to either recover it or use the flash drive which would be easiest.</p>
<p>Once you move your profile over to the flash drive, all you have to do is plug it in and you can sign into the profile like normal.</p>

<p>I have 2 XBox'es too. I recently downloaded some map pacs for Left 4 Dead 2.</p>
<p>I would like to download them for the other XBox so We can play system link on them.</p>
<p>Will I have to start a second LIVE account to do this? It shows I have purchased them when I search games on live's website.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to unzip&#47;zip using something in windows 10, not winzip or some other app&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Please</strong> <strong>is it possible to zip and unzip files using something I already have in Windows 10? If so, where is it? If not - why not?</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very confused! My computer defaults to win zip which now wants me to pay money, which
 I don't remember ever having to do before. Never do I see the option 'extract all' like it says it should on the 'how-to' pages of this microsoft website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually solve my problems fine by googling. I've found several posts saying there is something in Windows 10, and that I should be able to select 'File Explorer' to open zipped files but I cannot find this as an option; if I try to reset default
 program to open .zip files the only alternative it offers me is Firefox which appears to achieve nothing. I don't know how to find other alternatives already 'in the computer'.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unusually, I've no experience with&nbsp; choosing 'apps' for my computer (and have no mobile phone). I'm very worried about security, if I can get rid of one if I don't like it or understand it, what an asterisk means... I feel far too ignorant to risk a
 poor decision. </p>
<p>So I really hope there is something in windows 10 after all.</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

            <p>*If* the files are ZIP format: yes. &nbsp;Windows 10 can compress / decompress the ZIP format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/zip-and-unzip-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/zip-and-unzip-files</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that has, somehow, become broken in your Windows 10 (sounds like WinZip got installed?!) - you can fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First - UNINSTALL WinZip. &nbsp;You obviously do not want it.</p>
<p><a href="http://kb.winzip.com/kb/entry/110/#win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.winzip.com/kb/entry/110/#win10</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-click the Windows Start Button --&gt; Control Panel --&gt; Default Programs --&gt; Set your default programs --&gt; File Explorer --&gt; click on "Set this program as default" --&gt; OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want something better, with more 'power' and choices in what format it can compress / decompress? I highly suggest the latest

<h2>            how does camera on surface pro 3 compare to surface 2 &#40;ARM&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have yet to see someone compare the camera on the surface pro 3 to the surface 2 (arm / windows rt device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously surface 2 camera was improved but not then pro line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the new pro 3 camera that faces the user better than Surface 2? Same as surface 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Numbers reply don't mean as much to the consumer as examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like nearly every angle has been covered on various Surface Pro 3 reviews... Someone should do this comparison / tear down to see the differences inside and the differences in results btwn the devices.</p>

<p>

            <p>It is flush with the bezel.&nbsp; You use the kickstand and your angle goes off right along with it.&nbsp; I don't think anybody thought about that one but if you are using the front facing camera to do a Skype call, you will be looking down at the screen anyway -
 so you will be in frame of the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is based on the pictures of the tablet.&nbsp; There are no real details on it other than the cameras where demonstrated for picture quality during the last conference and it was pretty sharp (picture quality).&nbsp; It does not self-adjust lighting like what
 the iPad Air does when taking a picture though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think there will be a complaint with the cameras.&nbsp; Just be aware on how you shoot and practice with it when you get one.&nbsp; I am definitely getting one myself and will be doing the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get it, charge up the tablet and take it out for a 'road trip'.&nbsp; Do some practice shoots with both cameras (both still and video).&nbsp; Learn what limitations you would have and work with that.&nbsp; You do and you will have no problem in future use.</p>

            <p>Yea, should get a good shot of his kneecaps. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, there is no angle setting to the cameras. &nbsp;With the kickstand extended to full, that tablet almost lies flush with the surface. &nbsp;When they demoed the tablet at the conference, all the speaker
 did was just walk around with it and did not extend the kickstand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The picture quality was pretty good but the cameras should be the same as wheat came with the Surface 2. &nbsp;LIke I mentioned before and is the same rule with any digital camera is that you just charge it up, walk around with it and practice with it. &nbsp;Once
 you learn what limitations there are with it, then you know how to work with it when putting it to real use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For picture quality, I have a 14 megapixel camera and I have compared shots with it and my iPad which have 5 megapixel cameras and couldn't tell the difference in quality. &nbsp;The new cameras in the Surface tablets should be the same in quality but viewing
 angle; you can only go by what pictures they have of the tablet right now for reference or just wait for the tablets to start showing up after June 20th. &nbsp;Originally, I was going to get the i3 model but may change my mind and get the i5 model since it comes
 available first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboards will be available at the same time as well and they are "type cover" and no "touch cover" models are available (in fact, I don't think they are going to make them). &nbsp;I haven't seen word on the other accessories such as the docking station but
 I will say that the Pen is going to be pretty good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>JOT ADDONIS has a pen almost exactly what is described for the Pro 3 models if you want to read about them. &nbsp;There is no digitizer in the tablet and the Pen uses Bluetooth for connection. &nbsp;You get the real Digital Ink with the features of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft just may have finally done it with cameras and other features this time. &nbsp;With past history, though, it will be "wait and see".</p>

            Additionally, I do recall at one time during the conference, the speaker did have the tablet sitting on the table with the kickstand at normal extension and the camera showed a level, forward shot. &nbsp;SO, the camera (on the back) may be angled 15 degrees
 UP. &nbsp;It was not mentioned but I do recall now of seeing that.

            <p>Well, the camera is exactly the same as what you have in the Surface 2.&nbsp; One exception; the screen resolution of the Pro 3 is going to be higher.&nbsp; You will see a crisper, clearer picture than what you got on the Surface 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the glass on the tablet; it 'may' be the newer "HIB" Gorilla Glass from Corning.&nbsp; It is thinner but more robust to eliminate cracking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keynote video showing it in action is no longer available at Softpedia.com but you may be able to find it at ZDNet or CNet.&nbsp; It showed all the features and the camera in action.&nbsp; I do remember the speaker placing the tablet down on a table with the kickstand
 out in normal position and the video on the screen was level to what the back camera was showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machines are going to be shipping out on the 20th (i5 model) and everybody will know for sure soon after when they get them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key point about the tablets is that they have to work!&nbsp; No exception this time.</p>

            <p>If nothing else works enter bios (see manual proably f8 or del key at boot) and select Load default bios, save changes on exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, Enter bios, set 1st boot device to cd-rom/dvd , save on exit. Then put the Windows 10 install dvd in and select repair.</p>
