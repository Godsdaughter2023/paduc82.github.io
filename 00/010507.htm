<h2>            &#34;Download Video&#34; no longer shows using Real Player since I installed Windows 7</h2>
                    "Download Video" no longer shows using Real Player since I installed Windows 7. I've searched Real Player help but all it says is "to download videos click on the 'Download Video' pop-up that appears in the video as it is playing in your browser."<br />
<br />
Of course, if the 'download video' pop-up <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
does not appear</span>....then what? No answer in Real&nbsp; Player help.<br />
<br />
It was working fine before I upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 and of course I also&nbsp; upgraded to IE 8 and that may have something to do with it as well. Who knows.<br />
<br />
It's getting so you have to be a computer expert just to use everyday programs.

<p>Hi semana,</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; What is the version of Real player you are using?</p>
<p>My first suggestion would be to update the Real player to the latest version and then follow the steps below to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Start RealPlayer 11.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; On the top, click "Tools"</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Then click "Check for Updates"</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; Follow the instructions to install the Critical Updates.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; After that the "Download this video" button should reappear when you watch videos with IE8.</p>
<p>Let me know if the information was helpful or for further assistance.</p>

            I did all of this but to no avail. I'm using Real Player SP with a long list of updates. I've selected "All" of the updates and installed them.<br />
<br />
Before updating to W7 I used to download lots of videos in this way. Below is a question I posted on this Forum about the same time as the Real Player issue. I wonder if they are related problems. My hyperlinks don't work even though I have IE8 as the default
 browser.<br />

Which version of W7?&nbsp; E.g. does RP support X64?&nbsp; Does Default Programs (e.g. via Start menu or Control Panel) show you whether RP is listed there and allowed to use all its protocols and filetypes?

    <title>Gmail Account Syncing on Lumia 920 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glenschulz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gmail Account Syncing on Lumia 920</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Lumia 920 for a year now, syncing with my gmail account with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of this morning, it is failing to sync with gmail, giving me Error code: 85010017</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in Canada, on Rogers network.&nbsp; Yesterday (Oct 9) apparently Rogers had system-wide outages, but the problems have apparently been fixed, and I am not experiencing any other sync issues on my 920 with my other email accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked the status of Google's services, and although it doesn't directly list m.google.com, it appears that all Google services are up and running fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried rebooting my phone a few times, to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody else experiencing (or have experienced) issues like this, or how to solve it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Glen.</p>

            <p>Margins are a section property. In order to have different margins, the page will have to be a separate section. When you select "This point forward," Word inserts a section break for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often you don't actually need different <strong>margins</strong> (and hence a separate section) for a single page. If it's the side margins you need to change, you can accomplish this with paragraph indents (positive or negative). To increase top and bottom
 margins, you can add empty paragraphs. But of course if you need to make the top and/or bottom margin
<strong>smaller</strong>, then you will need a separate section.</p>

    <title>&#34;Successful Sign-in&#39;s&#34; on my Outlook recent activity page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anxioususer2019  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Successful Sign-in&#39;s&#34; on my Outlook recent activity page from Internet Explorer, which i dont use.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Be prepared for a long read.<br />
</p>
<p>So, the last few days i was hit by the email scam where they say they've recorded videos of you through your webcam without you knowing, and that they have access to my computer using a remote administrative tool, using a really old password from a leaked
 data breach, asking for bitcoin payment, etc etc... I took it seriously at first, (before doing research online) and took extra precautions to try and secure my account. I already have a Mobile Authentication app, and have it set up so that i get alerts on
 my mobile device for suspicious activity. I also removed all trusted devices, and as of today, changed my password. (i didnt think they had access to my current password, but im not too sure after looking at my recent acivity page today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also, have been getting "Unsuccessful syncs" from all over the world, but know that it is not a problem since i have 2 factor authentication, no trusted devices, and a new password. But to be on the safe side, i removed outlook from my mobile device and
 asked the microsoft privacy team if they could give me the recent activity data for the last couple of months so i could see just how many of them there were and if any were actually successful (I dont check on my recent activity unless i feel like my security
 is in danger).</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These have me on edge, but they are not what im writing to you today about. So here's my problem:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I use Google chrome as my default browser and my recent activity page shows that someone is "Successfully Signing In" in from the same IP adress, from the same location, through my primary alias, but using Internet Explorer as the browser. I do not use Internet
 Explorer. However, under the session activity, there are just a bunch of "Additional verification requested", with one such case actually saying "Successful sign-in". This has me worried again, that someone might have access to my computer or email, and is
 finding a way around my security measures. Sometimes, these Internet Explorer Successful sign-ins (that only request verification) are just a couple minutes before i log in myself, or during one of my current sessions in which i was looking into this matter.
 This makes me think it might just be something that happens when i log into my computer or when i have to put my password in on a microsoft site now that i have added all these extra security measures. But better safe than sorry. I have run a full scan of
 my computer as well as uninstalled Internet Explorer today, but it didnt not make the problem go away once i restarted my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cef866c-47ee-4ad9-8928-74d41ae14f82?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cef866c-47ee-4ad9-8928-74d41ae14f82?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Are these Internet Explorer Sign-ins something i should be worried about? And if so, what else could i possibly do besides resetting my computer to factory settings?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

            Hi Anxious,
<br />Do you use Outlook desktop software or another email client too? Any Chrome extensions that could be using the account data? 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />from the same IP address, from the same location, through my primary alias
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />This is from your own IP address? It's probably nothing, but if you haven't already ran malwarebytes, do so to rule out an infected computer. 
<br />
<br />There isn't much else you can do since you have 2-factor enabled.

<p>Hi Diane, thanks for the quick response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Outlook desktop, or have any other email service. I used to have Outlook on my mobile device but removed it 3 days ago when i noticed the Unsuccessful Sync attempts from all over the world. The only way I have accessed my account during this
 problem has been through Chrome.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Like in the original post, I have run a full diagnostic scan of my computer, which turned up nothing.<br />
<br />
For Chrome Extensions, i have 5. They are:<br />
-Docs (Chrome Ext)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Sheets (Chrome Ext)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Slides (Chrome Ext)&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
-Google Docs Offline&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Video Adblocker For Youtube Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont think any of those actually collect user data, but i dont actually know.<br />
However, my problem has not gone away, and as of looking at my recent activity upon waking up, noticed that there was an additional Successful Sign in from internet explorer.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d23ee832-c737-4ce1-9a23-f46599d3a8c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d23ee832-c737-4ce1-9a23-f46599d3a8c3?upload=true" /></a><br />
Im starting to think this is happening when microsoft asks me to verify my identity when trying to access my accounts sensitive info, (which i was doing a lot of while trying to increase my account security) or just trying to login to a microsoft website besides
 from the hotmail-outlook page (Such as this forums page). I made a quick edit to the original post last night, (after i had logged out of my outlook account) which required me to login and verify it was me. Which would explain why this last internet explorer
 had a Successful Sign-in.<br />
<br />
I agree that there isnt much else i can do at this point, But would still like someone from the microsoft team or another very knowledgable person to assure me that this isnt a problem, and explain to me why it shows Internet Explorer when i am only signing
 in and verifying my account through the Google Chrome Browser.</p>

When in USB mode, you will see the icon.

    <title>Mail merge from Publisher 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonyaprior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge from Publisher 2010</h2>
                    I spoke to Support microsoft who forwarded me to here.&nbsp; I have just bought Publisher 2010 and installed when I go to mail merge it is saying I need to configure to Outlook 2010 to be able to mail merge.&nbsp; We have Outlook 2007 and no where on the Publisher
 2010 box does it say Outlook 2010 is required.&nbsp; Customer support told me there is a way around this if I jump on this page and ask the question.

            <p>Unfortunately you do need to use the same version of Outlook as Publisher to directly integrate them...and no that fact is&nbsp;hard to find.&nbsp;Aternatively you can export from Outlook and create your data source in Excel and then do your mail merge.</p>

<h2>            Insider Preview license shows  &#34;Windows User&#34; or a non-MS account in winver search</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just did a winver search to verify build number and saw that the Windows 10 Insider Preview license is not issued to my Microsoft Insider account, although I was accessing through that account. (I set up multiple user accounts.) I want to stay on as an
 Insider past 7/29, but keep my W8.1 on my dual boot system for now. Is my Insider license in jeopardy by not showing the MS account?</p>

            <p>Thank you for you assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Insider 10 (dual booting) on 3 computers at different times with a the same 3 accounts, both MS accounts being registered Insiders : one live.com, one hotmail.com, and a non-MS acct, call it ZeeAccount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the HP from all 3 accounts, winver shows licensed to the Insider live.com acct.</p>
<p>On the Toshiba from all 3 accounts, winver shows licensed to "Windows User"</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;Acer&nbsp;from all 3 accounts, winver shows licensed to ZeeAccount</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info that may matter: I do not remember which was the original acct activated on any of the machines, but the live account was registered Insider for some time before the hotmail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that the Acer and Toshiba were installed from earlier builds and updated more than once. I setup the HP from the last iso build before 10240 during that interim when new insiders were on hold. It took a few days, but it did update to10240 before
 the 29th.</p>

On the other hand it also does seem that version 8.x does not work with UC handset. We have a couple of different brands (Plantronics and Jabra) and none of them is usable. The device is listed as available mic and speaker, but then no audio is coming in or
 out</p>

    <title>Hotkeys for Skype and others - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> felipe ambrosio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotkeys for Skype and others</h2>
                    <p>Some people (have to) use Skype every day for work. Apparently, these people are better testers than Microsoft's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the purpose of a hotkey to switch between dark and light mode? I mean, hotkeys exist to make constant tasks faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you set hotkeys for sharing screen, sharing audio, switching camera, opening chat and focusing on the chat box, ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously though, how many minutes would it take for a developer to implement these simple things and release an update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us go further - imagine automatically sharing the screen once you open a specific app, like the Whiteboard or an Office app, as well as ending sharing once the user returns to the Skype window. Also, imagine my contact being able to see me and the screen
 at the same time. How awesome would it be to have these features on Skype like every videoconferencing app has had since 2005?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not go even further - imagine a Skype with native support to chroma key and background replacement (for selected cameras), automatic microphone silencing and noise cancelling, video filters...</p>

From Office 365 Admin Center -&gt; Settings -&gt; Services and Add-ins -&gt; Office 365 groups, I want to get the list of settings available under the Office 365 Groups using POWERSHELL cmdlets. Like, I want to see Whether Guest Access to Office 365 Groups are On, Off,

</p>
<p>I am not sure whether these commands would get me the information I want to retrieve or not. Please Help.</p>

    <title>Alignment tabs in Word 2011 Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark mcdermott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alignment tabs in Word 2011 Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hey, all; long-winded question follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my freelance project to create a Word to PDF form, which the client wants resized to different viewers, I have had some success by setting up form fields in individual one-row tables whose width is 100% of the margin. I've already learned to my disappointment
 that Word form field will not be picked up by Acrobat's form generator, so I'm back to using blank lines following the question, in the form of underlined tab characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I want to resize page widths quickly as possible, I find the process slowed up by having to reset tabs for these underscores, and wishing for a Right Indent Tab option like InDesign uses, which pushes text to the right margin no matter where it's set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of forum searches informs me that an alignment tab setting available, but none of the methods for accessing it is available on Office365 Mac. BUT, the first header/footer template is a three-column sample with "Type text" fields that stays left-center-right
 regardless of where I move the tabs in the formatting ruler. I was able to copy this line to my form fields and could indeed &nbsp;follow the text with an underline leader that stays within the table cell no matter how it resizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But is there any way to access the formatting for this footer text to adjust the alignment tabs, or apply them to regular text style sheets. I cannot edit the placeholder text like I can with a field. Is there some hidden XML that's controlling this behavior
 (and will it fall apart if I have to "downsave" the file in the older ".doc" format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for previous helpful suggestions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

            <p>What about using a three-cell table, with the leftmost cell left-aligned, the middle cell center-aligned and the rightmost cell right-aligned? The gray lines below are boundaries (<em>Table &gt; Gridlines</em>)&nbsp;and don't print.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/274a0856-ca69-4986-8f78-473f431ec14f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also redimension the table and the text will stay formatted:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dad9911-471c-402a-9be2-1235a171867d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how your sample text will behave using longer text, but in Word the text wraps within each cell:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddfa735c-2ecf-49f5-850a-f90e80490ac9" /></p>
<p>In addition, tables readily convert to tabbed text or separate paragraphs (<em>Table &gt; Convert</em>) and vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For format control, you would use <em>Table &gt; AutoFit and Distribute </em>and <em>
Table &gt; Table properties.</em></p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia X2 00 phone for over a year. I love this phone especially when taking pictures. But now it is showing a virus infection sign. I have tried every way I know to eliminate the virus that is slowing down my phone especially when taking pictures
 and saving to memory card. Is there any means to scan the phone or any antivirus application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I await your prompt response.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>In addition to farby's post above you can try this- Switch off the phone - remove the memory card - connect it to a PC via a card reader - take a complete backup of card contents. Now open its properties by right clicking on the card in Windows explorer
 - Tools - Check the drive for errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also for device slowing down you can take the following actions-<br />
1. Clear the browser cache.<br />
2. Move the content from the phone memory to the memory card.<br />
3. Take a backup of all the messages using Nokia suite &amp; delete the excess so that you can free up some memory. In future do not let the message count to go beyond 500 so the phone functions remain smooth.<br />
4. Try using a theme that is smaller in size. The larger the theme size the slower the device becomes.<br />
5. If still the problem persists you can reinstall the current firmware using Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For firrmware reinstallation -</p>
<p>Connect your phone to a computer &amp; select Nokia Suite mode. If you do not have Nokia Suite on your pc you can download it from
<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Now open the Nokia Suite &amp; click on the “green icon of arrow pointing downwards”.</p>
<p>If any updates are available they will be shown in ‘green’. If not you may reinstall the current version. Reinstall option is shown in ‘blue’. If no option to reinstall is shown, please wait for sometime it will become visible. &nbsp;Then the Nokia Suite will
 download the new software version of the phone. After it you will be prompted to take a complete back up of the device content. Please
<strong><u>do not skip</u></strong> this step as reinstallation will erase all the personal data from the phone like contacts, messages, calendar entries etc.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have set a memory card password &amp; you have forgotten its code then take a backup of the card data also as the card will be locked after update and can only be unlocked if you enter the correct code or by ways mentioned in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/8585FFB1-9990-4929-B9ED-0FAFE0367E6D">
this thread</a>.</p>
<p>Also note that while updating the device ensure the following things-</p>
<ol>
<li>The device is full charged.</li><li>The internet connection Is of good speed &amp; has a backup in case of power loss.</li><li>The PC should also be connected to back up power source as if the process is interrupted the phone may go dead. More on update failure &amp; its remedies
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/CBAC00CC-7651-4DCF-8B11-8A6E5DC30D4E">
here</a>.</li><li>Please do not run any resource intensive programs in the background while updating as it may freeze the PC which in turn will lead to a dead device.</li><li>Ignore all the windows pop-up notifications about device being disconnected.<strong><u>DO NOT DISCONNECT THE PHONE UNTIL UPDATE IS COMPLETED.</u></strong></li><li>It will be better if you disable security keyguard &amp; PIN code request before proceeding with Update/Reinstallation.</li><li>Sometimes the device may show Test Mode.

    <title>Biggest Nokia 5530 problem on the board - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Biggest Nokia 5530 problem on the board</h2>
                    <span>I bought my 5530 yesterday and I can easily say this is the worst experience I've ever had with a phone. I've used one before, and it's nothing like this. Let me just line up the issues and see if anyone can pinpoint a solution. (2.0 fw version)<br />
                    <span>I bought my 5530 yesterday and I can easily say this is the worst experience I've ever had with a phone. I've used one before, and it's nothing like this. Let me just line up the issues and see if anyone can pinpoint a solution. (2.0 fw version)<br />
<br />
Issues:<br />
<br />
Display off on startup. You can hear it start, you can see the call buttons light up, but the screen refuses to turn on. I have to randomly lock and unlock it and then click the media button to see the screen.<br />
<br />
It's extremely slow. It does a side wipe just to get to each menu. The pop up bars frequently get stuck as well.<br />
<br />
I have the same call issue as a lot of people.<br />
<br />
I get some notification about the memory even though it's a nokia memory card.<br />
<br />
I really hope it's a software issue, because I don't want to send my phone to a North American dealership especially since I bought it in Kuwait.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</span>

            I think it needs a hard reset, but my phone doesn't do a hard reset. It's a 5530 and I can't see the start up. It's going a little faster today, but it still sucks.

<p>I am in the same boat . I asked for an iPhone for xmas , or a Blackberry , or anything to replace my&nbsp; broken sony ericsson and palm pilot . Unfortunately I was given a 5530 Xpress Music . WARNING ..... DO NOT , under ANY circumstnces buy this phone .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 4 miserable days struggling with the useless interface and finding there are NO APPS online other than&nbsp; a torch, and 3 stupid games on it ,&nbsp; I tried to re-set it in order to get rid of it to a 12 year old who lives on Facebook , the only user this
 phone is made for .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT , having connected to the server all by it's self , and used my months' credit up downloading e mails , I can't delete the e-mail headers from the phone . The hard re-set doesn't do it .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone give me advice on HOW I DELETE E MAIL HEADERS FROM THE PHONE&nbsp; please , WITHOUT deleting them from my server ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been given yet another nokia , this time a slide , and it is just as bad , but it does ring ,and I can answer calls , and send texts . I cant't actually make calls because the 5530 used all my credit up , so I use the free credit from the slide on
 my old Brick phone&nbsp; .............. hence my login name !&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't know if you're some kind of idiot or something, but the 5530 is a great phone for its money. Why don't you try a firmware update. I have that phone from over a month and i don't have any problems with it. After the new firmware update to v20 it actually
 became faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also strugled with your e-mail problem. I think the only way to fix this is to delete the messages from the phone and server or just don't check your e-mail from your phone. I preffer visiting googlemail from the browser instead of using the integrated
 e-mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And about your month credit: the first thing you have to do is to set up the connection settings. Delete all settings for GPRS internet. That way the phone will use just Wi-Fi if there is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also there are lots of applications for the phone. You just don't know where to look. If you are interested, send me PM, i'll tell you some sites for applications.</p>

            Merci Kris , great value as you can't use the software that is sold with the nthing , you can't connect using the useless web browser , and being and idiot&nbsp; I just love to spend my time searching for "Donkey Kong" to play on a 2.5 " screen . Thanks very
 much but I'm NOT intersted in this piece of useless **bleep** at all . My Family and the salesman agreed it was not of any use to anyone over the mental age of 12 and have given me anpther bloody Nokia slider phone . I had already decided NOT to set up any
 Nokia software as I have read the forum , and most owners of Nokia phones advise against it . When the contract expires I will be getting an iPhone for sure . Thanks for your response , and Happy phoning ...... eventually MDR

<p>I suggest you charge the battery. Don't risk it&nbsp; using an uncharged battery !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pissedoff&nbsp; : I didn't mean to call you an idiot for a reason. But i just get very annoied when someone doesn;t want to understand that you can;t expect from a phone like 5530 ( which
 is a budget phone ) to perform like a high end phone like N97. For its money 5530is just great. You get a Symbian 9.4 based phone, big touch screen, Wi-Fi and XpressMusic functionallity.I don't deny that it HAS its problems like every normal smartphone, if
 you haven't had a smartphone before i know whats the feeling. This is my first smartphone and the first time i was very confuced, but in time you will get used to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And something very important: if you want just a PHONE, 5530 is not your choise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;A poster named poizn and I already had a similar argument. He was raving about the 5530 being stupid and the iphone can do this and that. The simple answer to the question is that its cheap and marketed for kids about 12-16 years old. If you're not in that
 age group and buys this phone and expect it to perform like an iphone, YOU REALLY ARE AND IDIOT IMO (unless you cant afford anything else). FOR THE PRICE ITS A GREAT PHONE, and the bugs are standard for all symbian phones upon release, if you buy a symbian
 phone less than 6mos old expect these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The best comparison is that you bought a toyota vios (5530) and expected it to race and compete agains a Porsche 311 (Iphone, Omnia HD, etc).

<p>Downloaded the free OneNote 2013 a few days ago. Now experiencing the same problem. "Checked" Microsoft OneNote and chose uninstall, nothing. Followed directions given through a knowledge based article, nice to know about it, but no change. Took the chance
 and restarted my machine, no change.&nbsp; The problem seemed to happen in stages. At first, I had to reenter password, then message said account and software package did not match, go to Control Panel and repair; there is no option to "repair" associated with
 OneNote 2013. Now limbo. OneNote 2013 is a very good piece of software and maybe could be great. Please come up with a solution, want to use it on this computer which runs 8.1. Thanks</p>

            OK, I haven't posted in a long time, but I was able to get a third-party uninstaller and managed to force install OneNote 2014. &nbsp;Not sure if or when I will re-install it, since OneNote 2014 would be interesting to have. &nbsp;Shame that this problem exists
 for OneNote 2014 standalone with a paid version of Office 2010

    <title>HTC 8X Still Bricked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chesspin1  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTC 8X Still Bricked</h2>
                    <p>It's been around a month since my HTC 8X Phone was bricked by an update. Microsoft has admitted there was a problem but thus far has been silent. Here's what I've tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows Device Recovery Tool cannot find the phone.</li><li>Nokia Repair Tool (I know it is HTC) won't detect the device.</li><li>Tried both repair tools on both Windows 7 and 10 machines.</li><li>Contacted HTC, got a runaround and a refusal to help because the phone is "out of warranty" and told me I bought the phone a year before I did (I saved the chat to show what BS they put me through and to remind myself never to buy their products again).</li><li>Took the phone to the Microsoft Store in Delaware. They couldn't figure it out.</li><li>I noticed the drivers that Windows loads on this varies between Unknown USB device and a "Qualcoom" device.</li></ul>
<p>I've seen other threads on this. People claim to have had successful resolutions. I've also seen people post ROMs where others have claimed to find things like "a Russian search engine" on it. I don't want a mystery ROM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 16 GB Unlocked device purchased in the USA. Can anyone, especially Microsoft, explain how to repair this device?</p>

            <p>Chesspin1: my 8X was bricked too from the <em>Windows Insider</em> WP10TP botched install, however a Recovery File was found by WDRT some weeks ago - that appeared to be carrier/model-specific. I know you are not alone in not receiving a Recovery File via
 WDRT, however I have 2 suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have seen some users report that WDRT kept saying no firmware was found on the server, but strange as it sounds, it was only after they changed USB ports and/or USB cables that one was found. If you've been using a USB3 port, try a USB2 port (and vice-versa,
 though it seems USB2 is more likely to work). Change cables, if possible, and try the different ports again. Plug directly into computer, don't use a USB hub.<br />
</li><li>There was an official acknowledgement on the Insider forums some time ago that Microsoft was working with mobile operators to get all the recovery files (that they had some already, and were working on getting others). I have seen lots of people post separately
 words to the effect of "I'm still waiting", but what I have not yet seen is one thread where anyone (whatever their phone) who is still waiting for their Recovery File can speak up, complete with specific details about their phone that might help Microsoft
 determine which recovery files they still need to obtain from the manufacturers.<br />
<br />
So my suggestion is to do that, to start a new thread in the<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update-insiderplat_phone?tab=Threads"> Insider Program-&gt;Preview-&gt;Update-&gt;Phone forum</a> titled something like "<em>Post
 here if you're still waiting for a WP8.1 Recovery File</em>", and state in it (and request others do the same) the following info:<br />
<br />
- <strong>Phone name and original carrier</strong>, ex: "HTC 8X, originally on Rogers"<br />
<strong>- Model ID, </strong>ex: "PM2330002"<br />
<em>.. this info is found on the 1st line on the bootloader screen (reached via holding VOL-UP AND VOL-DOWN during boot up)</em><br />
<strong>- CID (Carrier ID)</strong>, ex: "ROGER001"<br />
<em>.. the CID identifies what the phone's original carrier-branding was, and it seems the Recovery File your phone requires is specific to the CID.</em></li></ol>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Update on the situation: I gave the phone to a friend of mine who works in IT for a major hospital. He has a supply of higher-quality cables and decided to try it on a computer with no other applications and a USB 3.0 cable from Nvida. It worked immediately
 and rolled the phone back to Windows 8.1 using Microsoft's recovery tool. I'm once again using it as my primary phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a sidenote: I also recently had a Surface tablet brick after an error with a Windows 10 update. It couldn't boot from a USB device that was working on another computer so I exchanged it at the Microsoft store. I am now stopping all of my computers from
 upgrading from 7/8 to 10 at this point. Windows 10 seems to be rather problematic so I'm holding back for awhile until they get the bugs worked out later.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Publisher Ruler&#58; The inch is not an inch.</h2>
                    If I pull out an inch-ruler and compare it with the ruler in Publisher, the inch in Publisher does not equal the inch on the ruler. The zoom in Publisher is set at 100%. Is there a way to fix this?

            <p>While I could be wrong, I doubt that it can be fixed because the scale and ratio of digital display varies from one monitor to the next and it will also vary depending on your screen resolution settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the scale in Publisher - whether inches or centimeters - is reasonably accurate when the document is printed.<br />

</p><p>The game worked in previous build and I have reinstalled directx and graphics card drivers.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if this is related to the directx12 changes in 10041.</p>
