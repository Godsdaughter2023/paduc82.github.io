</span>Re:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nightmare experience with Microsoft Outlook 2016 and Microsoft support</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Dear Mr. Nadella:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I have had a nightmare experience with Microsoft. Your company’s prescribed methods for solving my problems have been ineffective and have only succeeded in torturing me. I am
 hoping that you can refer my problem to some member of your team who will fully, and finally, solve my problems.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Background.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I have used Microsoft products on my home computers for decades. Until a few weeks ago I had a Windows 7 PC with the Microsoft Office 2010 suite of applications. They worked fine.
 Unfortunately, the motherboard on my computer collapsed so I bought a new Windows 10 desktop PC from Dell, which was delivered to me around January 25. Through my employer’s Microsoft Home Use program, I bought Office Professional Plus 2016. I installed Office
 Professional within a day or two of the computer’s delivery (around January 26).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Immediately I ran into major problems with Microsoft Outlook, which continue to this day. Outlook had major trouble installing my gmail account. When I tried to use gmail, Outlook
 would get stuck in trying to synchronize files and would freeze if I tried to send messages. If I tried to use my Yahoo account, I had the same problems of freezing and hang-ups. Outlook would also freeze when I opened my contacts (which I had imported from
 the hard drive of my former computer).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I struggled with this situation for about 10 days. I noticed, when Googling for solutions, that there are many reported instances of consumers who had similar problems. I also
 hired a couple of tech consultants, who also spent hours without success in their efforts to get Outlook to work.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Consequently, I contacted the Microsoft support line (800-642-7676) (which I shall call the
<strong>Support Line</strong>) on February 5 for help. At this point my problems with Microsoft really compounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Numerous problems with Microsoft support.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Please let me give you a somewhat abridged day by day chronology of my experience with Microsoft support.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 5</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>3:03 p.m.</strong> [all times are Chicago time]: Via a phone transfer from Dell, I go to the Support Line.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>3:07 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker A picks up the line. Using a support service so that he can view my screen and operate my computer, he works on the computer for half an hour. He finally says he cannot fix my problem and will escalate it to level 2. He
 gives it <strong>case&nbsp;number&nbsp;1414421080. </strong>He tells me that someone from level 2 will call me between 10 a.m. and noon on February 6.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>3:44 p.m.</strong> call ends.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 6</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>10:26 a.m.</strong> Tech Worker B from Microsoft calls me. I give her my case number. Through a support service, she accesses my computer so that she can view my screen and work directly on the computer. (She says she is in New Delhi.)</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>12:24 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker B says that she cannot fix the problem. She will go back to the team to find a solution. She will call me back the next day (February 7) between 2 and 6 p.m.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 7</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I stay next to my phone the entire afternoon. No one calls.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 8</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>3 p.m.</strong> I stay close to my phone most of the day. I step away to use the restroom. While I am in the restroom, someone from Microsoft calls. I answer the phone just as she hangs up. She leaves a message saying that Microsoft will call me back
 on February 10 or 11 at 3:30 p.m.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>5:30 p.m.</strong> I call the Support Line, give my case number and explain that the proposed times for a call on February 10 and 11 conflict with my schedule. The person to whom I am speaking apologizes for Microsoft’s failure to call me at the agreed
 time on February 7. I am told that I can schedule a call for a day and time that are convenient. I ask for a call on February 12 between 3 and 4 p.m. This person confirms these times and sends me an email confirmation (which I retrieve using Microsoft’s competitor
 Mozilla Thunderbird) (copy attached).</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 12</span></span></p>

<ul>

<strong>3-4 p.m.</strong> No one calls.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>6:09 p.m.</strong> I call the Support Line and eventually talk with Tech Worker C, to whom I give my case number and to whom I describe the preceding events. He apologizes for the failure to call me and transfers me to “level 2 technical support.” I
 wait as music plays.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>6:34 p.m.</strong> Someone or some algorithm on the Microsoft end of the line hangs up the phone.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:02 p.m.</strong> I call the Support Line and eventually talk with Tech Worker D, to whom I give my case number and describe the preceding events. He apologizes for my problems and puts me on hold with music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:14 p.m.</strong> The line goes dead.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:15 p.m.</strong> I call the Support Line. I am put on hold</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:36 p.m.</strong> I speak with Tech Worker E, to whom I give my case number and describe the preceding events. She apologizes for the preceding events and puts me on hold.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:42 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker E comes back on the line to tell me that Tech Worker B from “level 2 technical support” will call me back in 30 minutes.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>9:33 p.m.</strong> No one has called so I call the Support Line. I am put on hold with music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>10:06 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker F answers the phone. I give him my case number and explain the preceding events. He apologizes for the failure to call me and for the phones being hung up on me. He explains that no one is available in “level 2 technical
 support” to help me and so I must schedule a call for the next day. He tells me that I shall get a call between 10 a.m. and noon on February 13. He sends me a confirming email message (which I retrieve using Microsoft’s competitor Mozilla Thunderbird) (copy
 attached).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>10:28 p.m.</strong> Call with Tech Worker F ends.</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 13.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li>

<strong>10 a.m. to noon</strong>: I stay next to my phone. No one calls.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:19 p.m.</strong> I call the Support Line and reach Tech Worker G, to whom I give my case number and describe the preceding events. She apologizes for the problems I have had and puts me on hold with music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>7:32 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker G returns to the line to tell my she is transferring me to the queue for “level 2 technical support.”</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>8:34 p.m.</strong> Someone or some algorithm at Microsoft hangs up the phone. I call back and eventually reach Tech Worker H. I give her my case number and describe the preceding events. She apologizes for the problems I have had and offers to transfer
 me to the queue for “level 2 technical support.” I tell her that, given my experience, I want to talk with a supervisor. She puts me on hold with music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>8:48 p.m.</strong> Supervisor 1 picks up the line and identifies himself as a supervisor. I describe the preceding events to Supervisor 1. Supervisor 1 says that he is looking at my case on his screen and can see what I am dealing with. “We’ve got issues
 here.” He puts me on hold so that he can call “level 2 technical support” himself to line up someone who can handle my problems. He puts me on hold with music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>8:55 p.m.</strong> Supervisor 1 returns to the line to assure me that someone from “level 2 technical support” is waiting to help and that he (Supervisor 1) will transfer my call to that person. He puts me on hold with music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>9:00 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker H returns to the line to say that Supervisor 1 has left the premises and that she will transfer me to “level 2 technical support.” She puts me on hold.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>9:02 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker I from “level 2 technical support” picks up the line. I give him my case number and describe the preceding events. He apologizes for all the problems I have had and assures me that he will now fix them. Using a support
 service, Tech Worker I accesses my computer so that he can view my screen and work with the programs. After 75 minutes, he says he thinks that the last resort will have to be a repair of Windows 10, “which will take several hours.” Before that effort, he tries
 one more fix—create a completely new profile for me on my computer. After he creates the profile, Microsoft Outlook seems to able to access my gmail account. He concludes that the problem is fixed and we hang up.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>10:37 p.m.</strong> Call ends.</p>
</li></ul>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>February 14</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>When I try to use Outlook in the morning, everything freezes again. All the old problems return. I have to go to work, though, so I cannot attend to these
 items.</span></p>

 on hold.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>8:35 p.m.</strong> Supervisor 2 picks up the line and tells me he is a supervisor. I explain the preceding events, and he apologizes. He tells me that he will email “level 2 technical support” and tell them to call me. He tells me that they will call
 me (on the land line number I have given him, so that my cell phone is free to continue this call) in the next 30-60 minutes. In addition, at my request, he transfers me to the queue for “level 2 technical support,” where I automatically go into a queue with
 music playing.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

 him; she will put me on hold “for only 3 minutes.”</p>
</li><li>

<strong>3:29 p.m.</strong> Supervisor 3 picks up the line. He has the same name as Supervisor 2, although he does not think he is Supervisor 2 with whom I spoke the night before. I give him my case number and explain the preceding events. He apologizes. He
 offers to transfer me to “level 2 technical support” <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
or</span> to schedule a call for the next day (February 17) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
or</span> to email “level 2 technical support” himself asking them to call me today. I ask that we do all three things. He agrees. He tells me that he will email “level 2 technical support” as soon as he gets off the line and tell them to call me on my landline
 number (so that my cell phone remains free for this call). He also schedules me for a call on February 17 between 1 and 3 p.m. He also says that he will transfer me to “level 2 technical support.” He then puts me on hold.</p>

<strong>2:21 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker L comes back on the line. I tell him I need to leave at 3:30 p.m. He says he understands. Using a support service, he accesses my screen and starts to review files and the Outlook application.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>2:35 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker L says that he will continue working on the screen but insists that I hang up. When I explain that I can stay on the line, he says that I need to hang up, because he has to answer other calls “but I shall keep working
 on your matter and you can see the mouse moving on the screen.”<span>&nbsp; </span>He says that he will call me back in 10-15 minutes. He proposes to uninstall and then reinstall Office 2016 Professional Plus. I hang up. Over the next 90 minutes I can see through
 the IM program that he opened on my screen that he hands off my matter to Tech Worker M, who after a while hands the matter back to Tech Worker L. Long periods of time pass in which there is no activity on the screen after Microsoft Office 2016 Professional
 Plus reinstalls. </p>

 me.</p>

 email saying it will call me between 9 and 11 a.m. on February 19. (Copy attached) The message says that, if that time will not work, I should call the Support Line to schedule a new call.</p>

<strong>9:25 p.m.</strong> Tech Worker N from Microsoft picks up the Support Line. I give her my case number. She says that she cannot help me and that my matter must be escalated to “level 2 technical support.” I describe the preceding events and she apologizes
 for the problems I have had with Microsoft Support. I tell her that I cannot take a call from Microsoft Support at 10:15 a.m. on February 19 because of a conflict. She tells me to reply to Microsoft’s email message and to propose a different time. I tell her
 that the Microsoft message said I was supposed to call the Support Line to reschedule. She says that the Support Line cannot reschedule me for “level 2 technical support” and that I must reply to the email message from Microsoft. When I repeat that the message
 said I was supposed to reschedule through the Support Line, she says that I should reply to the email message. When I express doubts that a reply will work, she assures me that it will work “because I am a technician.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>While I was pursuing the foregoing activities, I also tried to find a solution through support.microsoft.com. Nothing in the chat rooms or on the boards
 helped me. I asked for a phone call. I was told through an automated message that someone would call in 57 minutes. About 2 hours later, I got a phone call. As soon as I gave my case number, however, the Microsoft representative said that she was only “level
 1 technical support” and that I needed to go to “level 2 technical support.” I explained that I was already trying that approach.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Current state of affairs; request for solution</span></span></p>

<p><span>I think you will agree with me on a few points:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Your support line representatives have been polite throughout this process.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Your support line representatives have been incompetent in fixing Microsoft Outlook 2016 on my Windows 10 computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
No one should experience what I have been going through.</p>
</li></ul>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I would appreciate it if you would promptly find someone in your organization who will make it his/her mission to work with me to get Outlook fixed once
 and for all. Please let me know the solution you will develop. My contact information is at the top of this letter.</span></p>

<h2>            Can not login to my skype - it is blocked</h2>
                    <p>Dear community support team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Skype for many years but recently I forgot my password and my account has been blocked. I can not access that account anymore on my desktop computer, although, it is still logged in on my mobile phone. It seems that my Skype id is connected with Microsoft
 account but the id name is something like "live-xxxxxxxxx) and also I am not able to see my contact list in Microsoft account. I desperately need help and it has been locked for over a month now. My blocked user id is fdan071924
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for your help</p>

<h2>            Excel Display Window Size</h2>
                    <p>Please see the attached screenshot. Whenever I open excel for first time, I get this. Only a partial view of excel cells in the complete window.Also the sometime sheet 1 , sheet 2 button are missing , plus these are not clickable. Only when I resize the
 window and maximise it again , it gives me the full view . &nbsp;See the 2nd attachment.<br />

<h2>            Replies to emails not appearing in SENT folder in Outlook 2016 desktop</h2>
                    <p>When I reply to an email that I opened in a saved folder in Outlook 2016 'perpetual' (no 365), the reply stays in the same saved folder and does not appear in the Sent folder.
</p>
<p>Is there any way that all replies and forwards, no matter where the originally received email is in Outlook, can be made to appear in the Sent folder?
</p>
<p>Generally, what are the criteria for replies and forwards appearing in the Sent folder?

<br />However, the originally received emailed that had been moved to a saved folder now has a new link to the sent message stating the date of my reply to the saved email. But I now have no email chain as a single document, apparently. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />1. Right click on replied to date to find related messages if you aren't using conversation view. (It searches by subject so it's not always useful.)
<br />
<br />2.  Create a search folder for replies and forwards if you don't want to use conversation view and want to see the full chain. 
<br />
<br />You need to use the Extended properties CFG from <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/adding-extended-mapi-fields-to-outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/exchange/adding-exten...</a> then create a search folder for replies/forwards. Every message in it will be one you replied or forwarded - you can enable show as conversations on the folder to see the full thread. (This method is good if you normally hate the conversation view - the view can be used only on this folder.)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45f118e2-3341-4025-8c45-c6cac402a251?upload=true" />

[See the corrected links in my previous reply. Sorry about that but I had to guess your Windows version since you didn't state it in your first post.]<br />
<br />
The "login as" option will be found in WINDOWS Explorer, not INTERNET Explorer:<br />
<br />
&lt;QP&gt;<br />
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the FTP website in your browser.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span><strong>Page</strong></span> [icon in Command bar], and then click
<span><strong>Open FTP site in <span>Windows</span> Explorer</strong></span>...<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>In <strong><span>Windows</span> Explorer</strong>, press <strong>ALT</strong>, click
<span><strong>File</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Login as</strong></span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the user name and password, and then click <span>Log On</span>.<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Workaround: <strong>[XP] </strong>Go to My Network Places&gt; Add Network Place. Follow the wizard to add the FTP site. The
<br />
URL format<br />
ftp://username:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** should work.<br />
<br />
If Network Places isn't on the desktop... Display Properties&gt; Desktop&gt;<br />
Customize&gt; check it.<br />
<br />
Workaround <strong>[Vista]</strong> Similar except- Open Computer. Right-click in the Computer window&gt; Add a network location.
<br />
Follow the wizard. Again, The URL format ftp://username:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** should work.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Don<br />

<h3> gunayadlapalli  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2013&#58; Slide transition</h2>
                    <p>How to delay the transition of a slide?</p>
<p>I know there is that button which sets when the slide transition should occur to the next one but that is useless for me.</p>
<p>I have created a "Next" button with the hyperlink to the next slide and an animation but I only want it to take the user to the next slide AFTER the animation has finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer. I am on a tight deadline with 2 weeks, yes, a fair while but a lot of work to be done by then.</p>
<p>

            As Dazed says this is the way. It looks better (IMHO) if you cover the actual link button with a "greyed out" copy that has no link and then set it to disappear after the animations. It will then look like a grey button becoming active (which most people
 are familiar with)<br />

                    <p>MS Excel 2010 - How to filter report to different sheets based on column entry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a report with the following Column headings:&nbsp; Department, Goal, Status, Expected Completion Date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a working document that gets updated daily.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to take the Row of data from each Department entry and populate a seperate Sheet for that department.&nbsp; In addition, if "All" is indicated in the Department, that row data be&nbsp;included in&nbsp;all
 department sheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible or will I continue to have to cut and paste this in to the different department reports?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

 then &nbsp;Press Alt-F11 from Excel to open the VBEditor, press Ctrl-R to open the project explorer, select your workbook (find the name you just used) and choose Insert / Module. In the window to the right, paste the code. Then go back to Excel (alt-F11 from the

    <title>Microsoft Account Conflict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantsutherlandwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account Conflict</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to create a Microsoft Account using my normal email address. However, I got a message that an account with that email address already existed. I then attempted to log on using that email address, but I got a message that said that the account
 not exist. Similarly, when I tried to do a password reset using my email address I got a message that the account was not recognized. So I then created an account with a new outlook.com email address. I then tried to an my original email address as an alias,
 but I got a message that the email address was already taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why this is happening, but I have an idea. Some time ago I wanted to use the Microsoft Fix It tool, and, as I recall, I had to create an account to do so. I created the account using my email address. However, it seems that the Fix It
 account process has been merged with the Microsoft Account process, and somewhere along the line my account got corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated/</p>

    <title>Instable sync with Windows Mobile Device Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derik99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Instable sync with Windows Mobile Device Center </h2>
                    Since I changed to Vista and WMDC I have a number of problems. It often disconnects before it is done or sometimes not connect at all, especially with playlist synchronisation with Media Player. I sometimes get the error-message:
<span>”Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) have stopped functioning”.
<span>”Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) have stopped functioning”.
</span>It used to be relaliable with Active sync. :( <br />
I use a Kaiser or TyTN II-mobile and need to sync it many times a day, so help in making it reliable would be appreciated.

            <p>There are lots of ways to do this in Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As was already suggested, you can use the Data Validation feature's List capability to make a pop-up menu from which to choose a list from a cell range.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another way is to make a combo box:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/making-popup-menu-buttons-for-excel-forms-in-offic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/making-popup-menu-buttons-for-excel-forms-in-offic.html</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or a list box</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/making-list-boxes-for-excel-forms-in-office-2011-f.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/making-list-boxes-for-excel-forms-in-office-2011-f.html</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or make a form on a dialog sheet</p>

<h2>            Imported favorites lost their icons.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed a new workstation running Windows XP SP3 and IE7 (as was my previous workstationl).&nbsp; Can't go to IE8 because it is not certified to run with my company's enterprise software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I exported my IE favorites from the old PC and then imported them on the new one; all the icons for my favorite sites have changed to generic ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did the icons disappear and how can I get them back to stay?&nbsp; I have&nbsp;visited some of the sites and sometimes the icon comes back and other times it doesn't.&nbsp; Also, the&nbsp;icons don't always&nbsp;remain.&nbsp; Sometimes, for no apparent reason when I launch IE, some
 of them are back to generic again.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Not enough info.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. one explanation would be that you customized them on the old work station and would have to recustomize them on the new one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such customization would not survive an export and import procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a web search for&nbsp; FavOrg&nbsp; to get
 some ideas for some of the customization you might have done.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

<h2>            Adding 3rd account to Outlook - lose connection to first two</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>32-bit Vista Business SP2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary account through Verizon ISP (with several additional accounts tied to it that all work find in Personal Folders).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second account is MSN account using IMAP and going through Outlook Connector.&nbsp; Shows no data location, but information is stored somewhere because I have it set to be removed from server and it continues to remain available - so while I can't explain that,
 it too works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Created free Gmail account and tried to add it using instructions here (and POP&nbsp;and IMAP both at different times if that matters):
<a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86374</a>&nbsp;and also <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/internet/gmail/add-your-gmail-account-to-outlook-2007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/internet/gmail/add-your-gmail-account-to-outlook-2007/</a>&nbsp;(which were basically identical).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked, but the toolbar changed from "Connect to Server" to "Connect to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and I could not change it back.&nbsp; When I sent a test email to the account I lost connection to both my primary and secondary accounts and only had access to the Gmail account.&nbsp; I was able to successfully send and receive with the Gmail
 account (the test worked as did actually sending messages)&nbsp;- but the others were essentially offline.&nbsp; It was very tough getting those original connections back (I did a lot of tweaking and eventually got it to work).&nbsp; But soon after (and I'm not sure if I
 did anything involving the Gmail account), the same thing occurred and Iost all contact with the other two accounts and needed to fiddle around again to get it back.&nbsp; Strangely enough, Windows Messenger also closed when I lost access to those other accounts&nbsp;(it's
 the same MSN account that normally goes through Connector)!!&nbsp; Since this is intended to be rarely used but I can't be without the others, I finally got fed up, deleted the Gmail account, closed and re-opened Outlook and all is well again - except I can't work
 with it using the Gmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I configured Gmail to forward to the primary Verizon account in Outlook.&nbsp; That works fine.&nbsp; So I can see messages received.&nbsp; But if I want to respond to them using the Gmail account, I need to open Gmail with my browser and do it all from
 there instead of being able to simply select the account to use to send&nbsp;in Outlook (obviously since the account doesn't exist there).&nbsp; This is inconvenient but it's at least a livable workaround - but I can't believe this is necessary and think I must be missing
 something that would allow it to occur like the other two accounts.&nbsp; At first I thought it may have to do with different PST files, but since I have no trouble accessing my Archives in a different PST file and that doesn't shut down access to my other accounts
 when in the Archive folders, that can't be the issue.&nbsp; I suspect it's because the account settings are completely different from the other Primary account accounts (and not run through Connector like the MSN account since I can't find a way to add more than
 one account to the Connector).&nbsp; And why would this have any affect on Messenger??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the nature of the beast and "sorry, but there's no way to do what you want with Outlook and the other accounts to add this as a third one without messing up the conncections" or am I missing some obvious setting or method that will let me set it
 up so it works like the others?&nbsp; It's clearly not the instructions provided above but something else - and I've no idea what.&nbsp; Can we add more than one Outlook Connector to Outlook so this 3rd account can be assigned to the second Connector and maybe work
 that way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, is there any way to do what I'm trying to do or is that simply not possible (as I'm beginning to suspect may be the case), or have I missed either the process to do this or the guidelines that say it can't be done with or without Connector or
 multiple Connectors - which I also can't figure out how to do if that's even possible either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it can't be done, is there at least some simpler way to set it up and switch back and forth and NOT KEEP LOSING CONNECTIONS but merely change the account being used (which&nbsp;may mean&nbsp;losing connection to the others while using&nbsp;the one, but easily returning
 to the others "at the push of a button"&nbsp;(and disconnecting from the one)&nbsp;and making sure they say put once changed&nbsp;- as one would do with Switch User in Windows without needing to logout and login without bouncing back and forth without warning or notice without
 logging out of one of them to prevent that)?&nbsp; Could it be a matter of automatic checking for new mail (which I do every minute) and when it gets to that account it switches and won't return?&nbsp; If so, can I exclude that account from automatic checking and how
 is that done?&nbsp; And that doesn't explain why the toolbars change as noted above and I can't get back the button to connect to Outlook Connector (or did I actually override Outlook Connector with this new account and while I can still get the MSN accounts through
 Outlook connector, it somehow now thinks that's the one that matters?).&nbsp; And with this&nbsp;switch to the other account button, that would be&nbsp;fine if&nbsp;changed to Switch&nbsp;to the original accounts once pushed (thus the Switch process I was alluding to earlier - but
 while pushing it does&nbsp;switch things,&nbsp;it doesn't provide a way back other than accessing the other accounts&nbsp;and doing a send/receive with them which reconnects them until they disconnect moments later for whatever reason).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not so much concerned with the temporary loss of connections&nbsp;with the first two if using the third or with the third if using the first two)&nbsp;if that's the only way to do it - but the seemingly random and unpredictable jumping back and forth once this
 third one is setup is not workable.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I do that, will I still be able to allow forwarding so when the third one is not connected, I can at least remain aware of new mail received?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance.&nbsp; I'm a bit embarassed to need to ask this, but I really have tried hard to find a way and admit I need help (or at least validation that I'm not losing my mind and that what's happening&nbsp; is normal and there isn't a
 way around it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate anything to try to improve things.</p>

            I used this method to "save" my N95 8gb after it completely froze on the white screen. There was no other way of resetting it. After restarting, I did lose the trial N Gage games and had to re load third party applications. This was a pain and took ages
 but there was no other way of getting my phone to start.

            Would hard resetting make the video issue go away?,<br />
You know, the one where you would record and it would freeze after five seconds or so then back again then vice versa.<br />
the problem is with the mass memory, but when you change it to phone memory it goes away.<br />
i have the latest firmware v20.0.016 but people have been experiencing it even with the previous firmwares.

    <title>Syncing my iPhone calendar with Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gusgougas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing my iPhone calendar with Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have used Outlook for many years and have been syncing with my iPhone for at least 5, through iTunes.&nbsp; My HP laptop crashed, so I had to reload everything.&nbsp; I have Office 2013 and just loaded iTunes.&nbsp; When I sync-ed, my contacts and bookmarks came through
 fine, however not my calendar I have on my iPhone.&nbsp; I actually think it did synchronize, I just can see it.&nbsp; When I look at the calendars on my iPhone, IT shows "calendar" and "outlook calendar".&nbsp; When I look at the calendars on iTunes, IT shows "calendar"
 and "outlook calendar".&nbsp; However, when I look at my Calendars on Outlook, instead of showing multiple calendars on the Navigation bar it just shows "calendar (this computer only)", which is blank.&nbsp; I think it is simply not showing my other calendars.&nbsp; Does
 anyone know how I can fix this?&nbsp; Again, I think it is simply a matter of having Outlook show multiple calendars, but I can't find out where to go to do this?&nbsp; Please help?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t install apps&#47;themes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install apps&#47;themes</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
Ok so I noticed this seems like a general problem, but I didn't find any topics with the same problems as me. Sorry if I didn't look hard enough.<br />
<br />
I have an N80. The problem occurs with PC Suite v6.82.22.0, the applications installer.<br />
I downloaded some themes for N80 and when trying to install them it simple says: Operation Failed.<br />
I am connected via USB and running XP SP2.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sia.

            Copy that application file to phone (use e.g Nokia Phone Browser) and start installation via phone UI -&gt; Does the installation work??

            Thanks for response.<br />
Yes that worked, however before installing it said that "the file is not compatible with phone". I just prssed continue anyway and it worked. Could this be harmful?<br />
<br />
This is my first symbian phone, so I don't know how these phones work... which is ironic considering I used to work for symbian lol!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I don't know (maybe some features of that application is not working)...<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you don't get any application installed via Application Installer -&gt; do this then:<br />
1. Go to Windows' Control Panel and open "Add or Remove Programs" application.<br />
2. Select "PC Connectivity Solution", click "Change" and then "Repair".<br />
3. After Repair, restart PC.

            Hmm... didn't work.<br />
It probably something to do with the themes being 3rd party that the software won't let you install them as a security thing.<br />
Thanks for your help!

    <title>2 PC license for Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus bought from - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            2 PC license for Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus bought from Moonbox - Will not Install on 2nd Laptop&#47;PC</h2>
                    <p>I bought a 2 PC license MS Office 2013 Professional Plus from Moonbox.com and I installed it fine on my laptop back in 2014.</p>
<p>I then bought a 2nd laptop in late 2015 but the license or product key is considered to be invalid on this new unit.</p>
<p>I contacted moonbox and they provided a new key as complimentary and in error it was for a office 2013 professional (not plus)&nbsp;and this code is not valid either. I tried it because I am desperate to continue with me work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I an still ping-ponging e-mails with Moonbox about the key problem and have no idea where it will lead but I strongly feel that it may be something related to this new laptop which is Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any advice on what I should do to get my software activated. I am hoping for a direct approach from Microsoft at this stage because I have the product key and when bought from moonbox back in 2014 it clearly states that it is a 2PC license
 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I need someone technical from MS to provide me with some information on whether Moonbox incorrectly provided me with a 1 PC license back in 2014, or if there is something else at work right now.</p>
