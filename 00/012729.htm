    <title>Still getting blank pages with Internet Explorer 8 after doing a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Still getting blank pages with Internet Explorer 8 after doing a restore to original default settings.</h2>
                    
<p>I can get to the&nbsp; IE 8 home page which I changed to AOL and it displays fine, but when I try to access my e-mail after signing in I get a blank white page with Done on the bottom of the screen. Oddly enough I am intermediately getting white blank ages as
 well when I try to access a web page from my e-mail in&nbsp; AOL 9.6 Desktop. Also when I try to access AOL system information from Windows 7 start task bar I get a blue blank screen. I had Kaspersky Internet Security until a few days ago when my subscription ran
 out and at&nbsp; that point both IE 8 and AOL 9.5&nbsp; were both working perfectly fine. Not having the financial means I went and downloaded Avast Anti Virus which was free. I tried to get on AOL and had problems so then I completely uninstalled all versions of AOL
 that were on my computer and then and tried to see if I uninstalled Avast Anti Virus&nbsp; and then downloaded&nbsp; a new version of AOL 9.5 which is actually 9.6 then reinstalling Avast Anti Virus if that would resolve the issue which it did not. I then uninstalled
 Avast Anti-Virus from my computer(using removal utility and in safe mode ) . I also get this little small white box that says ok and it related to aol. By this time I was so aggreivated&nbsp; that once again&nbsp; I uninstalled AOL 9.6 and decided to try a different
 anti- virus program so I went and downloaded AVG Anti Virus and was given the option to try AVG Internet Security 2011 so that is what I am using now.&nbsp; I have no problems with either Firefox or Goggle Chrome.&nbsp; I also went and tried the restore to default settings
 in IE 8 and the home page loads fine , however I still get a white blank page if I try to access any website with the&nbsp; word Done at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I have ran AVG Internet Security several times as well to make so that I had no viruses that could
 be causing the problem, which I do not. I am using Windows 7 Home Premium and it is 32 bit. At some point along the way I did a system restore as well and that did not resolve the issue. I am really hoping that someone can help me out because after trying
 all these various things I am clueless as to how to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ordered Office 2013 Professional Plus from an online retailer. Was given the download link and licence key. After licence key, then shown the error message:</p>

            <p>Call your credit card company <strong>immediately</strong>, <strong>RIGHT NOW, TONIGHT!</strong>, and report fraud. Have them cancel the payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Pro Plus is an extremely limited distribution bundle. The only way you could buy it legally online is through a "Volume License" purchase from a licensed MS reseller. And that would require you to buy 4 other products (they don't all Office) because
 a new Volume agreement requires that you initially buy a minimum of 5 licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, fraud artists do buy a bunch of Office licenses on a volume agreement and then resell them to the public. This resale is illegal. If/when MS figures out a volume license has been resold to the public it invalidates all of the product keys
 sold to that person.&nbsp; Buyers, like yourself are left out in the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the symptoms of a scam is that they are slow replying to emails and phone calls and constantly do everything they can to delay helping you.</p>

<h2>            Support Quality</h2>
                    <p>When I opened an O365 business account I was amazed at the quality of the support I received. It was world class; perhaps the best customer service I could recall. As a start up I was helped by a variety of US and Canadian based technicians who navigated
 me through a variety of challenging tasks trying to set up and integrate our business functions. Things like: migrating a domain, setting up email journalling, tailoring functionality of the system to suit. Truly, it was superb. Just amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Abruptly, it changed. The system to get support is more complex now and I hate to say it but the quality of the support is just awful. The support is coming from abroad and while I am reluctant to criticize on that point alone, it is nonetheless true that
 both the oral communication and the quality of the telephone transmission merits low marks. It has become so bad my expectations have sunk and I am now reluctant to use it. Before, when I was dealing with clear competency I never thought too hard about sharing
 my screen. I can not say that now. Luckily for me the more difficult tasks are done but I am now looking for alternative product or technical solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced the same change? Is there any explanation as to how such a deterioration could be so abrupt?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding. Since you asked let me give you some specifics by way of comparison.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I started with O365 it was through Go Daddy. Many businesses start their technology journey by selecting a domain name and Go daddy is often the initial point of contact. Once you have selected the domain they make it easy to select O365. However, this
 turns out to be a big mistake because the product they offer is a restricted version; like a shell product. So later, when you are in need of more complex tasks you find the system and support is not able to accommodate. A good example of this is Microsoft
 Dynamics, the customer management product. It does not work with the Go Daddy version of O365.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you begin the effort to get the domain moved to the <em>real</em> O365 on the Microsoft servers. This is quite a task and I could never have done it without Microsoft support. It took hours. It took three way interfacing with Go Daddy over the phone
 even though it is nominally the same product; all of it managed and coordinated by the outstanding Microsoft technicians I had the pleasure of working with. In my case I had to set up email journalling through Groups; again a complex task that took quality
 time to complete. &nbsp;There were a few other examples where the task was quite involved and given my current experience with what I will term the "new support model" it would never have happened, at least without me having a nervous breakdown. The bottom line
 on this point is I would not have been able to use O365 without the great quality of the USA and Canadian technicians that helped me during that critical period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of comparison let me lay out the current level of support. By the way, I don't want to appear overly critical of the individuals I was interfacing with, they were always professional, courteous and trying to do their best. In saying that, recently
 I had one of our users who could not get his email linked to his phone using OWA. It took seven days to fix and no root cause was identified. As a general indication of how dysfunctional the registering of a support call has become take my first experience
 under this apparent new system. After calling the catch all support number I was screened only to be transferred to another agent who started to screen me for personal details to such an extent I started to feel I was being scammed. Then, in a bizarre twist
 actually during this call I received another call on a different line again from another Microsoft agent trying to respond to the same ticket. When I explained this weird circumstance to the first agent he started telling me that the other caller was a scam.
 It was like the keystone cops! With that as a background; Would you be inclined to share access to your machine? I think not, and without that utility the whole service model falls apart. A customer will not share a screen with someone that does not appear
 competent. At that point its a bust!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience I would tell anyone in a start up situation, where perhaps you need extra support to get going versus a larger business with deeper resources is; Don't buy Go daddy O365 and don't rely on Microsoft support for your business needs.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Outlook 16 build 8431.2107 - Home Page tab gone from Folder Properties</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the latest Outlook 16 update took place and getting to build 8431.2107 to our dismay we noticed that the Home Page tab has gone from the Folder Properties screen.</p>
<p>All Outlook versions, from years ago and until at least the previous build would let you use an Outlook folder to show a web page inside Outlook.
</p>
<p>This is a functionality that me and hundreds (maybe thousands) of other users are using daily to do their work.</p>
<p>See below the screen that you used to get when you checked the properties of a folder Inbox:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de8db7b4-60df-4b99-b5d4-f9c4a0757e91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/de8db7b4-60df-4b99-b5d4-f9c4a0757e91" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the entire Home Page tab is simply not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to get it back??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Vassilis</p>

<h2>            Corruption of the driver files in system32&#92;drivers folder</h2>
                    <p><span><span>After installing Update 1 for Windows 8.1, I encountered a nasty problem. Sometimes, I don’t know why or what causes it, some driver files from %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers and %SystemRoot%\WinSxS get corrupted. More precisely, their digital
 signatures get corrupted. This problem affects <strong>BOTH</strong> Windows 8.1 and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Technical Preview</span>. I encountered this problem on
<strong>4(!) different PCs</strong>, which all have different motherboards, so this problem doesn’t seem to be caused by specific hardware.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>More frequently this disease strikes files from %SystemRoot%\WinSxS\amd64_machine.inf_XXX (especially msisadrv.sys), and files from %SystemRoot%\WinSxS\amd64_agp.inf_XXX, %SystemRoot%\WinSxS\amd64_uaspstor.inf_XXX, %SystemRoot%\WinSxS\amd64_volume.inf_XXX
 are also affected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Since this digital signature corruption problem affects the&nbsp;*.sys files in both folders - %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers and %SystemRoot%\WinSxS, Windows cannot boot and, more important, it cannot repair itself, because files in %SystemRoot%\WinSxS
 are also corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hoped that Windows 10 TP is free from this problem, but unfortunately, it’s not.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As far as I know, Windows Server is not affected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I started encountering this problem more than a half a year ago, with Windows 8.1 Update 1.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates. I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Ensure to update all device drivers after upgrading to Windows 10 Technical Preview.
<span>Ensure to install the latest Windows Updates. <strong>Windows Update: Frequently Asked Questions</strong>:

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for
 you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe driver you shouldn't install.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span>If the issue still persists even after installing missing updates and updating all device drivers then
</span>I would recommend you to join the Windows Insider Program to get more frequent preview builds and send your feedback straight to the people building Windows.</span></span></p>

            <p><span><em>This issue might occur due to incompatible or outdated drivers and missing updates.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All my drivers were shipped with Windows 10 TP, except for the NVidia driver. Missing updates for Windows 10 TP? Are you kidding me? ^_^</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm definitely not trying to blame anyone here. I'm a very friendly person ^_^ I just want to understand what this mysterious problem is. It's been torturing me since Windows 8.1 Update 1. And it's definitely a very weird problem. I&nbsp;don't even have&nbsp;any idea
 where to dig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All corrupted files have "ASN1 bad tag value met."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Server that was and now is installed and run on the same PC, where Windows 8.1 was installed and now where Windows 10 TP is installed has never had this problem. It definitely uses the same hardware ^_^&nbsp;and the same bunch of drivers (guess why ^_^),
 and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 TP has no antivirus software installed, it uses its own Windows Defender. No single "optimization program", such as Registry Cleaner, has ever been installed or run on any of my PCs at any time. It just never happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, by the way, I use a separate partition on the same drive for storing pagefile.sys. I know it's definitely unrelated, but I can't think up anything else to share with you. Ask me anything you need. ^_-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else ever faced this problem?</p>

            <p>First thing you could do is checking for corrupt files.</p>
<p>Run cmd.exe as administrator.</p>
<p>At this command prompt run SFC /SCANNOW</p>
<p>When there are corrupt files find. Run the same command at least 3 times.</p>

<h2>            0x80244018 error downloading build 17711.1000.</h2>
                    <p>Hi ;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I've now tried 5 or 6 times to download 17711.1 and have gotten the same error (0x80244018) each time.</p>
<p>Doing a little research I came up with basiclly just recreating the Windows Update directory and files. But it seems to not work.
</p>
<p>No matter what I try the Catroot directory will not get erased. Not that that's the reason for the error but it's part of the clearing process that doesn't get&nbsp; completed. The error pop's up at different parts of the process. So it might be hard to pin down
 'where' it occurs. Any Idea's?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            3rd party virus programs will give this type of issues, the 3rd party virus program needs to be removed using the tool from the maker of the program.

<h2>            Excel printout doesn&#39;t match preview</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this has just started happening and i have been printing from Excel previously for many years without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up my pages in Excel check everything looks fine in print preview and then print (either to physical printer or to PDF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resulting printout is all over the place. The bottom of the page gets printed at the top of the next and additional pages get printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any changes to the document (tested with a document that I had previously printed out without issue) although Office 365 has done its own updates.</p>

<p>Hi Eli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I didn't get back sooner. I tried your workaround it but it does introduce other issues by reducing the size of the worksheet content on the A4 page. It did correct the page length issue though!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still unsure of what you mean by <em>"</em><span><em>the rows of Page 1 exceed the A4 length size"</em><em>.
</em>Could you elaborate as I would like to understand.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I persevered trying to resolve my issue and finally came across a setting under Options which I had not heard of before - and I can't really understand it's intended use. 'Scale content for A4 or 8.5 x 11" paper sizes' was checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3248e6d5-c206-452e-980e-13cf4bd47562?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3248e6d5-c206-452e-980e-13cf4bd47562?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearing this checkbox seems to have solved my problems! So I guess it must have become activated during an update..? Would be good to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Off topic, while trying to do all this I came across a solution to another problem I have had for years. Whenever I insert an image it always gets distorted (height gets reduced). I found out that the default 'Office' Theme is the culprit and changing the
 Theme to 'Metropolitan' ensures any images inserted retain their correct proportions. Quite why is beyond me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The info was found at a post in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.excelforum.com/excel-general/889534-excel-will-not-print-images-at-correct-height-width.html#post4431098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel Forum</a>. Hope it will help someone else!</p>

<p>Hi Sophie,</p>
<p>To transfer the ownership of team site, we can add another user and remove the leaving user.</p>
<p>If you are looking for changing the team site (site collection) admin, we can go to SharePoint Admin Center (<em>https://&lt;tenant&gt;-admin.sharepoint.com/</em>) &gt; select certain team site &gt; click
<strong>Owners</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Administrator</strong> &gt; Change<strong> Primary Site Collection Administrator/Site Collection Administrator</strong>.

    <title>Cannot Download China Map for Windows Maps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d-ralph-hk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Download China Map for Windows Maps</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950 XL with latest generally available Windows 10 Mobile.&nbsp; I have downloaded and updated a number of offline maps&nbsp;for the Microsoft / Windows 10 Offline Maps app, but when I try and download a China map (Beijing &amp; Guangdong Provinces), China
 does not appear in the Asia list (or any other list).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have these installed until recently (some problems with updating the maps) but now they are the only ones I can't find to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have the China maps been withdrawn or is there some other problem and if so, can anyone offer a suggestion on how to find the China maps?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a&nbsp;lot for any help you can provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is really unacceptable. A Microsoft flagship phone with latest Windows Phone 10,had China map downloaded, but got removed by the update, now China is even no longer in Asia, what a joke, whoever makes that silly mistake really trying hard to upset the
 most important market for Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadder for me, I'm actually trying to have a great time here in China with family and friends, now my $1000 phone has just let me down again on the basic function like this. Feel so sorry for you, Microsoft and your customers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No way am I going to reset my phone for this. Fix it quickly, please! </p>

            <p>Hi JG, after reading your post, please allow me to ask you this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the "Offiline Windows Map" worked, the phone must satisfy all the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Language settings set to "Chinese";</p>
<p>2. Phone is being used in China;</p>
<p>3. Phone must be originally purchased in China;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"China" and "Japan" have been disappeared from my Windows 10 Mobile for more than 3 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine satisfy:</p>
<p>1, 2, but it was purchased in USA. So for me, '3' is the issue then??</p>

<p>I don't live in China but I visit China few times each year and I rely on offline maps to drive there... I bought recently 950XL with the latest windows 10, and I was surprised that i can't find China maps in the offline download list!!!!</p>
<p>

</p><p>I wonder what is the reason to restrict china offline maps to people living in China!!! What about those who want to visit China??</p>

            <p>I'm in the same boat. &nbsp;Got sucked into the update, only to find my China map deleted with no way of getting it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the hard resets with the region set to China, and I'm not getting the same results (no China map available). &nbsp;I'm now unwilling to go through a hard reset again--it's a big hassle and I lose track of a lot of my settings each time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know any other ways to get a quality offline China map on our phones? &nbsp;Could the old China map file be manually downloaded from my PC and dragged to a relevant folder on the phone? &nbsp;Are there any applications that can fully replace the map feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in Shanghai and this makes it impossible to use Uber, as far as I can tell. &nbsp;The online map is crummy now too. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>While curious on the subject I found this page:<br />

</p>
<p>~ half way down are some unusual terms for mainland China, that apply to developers using HERE map data, including Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your guess is as good as mine, but I suppose HERE did not want to risk a political power play, and pulled the road map data for China from their servers. Hopefully only temporarily while the legal and technical terms are sorted out.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. I live in Beijing. Went home to the UK 3 weeks ago and when I returned last week my China maps seemed to have disappeared. There must have been an update at some point but which I have no memory of. Either way, there is no China
 maps available to download anymore, and the live maps is simply blank with no roads or features. So annoying. I can no longer use Uber which has ruined my working week as I rely on it for getting about town (those who own a windows phone in China will also
 be aware that the alternative DidiTaxi&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">滴滴打车
 app also fails to work on Windows phone (Android and iOS have no problems), so no solution there either!). Likewise, my wechat location pin function doesn't work anymore either, therefore cannot use for arranging meetups with customers, colleagues, friends
 or drivers. Highly irritating - I may have to buy a new phone at this rate because I cannot afford to wait around for HERE or Microsoft or whoever it is who is responsible for these maps to resolve whatever political conundrum they have with the Chinese government.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">Is there anyone from Microsoft who can provide a sensible answer with some detail about how long we should wait for this to blow over,
 or what is the alternative data source we can use to make our apps (which use the maps) function properly?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Hello.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer us what conditions exactly have to be satisfied to make China offline maps available. I support Chinese users and those regularly traveling to China from our company.
 But I am the one who set devices for them, here, before they will travel to China from Poland.
</span></p>
<p><span>I do work in Poland.
</span></p>
<p><span>I do purchase phones in Poland.
</span></p>
<p><span>I set devices exactly the way those will be useful for users and they require offline maps to be able to travel.
</span></p>
<p><span>Resetting multiple phones that are already set – just to set Chinese location at initial configuration are not the solution. Please advise how can I here set phones of Chinese(!)
 users to make them able to get China offline maps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By the way: Chinese GSM networks often shows to be unrelaliable. Travelers have with them also Polish SIM cards. Accidental usage of those in China for online maps does cost a
 LOT. We do avoid online maps there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We do purchase a lot of Windows 10 mobile phones. Including multiple Lumia 950 phones. Please advise me how should I set them up for our Chinese employees so they will have offline
 maps downloaded.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please support us as we are clients that are supporting You with multiple purchases of&nbsp;</span><span>Your
 products. </span></p>
<p><span>We also do consider switching to other system platform because of
</span><span>Your mobile system </span><span>unclear future.</span></p>
<p><span>Please respond to my post and give me argument for my talks with decision making persons in our company so I won’t have to hassle with switching over to concurrent to Your system.</span></p>

            Can you please explain how you know that the 6230i firmware/software is not to be added to the NSU..<br />
<br />
As this completely surprises me especially when personal friends of mine who actually work for nokia as senior software engineers cant confirm or deny what you are stating.<br />
<br />
I have been personnaly promised for months that the software for the 6230i is to be added but is being held back once more due to possible bugs...<br />
<br />
I am well known in this forum and have had to put many posts from other forum members straight due to thier own lack of proper information to which they seem to act upon before checking the facts..<br />
<br />
So if there is something that you know for a fact or you too work for nokia then please confirm what you are stating and prove to me that you are not going to join the long list of know-alls who seem to know nothing about what they are saying but just seem
 to circulate un-founded information from other members...<br />
<br />
The 6230 and the 6230i have always had the ability to be updated as I have stated many times before all that is needed is a data cable connection and the latest firmware/software from nokia it has nothing to do with model or type only if the model has the ability
 to communicate with either data cable or o.t.a. over the air...<br />
<br />
The 6230 is still to date the most bug ridden mobile that nokia has ever produced(FACT)this is well documented and writen about on phone magazines in the past and on the net and especially in this and many other forums but to date this mobile has not been added
 even tho it should have been made priority over and above all other handsets due to the fact that it was the most bug ridden handset...<br />
but wee are just mere mortals being forced to dip in to our pockets once again to buy another mobile from nokia because they refuse to prove loyalty to the many not so happy customers that they dont care about...<br />

            hi xentos<br />
<br />
Im sorry friend that you misread my last post.<br />
I did not state that I knew were to get or had the latest firmware/software for the nokia 6230i.<br />
At this present moment I am trying to raise enough attention from the many users of the 6230i to complain to Nokia directly either by phone or email .<br />
The 6230i should have been added to the NSU from day one as agread to by many on this forum as the 6230i is the most bug ridden Nokia product that they have ever produced..<br />
Why should the out of warranty 6230i users have to pay for a firmware updrade when others are having thiers for free direct from nokias NSU and thier handsets are older and from the same series as well..<br />
There should be a law to protect the consumer from having to pay for a companys problems when the company should either foot the bill or waive it or in this case make proper use of the NSU and add the firmware...<br />
I have yet to pay for any software update or patch using any other hardware or software in the past and I wont be paying any time soon either.<br />
I have never had to pay to have my BIOS/CMOS updated on my PC ,or my firmware on my DVD writer ,or any software updates for windows or linux or my virus checker ..<br />
SO WHY SHOULD YOU OR ANYONE ELSE PAY TO FIX NOKIAS BUGS..<br />
Would you pay for damage to your car that someone else has done or get them to pay...<br />
Sorry again Xentos but the only way Nokia is going to add this much overdue update for the 6230i is if enough people complain and not rely on what is printed here in the forum to make any difference as what is posted here is generally ignored by everyone connected
 to Nokia because if it wasnt being ignored then the forum wouldnt need to exist<br />
<br />
be one of the many to complain<br />

            Hi Madmick,<br />
<br />
Do you still owe a 6230i? I do. But I didn't manage to update or went to a NSP. So what is your status? Do you have v3.89?

            AFAIK, 6230 and 6230i are not BB5 phones, hence they can not be updated using NSU, you can check Nokia sites for the phones that are supported by NSU...

<br />
I dont know if you have been following the thread here or if you have just arrived on this planet or if you have just re-registered under another handle to repost unfounded information but you are completely and utterly incorrect concerning the 6230 and 6230i
 ...<br />
<br />
These handsets have always been compatible for update on NSU it is just that they have not been added to the NSU yet).<br />
<br />
Firmware and software upgrades for handsets depends not on thier edition just on whether or not they have the ability to be communicated with using either data cable,bluetooth or O.T.A.(Over the Air).<br />
<br />
Others have posted many supposedly correct information in the past concerning compatability with the NSU including the difference between S40 and S60 series as being a barrier amongst other stupid posts as you can guess these non informed forum members were
 set straight by the professionals....<br />
<br />
So if you look more closely at the list of handsets already added to the NSU you will see that there are handsets from both series 40 and 60 also older and newer handsets so get your information correct..<br />
<br />
The 6230i was meant to be added to the NSU as part of its original Launch but was removed due to the possibility that it may damgage any handset that had a firmware below version 03.40 thats all..<br />
<br />
At this very moment in time Nokia are meant to be working on the problem and all the 6230 and 6230i owners out there will one day receive a much over due update ..<br />
<br />
Not like yourself I do keep in contact with Nokia and I have a history with Nokia as you can see if you check out the rest of my past posts .<br />
<br />
So in future can you please get it right as this is very unfair to other forum members and it also creates further problems when handset users have to rely on the information posted here ..<br />
<br />
Also before you try to post anything less than a retraction or at least see that you are incorrect please understand that I am very definately well informed from all the proper sources especially Nokia I am also a Computer and Phone engineer with many friends
 who are highly placed Nokia software and hardware enginneers and all of them work worldwide .<br />
<br />
I always send a copy of these posts to them and to date they have only been able to confirm two as having some basis in reality .<br />
<br />
I know for a fact before sending this to them this will only have the reaction of giving them a laugh and adding you to thier not so well informed candidate list...<br />
<br />
I wait for your response on this and if you would like me in future to post the links and the contact information for you for Nokia then please do ask....<br />

like i said, as far as i know the supported nokia phones are those BB5 phones and are listed here by nokia, see the link below, and tell me if you can see 6230 there???<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4579163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4579163</a><br />
<br />
BTW, i have one of the 1st batch of Nokia 6230 and i have tried to update this with NSU, but NSU does not even revognize it, simpy it is NOT a supported phone by NSU, however if Nokia has a plan to include 6230 and other non-BB5 phones well and good, but until
 that happens then it is NOT YET supported which is what i am saying that is why i said AFAIK... update over the air is something else and it is dependent on the provider...<br />
<br />
and i dont know why you are so arrogant? if you are a professional, you sure are not sounding like one...

            No, 6230 and 6230i are not supported by NSU. I have tried with 6230i and NSU indicated that the connected phone is not supported. Not only that after tried that I had to re-install NSU, since "some important part of program is missing". Tried it twice
 and came out the same.

    <title>One note snap grid does not match displayed grid lines. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azmodius666  say:</h3>
<h2>            One note snap grid does not match displayed grid lines.</h2>
                    I just started using Onenote (win 10) for classes and I can't seem to understand why I can draw a shape that perfectly snaps to grid points (grid paper), but as soon as I move it, it no longer snaps to the same grid. It's as if moving the shape causes
 it to relocate onto a different, invisible grid that's shifted over 2/3 of a space. Is there a fix for this?&nbsp;

    <title>Undo a Delete operation in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abgeerdad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undo a Delete operation in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>A few times I've accidentally clicked the "x" beside an email (which sends it to the Deleted Items folder), when I intended to click the "x" in the search bar to "Close Search". Of course, the reflexive response would be to "Undo" (Ctrl-Z or the button at
 the top), but that will only undo the last action before the delete. Why doesn't "Undo" work on a delete item action? What can I do to quickly get back an item that I accidentally deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can go to the Deleted Items folder to bring it back, but if I didn't notice which email I had clicked on, then I may not figure out which email in the Deleted Items folder I need to move back to the folder it came from (and&nbsp;since it&nbsp;was being deleted
 from&nbsp;a search results list, it may not have even been in the Inbox, so I'd have to figure out where to file it also).</p>

Size 6 3/4 is a standard size envelope.&nbsp; What happens if you click on the Add to Document button and then click on the Show\Hide (¶) button?</p>
<p>You should then see a ¶ where the return address goes (click in front of it) and another one where the address to which the envelope is to be sent will go.</p>

            <p><span>I created the original envelope in Word 2003 and attached it to a document, since I print a number of these envelopes each
 year to pay bills.&nbsp; The file worked in Word 2007, the file won’t work in Word 2010.&nbsp; I created a new envelope and attached it to a document and showed all non-printing characters.&nbsp; The create envelope section allows you to select the #6 envelope and it appears
 as such in the document.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I go to print the envelope and it doesn’t matter whether I select All Pages or Current Page the paper size defaults
 to the #10 envelope and cannot be changed in the Custom Paper size and it defaults back to the #10 envelope.&nbsp; If I select the Japanese Postcard which is close in size to the #6 envelope it will print the envelope if I adjust the top margin, but both addresses
 are not in their proper places on the envelope.&nbsp; Notice in the paper sizes there is no #6 envelope in all the envelope sizes to choose from.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!</span></p>

            This is not a good answer!&nbsp; It should be obvious from what I wrote that a number six (6) envelope is not available in the list of envelopes in the print menu and should be added.&nbsp; Word only recongnizes the number six (6) envelope when you create the envelope
 and it appears correct when added to a document, but when you print that envelope it defaults to a number ten (10) envelope because the print routine willl not recognized the number six (6) envelope.&nbsp; When I&nbsp; try to create a custom envelope in the print options
 it will not save the custom size and will default to the number&nbsp; ten (10) envelope.&nbsp; If I select the Japanese Postcard size&nbsp; and adjust the margins it will print on&nbsp; a number&nbsp;six (6) envelope but not totally right.&nbsp; It's like drinking near beer, but there
 is no satisfaction!

            Did you ever figure this out? &nbsp;It's been driving me mad. &nbsp;However word works it keeps it a secret so you are left to just experiment and cross your fingers. &nbsp;

            <p>Sometimes printing special sizes is dependent on the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to:</p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Devices and Printers</p>
<p>click on your printer and then near the top click Print Server Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the 6 3/4 envelope appear in the list of Forms?</p>
<p>If not then try to create one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do this to print on 6x7 paper with my HP OfficeJet Pro 8100.</p>
<p>Word 2013 will print on 6 3/4 envelopes on the 8100 but the return address is not correctly placed, too far to the right.&nbsp; The only envelope that has the return address correct is #10 (.13 from left, .13 from top)</p>

            Well i just called tech support and had her remotely reinstall my drivers. Now it works. Knowing how these things usually are I consider myself very lucky. Important note to all: b4 contacting tech support clean up your desktop and accessible screens.&nbsp;

<h2>            Epson Scanner 4870</h2>
                    <p>Every time Windows is updated, the scanner icon disappears from the desktop, as does the installed driver. Have tried the Windows scanner app, but this is hopeless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the original scanner install created a directory on C: drive, it is just a small matter to reinstall the Epson software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I feel this is totally unnecessary and cannot understand as to why it is uninstalled by Windows&nbsp;</p>
