<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93;MS keyboard and mouse center customization not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I am having problem with KB and Mouse combo 3000. I have customized some special buttons using the MS keyboard and mouse center on Windows 10. However, my customization no longer works, the customized buttons just perform their default function
 until I open the KB&amp;M center manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the most recent version of the center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this?</p>

<h3> ozarka kid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Foxconn 975X7AB problems installing Windows 7</h2>
                    I have been in computers since 1962 and have two documents on the wall thanking me for helping land the frst man on the MOON.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I always freeze up during the process of expanding the files during the installation of Windows 7 Pro.<br />
<br />
I have used several DVD's, several Thumb Drive methods and a Ghost install. <br />
<br />
All of them freeze up somewhere in the "expanding the files" process anywhere from 0% to about 85%.<br />
<br />
This is really driving me nuts and it seems there should be a SIMPLE Solurion out there somewhere.<br />
<br />
I have tried removing all non essental items and unplugged my SATA drives and DVD SATA burner because some say<br />
the IDE abd SATA harddrives clash during a wondows 7 install.<br />
<br />
I am pulling out what little hair I have left over this.<br />
<br />
Any sugestions are Greatly appreciated....<br />

            Your issue appears to be related to a defective RAM module(s) or incorrect CAS timings/RAM voltage settings&nbsp;in the BIOS.&nbsp; Visit the RAM manufacturer's support web site and obtain the recommended BIOS settings and use them.

            <p>I have had this problem for a very long time.&nbsp; My motherboard is a Foxconn P9657AB-8EKRS2H.&nbsp; I wanted to re-install Windows 7 so I could start with a fresh install.&nbsp; Everytime I tried to install it would freeze at expanding files.&nbsp; The activity lights on
 the CD-ROM and HDD would stop anywhere form 2% - 10%.&nbsp; I tried SATA drives, IDE drives every combo I could think of.&nbsp; I had Windows 7 already installed installed so at some point I must have done something right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well what solved it for me was the memory.&nbsp; I was running with 8 GB G-SKILL DDR2.&nbsp; I removed all the G.Skill modules and put in one 512 mb generic low end ValueRam I had laying around. After that the files expanded without issue and pretty quickly too I
 might add.&nbsp; Once WIndows 7 was installed I put all the G.Skill memory back in and it runs fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help others with this board because that will drive a person insane trying to troubleshoot.</p>

            Hi touchefriend,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
In order to burn the .vsp file in Windows Media Player, you’ll have to first convert the .vsp file to Windows Media File.
<br />
<br />
You can use a third party video file conversion tool to convert to a file supportable to burn in Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be
 solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.<br />

<p>This probably happens because<br />
a) you set up an automatic logon process some time ago and<br />
b) someone changed your password recently.</p>
<p>You can do this to resolve this issue:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a date when you could still log on.<br />
9. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.</p>
<p>After resolving this issue you should plan ahead: Click Start / Help, then look for help on "password". Follow the instructions to create a keyfile on your USB flash disk so that you will never again end up in this awkward situation.</p>

<p>So log on to the administrator account you set up specifically for this purpose and re-set the password.</p>
<p>Oh, you DIDN'T set up an emergence access User?</p>
<p>You can reset a password by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some</p>
<p>careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in</p>
<p>Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't</p>
<p>be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tape the Shift key five time. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have fixed this, <strong>create a new Admin user and call it "Admin" or "tech" or similar to keep for such an emergency.</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 recovery files not valid, windows 8 preinstalled</h2>
                    <p>my Sony Vaio Laptop will not factory reset or refresh, instead it asks for recovery media. After following the steps to create a recovery USB drive the factory reset and refresh programes both state that my recovery media isn't valid after it has been inserted,
 &nbsp;I have repeated these steps several time and have even created a windows 8.1 recovery drive on a different machine but none of these&nbsp;have worked.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have attempted to download windows 8 from the Microsoft website but as my laptop came preloaded with windows 8 I have no Product Key to verify and begin the download, any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has become a common problem... It seems that the Upgrade to Win 8.1 is damaging\modifying the system to the point that all of the tools fail,,, as you have noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you&nbsp;most likely need is the Win 8 Recovery Disk\Flash drive for your machine...</p>
<p>You might want to contact Sony and investigate this, as well as see if they have a solution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have one of these preinstalled machines to test, but I can make a couple of guesses as to what happened...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The Upgrade to Win 8.1 overwrote the Win 8 files, so you get the media missing type error.</p>
<p>2) The needed files are still there, but Win 8.1 Upgrade added another partition to your hard drive,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which caused the address to the needed files to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony may be able to help with #2... they may know which partition to delete to get the process to work...
</p>
<p>The needed media should be reasonable in price... which is what you most likely will have to do.</p>
<p>The license is the expensive part, which you already have... disks are cheap. Flash drives are a bit more expensive.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem with win 8 to 8.1 upgrade.&nbsp; I learned how to read the win 8 key off the pc.&nbsp; However when entering that key into a MS web site, MS said it was not a valid key.&nbsp; The problem is worse than this however.&nbsp; Those recovery bootable win
 8.1 disks are corrupted in the sense that if you try to restore a win 8.1 system image using a bootable recovery disk you created the partitions don't match what is on the machine and it does a reformatting of partitions, adding an extra new partition.&nbsp; What
 is all that about?&nbsp; It looks like a virus to me.&nbsp; You may have to only do image restores from within win 8.1 by going to setting from a left swipe, then choose change pc settings and then restore and from there choose the advanced restore and image restore.&nbsp;
 Check to make sure the partitions agree with whats supposed to be for the C drive and whatever you do, don't put on an image with that extra partition on it.&nbsp; Now the above process failed on me today by even the above process tried to create an extra partition.&nbsp;
 But I found that the USB port driver was corrupted.&nbsp; Note that avast did not find this problem.&nbsp; I was able to fix the corrupted usb port driver by reinstalling the intel blue tooth network software from intel.&nbsp; I think the driver was corrupted from a web
 site I visited.&nbsp; You can also detect if the usb port driver has been tampered with by going to devices and if you get an error for your pc on the usb port then reinstall the intel blue tooth networking driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why did I need that product key?&nbsp; My win 8.1 is running fine.&nbsp; Well I wanted to be able to create a bootable usb drive from the Microsoft web site, but to do so required you have the windows 8.1 key.&nbsp; I have my key but its not recognized by MS.&nbsp; I would
 have to pay $120 to MS to outright buy a new copy of windows 8.1 and install it on the existing system.&nbsp; Its not worth it.&nbsp; If the system&nbsp;fails I will start over with win 8 recovery dvds and build up the system from scratch again.&nbsp; Hopefully this can be done
 quickly with all the system image copies I have lying around.&nbsp; By the way you can save multiple images on a single disk by renaming the saved image from the original name of your computer.&nbsp; The restore will use the renamed copies - I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony sure did not treat us right on that product key did they!</p>

            <p>It's not a Sony issue, it's a microsoft one. There are countless threads about this issue and no real solution outside of of starting 8 from scratch and going through update after update until you get to the point you can update to 8.1. Or you can do the
 8.1 download trick. There's no real solution, and I asked about this issue specifically in this thread:
</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_install/why-are-windows-8-keys-not-valid-for-windows-81/a63fbdf1-8242-4748-9aac-e5320b381ff5?tm=1413047974194</p>
<p>
</p><p>Makes no sense 8 keys don't work for 8.1. The fact that there are threads like this popping up all the time is evidence of it. They blame piracy for it. Dolts try and say they are completely different operating systems. Many excuses but no solutions.

            <p>Its not quite that bad.&nbsp; If you could make a good image of your win 8.1 system when it has the correct partitions and also is free of viruses, then all you need to do is recover the pc image from inside win 8.1.&nbsp; If you have such a messed up system that
 you must reinstall win 8 from scratch, once you get the initial installation done, then you can move on to your good image from inside win 8.&nbsp; The only problem I see is that usb port bootup recovery.&nbsp; That's the one to avoid.</p>

            <p>Sorry. That is a pain when you're trying to wipe and sell your laptop. Then expect the next person to have to deal with that when one of the selling points of Windows 8.x is the ease of a refresh or clean wipe. Having to image, backup and what not completely
 defeats the purpose. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that I don't appreciate the help, but everyone offers workarounds without actually addressing the issue.

<h2>            Surface Pro 6 immediately overheats when setting performance to maximum</h2>
                    <p>I recently noticed that the performance settings with power cable connected were set to minimum. I changed that to maximum performance, however I immediately noticed my mouse freezing up about once a second as soon as the device had to do some processing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I analyzed that problem further using the performance graph on the task manager and learned that as soon as I increase the performance setting from anything but the lowest setting, then on even the slightest workload the device would immediately overheat
 the CPU, freeze the system and drop the clock speed to 0.4 GHz for a moment&nbsp;to cool down. This does not happen when the performance setting is set to minimum, however then the CPU performance will be constantly limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue? Is there a fix for it?</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, I tried doing it again, and it didn't work.</p>
<p>A few days ago I decided to try it again randomly, and it worked.</p>
<p>I try it again today, and it doesn't work again!</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me with what's going on, or guide me to an app that'll let me project my phone's screen on my laptop?</p>

    <title>0x80070427 error for MatSvc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabeth23  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x80070427 error for MatSvc</h2>
                    <p>Running xp pro, svc pk 3, ie 8 32bit. </p>
<p>I receive this error when I try to run Microsoft Fix-it. The program installed fine, and runs fine when I use it to check problems. But I keep getting this error msg in event viewer under applications.
</p>
<p>While researching the website, it stated requirements were for xp pro, 64 bit not for 32 bit. Could this be why I am getting errors?</p>
<p>Any assistance is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How do I view a list of deleted files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was experimenting with the Voice Control option in Windows 7, and I think I may have accidentally deleted an important file&nbsp;on one of my hard drives.&nbsp; How do I see a list of recently deleted files on Windows 7, preferably without downloading/installing
 anything third-party?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, XPAero</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(BTW I'm an advanced PC user, so I have tried a lot of the normal stuff, e.g. the Recycle Bin)</p>

            Recuva will possibly show you everything that has been deleted if it has been over written yet,<br />
But it will have to be downloaded.

</p><p>I have this issue with Xbox where I can't join any clubs because my privacy settings don't allow me to. But when I head over to my privacy settings, joining clubs is allowed... I have seen more people with this issue but haven't been able to find a fix for

<p>Hey Lennard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should've been more specific when I mentioned if you had a console because the 360 does not have the Club feature I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to ask if there was also trouble joining clubs on the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the error message you get when trying to join a club?</p>

<p>
</p><p>On Xbox.com I would turn the setting to join clubs to blocked, sign out from your account then sign back in, change the setting back to allow and see if that helps. After changing it back to allow it may be a good idea to sign out and back in one more time
 and then try to join a club.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that helps!</p>

<p>Hi Diego,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just tried it but it does not work. When I clicked 'Accept' to join the club on my browser (tried both Safari and Chrome), nothing happened. So I tried it on the Xbox app on iOS, logged out and back it, but when I tried to join the club I got the same message.
 I will add a screenshot which is in Dutch, but this is the message I get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there's a fix for this.</p>

<p>I am not aware that I have a child account, I never created it like that nor are there any 'parents' connected to my account. So it can't be a child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean with try another account? If I switch to another account I don't have any games on there, and as I said earlier, I do not own an Xbox One, I'm on Windows.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is it not allowing you to join clubs for any game or just one game specifically? Also have you tried creating a club just for troubleshooting purposes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been something known for joining or creating clubs for Forza Horizon 4 on the Xbox app for Windows 10.</p>

<p>Already answered that question in a previous post :) It is for all clubs, not for a specific game. But the club I want to join is for Forza Horizon 4 yes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are correct apologies for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By any chance would you happen to have another Xbox account that you may be able to try and join/create a party so we can see if it's an account issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest to report this issue to Microsoft through the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Feedback Hub on Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I recommend to possibly contact <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Support </a>to see if there is anything they can see on your account that could be contributing to this.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Has Reactivated Itself</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago I had to refresh my Windows 8.1 desktop PC because some lousy updates from Microsoft ruined my machine. &nbsp;On reinstalling Windows (and downloading the 8.1 version overnight), I set Windows not to install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I MADE CERTAIN OF THIS</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this morning, I came along and found out that my computer wants to restart in order to update my computer! &nbsp;No I ain't joking! &nbsp;So now I am having to one by one, uninstall the updates before I can restart my computer!!!! &nbsp;THIS IS STUPID!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the updates are from Microsoft Office, and I am wondering if it is Microsoft Office that has reinstated Windows Update on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT IS THE POINT IN HAVING THE FUNCTION TO DEACTIVATE WINDOWS UPDATE WHEN OFFICE REINSTATES IT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WOULD LIKE MICROSOFT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WITH ALL THE PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD WITH WINDOWS 8 I CERTAINLY WON'T BE UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Answer-by-number, please:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When (exact date &amp; time, if possible) did you do the Refresh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When (ditto) did you install Win8.1 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When (ditto) did you install Office again? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. After you complete the Refresh, how long was the computer connected to the internet before you changed your Automatic Updates (AU)&nbsp;setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did you change AU to the <strong>Download updates but let me choose...</strong> option, the
<strong>Check for updates but let me choose...</strong> option, or did you just&nbsp;turn AU off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>==============================================================<br />
[1] Installing MS Office (or one or&nbsp;more Windows Essentials) will (a) re-enable AU [if it had been disabled] and (b) set AU to the default Automatic (Recommended)&nbsp;setting. This is spelled out in the EULA gobbledygook&nbsp;but hardly anyone reads that, right?</p>

            <p>Hi. I had something similar&nbsp;happen to me today, when I was getting Error Code 08007002.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I'm going to disconnect from&nbsp;WiFi when shutting my computer off. That way nothing will get installed without me being here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what I supposed to do, followed the step-by-step instructions VERY carefully.&nbsp;Turned off Window Updates and continued&nbsp;and when&nbsp;told&nbsp;to&nbsp; turn it&nbsp;Window Updates back on, it had already turned itself on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not been watching the progress of the updates, been letting my computer install and shut down. No telling what I missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have it fixed now.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Internet connection fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any <strong>error message </strong>while connecting to Internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might experience network or Internet connection issues in Windows for a number of reasons. Some common issues that can cause these problems are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrupted or incompatible drivers. </li><li>Network connection settings. </li><li>Hardware or software problems. </li><li>There's interference from other devices. </li><li>Your router and the network adapter in your PC might not work together.</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't connect to a network, there might be a problem with your network adapter, the piece of hardware that makes it possible for your PC to connect to a network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, try using the Network Adapter troubleshooter to automatically find and fix some problems. This troubleshooter will disable and re-enable the adapter and try some other common repairs. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Click <strong>Network and Internet</strong>, and run the <strong>
Network Adapter troubleshooter</strong>, and follow the instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on your screen and check. </p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Try to uninstall the network adapter driver, and then restart your computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver.Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. Right click </strong>on <strong>Start</strong>, select <strong>Device Manager
</strong>and navigate to <strong>Network adapters </strong>&gt; the network adapter </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Right-click (or press and hold) the network adapter, and then select
<strong>Uninstall</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete the driver </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software for this device </strong>check box &gt; <strong>OK</strong> to confirm you want to uninstall it.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>After uninstalling the driver, select the <strong>Start </strong>
button &gt; <strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your PC restarts, Windows will automatically look for and install the network adapter driver. Check to see if that fixes your connection problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            PC reset without removing Microsoft Office and Edge</h2>
                    <p>I would like to reset my pc as I have a lot of unnecessary things on the system. I currently have all Microsoft Office programs, e.g. Word, Powerpoint, Exel, etc. However, I am uncertain that Office and Edge will remain on my laptop if I reset the laptop.
 I have tried to reset with back up files but it doesn't give me an option to only remove certain apps.

<p>Some help would be great.</p>

            Hi Chris, resetting Windows 10 will remove Office, Edge will not be touched, but you will loose your bookmarks . ..  etc., there will be no option to keep Office, you will have to re-install Office after the reset.
<br />
<br />What version of Office do you currently have installed?

<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>I do not know the exact version of Office but it apparently says that I have Office 2016 but I am not sure as my mum got it for me to do homework etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I do know that it is a fairly recent version as I was given it about a year ago.</p>

            Why not just uninstall what you don't want? Resetting is a major operation: You'll start with a fresh copy of Windows but then you'll have to update it, which could take a long time, then re-install your software, restore your backed up personal data,
 and set everything up the way you like it. I'd consider that a 'last resort' choice.

    <title>Slow transfer speeds to USB 2.0 flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bk201  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow transfer speeds to USB 2.0 flash drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I know that this topic has appeared once or twice in these forums but there haven't been any resolutions and they've been quiet lately so I started a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I migrated from Windows XP to 7 and found this problem. When I try to copy a file (a 1.2GB video) to a usb flash drive that I know is usb 2.0 hi-speed (copying files to it in xp were really fast) it takes over 2 minutes. 7 reports that it is copying
 at 3-4 MB/sec. When I copy from the flash drive to my computer it copies at about 9-10MB/sec. I've also tried plugging it into the rear ports but that doesn't change the transfer speed at all. I know it isn't something related to the flash stick itself because
 transferring files to it in xp were a lot faster.</p>
<p>Some random information: Transferring files from one hard drive to another averages at about 60MB/sec (both of the hard drives are SATA II drives). I'm not sure what speed it should be but it doesn't feel drastically slower than on my xp machine. Windows
 7 and my device drivers are all up-to-date.</p>
<p>System specs:</p>
<p>Dell optiplex GX620</p>
<p>Pentium 4 3.2GHz</p>
<p>2GB Ram</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional 32-bit</p>
<p>AVG 9 free edition anti-virus</p>
<p>My setup is almost identical to how it was on my windows xp machine except I have less programs installed so there isn't something new that could have caused problems.</p>

<p>Hi BK201,</p>
<p>I've actually tested copying a 1.2 GB file to a flash drive on both an XP machine and a Windows 7 machine and I'm getting almost the exact same speeds (between 3 and 5 MB/s). These speeds are very normal for USB 2.0 flash drives. The vast majority of flash
 drives read (copy to the computer) faster than they write (copy to the flash drive). That's why you're seeing the difference in speed when copying to the computer.</p>
<p>If you still feel that the USB speeds are slower and you still have the issue in safe mode, the only thing I can recommend is to get the latest Windows 7 chipset driver. Considering Dell doesn't offer<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?journalid=8B345EAD62C42C44E040AC0A63E97D42&amp;docid=364757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 7</a> (or <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/solutions/en/winvista_faqs_rel?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=prem#faq06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Vista</a>) drivers for the GX620, your drivers are likely <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;up-to-date. The best I can do is recommend contacting Dell for any Windows 7 drivers they might have.</p>

<p>Hi Cody,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I can't do any tests of my own on my XP machine because 7 has replaced it but it does feel slower. Perhaps it's just my imagination. I noticed that if I copied that 1 GB file to the flash drive that if I cancel it the
 computer locks up and will only respond if I pull out the flash drive (can't even disconnect it properly. I have to just pull it out). Is this a bug or just something related to my out-dated chipset drivers?</p>

            Cody,<br />
<br />
Have you or anyone in your community figured out why USB and hard drive transfer rates are slow in 7 compared to XP.&nbsp; My Dell Studio 1735 has a 4 GB ram and 2.1GHz Dual core.&nbsp; With two hard drive bays, I installed XP pro on one and 7 Ultimate x64 on the other.<br />
<br />
The 7 had rates ranging from 466Kb /s to 8 Mb /s&nbsp; (up to 25 Mb /s when transferring to 2nd hard drive).
<br />
<br />
The XP ranged from 5Mb /s to 20+Mb /s (up to 40Mb /s when transferring to 2nd hard drive).<br />
<br />
After searching online, I see this is a common issue with Vista / 7.<br />
<br />
Any reason why this is?&nbsp; Or suggestions to increase the USB transfer? <br />

            Cody C, you obviosly don't pay attention to much then, almost every problem i see posted, you have a cookie-cutter response of:<br />
<br />
Since I don't have any other reports of that issue, it's most likely due to the drivers.
<br />
<br />
When in fact, if you just did a simple google search of 75 - 90% of these issues, you'll see SEVERAL examples..
<br />
<br />
If you don't know what the issue is, simply say " my guess would be XXXX " or " i have no personal experience with XXX " or " I simply don't know "<br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
As for the 5 - 6mb/s transfer rate being " normal " it's not, that's slow for USB 2.0 or better. the actual cause of the problem is vinsta and win 7's approach to making USB devices safer to remove (in case of error during transfer i'm sure)
<br />
<br />
here's the way to get around that HUGE bottle-neck:<br />
<br />
<span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span>In <b>Device Manager</b>, right-click the USB drive in
<b>Disk drives</b> folder, then select <b>Properties</b>, switch to <b>Policies </b>
tab, and choose <b>Optimize for performance</b>. Click OK to keep it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After performing this fix for myself, my transfer rate on a cheapo cruizer micro went from 4.5 - 5mb/s to 20 - 30mb/s on small files, and average of 10 - 15mb/s on huge file transfers<br />

            <p>I get the same problem too and its the update drivers response all the time but how come windows xp transfers faster and it doesnt update drivers as much as windows 7 does.&nbsp; Win XP usb rates were worlds better then Vista/7 ever is and I dont know why Microsoft
 just doesnt go back to that code or offer it to those that want the faster rates we used to get back then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I transfered an 500meg&nbsp;avi file from my microsd card to my pc harddisk and it took about 45 secs (what windows said with a 10mb/sec rate)&nbsp; and same file to my usb drive started off ok with a 3mb rate then half way through it died to a measly 300kb/sec and
 now says a 20min wait.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats not counting the speed slows down even more at times.</p>

<br />
i have the same problem...my flashdrives copied and saved at blazing speeds with xp compared to windows 7 which is slower then snail mail.......and when you format a flashdisk it takes10 times longer which sucks.......microsoft needs to fix this problem with
 windows 7 ....which in all other areas i like much better then xp.....its just the snail mail motion of flashdisk speed&nbsp;on 7 which blows...or maybe they just want us to buy a computer with usb 20.0 huh instead of 2.0

    <title>samba connections not restored after windows 10 creator update version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronkirschner  say:</h3>
<h2>            samba connections not restored after windows 10 creator update version 1703</h2>
                    <p>When I first updated to Windows 10 last year, I experienced problems with not being able to reconnect my samba server shares. &nbsp;I discovered in advanced settings that a parameter had changed to allow windows to manage homegroup connections. &nbsp;I changed that
 back to use user accounts and passwords to connect to other computers and all was good again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week on 2 computers the same has happened but the same fix no longer works. &nbsp;I've also made sure that I added regedit AllowinsecureGuest dword=1 and added windows credential for the shares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We already have enabled plain passwords for samba.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restored to previous versions but it keeps on updating again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANy solution would be appreciated.</p>

<p>You can block the upgrade using the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.

<h2>            Windows update changed icon on rar zip files to PDF</h2>
                    Ever since the recent September Windows 10 update all rar zip files are now showing the pdf icon and if you try to open or extract these rar files&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;automatically tries to open them as pdf's.&nbsp; Why has this happened?&nbsp; All versions of Windows, including
 previous Windows 10 builds, have recognized and labeled rar files with the correct icon.

            Settings does not give you that option.&nbsp; Instead it directs you to the Windows App Store where you are invited to sell your soul by signing in to your Microsoft account, which forever makes you have to sign in to your computer with a password every time
 you start your computer thereafter.&nbsp; No thanks, been there done that.&nbsp; Years ago I signed into Windows with the correct password at least 50 times and it said it was wrong password.&nbsp; I had to wipe my hard drive clean, losing all my files to reset computer.&nbsp;
 I don't trust any version of Windows with sign on passwords.&nbsp; And to make matters worse, I already have the free app that unzips rar files on my computer but the app does not show up as an option in settings/Default programs.

            <p>Here is a screen shot of several rar files wrongly labeled with the Adobe logo as the default app.&nbsp; If you go to settings/default apps there is no option to change this to correct program.&nbsp; Instead you are directed to the Microsoft App Store to download
 an app I already have on my computer but Windows can't seem to recognize since the September update of version 1511.</p>

At the end of the day I only get the subject list and no contents of the messages. This is for all accounts.<br />
<br />
I received the message. Message cannot displayed, try later again.<br />
<br />
Can you help me to repair this big problem for me? (more than 3000 messages!)<br />
