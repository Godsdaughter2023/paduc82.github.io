<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this information. I came across this forum since I was having a slightly different issue with&nbsp;<span>At startup, open files in ____</span><span>&nbsp;feature, which I have finally resolved on my own. I am posting here
 in case someone else has the same issue. My apologies if this is a faux pas, but I couldn't find my same problem anywhere else.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My issue was that Excel was NOT opening the file in the folder I designated. I moved the file to my Documents folder - feeling safe because it was the only Excel file in there after moving it, and Excel tried to open EVERY file in the Documents folder,
 no matter what the extension. Only problem, it still didn't open the file I wanted it to!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Somehow I stumbled upon the fact that Excel wanted to save my file as [filename]1.xlxs This made me look again at the file, and it had no extension at all! Once I saved it with the .xlsx extension, Excel would open it at startup as directed in the
 Excel Preferences no matter what folder I put it in. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Of course, I'm also getting the blank document opening, as well, but am happy I got my document to work right since I use it every day.&nbsp;</span><span>Am hoping they will fix this current issue soon.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>As for the missing .xslx extension, are you sure it was missing? One of the stupidest features of Windows is that by default it suppresses file name extensions from view in Explorer windows. One of the first things I do on a newly set up Windows machine
 is to change that setting in Explorer Options. macOS has an analogous setting in Finder Preferences, Advanced panel:
<strong>Show all filename extensions</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my issue with the correct file opening plus an unwanted blank file opening occurs only on the latest Mac version of Office 365. I have the same Office 365 subscription installed on a Windows machine, opening the same startup folder, which is managed
 by Dropbox to have the same contents on both machines. The correct file opens on both machines. The unwanted blank opens only on the Mac, not on the Windows machine.</p>

<p>@ Ordinant: Thanks for your comments. I am not completely sure if the extension was missing or not. I am on Mac OS Sierra and some file extensions show and others don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;(My Finder settings for "Show All Filename Extensions" was not checked, but checking
 it seems to make little difference.) It was originally from a template file that I most likely "Saved As." So just could have been the old extension or who knows; but thanks for the info on converting all old spreadsheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the my other comment, let me clarify... You're right - I had moved the file to the Documents folder, then changed&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>At startup, open files in .../Documents. (I wondered it there was something wrong with my original folder name and
 was testing that theory.) </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a side note, I still laugh when it attempted to open every file in Documents (luckily I didn't have that many that weren't in other folders). I realize now that it says "...open ALL documents in ..." so it was true to its statement, but
 had assumed it would only open Excel documents. I wonder what need there would be to attempt to open all file types, even those it cannot open. Interesting. lol!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>btw, I have updated to 16.10, and MS has not yet fixed the extra blank sheet yet. :(</span></p>

<h2>            excel 2016 for mac vlookup issue</h2>
                    I'm using excel 2016 for mac and the vlookup function is returning incorrect data.&nbsp; I am looking up a series of sales figures by product by year by state (each identified by a unique code).&nbsp; If a data point doesn't exist (e.g., TX2014prod1), instead of
 returning an error, it pulls the data from the next line down (TN2014prod1).&nbsp; I have retyped the formula at least 10 times, deleted the sheet and started again and deleted the source data and restarted the spreadsheet.&nbsp; but each time, same error with vlookup.&nbsp;
 Any suggestions?

            Dear Manohar,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Not quite. When you request a reset you need to verify it by putting a code that you will receive to your strong proofs. If you do not have access to them, you will not be able to submit the request.
<br />
<br />More you will find in this support article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a>

<br />
<br />You can, but the email will be triggered only if you will put a correct one, so you cannot put any kind of email.
<br />
<br />Hope this clarifies things.

            Dear Manohar,
<br />
<br />I have tested it for my account and it didn't trigger the email when I have chosen that I do not have access to any safe proofs. Also, if you will do, you will be brought to recovery account option which will allow submitting request to Microsoft Account support in order to validate your account. Obviously if someone does not have access to the information that you have provided while creating the account, does not have your current password or previous passwords, does not have your contacts, is not aware about emails and has no clue about safe proofs, there is no way to recover account.

<h2>            Hyperlink showing up in emails on Outlook for Mac 2016</h2>
                    When I read my emails in Outlook version 15.21.1 on my Mac Book Pro, if I hover over a hyperlink a white box appears with the whole hyperlink address. &nbsp;How do I get the links to go into the grey bar at the bottom or at least stop the annoying popup of

            Only last 30 days of conversations are stored on cloud. So from Microsoft servers, you can retrieve only last 30 days of conversations.
<br />
<br />For conversations, older than last 30 days, you need to access your old computer and retrieve your main.db file.

<h2>            Access 2007 Runtime will not run certain parts of the program</h2>
                    
<p>I am not a bigtime developer, but have developed numerous databases for very small business clients, and they have always worked.&nbsp; I have Access 2007.&nbsp; I developed a database - FE/BE - for a client who does not have any Office program.&nbsp; I downloaded Runtime
 2007 onto his standalone computer and installed the database.&nbsp; It opens, and looks good - but many of the buttons will not work.</p>
<p>My understanding of Runtime (as per Albert Kallal) is that Runtime is Access without the navigation pane and the (detested) ribbon; this means that my client cannot make unexpected alterations, which I like.&nbsp; It should also mean that the database works as
 it is designed.</p>
<p>When preparing a database, I put every action/command/whatever on the various screens, or I create appropriate shortcut rightclick menus; This means I don't need the ribbon.</p>
<p>I have worked out that the button to run a spellcheck will not work unless I download a spellcheck program (from somewhere), and maybe the same for a pdf/email button.&nbsp; With someone's advice, I overcame the link problem.</p>
<p>However, a button to open a form should work; instead it gives me a message - so quick that I have trouble reading it - then closes the database completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing?&nbsp; and where wil li find a spellcheck and pdf?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, I did give in and buy a copy of 2010 for my client - but it refuses to run the database, too.</p>

<p>Gina, Thanks for the spellcheck - I will use it, but Spellcheck is the least of my problems, as I have worked out that the database&nbsp; is in READ ONLY mode - at least, that;s what it tells me, and the buttons that won't work are the ones that say&nbsp; 'Open a
 form and got to a new record".</p>
<p>As for trusted Location, here's a summary of all my actions to date - usually as a result of advice from someone on the internet:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saved the database as c:\program files\mydatabase\mydatabase.accdr -&nbsp; to overcome the problem of the FE linking to the BE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have converted most macros to VBA - some (eg addmenu) will not convert, but work anyway</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have adjusted the registry to allow the location as trusted</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked that each file is NOT marked READ ONLY</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have ensured that the User has full rights to the program</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have renamed the FE as .accdr</p>
<p>The database works just fine on my computer, including when run \Runtime</p>
<p>Transfer it to the other computer and I get&nbsp;&nbsp; [This database has been opened Read Only.&nbsp; You can only change data in linked tables. To make design changes, save a copy of the database]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because this database will run on a single computer, no network involved, and following instructions by Albert Kallal on using runtime, I have ignored the Package Solution unitl today.</p>
<p>When it asks for a Root Install folder, you are given 6 options and Program Files has (All users, Read Only on Vista).&nbsp; Ha! I thought, that's the problem, so I saved it to User Appdata (Current User) - but it is still READ ONLY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am desperate for a solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Have you right moused click on the database file itself to insure it's not Read Only which happens sometimes when copying the database from one location to the other?

            One of the major problems with using the runtime is that error messages are cryptic. You have to include a great deal of error trapping when deploying using the runtime. If errors are occurring then you have to test using a full version to debug.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for all the advice;&nbsp; I finally have the cause of my problems, and the solution.</p>
<p>I had created a database - FE/BE - for a small business, which has only Runtime, so the problem was&nbsp; linking the two on the business computer</p>
<p>Early on, I was seeking advice on how to overcome the linking problems; someone recommended saving the file on my computer to c:\program files\mydatabase;&nbsp; this I did.&nbsp; It worked on my computer, but not on the business one.&nbsp; After weeks of frustration, lots
 of research, and lots of help from all the online gurus who are so willing to give their time and advice (thanks and God bless you all), I was getting better educated, but still had a database that wouldn't work.&nbsp; Finally, I decided to have another look at
 the Package Solution, which is really overkill for what I needed.&nbsp; Browsing through this, I found that c:\Program files\ is read only on Vista!!&nbsp; So now I knew why my program was Read Only; all I had to do was move it somewhere else - and overcome the link
 problem.&nbsp; I have several answers from various people, but the simplest for me in the short term was to create a new User on my computer, name it as on the business computer -&nbsp; C:\User\Luke&nbsp; set up the links, then copy it to his computer - c:\User\Luke - and
 it works like a dream.</p>
<p>Yes, I will finish the job more professionally, but it has got him up and running.</p>
<p>So again, thanks to all who contributed to my education</p>

            Did you compile the database to an ACCDE file?&nbsp; If not, you should.&nbsp; It will help you avoid runtime errors that crash the program.&nbsp; It isn't a panacea but it does help.&nbsp; If you leave it as an ACCDB file then you have to ensure to provide "bullet-proof"
 error handling.&nbsp; That at least would hopefully stop the initial crash and give you a chance to figure some things out.

<h2>            MSN Weather update published today to address live tile &#38; lock screen localization issues &#40;WP 8.1 App&#41;</h2>
                    <p>MSN Weather Update (build # 3.1.4.413) was published today to address live tile &amp; lock screen localization issues. You will now be able to see live tile and lock screen weather conditions and details in the localized language and not in English as previously
 reported (assuming your WP device has language and region set to non-English).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to get the Weather app automatically updated on your WP Device if you have auto-updates turned ON. If you have auto-updates turned OFF, you need to go to the Store and search for the App and then download the update manually.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, with this update come new bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Context:</p>
<p>Win 8.1 Pro x64 en-US, Time zone GMT+1, geographic location France.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:</p>
<p>"MSN Weather" Live Tile does not update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>- attempted the Apps Troubleshooter, to no avail.</p>
<p>- attempted uninstall/reinstall of MSN Weather app, to no aval.</p>
<p>- attempted to alter the OS Settings to 'Time zone GMT-8', geographic location 'United States', then the live tile updates again, everything works as expected. Upon reverting the OS Settings to 'Time zone GMT+1' and geographic location 'France', then opening
 the MSN Weather app, from then on the live tile no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's something rotten in the kingdom of Windows 8.1. Looks like Microsoft has big trouble dealing with anything that's not US-focused, US-related, US-centric...</p>

            <p>I experienced the same problem.&nbsp; The live tile was not updating, even if I opened the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unpinned the tile from the front screen, and then repinned to the front screen.&nbsp; It has been working correctly for several days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the problem was a result of the upgrade, but I do recall installing the upgrade recently.</p>

                    <span>
<p>Hi! I'm in the need of deplying an Excel template for all users in our domain. This template only contains color palette and nothing more. But I thought it'd be just be as easy as copying an xlsx file to the users XLSTART folder. But this results in two
 workbooks being opened whenever the user opens an existing Excel document. However, when the users just open Excel, everything seems fine. But when they open an existing document, two workbooks are open.</p>
<p>This is Microsoft Excel 2007 btw. Also, both Windows XP and Windows 7.</p>

<p><span>In 07 Theme Colors are shared among all Office application , If you save them in the right place you will have access to them from all Office applications including Excel.</span></p>
<p><span>First create your theme color in PowerPoint &nbsp;&nbsp;( Powerpoint\Design tab\Colors\create new theme color)</span></p>
<p><span><span>Office has its own themes saved in<span>C:\Program Files\Microsoft
 Office\Document Themes 12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; , but when you create your first Theme it adds three new folders (Theme color, Theme Effects, theme Font, they don't exist if you haven't created any custom theme and as I mentioned in my case they are in path given above)
 . </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As far as their location It could slightly vary depending on how IT has installed Office. In my case it is in&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;C:\Prog</span></span></span></span><span>ram
 Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Document Themes\Theme Colors .<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;You can create a custom theme and do a search to find its location and them you can ask IT to publish all those XML file for all the users in the same directory.</p>
<p>So you don't need to distribute any Excel files, just XMLs.</p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One of the nice features about the Windows 8.1 Reset is that it allows one to "Clean the Drive" Fully during the installation.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It would be nice if users could run this during the Windows setup by booting from Windows 10 installation media (without using DiskPart) and not just through a reset. This would help them wipe out their previous Windows Vista/7/8.1
 installation. Now Microsoft aren't making Windows upgrade only adding this to the Windows 10 installation shouldn't cause issues.</p>

            <p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new feature which has been added to Windows 10 Technical Preview recovery options.
</p>
<p><span>If you’re just resetting the PC for your own use, choose “Just remove my files,” as the process is much faster. The second option, “Fully clean the drive,” is there for when you are giving or selling the PC to someone else and you want to ensure that
 they can’t use a PC forensics utility to mine data off the supposedly erased hard drive. It’s much more time consuming than the first option, but also makes your PC safe for transfer to a new owner.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if you chose the first option to remove only files then your files can be recovered by any other user as your personal files will be just marked as delete it will not be removed. The second option will completely remove your apps personal files and
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to provide a feedback to Microsoft using the Feedback App. <span>
Use the Windows Feedback app to tell us which features you love, or when something could be better on Windows.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to <strong>Start</strong> , enter the phrase <strong>
Windows Feedback</strong>, then select Windows Feedback.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi, I havent used the MS Utilities yes as we have had to revert back to 1708 Deferred Channel to resolve this issue for ALL of our users. Since the machines were updated to 1802 or 1803 then they have had issues rendering above 1080p and getting the lag
 in Outlook (especially when pressing enter for a new line) This has been tested with 1708 and the issue we are seeing is resolved and we can use in high resolution. This needs to be resolved before 1708 support expires.

<h2>            How can I edit a contact from an imported group&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have imported a group sent to me from a friend.&nbsp; I have the group and can change the group name.&nbsp; However, because the contacts in this group are not my particular contacts, I cannot change the email addresses or display name.&nbsp; I double click the contact
 name, open the contact and get the screen with all the fields, make the changes and click Save and Close.&nbsp; It will not update in the group screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that with Outlook 2010, unless a group member is a contact too, I can't change it.&nbsp; How does this work when importing a group?&nbsp; Can I add all of the contacts in the imported group to my Contact list as individuals?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            &#34;My Collection&#34; empty.</h2>
                    I started a trial for Zunepass yesterday. I downloaded about 150 songs. It was my assumption that I would be able to listen to these songs with the zune software with which I used to download the songs. This was the case yesterday after I downloaded the
 songs. Everything was working great and then today when I opened Zune, there were no songs in my collection. I even used the search function on the start button and the songs could not be found. I re-downloaded one of the songs and searched it again in the
 start menu and it found it. Apparently, the songs were automatically deleted from the computer and "my collection". Even when I went to look for some of the songs that I had previously downloaded, they had "download" as an option rather than "already in collection".&nbsp;
 Am I going to have to download the songs everytime I restart Zune? Is this just a bug? Is this specific to the trial only? To be honest I am interested in keeping zunepass, but not if it is going to function like this.<br />

<p>The Zune Pass is not supposed to work this way. Could it be that you streamed the songs instead of downloading them? This could explain the issue. Please let me know if I can be of furter assistance. Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers! Have a nice day,</p>

            Couple of errors in your formula. You must use OR if you are doing multiple checks and you have double quotes around your sheet and cell references which means it will be checking as if this was a literal string and not the contents of the cell on the

<span>Hi Asdrubal,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>The downloaded Office applications’ default language is based on the display language of the users’ portal. As you can’t change the display language for users once, users
 may need to manually change the option to select the language when downloading the Office applications.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

<p>At this time, very few fonts contain the necessary information for these features. Try using the Gabriola font with a couple of the more extreme stylistic sets, such as numbers 5 and 6. Ligatures for<br />
'fi' and 'ffi' should work with some of the newer fonts that come with Office 2010, such as Calibri and Constantia.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Issues with Generic&#47;Shared Mailboxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hightorie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Issues with Generic&#47;Shared Mailboxes</h2>
                    <p>Our&nbsp;Outlook was&nbsp;migrated this week to Office 365.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spend 90% of my workday in a generic/shared mailbox, and prior to the switch, if I deleted or sent anything in that mailbox, it would go to the deleted or sent folders for that mailbox.&nbsp; In addition, if
 I started a new email in that mailbox, it would by default send from that mailbox.&nbsp; And, I could set up the OOO messages for that mailbox, which I need to do on a fairly regular basis, by just clicking on the File tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the migration, all of the sent/deleted go to my personal work email account's sent/deleted folders.&nbsp; If I start a new email in the generic mailbox, it defaults to send from my personal work email account, and I have to choose the generic one every
 single time, which&nbsp;I can't be sure I'll remember to do!&nbsp; I can no longer set the OOO for the generic box either, unless I use the very tedious workaround that involves me closing Outlook and waiting a solid 5 minutes to log back in under the generic mailbox.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is incredibly frustrating!&nbsp; Does anyone have any advice or experience with a good fix for this?&nbsp; I&nbsp;am using Win10, and was LOVING it until this switch.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;

<p>Hello HighTorie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow the steps below to send emails from the shared mailbox: </p>
<p>1. Open Outlook. Choose <strong>New Email</strong>.</p>
<p>2. If you don't see the <strong>From</strong> field at the top of your message, choose
<strong>Options &gt; From</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>From</strong> in the message, and change to the shared email address. If you don't see your shared email address, choose
<strong>Other email address</strong> and then type in the shared email address. Choose OK.
</p>
<p>4. Finish typing your message and then choose Send.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, then it is a normal behavior that the sent emails will go to the sent items of the primary mailbox. Because you have the delegate access of the shared mailbox and you are sending emails on behalf or as the shared mailbox.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to the OOO messages, I’m not clear what it means. Would you mind explain it or make an example for better understanding? You can also capture some screenshots for further check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

    <title>6760 - turn by turn disconnects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cvindura  say:</h3>
<h2>            6760 - turn by turn disconnects</h2>
                    
<p>hi</p>
<p>have a 6760 with the map for Australia installed with english female (UK) voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can load ovi maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can connect to the satelite to get my position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When connected to the satetlite, you get a first screen. If I type in an address, or use a favourite stored location, and select "drive to" or "walk to", the phone will calculate a route and the voice will start to give me directions. A second screen then
 loads by default to a 3D view where your position is represented by an arrow, and a blue line shows the route direction. The phone essentially behaves like a standalone GPS at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after a short while as popup shows to say something like "....this will take a few moments".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this, the voice and route features shutdown and the screen is returned to just the 2d positioning map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to get the "drive to"/"walk to" route calculation with voice direction to stay on (obviously)...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can any one help?</p>

<p>The 6760 is a phone that does not get free voice guidance. Perhaps that's related to this problem? Do you get a pop-up requesting to download a license?</p>

<p>I downloaded a voice (English - UK female) using Ovi suite. It works for a little (ie I can hear voice directions) until I get the popup.&nbsp; I noticed that when I set the GPS to only integrated GPS, and the internet to "ask..." , the popup changes to something
 like "phone needs to connect to the shop..." So the voice needs a license? Cheers</p>

<p>Voice guidance is not free for all phones; that's correct.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office 2010 Starter Download Legal or Illegal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 Starter Download Legal or Illegal</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft Community,
<div><br />
<div>I am using <b>Windows XP SP3 x86&nbsp;</b>and I cannot find my Office 2000 CD. I found out that
<b>Microsoft Office 2010 Starter</b> is available for download for free. But, all of these downloads seem shady and illegal. They aren't from msft.digitialriver.net/win/ or any official Microsoft hosting website. I am not that satisfied with free software like
 LibreOffice, so I wanted to ask it here if those downloads are official. Thanks!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(My old laptop loaded with Windows 7 Home Premium from 2010 came with the software, which I think means that it is&nbsp;<b>OEM Software</b>. As far as I know, OEM Software like MS Office Starter can only be installed by the OEM.)</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Also, please do not post about how I am using such an outdated OS. I am not satisfied with the Windows 8 and 8.1 interface. I am fine with using
<b>Windows XP</b> on my <i>2012</i> computer and am aware of the risks for running it after April 8. I have MSE installed, so it will be protected until 2015 from viruses.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>

<p>You'll have to install a free PDF application such as CutePDF, which adds a printer icon in Windows. (Sorry, I should have clarified this immediately.) You can then choose it as the printer when you make a printout of the list of markup; you&nbsp;get to choose
 the file name for the resulting PDF output.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Copying and pasting from the PDF file into a Word document would seem the easiest way to make sure you can edit the text as desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>OCR stands for "optical characer recognition"; it refers to the process of converting a scanned document, or a PDF, into a format which can be read by a word processor. If you have a scanner, you probably have basic OCR software too. But, as I wrote, copy
 and paste should be sufficient in this situation.</p>
