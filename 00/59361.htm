            <p>Hi Mantipa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hard drive partitions on the OEM computers might be different from the custom built PCs. The OEM computer manufacturers have their own customized way of partitioning and any changes to these partitions may create problem on the computer
 and this may lead to no boot scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this scenario, it seems that the recent changes that you have made to the OEM partitions has resulted in some problems with the Operating System or the Boot Configuration Data and that could be the reason why you are unable to boot
 the computer. So, if you have received a Windows 8 installation/recovery media with the computer, you may try booting from the installation media and try rebuilding or repairing the Master Boot Record, Boot Sector and the Boot Configuration Data and check
 if that resolves the issue. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Boot from the Windows 8 installation or recovery media. (To do this, you need to contact the computer manufacturer to changes the boot device priority from the BIOS of the computer.)</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “<b><i>Windows Setup</i></b>” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “<b><i>Next</i></b>”.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “<b><i>Repair your computer</i></b>”.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “<b><i>Troubleshoot</i></b>” and then select “<b><i>Advanced Options</i></b>”.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “<b><i>Command Prompt</i></b>” and type the following commands and press “<b><i>Enter</i></b>” after each command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>BOOTREC /SCANOS</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>BOOTREC /FIXMBR</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, then since, this is a brand new computer and the hard disk partitioning and the operating system are customized by Lenovo, the best option here would be to get in touch with the Lenovo Support from this link:</p>

<h2>            Cant Delete event log file</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I've been trying to delete appsanywhere so that I can reinstall it however it won't&nbsp;give me the option to reinstall. I think that this is because there are still two files from the software on my PC. These files are</p>
<p>"AppsAnywhereExternalUpdater.evtx"</p>
<p>"S2AppsAnywhere.evtx"</p>
<p>I've tried deleting them but it says "The action can't be completed because the&nbsp;file is open in windows event log"</p>
<p>So I deleted all of my event log&nbsp;files and it still says that its open in the event log even though there is nothing in my event log viewer. The only reason I know that its still on my PC is because I'm running&nbsp;a search everything app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to delete these files because everything I've tried hasn't worked :(</p>
<p>(Also I don't know too much about event log files and stuff so please be super obvious&nbsp;in your response)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            Hi M22_Tanker 
<br />
<br />It depends on your System and the sound software provided by the manufacturer, whether you will have the Loudness Equalization setting, it is not available on all PC's
<br />
<br />Right click your Sound icon and choose Volume Mixer
<br />
<br />Click the icon at the top of the resulting dialog for your Speakers
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, do you have an Enhancements Tab
<br />
<br />if so, you will find that setting on that tab

    <title>w32time keeps stopping - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            w32time keeps stopping</h2>
                    XP SP3 on ASUS P6T SE i7 desktop<br />
<br />
w32tm.exe keeps stopping and when it does the clock loses more than a minute per hour.&nbsp; It can synch and correct just fine but then runs slow again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I execute the following commands:<br />
<br />
net stop w32time<br />
w32tm /unregister<br />
w32tm /register<br />
net start w32time<br />
<br />
it starts and runs fine for an hour or two and then stops again.&nbsp; When the computer is powered off overnight, the clock is fine, it only loses time when turned on, so apparently it is not the clock hardware but something weird with the software.<br />
<br />
Something is causing w32tm to stop ...<br />
<br />
I recently did a clean re-install and the problem returned but I wasn't watching closely enough to tell just WHEN it returned ... it was there before the reinstall and that was one reason for the reinstall.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can synchronize it with timeservers and that corrects the time but it keeps running slow.<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>Thank you so much for your response.&nbsp; I fear that my first post might have been a tad inaccurate.<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>If I understand the article (314054) correctly, the modification suggested would replace external NTP time obtained from the net with the internal hardware clock.&nbsp; I don't think the problem I'm experiencing is with
 either source of time.&nbsp; When I "synch" with external time servers (after restarting w32tm) the time is correct.&nbsp; When I power off, the time remains correct.&nbsp; It's while running that the time goes awry by about a minute or two per hour.&nbsp; But I've found that
 seems to happen with only one program.<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>Watching the time after starting w32tm, it remains good all day UNTIL I run Avermedia Media Center.&nbsp; (TV tuner USB stick) That program seems to throw the time out of whack.&nbsp; I've compared periods of time when that
 program was not run and periods of time when it was and the problem appears to occur only when that program is run.&nbsp; So I uninstalled and reinstalled Aver Media Center.&nbsp; The problem recurred immediately on running that program again.&nbsp; Would the suggested modification
 to derive time from the internal hardware clock be likely to have any effect on this?&nbsp;
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>Previously when I issued the "net stop w32time" command the response indicated that time service was not running.&nbsp; This time when I did that, the response was that the service was successfully stopped.&nbsp; So it WAS actually
 running, it was just not keeping time correctly.&nbsp; The "unregister" followed by the "register" command and then "net start w32time" has the result that the time is then correct. (+/- 1 second)<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>So .... it's NOT necessarily that w32time is stopping by itself, (although that has been observed) it's rather that something about Aver Media Center is causing the clock to go haywire.&nbsp; Now I have two other XP SP3
 machines, one on a netbook with an Intel Atom processor and one on a Desktop with an AMD dual core processor and neither of them has the slightest problem with Aver Media and time.&nbsp; It's only on the big fast machine with the i7 quad core processor that this
 problem occurs.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>I had suspected the motherboard hardware but ... as noted ... when powered off the time stays good.&nbsp; I am using "Dimension 4" software to update the time every 30 minutes from internet time servers.&nbsp; That works fine,
 in terms of correcting the time but the time deviations are so large that even after just 5 minutes, the error is 10 to 15 seconds.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>There are many other differences between the i7 XP machine with the time problem and the other XP machines with no problems.&nbsp; Much more powerful video cards (both Desktops have twin video cards and four monitors) is
 the most obvious difference.&nbsp; But just why any of this should interact negatively with the time service is not clear.&nbsp;
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>Now when I exit Aver Media Center, the time is fine.&nbsp; Unless I find some other application that triggers time problems, it seems to be isolated to that one application.&nbsp; Googling this issue doesn't turn up anything
 indicating others have had similar problems.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>I would be inclined to think "re-install Windows" if it were not the case that I've recently done this so we are dealing with a rather "fresh install."&nbsp; I noticed time going off often before the reinstall but never
 actually tried to track it down.&nbsp; I'd just keep correcting it.&nbsp; I've even gone so far as wondering if switching to Windows 7, and coping with all the enormous consequences of that with respect to the software I use daily that won't run on Windows 7, might
 be the path of least resistance.&nbsp; And yes, I CAN live without a TV tuner on this box, since it works fine on the other machines.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>And yes, there is a software update available form Aver Media.&nbsp; I've tried both the older one that came on CD with the tuner and the newer one and there is no difference that I can see.&nbsp;
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>Do you still think that the suggested modification would likely solve this problem?&nbsp; You can perhaps understand why I'm a bit hesitant to start messing with the registry unless I'm reasonably sure there's a good chance
 that would solve the problem and not cause other problems.&nbsp; Mostly I'd like to understand WHAT is actually going on here.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><font>Thanks again.</font></span></p>

<p>
Hey StromIV,</p>
<p>
Here are few steps you can try out.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1:&nbsp;</strong>Temporarily disable any security software installed on the computer while performing the backup to avoid any interference from them. Does this help in completing the backup?</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>Are the Windows Backup services running?</p>
<p>
The two&nbsp;services responsible for Backup are:&nbsp;<strong>Volume Shadow Copy&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Windows Backup.</strong></p>
<p>
Make sure that they’re started and the startup type is “<strong>Manual</strong>”. Restart the services if they're already started.</p>
<p>
<strong>To check:</strong></p>
<p>
1. Go to start and type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc.</strong></p>
<p>
2. Locate the services.</p>
<p>
3. Double click on the service name.</p>
<p>
4. Check the startup type.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 3: Backup only files instead of whole PC backup</strong><br />
<br />
Choose to backup only files for test purpose to check whether the same error reappeares.</p>
<p>
Refer:</p>
<p>
<strong>Back up your files</strong></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-files</strong></a></p>
<p>
<strong>Step 4: Run Check Disk</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>Important:&nbsp;</strong>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector any data available on that&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
might be lost.</p>
<p>
<strong>Steps to run Check Disk:</strong></p>
<p>
1) Click Start, and then Run.<br />
2) Type&nbsp;<strong>cmd</strong>, Right-Click on cmd and select&nbsp;<strong>“Run as Administrator”.<br />
</strong>3)&nbsp; Use one of the following procedures:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To run Chkdsk in read-only mode, at the command prompt, type&nbsp;<strong>chkdsk</strong>, and then press&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To repair errors without scanning the volume for bad sectors, at the command prompt, type<strong>chkdsk volume:/f</strong>, and then press&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note&nbsp;</strong>If one or more of the files on the hard disk are open, you will receive the following message:&nbsp;<br />
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</p>
<p>
4)&nbsp; Type Y, and then press&nbsp;<strong>ENTER&nbsp;</strong>to schedule the disk check, and then restart your computer to start the disk check.</p>
<p>
5) To repair errors, locate bad sectors, and recover readable information, at the command prompt, type<strong>chkdsk volume:/r,&nbsp;</strong>and then press&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If one or more of the files on the hard disk are open, you will receive the following message:</p>
<p>
<strong>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</strong></p>
<p>
Type Y, and then press ENTER to schedule the disk check, and then restart your computer to start the disk check.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software(s) after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</p>

            <p>Hello Pastor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appreciate this fact that you want to setup a wireless printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect a printer to your PC or add a new printer to your home network, you can usually start printing right away. Windows supports most printers, and you probably won't have to go out of your way to install special printer software. If you're using
 Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1, additional printer support and drivers are available through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow steps provided in these articles and check if it helps.<br />

    <title>Continuous &#34;Please Wait&#34; after initial round of Win 10 Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vinces2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continuous &#34;Please Wait&#34; after initial round of Win 10 Updates</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my Asus V6J&nbsp;laptop from Win 7 to Win 10 using an iso on cd as there was some problem with the upgrade app (I forget now). All seemed fine and working. I did install&nbsp;ClassicShell menu app to get the Win7 feel back. Then let it go into an extended
 round of updates which I think involved a couple of restarts. I found it hung on a "Please Wait" screen somewhere along the line and held power button&nbsp;to turn-off and restart. Same again so left for several hours but no change. Tried start-up repair but no
 success. Surprisingly there were no restore points made to use - I would have thought the new installation and subsequent updates would have created some but none there. Repeated overnight and still waiting. It has been 5 days now&nbsp;and I am guessing it will
 never get there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get at the PC via the network and all files are available, so I can "do things" if that is smart. DOS prompt is fine (using install cd).</p>
<p>
</p><p>POSSIBLE issues - when originally upgrading the App said not suitable for Win 10 due to graphics card being GeForce Go 7400 which it said there wasn't a driver. But a hunt on Google found a later driver and that let the app run - until whatever point it
 got to and wound back the install. Once installed via cd the Win 10 driver had no problem controlling resolution etc so I don't know what the problem was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried sfc / scannow and found a way around the pending restart issue but still didn't get it to run; can't remember why not at the moment. Also tried the boot manager repair set of commands to no avail - although they all completed successfully. I
 haven't found a way to get to safe mode. On the advanced repair options from cd startup the menu button that would normally get there is missing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other slightly unusual thing I did is I didn't want to leave the windows.old files on as taking up too much space (only 1Gb free at the time) so, instead of doing the clean up old system files I got the bright idea to simply move them to my NAS
 in case I wanted to go back. However only some went and the rest had permissions errors. I have used the command prompt to take ownership of them all and delete them from the prompt. So I have 7Gb free now. That was when I did the last reboot and waiting -
 5 days ago!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was doing the hold power button down to power off as it went there was the briefest flash of the login screen. So whatever the problem is it is small. And Butt Ugly!!! Any idea what to do to sort it? Thank you.</p>

            <p>The nature of the problem I have here seems remarkably common hunting around the www but no solution evident. I spent several hours with tier 1 support at MS and not the tiniest clue despite the effort. Only offered solution is a reinstall. I am pretty close
 to that but still a little stubborn as my main PC runs Win7 just fine so can do with android ph and no laptop for a little while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crazy thing this was a perfectly good win 10 upgrade that was working just fine until some update broke it a couple of days later. Then this litany of STUPID just breaks out in the operating system. How crazy is it that the startup repair trips out on
 wrong op system when it was the same cd that installed it. Or that the log in screen flashes on held power button?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual problem is really small, and really big at the same time. If someone could kindly help me with diagnostics to sort this hundreds of people will Google their way to this once it is marked solved. How about it legend? Sure would appreciate your
 help! Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestion Taffy - it definitely has merit for the situation described. The 4.2.2 beta was released in June 2015 so I definitely had the latest version. However it is eligible for the "dubious - could cause problems" title so I went to dos
 mode and renamed the program file directory, and also the one for Office just in case but alas no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every few days I have tried something else to fix this. Since my earlier reports I have managed to get the Start-up menu item to appear. Can't even remember now how I did that, but I have gone round every single menu item for the fun of it and none have
 improved the situation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have changed it as now the thing is stuck in a start-up repair loop and no more do I see the never ending Please Wait - which I think is a backward step as the other thing I don't get is to see it on the network any more. So I am boxing myself into
 the reinstall corner and that is just how it goes sometimes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think I will bite the bullet on that and stop being stubborn as already I have needed the laptop a couple of times that I have had to sort in other ways. Stubborn can only go so far, before pragmatism kicks in...! But I reckon disabling the Classic Shell
 is a pretty worthwhile (unproven) strategy for someone reading this at the Please Wait end of this game....</p>

            <p>Reading this,&nbsp;the two huge threads about the screwed-up Start menu ("Critical Error - Start Menu" and "Start Menu doesn't appear"&nbsp;) and the huge numbers of threads about other serious Windows 10 errors, I can't help but think that Microsoft are raking in
 the money on their Helpline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft lied at their huge relaunch Press Conference a year ago (see press&nbsp;article below)&nbsp;when they told those there that the Start problem hade been resolved. The "Start Menu" thread is over a year old now!</p>

            <p>Well Taffy I'm going with the cynical view too now. I did the Reset option - initially with Preserve Your Files which seemed to be going fine for a few minutes then arrived at "Encountered an Error and no longer able to proceed" with no other info than my
 files haven't been affected and a Cancel button available. Then I tried the Reset with not keeping my files option and that ended in the same screen - minus the bit about files not affected. Which I found on restart as "No Operating System" was displayed so
 in went the install dvd and of course now I have no licence code and had to skip the serial number while a full install happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty disappointing all round on so many different levels. I don't understand enough of the fundamentals to figure out why so many "failure to proceed" points came up but this is so bad it is obviously a "not fit for purpose" product being provided and
 I might just stir the provider up along those lines using our Oz Fair Trading laws. There is no way such a manifest failure to perform should be built into a product that, at its most fundamental level, is provided as an "operating system" yet is manifestly
 inadequate to perform this basic task on commercially available hardware in good condition.</p>

            <p>Now I have been forced into a clean install I have realised THE BIGGEST SINGLE FAILING HERE was that a Win 10 install defaults to turning system restore off. I don't know if that is a platform wide decision or some box the Asus V6J laptop fitted in, but
 that is the one thing that would have made whatever the update issue which turned a perfectly well functioning Win7 to Win 10 upgrade PC from a minor problem a system restore would have got me doing a diagnostic jobbie to see which update caused the problem
 to this total fail never-ending Please Wait that degenerated into a fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had System Restore turned on in the previous Win 7 version and there is no possibility I would have decided to turn it off during upgrade or anything else. When I saw the fresh install had it off too I could only conclude that some individual at MS has
 decided in their microbial wisdom to default to turning it off, not even telling the user in the process - thereby doing more damage in a single flawed decision than the most malicious of virii could ever hope to achieve...!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the other aspects raised about there being entirely unhelpful diagnostic errors "incompatible operating system", a total fail of sfc to perform, the rewriting of boot records or image repair to reset things are just astonishing. Also the fact that not
 a single troubleshooting menu item completed as it should. Even reset failed so I (still) have the problem to deal with of no activation passed on to the fresh install.</p>
<p>
Hopefully someone reading this knows how to get this particular errant decision to be reviewed and rectified by linking a can-do MS person with my tale of woe here. In the mean time I am recommending all my friends stay with Win 7 until such time as there is
 widespread community reports that Win 10 is actually worth paying for, as opposed to the current free upgrade that is a long way below worthless (how did that happen - really? So unexpected, but sooo true!). Thank you.</p>

            <p>hmm, one small improvement - despite Windows reporting it wasn't activated, suddenly it was. Who knows how that happened. But, on the other side of the coin, I have discovered that the new Windows 10 way of handling accounts is another not fit for purpose
 design. This is a laptop because it is portable. Unbelievably to those in Redmond I guess, but it is actually a tool! I want to use it to do things remotely, rarely requiring the full love-in experience of a 24/7 connected PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make the mistake of giving the W10 setup your Microsoft ID and you are going to get a user folder name with the first 5 letters of your ms username. This is ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE, as people have complained about ad nauseum. What it does is generate an extra
 task to try and rename the folder and ultimately discover the advice out there to rewrite the registry entry is unhelpful as there are a heap of other entanglements. Save yourself the bother and create a new user account selecting no email and no ms account
 and then give it admin privileges then log into it (takes a couple of times and restarts before good control is achieved) then delete the old account. It works, but that was about 6 hours of effort to discover it is the only credible way to fix yet another
 stuff-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then find can't import an exported bookmarks file to Edge - the work around being to import to Explorer THEN Edge. How did MS lose the plot so badly after getting Win 7 so right, followed by the Win 8 reaming but it seems W7 is going to remain the pinnacle
 of achievement, maybe for ever. I so wish I hadn't experimented with leaving it...</p>

            Appreciate the info and will run the system file check, but not looking for troubleshooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trying to figure out if Windows 10 has a feature that other windows versions do not that allows Windows to shutdown a PC if it's necessary during any specific
 event.&nbsp; For example, if I needed a new power supply and the watts was not sufficient for my current use on my PC, would windows shut down the PC as a safety feature?

<h2>            SCAM ALERT ON FACEBOOK</h2>
                    <p>I clicked on something on Facebook and an alert came up that my computer might be infected with a virus, gave this number 1-866-282-6761 to call.&nbsp; I did not call as I suspected it was a scam number.&nbsp; I had to manually shut down my computer to get rid of
 the message and even after restarting the computer, a shorter version of the alert was up again but I was able to get out of it without turning off the computer again.&nbsp; This has taught me to be wary of clicking on anything on Facebook, makes me want to completely
 quit Facebook if they can't do any better than letting these fake things be on It's&nbsp; site.&nbsp; I'm also seeing some reports that Windows Defender is not good to have on one's computer.&nbsp; Windows Defender is&nbsp; supposed to be a part of Windows 10, I thought???&nbsp; Does
 anyone know for sure if Windows Defender is legit?</p>

            Hi EdithPT, Windows Defender is legit and is the built in Malware app in Windows 10
<br />
<br />There are a lot of dubious apps out there named something very similar, that are not legit - that may be where those reports are getting mixed up about . . .

<p>Thanks&nbsp;<span>DaveM121 for your reply.</span></p>
<p>I used my virus protection that comes with my ISP and it showed nothing harmful in my computer.&nbsp; Do you think that I should use Windows Defender to also scan my computer?&nbsp; I didn't download Defender, what I have came with my new computer, Windows 10.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi EdithPT.
<br />
<br />If you are using a 3rd party security software and it is up to date - not a 30 day trial, then you are Okay and protected and will not need to turn on Windows Defender!
<br />
<br />A lot of users think the software that cane with their device protects them - this is not the case after 30 days when the trial runs out.

 I'm just wondering if it's o.k. to use both of them?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As I mentioned, I was doing the quick scan with Windows Defender and it was scanning rapidly and now is stopped after almost 8 min.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; I was supposed to go on about doing what I wanted to do while it
 was scanning so I checked my email and now it's not scanning.&nbsp; I keep checking and it's not moving at all.&nbsp; I don't know if it ran up against a problem and maybe I should just cancel and restart.&nbsp; Please give your input.&nbsp; Thanks.</span></p>

            Hi EdithPT, I would let Defender do its thing, if it has not been ran before, it will stop and start and eventually complete. This does not mean you have to leave your PC on or stop working, just carry on as normal . . .

    <title>OEM Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO download&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nipper007  say:</h3>
<h2>            OEM Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO download&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS Q500A laptop that originally came with Windows 8 64-bit version.&nbsp; I upgraded to the Windows 8 Pro with Media Center 64-bit version with entering a valid product key that I purchased.&nbsp; I also have a Samsung 300E laptop that came with Windows
 8 64-bit version and this same version remains on the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to download the Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO image on either laptop where I can install Windows 8.1 Upgrade on Windows 8 systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to <a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57608376-285/how-to-download-the-official-microsoft-windows-8.1-iso/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download the Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO image in this article</a>, the Windows 8 product key is invalid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get this error on both Windows 8 laptops when entering the Windows 8 product keys.&nbsp; I used
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Belarc Advisor - Free</a> version to get the Windows 8 product keys, except for the ASUS laptop that I upgraded to&nbsp;Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I successfully download the Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO image so I can manually upgrade this and other Windows 8 systems without needing to download the free Upgrade?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloading the ISO image would save hours of time in case the Windows 8.1 Upgrade fails where I have to start over.&nbsp; Seems like this is a common element of Windows 8.1 Upgrade process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plan on upgrading one of the laptop to Windows 8.1 just to see the differences and problem endured with the Upgrade process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were looking out for the same option on our computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your link worked to an extent by following Step 2 and Step 3. I believe this was a flaw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems MS Store is the only choice apart from downloading using Windows Store.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8.1/productID.288401200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8.1/productID.288401200</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should first try using Windows Store, the windows 8.1 upgrade might go through as well.</p>

            <p>Update...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to install the Windows 8.1 Upgrade from the ISO image that I burned to a DVD, the SETUP.EXE file ran and started the install.&nbsp; When it prompted me for the Windows 8.1 Product Key (not the Windows 8 product key), I entered the Windows 8 Product
 Key.&nbsp; This of course shows an invalid product error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no Windows 8.1 product key required for the free update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes me wonder if the Windows 8.1 Upgrade in the Store would show the same error.&nbsp; I don't want to waste hours waiting for the download.&nbsp; I did try to download Windows 8.1 Upgrade through the Store, however, it never went past 3% of the download.&nbsp;
 I have a 10MB Internet connection and everything is fast here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to install Windows 8.1 Upgrade on this one laptop for testing, but it seems installing the FREE Windows 8.1 Upgrade is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advise, suggestions, etc.?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are trying to install from Store, then, t<font><font color="#000000"><font>his issue could occur if there are certain compatibility issues with the devices or the drivers installed for them during Out of Box Experience (OOBE) phase of the update installation.
 Again, when you try to upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 using the update from Store, you would not need a product key during the installation phase as it's a free upgrade.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1) How are you trying to upgrade to Windows 8.1? Is it using update from Store or using an ISO media?</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2) When exactly do you receive the error message?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First of all, I would suggest you to disable any other devices apart from mouse and keyboard. You can also disable the any external devices such as video card from BIOS. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer of
 the computer to do so.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Secondly, update all the drivers for the devices on the computer. To do so, refer to the manufacturer website to do so.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Step 1: Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press “<strong>Windows</strong> Logo” + “<strong>W</strong>” keys from the keyboard.</font></font></font></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are trying to install from Store, then, t<font><font color="#000000"><font>his issue could occur if there are certain compatibility issues with the devices or the drivers installed for them during Out of Box Experience (OOBE) phase of the update installation.
 Again, when you try to upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 using the update from Store, you would not need a product key during the installation phase as it's a free upgrade.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>1) How are you trying to upgrade to Windows 8.1? Is it using update from Store or using an ISO media?</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>2) When exactly do you receive the error message?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First of all, I would suggest you to disable any other devices apart from mouse and keyboard. You can also disable the any external devices such as video card from BIOS. Refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer of
 the computer to do so.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Secondly, update all the drivers for the devices on the computer. To do so, refer to the manufacturer website to do so.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Step 1: Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press “<strong>Windows</strong> Logo” + “<strong>W</strong>” keys from the keyboard.</font></font></font></p>

<p>If you would have read my previous messages, the methods I used to attempt to install the Windows 8.1 Upgrade would have been known to you.&nbsp; Your canned response did not help as all of these methods have been tried.&nbsp; The second question about any errors,
 well, if you would have read my response above you would have known there was no error message from the Store.&nbsp; The Windows 8.1 Upgrade just stalls without the progress indicator going past 2%.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of what I did with the Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Extracted the ISO files to C:\Win81Upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Created ei.cfg in the Sources directory:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Win81Upgrade\Source\ei.cfg</p>
<p>[EditionID]</p>
<p>[Channel]</p>
<p>Retail</p>
<p>[VL]</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note - I think the Channel should be set to <strong>OEM</strong> rather than Retail.&nbsp; I have Windows 8 on two laptops (ASUS and Samsung) where Windows 8 had been pre-loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Downloaded and installed the Deployment Tools in the Windows ADK for Windows 8.1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39982</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Ran OSCDIMG.EXE from the Deployment Tools to create a bootable ISO image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Burned the newly created Windows 8.1 Upgrade ISO file that is now bootable (which bootable does not matter as I will be using this for upgrading Windows 8 to 8.1) to a DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I run setup.exe on the DVD that I created, it cannot verify the Windows 8 product key entered during the setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I avoid entering the Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 product key when installing the Windows 8.1 Upgrade?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did this with my setup files from windows 8.1 upgrade thru the windows store. It said that setup failed to verify my product key. I also ran the setup files again without the config file and it says I need a key. When I enter my key in, it fails.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In my past experience downloading ISO trials from Microsoft's website, I have had the same experience as others with bad ISO downloads by validation of the integrity thru Checksum of&nbsp;MD5 method.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have now installed windows 8.1 three times thru the windows store and each time, I get parts of my system not working. On reboot to finalize the install, I lost my touchscreen and volume and even my brightness adjustments. This is happening on my HP computers,
 but researching the web, it appears many HP users are experiencing that upgrading to the Free windows 8.1 from windows 8 is just not happening for them when it comes to success.&nbsp; I have put in 15 hours of wasted time for three upgrades. I even upgraded to
 the latest drivers and still have features not working. I did notice that updates prior to the 8.1 upgrade did remove my features. And that when I increase my system restore points disk size, it only goes back two maybe three dates.&nbsp; After each 8.1 upgrade,
 windows 8.1 disables my system restore points too.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Seriously, I know there is a flaw in the files being downloaded thru Microsoft. And probably a flaw in the ISO image HP used to install the Windows 8.&nbsp; I am really disappointed in HP and Windows 8 by Ms.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I even reverted by to the older drivers and still the system wasn't fixed. I believe It is the Ms software that is causing the problem that is being used in the New System upgrade.&nbsp; Or perhaps, the drivers are not compatible and the supposedly new drivers
 really suck too.. Regardless, I would like to get an ISO of both windows 8 and 8.1 that I could manually validate the files are in good shape.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You probably don't need to do any of the Command Prompt stuff... I didn't, but the installation kind of varies with exactly which Win 8 installation you are starting with...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be advised that the USB Flash this process will create is slightly different than the ISO Image you can create... The Flash is ID'd as a ESD, and the ISO image is not...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be a bit easier to use the USB Flash to install, but I would advise to save both..</p>

<h3> onetech it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible to sysprep an upgraded Windows 10 image, on an OEM machine&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Previously, I have been able to install the OEM build of Windows 8.1 on an OEM system (in this case a Lenovo laptop) and then sysprep and capture the image in order to use it as a base image for deployment on other similarly licensed OEM laptops in my enterprise
 environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I perform an upgrade to Windows 10, sysprep the machine, and then capture and try to redeploy the image to another machine in a clean zero-state (or even the same machine), the post-deploy process prompts me to enter the license key for Windows
 10, rather than reading the system motherboard to identify that the system is a qualifying OEM upgradable to Windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is it possible to perform a sysprep of an upgraded Windows 10 system, or do I need to have new base install media from the OEM that contains a valid activation key?</p>

            <p>You can't 'clone' an upgrade, because each Windows 10 upgrade has to verify entitlement by reference to the existing functioning Operating System. &nbsp;What you are currently doing is trying to clone/deploy a clean install of Windows 10, which requires a valid
 Windows 10 Product Key on each occasion, as it cannot reference the currently installed OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm aware you can only deploy the OS in the way you are trying to do it in a Windows Enterprise environment where you would have Volume Licensing Agreement with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more help you would be better posting on the Technet Forum, where there are more professionals participating who deal with advanced networking and similar issues on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the Onedrive program running after startup on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, OneDrive is set to start when you sign in to Windows to have all files in each folder you choose to sync. In OneDrive on your PC is automatically kept in sync with your online OneDrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps to disable autostart of OneDrive on Windows 10.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Right click </strong>on the <strong>OneDrive icon </strong>
on the <strong>taskbar notification area </strong>and click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Under <strong>Settings</strong> tab, <strong>uncheck</strong> the option
<strong>Start OneDrive automatically when I sign to Windows</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, <strong>restart</strong> the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy with Onedrive enabling on startup but its the Uninstall application icon in the startup list that concerned me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a little digging it seems Microsoft\OneDrive\<strong>17.3.5930.0814_1 </strong>
is the version number, Onedrive must have been in the process of updating. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance :)</p>
        </p>
