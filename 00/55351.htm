<p>Hi TomArrow, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It sounds like your game didn't fully install successfully. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, try unplugging your Xbox console from the power supply / power plug for 5 minutes</p>
<p>
</p><p>then plug it back in and start it back up.. If that doesn't work, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try uninstalling the game and reinstalling it. </p>

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            <p>If the windows came preinstalled with the device, then it doesn't carry transfer rights i.e OEM licenses die as soon as motherboard dies.</p>
<p>However, if it were a retail version like you purchased an Installation CD/DVD, you can uninstall the license from your old motherboard and move it to a new one.</p>
<p>You can also use telephone activation to activate windows on your new device.</p>

    <title>Synaptics SMBus Touch Pad on Sony Vaio SVE14A1C5E - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics SMBus Touch Pad on Sony Vaio SVE14A1C5E</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony Vaio laptop, SVE14A1C5E, which I upgraded to Windows 10 in August.&nbsp; Initially I did not experience any issues with the Synaptics touch pad, but in the last few days the touch pad has become very difficult to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most notable problem is positioning the mouse pointer, which has become erratic.&nbsp; Using the&nbsp;arrow pointer towards something I wish to click on, when I hit the touch pad to click the mouse pointer jumps upwards and clicks in a different place.&nbsp; I have
 to hold the touch pad down to keep the pointer in position.&nbsp; The pointer generally feels sluggish and jumpy.&nbsp; It is also hard to control the zooming option, which is happening even when I don't think I am doing anything to trigger it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the driver software in the Settings/ Devices/ Mouse and touchpad/ Mouse Properties/ Hardware, and the status is that the device is working correctly, and that the driver (dated 05/08/2015 version 19.0.19.1) is up to date.&nbsp; I have also tried
 resetting the device to its default settings but this has made no difference to the performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help or advise on this very annoying problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it wasn't quite as easy to install the driver again, as the link you kindly supplied unfortunately redirected to the European Sony website, where I had to enter my model number and then try and find the driver downloads.&nbsp; There is no Synaptics download
 available for Windows 10, and so I selected to run the Windows 7 version, as that was the previous Windows version I had on my laptop... I am not sure if that was the right thing to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I ran the program in compatibility mode as you suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought initially after running the driver installation that there was a slight improvement in the touchpad, but actually I am still getting the problem with the cursor jumping when I
 click the pad, so I can't unfortunately say that this problem is resolved.</p>

                    <p>Thank you Jim and Cassandra for your responses - that said:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither of your replies have helped me to determine what the problem may be.</p>
<p>You two seem to be having a (fill-in the blank) contest which is not helping me.</p>
<p>Pretend that I am a novice to a computer.&nbsp; The computer that I purchased (HP Touch Smart) CAME with 8.1.&nbsp; No upgrades were made to any current computer.</p>
<p>I can download bank CSV in Vista on my laptop. (through Chrome).</p>
<p>Do I need to change my browser (and how, pretending that I am a novice).&nbsp; I go to IE, and nothing ever shows up - click on it and screen is blank.&nbsp; I have purchased Office and have it loaded on my desktop. (8.1).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Looking forward to getting instructions that make sense to me without the geek-speak (no disrespect meant), can initiate without printing all of the suggestions,&nbsp;and that I can solve my problem.</p>
<p>Please know that I appreciate the time you take in sharing your expertise.</p>

<h2>            Jade Empire language</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just got the digital version of Jade Empire, but the game is in french, I can't even find an option to change the language settings.<br />
Even changing my region to something else than Belgium doesn't help.<br />
My systemlanguage is always by default english, so why would Microsoft assume I want to play my games in french?&nbsp;<br />
It isn't even my native language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, I am new to xbox, so please be gentle ;)</p>

<p>Hello Hersenchimmel,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the digital download version of the game will be in the language of the country it was downloaded in. The only way to change the language option (if available) is through the game's menu.<br />
<br />
You could also try to change your Xbox LIVE region language (if available) by following the directions written on this link
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/kinect/setup-and-playspace/dashboard-or-hub-in-another-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Other than that, there would be no way to change the display language the game is available in. This would also happen with future game content purchased directly through the marketplace unless the default language for the game was English or if there was an
 option set by the developer for different languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Hassassinade, </p>
<p>Thanks for your answer, But unfortunately, the only options I have there are dutch and french. Mine are set to dutch, as it's the only option I have besides french.</p>
<p>You see, Belgium is a bilangual country, where roughly half speaks french, half speaks dutch. (and then there is the small amount of german speakers, but I digress). I expect a little bit more from a company like Microsoft, and not assume everybody in Belgium
 is natively french speaking. </p>
<p>I can live with it, if it was advertised as french only. But it wasn't. Hell, all the info was in dutch (again, because I dindn't have the option to select english). Why the original version is not provided is beyond me, because most (if not all) console
 games released here gets released in english with french and/or dutch localization. (Actually dutch lacalization tends to stick to subtitles and not the whole audio dubbing mess).
</p>
<p>Even so if Bioware is the one that uploads the content, It's still Microsoft's responsibility to quality check. No?</p>

<p>Nope bioware is responsible</p>
<p>Ms doesnt have access to source code from anoother company and illegal for them to do so</p>
<p>It is upto The company whAt languages they support not ms</p>
<p>if you check the xbox live regions they mention what languages are offically supported in your region</p>
<p>you cannot expect english in russia for example&nbsp;</p>
<p>only your offically supported languages by country is allowed that is set by your country not by you</p>

<p>And I shouldn't expect french if I clearly state in my profile that I speak dutch, either. Now should I?</p>
<p>I can't believe it's THAT hard to understand.</p>
<p>What people don't seem to get is that here in Belgium only the french dub their games and movies - which is, in my opinion, always horrible and an inferior experience. For the dutch audience subtitles suffice. So, the english version WAS released here (like
 every game and movie here - except young kids games/movies ofcourse, which we still have the option to buy - or see - the original version). Only the download is *** up on the market place. Something that should be easy to be rectified.</p>
<p>Ok, I can see that Bioware (or 2K apparently) *** this one up, but since I pay Microsoft, I go to them If I have a complaint. I shouldn't be jumping through hoops, just to be able to play this game.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I just contacted 2K about this. Since I got redirected there from Bioware. I'll probably going to be redirected back to Bioware and then back to Microsoft.
</p>
<p>One of my first purchases on xbox and already a mess.</p>

<p>Anything digitally downloaded will experience this same sort of cause and effect, there's really nothing we can do about it. If you want to make sure the game you play is in English, you'd need to get a hard disc copy of the game unfortunately and make sure
 before purchasing that it has the ability to change languages or is simply in English.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's ok, I've finally talked with a support guy. They're looking into it.</p>
<p>The reason I bought it on the market place is that, if I get it there I'm 100% sure it works. At least that's what I thought.</p>
<p>Since not all xbox titles are backwards compatible, but it seems this one is. I could get a secondhand copy at amazon for around €6 including shipment, so it would be cheaper. That would be the road to take in the future I guess.</p>

<p>Depending on where you purchased your console you would need to buy those specific region games (or region free games). If you purchased the console in Belgium it's likely it's a PAL console meaning that any game you want to buy you should make sure the
 box reads PAL on it. North American consoles are marked with NTSC.</p>

<p>Yes I'm aware of that.</p>
<p>It's my first xbox. Not my first console ;)</p>
<p>But thanks for the advice :)</p>
<p>But since you brought it up: Are 360 games region free, like most PS3 games?</p>
<p>Just curious. I realise the old xbox games aren't, just like the ps1/2 ones. I just mean the 360 games.</p>

    <title>How to Fully Delete User Profiles&#47;Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catbill  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Fully Delete User Profiles&#47;Accounts</h2>
                    <p>I created a user account/profile in Windows 7 and now want to eliminate it in Windows 10. &nbsp;I had set it up as an Administrator account.&nbsp; &nbsp;A Microsoft technician told me I could just delete the folders/files to eliminate it.&nbsp; I was seemingly able to delete
 the files in the Test folders (c: users/Test), but cannot delete the folders themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Under Properties, the Test folder shows that there are 0 bytes and no files.&nbsp; When I right click to delete the folders, a window opens that starts to count the number of files.&nbsp; Then another window pops up saying “You require permission from Catbill-HP\Test
 to make changes to this folder.” </p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1:&nbsp; How can I delete the remaining Test folders?&nbsp; That is, how do I get permission from the Test account/profile if all of the Test files have been deleted??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: &nbsp;The account I sign in with is called Catbill 10.&nbsp; It appears to be associated with a folder called Catbill under “Users” in the root directory. &nbsp;Is Catbill 10 the user account and Catbill the user profile?&nbsp; &nbsp;Is Test considered a user profile?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 3:&nbsp; Windows Explorer shows a folder called Test under the Homegroup folder.&nbsp; I don’t know why Test &nbsp;shows up there.&nbsp; Shouldn’t the folder be Catbill 10 or Catbill?&nbsp; If so, which?&nbsp; And why isn’t it there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any answers to these questions.</p>

            What is "Administrators (Catbill-HP)\Administrators"?&nbsp; When someone says that an account is an Administrator account what that really means is that their account is in the Administrators group.
<p>When permissions are assigned to things like a folder or a file, you can use an user account name or a group.</p>
<p>Permissions are also given to actions like installing a program.&nbsp; And again certain accounts or group are allowed to do those actions.&nbsp; That explains the Administrators after the \.&nbsp; What is in front of the \ is basically tSelehe machine name.&nbsp; Even though
 they show it as Administrators (Catbill-HP)\Administrators, in reality it is: Catbill-HP\Administrators.&nbsp; As in the Administrators group on machine Catbill-HP.&nbsp; Each machine has their own list groups like Administrators and Users.<br />
</p>
<p>On the unknown account with the long numbers.&nbsp; Whenever an account is created it is given a long unique Id.&nbsp; that is what you are looking at.&nbsp; It is this unique Id that Windows uses internally.&nbsp; Normally Windows shows you "friendly" name like Test, but that
 information might not be available if the account has been deleted.</p>
<p>As in the unique Id is actually used in the file system on the folders and files.&nbsp; When you look at the permissions of a folder or file it looks up that unique Id and translates it to the friendly name.&nbsp; If the account has been deleted I can't do that look
 up and just give the unique Id.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK now that you are sure that the user accounts have been deleted lets see if you can get the correct permissions to delete the C:\Users\Test folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on this folder from File Explorer and select Properties -&gt; Security -&gt; Advanced</p>
<p>The first things to do is make sure that the Administrators group is the owner of all the files/folder below it.</p>
<p>Select <strong>Change </strong>the end of the Owner line.&nbsp; Type in Administrators, select OK. (Did this just to get the next option to show up)</p>
<p>Select<strong> Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong></p>
<p>Select <strong>Replace all child object permission entries </strong><strong>with inheritable permission entries from this object</strong>Normally I would mention also making sure that in the permissions box Administrators has full control set, but you already
 said that was the case.</p>
<p>Select <strong>OK </strong>-&gt; <strong>Yes</strong> -&gt; <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you should be able to delete the C:\Users\Test folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't delete it at this point then the only other reason it won't delete is because a program has the folder or something below it locked.&nbsp; You best bet for taking care of that problem is try rebooting your machine, and then try the delete again.</p>

            Most laptops and many OEM (HP, Sony, etc.) desktop computers come with a factory restore image on a special partition on the hard drive. The factory restore process is normally invoked by pressing a Function key (like F11) at computer startup. There will
 be a message as to which Function key to press on the screen when you first start your computer. You can also refer to your computer manual, or the computer mftr.'s website, or contact its tech support to see how to restore your computer to factory condition
 since each computer mftr. does it differently - sometimes even between models.<br />
<br />
These machines also usually have a utility with which to create physical recovery discs in case the hard drive needs to be replaced or the factory restore image is somehow damaged. If you did not create the physical recovery discs and/or damaged the recovery
 image, contact the computer mftr.'s tech support to order a recovery disc set. This is normally very inexpensive, around $20-25.

            Yes, you can use a GeForce 9500 GT video card with that motherboard.<br />
<br />
The ECS G31T-M7 motherboard has a PCI Express slot for video, the same slot you're using for the Geforce 9400 GT.<br />

                    <p>When typing with the Japanese IME keyboard, the text appears in the top-left corner of the screen instead of where the cursor is. This only happens with some apps. e.g. in Word the text appears at the cursor, but in SMART Notebook the text appears in the
 top-left corner. On computers with multiple monitors it may even appear in the top-left corner of a different screen to where the app is.</p>

            <p>1. Go to Dell's web site, and download the latest driver (even if it's the same version).&nbsp; Win7 Driver should work, but if they have Win8 or 10 Driver, that is better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to Device Manager, and locate the device under the "Sound..." section and right-click, and uninstall your audio card (there may be multiple devices as part of the same single audio device.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Reboot, if requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Install the drivers you loaded per the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Reboot if requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this still fails, it is possible that the device may not be compatible yet.&nbsp; If so, if you can find out what chipset your audio device is using, i.e. Realtek, you might be able to head to the chipset manufacturer's web site and download a newer version
 there.&nbsp; Be careful though, as sometimes OEMs customize audio devices, and the device may behave differently, have missing features, or not work at all.</p>

Check to see if the realtek driver is also updated in the sound video game controller tab. I updated the sound driver there and it solved the problem.

<p>How to use your Windows 7 / 8 or 8.1 Product key to activate Windows 10.</p>
</strong>
<p><strong>Activation in Windows 10 - Microsoft improves activation process in Windows 10</strong>:</p>
<p>"We have received a lot of feedback from Insiders on making it easier to activate Windows 10 on devices that take advantage of the free upgrade offer to genuine Windows by using existing Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 product keys. If you install this
 build of the Windows 10 Insider Preview on a PC and it doesn’t automatically activate, you can enter the product key from Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 used to activate the prior Windows version on the same device to activate Windows 10 by going to Settings
 &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation and selecting Change Product Key. If you do a clean install of Windows 10 by booting off the media, you can also enter the product key from prior Windows versions on qualifying devices during setup."</p>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong> Starting with the November update, Windows 10 (Version 1511) can be activated using most Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 product keys. For more info, see the section Activating Windows 10 (Version 1511 or higher)

<span>
<p>How you activate Windows 10 after reinstalling it depends on how Windows 10 was originally installed on your device. If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Windows Store, you have a digital entitlement for
 your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a digital entitlement for without entering a product key. During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, select Skip. Windows 10 will automatically
 activate online after the installation is complete. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>If you previously installed and activated Windows 10 using a product key, you’ll need to enter the product key during reinstallation.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I suggest you make an Image Backup (to an external USB drive) of your current version of Windows before you attempt the upgrade. Should anything go wrong during or after the upgrade you can use the backup to restore your previous version.</p>

 &nbsp;Everything is disconnected except the mouse &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

            If you are using an NVIDIA video system (either on the motherboard or an add-in card), the installation of the NVIDIA software optionally adds one or more startup items to launch the NVIDIA control panel.&nbsp; They are set to launch and run every time your
 system boots.<br />
<br />
If it was working before and you have done some system updates lately, something is out of whack with it and/or your system has a malicious software affliction.<br />
<br />
To see what the commands look like, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msconfig<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the System Configuration Utility and click the Startup tab to see the Startup Items.&nbsp; You may have to slide the columns around to better see things and since msconfig is not a startup manager (it is a troubleshooting tool) you can't' make
 the display any wider.<br />
<br />
Items with a check in the box will be launched automatically every time XP restarts.&nbsp; Items with no check in the box are still "installed" but not configured to launch automatically every time XP starts.<br />
<br />
The NVIDIA related startup line(s) you see in msconfig Startup tab will look something like this:<br />
<br />
RunDLL32.exe NvCpl.dll,NvStartup<br />
RunDLL32.exe NvMcTray.dll,NvTaskbarInit<br />
<br />
If either the NvMcTray.dll or the NvCPL.dll files are somehow missing, corrupted, mismatched, out of date or the wrong versions (maybe from some recent update), when the NVIDIA applications try to launch, you may see messages like this (or similar complaining):<br />
<br />
rundll32.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application of DLL c:\windows\system32\nvmctray.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
RUNDLL<br />
Error loading c:\windows\system32\nvmctray.dll<br />
%1 is not a valid Win32 application<br />
<br />
If you don't think you are using the NVIDIA control panel, you could just disable the item(s) is msconfig to stop it from launching when you start your computer.&nbsp; If you are using the NVIDIA control panel, disabling the items will leave your system with no
 NVIDIA control panel (this may not be a good thing).<br />
<br />
You could just go ahead and disable the startup item(s) in msconfig (disabling does not uninstall anything), reboot your system and see how your system works.&nbsp; If things get worse, you can run msconfig again and reenable the NVIDIA items, but hopefully you
 will want to fix things the right<br />
way.<br />
<br />
Disabling items in msconfig is not really fixing things and you will not have an NVIDIA control panel, but some folks don't even know what the NVIDIA control panel looks like so that may be fine.&nbsp; You will have stopped the message from popping up on every startup.<br />
<br />
If you want to use the NVIDIA control panel features, you need to repair or reinstall your NVIDIA software. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The best way to reinstall the NVIDIA software is to visit the NVIDIA support web page and either let it check your system and recommend the best software for your system or for you to find the correct version of software yourself on their web page and download
 the latest video driver software<br />
package for your system and install it yourself.<br />
<br />
It is recommended to run the NVIDIA scan with Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the NVIDIA support page for the scan:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/PreScan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/PreScan.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
Read the directions, then click the GRAPHICS DRIVERS button to start the scan.<br />
<br />
Let their online scanner take a look at your video system and see what it suggests for drivers and consider their analysis if they suggest a new driver.<br />
<br />
Download and install the recommended driver and reboot your system and check the installed driver version again.<br />
<br />
If following their directions does not straighten things out, then do this:<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter: <br />
<br />
msinfo32 <br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.
<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information.
<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.
<br />
<br />
When you have the time, I would do this too:<br />
<br />
Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />

    <title>Wireless adapter flashing from red to green &#40;and staying mostly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjaman65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless adapter flashing from red to green &#40;and staying mostly red&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>So I have recently been having issues with my wireless adapter...I think.</p>
<p>I have been having connection issues lately and I have noticed that my adapter flashes back and forth between green and red a lot. According to everyone else out there on the web (which I always take with a grain of salt), when it turns red it has lost connection
 with my wireless router, that the signal has dropped and the adapter is fine.&nbsp;So if that was the case why aren't all my other devices (laptop, phone etc.) also saying they lost signal? This is why&nbsp;I believe my adapter is on the fritz, not an issue with my
 router. Thoughts?</p>
<p>Also, I'm not to pleased with the current prices of adapters for the Xbox 360. Should I maybe just bite the bullet and get a new console with built in wifi instead? My current console is one of the almost original arcade models (I say almost because it has
 been sent in twice for repairs and I may have just gotten a swapped out model one of those times).</p>
<p>Thanks for your input!</p>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd definately look into a trade-in and get a newer model :) It sounds like the adapter is stuffed, either due to a recent XBL update, or simply wear and tear.</p>
<p>Go for it. Make the jump Sounds like you would benefit no end anyways if your console is one of the earliest models :)</p>

<p>You will really need to worry when your wireless adapter is plugged in and there is no light... however, since you are getting reception to your other electronic devices, you are correct - your router is fine. If you have a turtle beach headset plugged in,
 I might recommend moving it. If there are too many peripherals, your 360 won't get a great signal. Also if your console is too crowded by other things on a shelf, this could cause a poor connection. If this doesn't help, try going to your system settings --&gt;
 network settings --&gt; configure settings --&gt; advanced settings and restore your factory defaults and select B once to go back then test your Xbox live connection, it should help. Good luck!</p>

<p>Well, earlier that day I had already restored factory defaults with a support tech on the phone. So it would seem that it was only a temporary fix and that I really am having issues with the adapter. Any other thoughts?</p>

<p>I spoke with an employee at my local game store and he said that the network adapters of the type I have are notorious for going bad. He said it's actually the short USB cable that is the issue. So buying another one used means that it's cable is most likely
 almost done as well.</p>
<p>I think my best bet will be to get a new console. I can get a pretty good deal right now with Christmas going on.</p>

<h2>            wmplayer.exe won&#39;t shut off in Resource Monitor</h2>
                    
<p>I recently started having a problem with Media Player. Videos will not play through Windows Media or Windows Live Photo Gallery. When I right-click to preview, nothing happens. After hitting the close button several times, the program goes to the "Close
 Program" window and the program closes. The computer slows down at this point. I open Resource Monitor, and wmplayer.exe is shown in red, and the CPU usage is 95-100%. I click on the box, right click End Process, and the CPU usage drops to 3-5%.</p>
<p>I open the same video in HP Media Smart, and the videos work fine.</p>
<p>This all started after I sent the computer to HP to replace a bad fan under warranty. While they had it, they installed "Installed Suite" twice. Each has a different version number.</p>
<p>HP Support has been no help. It should also be noted that when I got the computer back, the speakers would not work. Icons were irrational, IE: my home page, MSN, would show my bank's icon, not the MSN icon. I did system restore to a date prior to sending
 it in, and that repaired the speakers. The "Installed Suite" they put in does not show in the recently installed programs, so I cannot uninstall them.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;Sl380,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you receive any error message?</span></li><li><span>What is the file type of the video?</span></li><li><span>Does this happen with all types of videos or any particular video?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run inbuilt troubleshooter for Windows Media Player settings and check if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To run&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span>

 Player Settings</span></span><span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>After running the troubleshooter check if you can play the videos in Windows Media player.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,</span><span>you may
 put the computer in a clean boot state and check if any third party applications are causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following
 KB article to narrow down the exact source. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps

<p>Srinivas, Windows Media Player and Windows Live Photo Gallary would just freeze. After several clicks to close, all I would get is the "Not Responding" message.&nbsp; The files are .wav,. .mpg, .vob. The .vob will change to a .wav file in HPMS.</p>
<p>After following your instructions, it seems to crash less. I can play 2-3 of the videos before it stops, instead of none. I was able to narrow it down to Adobe. I installed the flash player and that's where&nbsp;I am at. Also, if I right click and open them in
 HP Media Smart, they are working there now too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I still, however, need to close and restart to view more. I also installed the new Live Essentials 2011, in hopes it would overwrite the wmpalyer.exe file and solve it that way. Didn't work, so I unistalled it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Srinicas, I finally got to trying that. My wife's computer (on Vista) got the BSOD and I've been working on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; No, turning WM off then on, with restarts in between did not do a thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure what you mean by third party codex. If it is there, I didn't put it there. Like I said, I did not have this problem before I sent it in to HP to have the fan replaced. Whenit freezes, I still show on the resource monitor wmplayer.exe as not
 processing and it is in red, not black like the other processes. Percentage of use is 48-65% as it jumps around.</p>
<p>HP support once said I should just backup the computer and reinstall W7. Since I bought this with Vista, and they sent me the upgrade to W7 as part of the sale, I have the upgrade disc, but no Vista disc. So I don't think I can do that.</p>

<p><span>Hi Sl380,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to first run a System File Checker</span><span> (<span>SFC
 scan). The System File Checker tool to determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows, The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files
 by using the correct versions. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span>Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the scan is complete, verify if Windows Media player works fine. Access the link below to know more information about System File
 Checker tool</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If SFC scan does not help, you may try to create a new user account and verify if the media player works fine in the new user account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To create a new user account, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts
 and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Manage another account. Administrator permission required. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click Create a new account.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Srinivas, I did the scannow and it found nothing. I already had the computer partitioned, so my wife had her seperate "side" I copied the videos from my Windows Photo Gallery and imported them to her gallery. At forst, they worked fine, both in WLXPhotoGallery.exe
 and wmplayer.exe. Then I loaded a second set of videos. At first, they worked fine. Then, for no reason, when I tried to play video 4, video 1 would play. Same with the other videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I don't think creating a third account is going to do it.&nbsp; I am getting the Vista recovery cd's from HP, as that is the original format. Then install the W7 upgrade and hope. At least I can still copy my pictures and socuments onto disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your help, but I think I am just chasing ghosts here. Of course, HP still claims it is coincedental that I had all these problems after they replaced the fan.</p>

<h2>            Random Black screen Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>A few times this has happened.&nbsp; My Win 7 64 ultimate computer is running normally. Then suddenly the screen goes totally black. At least one time the mouse arrow was visible.&nbsp; One time music was playing through iTunes and it stopped.&nbsp; The computer does not
 respond to &lt;cnt&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;del&gt; , &lt;alt&gt;&lt;tab&gt; or the windows key.&nbsp; The only thing I could do was hold the power button 5 seconds.&nbsp; Then it came up just fine.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Definitely sounds like a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when<br />
possible) actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean the dust bunnies,<br />
clear the vents, and ensure the fans are working. Add a small fan blowing into the<br />
intake to reduce the effects of heat. If a laptop about all you can do is reseat the<br />
memory and clear the vents (though you can still add a cooling fan or pad).<br />
<br />
Check with a real computer shop (one that services that make and model) and/or<br />
the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems). Ask in<br />
their forums (if any) about known issues.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

    <title>windows 10 backup onto new install. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tempus mr20  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 backup onto new install.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from 7 to 10. As such, my programs and apps were kept as they were&nbsp;where possible.</p>
<p>Now I am considering wiping and making a clean install of windows 10.</p>
<p>What I wish to know, is if I do so, can I use a previous backup/image from now to retrospectively return my pc to how it is now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might sound backwards, but I am wanting to keep what I have if possible, as I might not be able to find all my existing programs and setups so easily. So I can rewind to my current system if I am needing to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Off hand this seems possible, but I am aware that encoding and encryptions might change between builds.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to know if it’s possible to restore your current Windows 10 backups after doing a clean Windows 10 installation, the answer is yes. As you have said, it will make your PC as if you never did anything.

<h2>            Autoplay dialog box not working&#59; flashes up and disappears</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span><span><span>Autoplay has stopped working on my PC. I first noticed when I swapped out a game disc (FEAR: Extraction Point),
 which had been in the drive for a couple of weeks, for another (Gears Of War). No autoplay dialog appeared. I opened and closed it again, put FEAR back in, tried an audio CD. No luck.<br />
<br />
What's interesting is that if I pay very close attention, the autoplay windows flashes up, but disappears immediately. The same occurs if I 'force' autoplay via the context menu in explorer.<br />
<br />
I have attempted the following:<br />
<br />
1) Obviously checked the autoplay settings in Control Panel. Reset to default, turned it on and off again, etc.<br />
<br />
2) 'Shell Hardware Detection' is running and set to automatic. Checked via 'services.msc'.<br />
<br />
3) Applied a few registry tweaks for 'NoDriveAutorun' and 'NoTypeAutorun' entries.<br />
<br />
None of the above have made any difference. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64.<br />
<br />
Please assist! Thanks in advance.</span></span></span></p>

<p>This same situation started occurring with my x64 Win 7 Ultimate installation and&nbsp;I've been trying to fix it for the past 10 days.</p>
<p>Something changed 14 to 10 days ago and I'm unable to remember what it was. Too many days had passed for a Restore to help, because the earliest Restore I had didn't solve it.</p>
<p>I've tried everthing dancingcarb tried. Even downloaded "autoplay repair" and "defaul programs editor", ran&nbsp;and still no joy. I've searched the web and read lots of posts, but nothing has helped. This post is the one that most accurately describes what I'm
 experiencing.</p>
<p>Autoplay settings in Control Panel kind of work. PowerDVD will launch when I insert a recorded DVD, Windows Media player will launch when I insert a recorded CD, and Explorer will launch when I insert a data disk. But selecting "always ask" does nothing.
 I can't remember&nbsp;Autorun&nbsp;working recently. I see the autoplay dialog box flash on screen. I can right-click the drive and choose autoplay but the same thing happens - the dialog box flashes and disappears.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling CyberLink Suite and Nero. Nothing changed. I'm wondering if some recent Windows update changed how autoplay operates.</p>
<p>I've run a full system virus scan.</p>
<p>This is a new computer,&nbsp;about a month old and I miss selecting what I want to do on each occasion.</p>
<p>It's like something (a handler of some sort maybe) has hooked all of the non-application specific selections. If I had secondary Win 7 machine, I'd start fresh on it and then compare registry settings between the two.</p>
<p>I've not tried booting in Safe mode (will try this evening), but I don't have much hope.</p>
<p>This is about the last obstacle to overcome (and don't understand why it's happening). I hate the thought of starting fresh and redoing everything I've spent the past month doing (which has involved methodically moving approx 1.5 TB of data and&nbsp;installing
 applications from my last computer), not even knowing if it will solve the issue.&nbsp;I'd be grateful if anyone can point us in the right direction. I'm about out of ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Later...</p>
<p>As for the&nbsp;"Verify if Autoplay works in safe mode." No, it does not. Best I can tell, it's not even available.</p>
<p>Like dancingcrab, sfc found nothing.</p>
<p>Still stuck</p>
<p>+*+*+*+*</p>
<p>I don't know what just happened, but I lost my summary of troubleshooting steps in solving the problem on my system. I can recount if it would help anyone, but for now -</p>
<p>MotoHelper Service turned out to be the culprit on my system. Changed the service for a manual start, and Autoplay now works as expected.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Subway Surfers Exe File for Windows 8.</h2>
                    I Installed &nbsp;Subway Surfers Exe File for Windows 8. The Installation was done properly but I See only the first start of the game and it plays only the painting in the train. I am not able to start the game and no keys are working, I even tried mouse clicks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is because of Anti Virus Software. I tried to disable it till installation and then followed the following steps and the game is running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)install AutoHotkey_L_Install.exe</p>
<p>2)Double Click the file "SubSurf.ahk"</p>
<p>3)run Subway_Surfers.exe enjoy......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded a compressed folder called subway surfers pc with keyboard script (64 Mb) which has all the files mentioned above.</p>

    <title>Receiving a message that my version of Windows 7 is invalid. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Receiving a message that my version of Windows 7 is invalid.</h2>
                    I keep getting the "Invalid Windows 7" message though it is valid (it came from Toshiba directly).&nbsp; The problem may be that Toshiba replaced the original hard drive and, obviously, reloaded Windows 7 with a different key.&nbsp; So my question is: can I validate
 the version currently running on my laptop with the original key that came with the computer?&nbsp; And if so, how do I get to the screen where I would do the entering?&nbsp; Thanks a million.

            Thanks for all your help and advice.&nbsp; I decided to first try simply using the "old" key that came with the computer and lo and behold, that seems to have worked.&nbsp; At least I haven't had any further "invalid" messages since then, and Update is working.<br />

            Hm. I see. Please note that feature upgrades might take a long time to install depending on the configuration and the number of files. 
<br />Give it another half an hour and if that doesn't move, reboot the computer which would undo the changes done by the update.
