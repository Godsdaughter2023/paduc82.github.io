    <title>REST API filter on FileDirRef - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            REST API filter on FileDirRef</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am querying the items of a document library with a rest call to "/web/lists/getbytitle('xxxx')/items". The call is used to populate a tree view component with all files and folders. As there could be lots of them the component does the Rest call one dir
 Level at a time. So if someone clicks on a Folder it will query the content of that folder. This is achieved by setting a filter on "FileDirRef eq xxxx".</p>
<p>All of that works perfectly well in SharePoint 2013 on premises. Unfortunately,&nbsp;that same&nbsp;query&nbsp;doesn't work in Office 365. It returns an empty result. In another forum someone proposed to use the Rest functions for retrieving files and folders. But these
 are two distinct calls for getting both which would be inefficient and means that I have to merge those two results by myself. The treeview component doesn't support that way either so it is of no use for me.</p>
<p>I can't see any reason why this filter only works on premises. It just seems like a bug to me. Is there any good way to report this bug to Microsoft? In my experience reporting problems that are somehow related to development to the normal Microsoft support
 will get blocked by telling me "learn how to develop"... As bugs like this block people from moving to the cloud, I think it should be of interest for Microsoft to get that solved. But it's hard to find the right person in such a big company.</p>

    <title>Can I print my publisher pages continuously on roll paper&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ade_photo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I print my publisher pages continuously on roll paper&#63;</h2>
                    I have a very long image which I have cut and spaced across 30 or so pages. There is text filling the top two thirds of each page and the image running along the bottom. I want to print the pages, including the image, on one continuous roll of paper so
 I can make it into an accordion book. As you can probably guess I do not want any spaces between each section of the image, I want it to be printed as one continuous image. On each page I have the images fully fitting the page, is there an option to print
 my work how I described?

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer I will be using takes roll paper yes, I've sourced some nice photorag paper to print on.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the model of the printer, it's the universities printer.</p>
<p>I'm mostly stuck on how to prepare my work for roll printing, I'm unsure if I can print this way straight from Publisher or if the work needs to be converted into a long thin image format to be recognised properly by the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a meeting with a lecturer tomorrow to discuss using inDesign to print it, I was hoping I'd be able to save some time and resolve the problem today so I can make a start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep you posted on my lecturers input.</p>
<p>

<p>Try using a banner template instead of the multiple pages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>File &gt; New &gt; Banners and you can use any of the templates or scroll down to find the blank pages with sizes up to 10 ft. If you need something even longer then create the 10 ft and go to Page Design &gt; Size and use one of the options under that option to
 increase or customize the length and width.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to choose your 'banner printer' as your default.</p>

<h2>            Calendar Details Showing when using Scheduling Assistant</h2>
                    
<p>We have 3 users that are having a Major security issue with their calendars.</p>
<p>When I go to schedule a Calendar appointment and I use the Scheduling Assistant, if I add these users I can see their Calendar Details.</p>
<p>We would only like their Free / Busy information to be shown, but this is not working correctly for them.</p>
<p>I have checked their Calendar Permissions and it is set to Default - Free /&nbsp;Busy and that is it. I Have changed it, closed out of outlook, and changed it back, but it isn't working. Checked Calendar Share permissions and disabled that, still not fixing it.
 Had them run outlook.exe /CleanFreeBusy but that hasn't helped either.</p>
<p>I believe there may have been some security settings in 2003 that we can no longer access in Exchange 2007.</p>

            As I see it , is difficult for a program or app to decide whether a determined word is an adjective .For example,  "Slow" is an adjective , but , let's say "She runs slow, the same word is an adverb that modifies the action.

<p>You could find <em>potential </em>adjectives with code like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Demo()<br />
Dim wdSynInfo As SynonymInfo, wdSynList As Variant<br />
Dim StrTxt As String, StrOut As String, StrTmp As String<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(1, StrTxt, " " &amp; StrTmp &amp; " ", vbTextCompare) = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StrTxt = StrTxt &amp; StrTmp &amp; " "<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; StrTxt = Trim(StrTxt)<br />
&nbsp; For i = 0 To UBound(Split(StrTxt, " "))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StrTmp = Split(StrTxt, " ")(i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set wdSynInfo = SynonymInfo(Word:=StrTmp, LanguageID:=wdEnglishUS)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If wdSynInfo.MeaningCount &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wdSynList = wdSynInfo.PartOfSpeechList<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For j = 1 To UBound(wdSynList)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If wdSynList(j) = wdAdjective Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StrOut = StrOut &amp; Chr(11) &amp; StrTmp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; .InsertAfter vbCr &amp; StrOut<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above macro outputs a list of potential adjectives at the end of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you start analysing the output, you'll find the code demonstrates a fundamental problem; many words exist in more than one part of speech. The part of speech a word belongs to depends on its context and there is no definitive solution apart from one
 that employs contextual analysis - which you can't do with a macro. </p>

<h2>            Windows Live Admin Center</h2>
                    I was trying to enroll for Live@Edu for my School District.&nbsp; Apparently, our domain is already registered for some service, but I have no idea what service that is.&nbsp; This is the response I got from Live@Edu support.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<p>After checking the domain umtsd.org in our tools, it appears to be enrolled as a non-EDU domain. To get assistance with your issue, please visit

            I have a domain, techmansworld.com, that I am trying to set up. Yesterday, I set up my domain on domains.live.com with Hotmail checked as an option to set up. It did not work, even though I had every single thing that it said to do.
<div><br />
<div>So I deleted all of my records for domains.live.com, then deleted my site off of the admin center. Then I set it up again, this time making sure that no mail was checked during the setup process. This time I had few records to enter, and my domain checked
 ok immediately.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I decided to add mail, and I had to add new records. Did exactly what it said, and now I'm back to square 1. Please help me, or I will have no other solution but then to switch to Google apps.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After checking your account it showed that there's something wrong with your MX record. Possibly it is what causing your issue with your Domain. As suggested by our experts, please contact your domain provider and ask for other MX record. After that, re-configure
 your domain in Windows Live Admin Center. Here's an <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/admin-wlsettings/handling-issues-with-mx-record-or-pending-dns/b722ed21-b20e-40e2-8dbb-26fa12003c32">

    <title>Word 2011 crashes every hour - memory leak&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jomotzkau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2011 crashes every hour - memory leak&#63;</h2>
                    Problem: word crashes roughly every hour (document turns into question marks or blank and word is unresponsive and needs force closing - document can sometimes not be recovered - but sometimes can be).<br />
<br />
I am working on simple short word docs composed on this imac and saved to its local HD - no graphs, images, tables or alike - docs are around 15 pages and contain a few comments.<br />
<br />
Two main error messages I get include:<br />
"A file error has occurred. Check your network connections or make sure the disk is properly inserted and not defective"<br />
<br />
"'fail to save due to out of memory or disk space" and "word has insufficient memory"<br />
<br />
I have spent a good month on this forum (and with microsoft email support) and gone through all the usual steps... deleting fonts and preferences etc -- I have also uninstalled and re-installed everything and tested word in a different user (same problem!).
 I have been asked to re-post the problem here.<br />
<br />
System: My imac is only 2 months old (bought Nov 2011) -- it runs OS X Lion and Office 2011 - and has all the very latest updates (14.1.4 and recent Office updates too)<br />
So the system is fine and checks showed that there are no hardware faults with the actual memory etc.<br />
But Word has never worked - it has crashed from the very start.<br />
<br />
Reading older forums it seems similar problems were around for 2004 and 2008 word - and had to do with memory leak (i.e. the mac did not allow word to write to disk so word runs out of memory after accumulating and never dumping its recovery copies).
<br />
<br />
Any ideas - this is getting really annoying - will have to return the Mac as I cannot work like this.<br />
<br />
thanks.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have had a similar problem with Word 2008 over the last couple of years (I haven't used Word 2011), but I've found a satisfactory workaround.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem: when editing with tracked changes, Activity Monitor shows Real Memory usage starts at the usual 180mb or so and gradually increases with each change tracked to 1.5gb - 1.7gb before Word becomes unresponsive/crashes. Docs may be corrupted but
 can usually be reopened. I have just installed OS 10.8.2 and the latest update of Word 2008 on a clean hard drive and this problem still occurs, and it is reproducible on both my 2.5 GHz intel mini with 4gb ram and my iBook (1GHz PowerPC with 1.25gb of ram
 running OS 10.5).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The solution that works for me is to go to <em>Preferences</em>, select the <em>
Track Changes</em> pref pane, and then uncheck the "Include author, time stamp and action buttons" check-box. Real Memory usage no longer increases with each change, and Word is accordingly much more stable. The information on the author and time of changes
 is still collected; you just need to hover over a balloon to see it. If required, you can reselect the checkbox at the end to display the colour-coded time-stamped balloons while reviewing changes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There may be another variable at work here (I also turn autosave off), but I'd be interested to hear if this solves the problem for anyone else.</p>

            Hi Rich - and others who offered support,<br />
<br />
just a note on this:<br />
<br />
The problem still persists - I just cannot use windows without it crashing several times a day.<br />
<br />
I have in the meantime had specialist dedicated phone support from microsoft - which was nice - and they really seemed to know what they were talking about.<br />
Still we could not solve the problem (nor find out why this happens...)<br />
<br />
Obviously it is not clear whether Lion - my imac or Office is the problem but the error messages do identify office as the culprit.<br />
<br />
As a solution microsoft support ultimately said I should try Office 2008...<br />
<br />
<br />
So for anyone else who finds Lion and Office 2011 do not mix -- get hold of a copy of Office 2008 - and word will be much more stable!<br />
<br />
This still leaves me with 200 Pounds spent on Office 2011 that does not work... but at least I can use my mac for some word processing now!<br />
<br />
thanks again for your support on this forum!<br />
<br />

<h2>            Where can I find Office 365 product key with Surface 3</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased Surface 3 from the Microsoft Online Store UK. I understand it comes with a years subscription to Office 365, but I can't find a product key in my Microsoft Account and anywhere in the package I've received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some pre-installed Office 365 software but I can't find a way to activate it. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have phoned a couple of Microsoft support numbers but unfortunately I have been appalled at the level of 'help'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>If the dates are in column A, the names in column B, try the following formula to get the second name corresponding to the date in cell C1:</p>
<p>=INDEX(B:B,MATCH(C1,A:A,0)+1)</p>
<p>To get the first name you can use this as an alternative to the VLOOKUP that you already have:</p>
<p>=INDEX(B:B,MATCH(C1,A:A,0))</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1020 blurry pics</h2>
                    I'm using Lumia 1020 for the last 10 days and facing the same problem of blurry images and inferior quality even when viewed on PC. The problem persists in auto mode and even after hard resets. The phone is running Amber straight out of the box.<br />
<br />
Appreciate if some working solution is shared as its seems that I'm not the only one suffering from this. Thanks.

            Thanks paulheu. I removed the circular film covering the entire camera before using it. Are you suggesting there is a separate protective film for the lens too? I'm unable to detect it through naked eye and if it is there how do you remove it because I've
 tried scratching the glass with my nail. Thanks.

            no there isn't after you have removed any plastic from the lens. if you have tried hard resets, then you may need to take your phone back to your point of purchase, or if they are being less than helpful, to Nokia Care for inspection.

    <title>Microsoft Office Professional 2016 &#38; Skype for Business Basic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brent c.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional 2016 &#38; Skype for Business Basic</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a retail copy of Microsoft Office Professional 2016.&nbsp; I downloaded the software from Microsoft's website and completed the installation.&nbsp; Later, I tried to install Skype for Business Basic, which is free.&nbsp; However, this installation failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some reading, I learned that my version of Office Pro 2016 uses a "Click-to-Run" installer.&nbsp; This installer is incompatible with Skype for Business Basic, which uses the older Windows Installer (i.e., the&nbsp;MSI installer).&nbsp; The error message I get is
 analogous to this one, except that it indicates Skype for Business Basic:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89741583-4a88-4126-8fbe-8971b97bc270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89741583-4a88-4126-8fbe-8971b97bc270" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So Skype for Business Basic requires that my version of Office Pro 2016 be installed with&nbsp;the&nbsp;MSI installer.&nbsp; My question is simple:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to get an MSI-installation version of Microsoft Office Professional 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Microsoft Office Professional <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Plus</strong></span> 2016 uses&nbsp;the MSI-installer.&nbsp; But I don't have access to that version.&nbsp; Not to mention, it would not be compatible with my product key and it comes with the full version of Skype for Business.</p>

            <p>Okay.&nbsp; So let's move on to the next logical question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; Is the "Basic" version of Skype for Business available in "Click-to-Run"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, why would Microsoft offer a software product compatible only with Office Plus?&nbsp; Office Plus already comes with the full version of Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that Skype for Business is compatible with "Office 365" subscription versions.&nbsp; These&nbsp;all use "Click-to-Run".&nbsp;

            <p>I resolved this problem by clicking the appropriate&nbsp;link at this Microsoft support article:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/lync/skype-for-business-is-removed-when-you-upgrade-to-office-2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link downloads an executable, which when run, automatically downloads and installs Skype for Business.&nbsp; In my case, it installed the Basic version (which is what I am entitled to).&nbsp; I suspect&nbsp;that the executable&nbsp;may also install the full version (i.e.,
 if the product key corresponds to the appropriate software license such as Office Professional Plus).</p>

<h2>            How do I get my Skype number</h2>
                    <p>I signed up and paid for a Skype number account, so people from a mobile or landline could call me. However, after I paid and got a confirmation email that I paid, I could not locate my actual Skype number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I would obtain my Skype number so I could give to my family to call me? Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>To all forum leaders,</p>
<p>&nbsp; As several community members have indicated, the current Outlook issues are not limited to mobile devices.&nbsp; For many, Outlook is also not syncing with the Mail app on PCs.&nbsp; It is very frustrating when the Outlook team seems either unwilling or unable to
 acknowledge the depth of the problem and then insist that everything is fixed.</p>

            My mail programme will not sync on windows 8 pc has not synced for around 3 days, my mobile has started to sync today but my pc is still screwed up, not happy, no updates or even acknowledge a problem let alone give anyone an expected fix time. How many
 thousands have left Microsoft to get reliable service elsewhere, its as if no one gives&nbsp; a toss, pay your money and shut up and deal with it, service like this from any other company would see them bankrupt, but money and market share keep them going regardless
 how they treat their customers.

            <p>At least its not just me. I was starting to think it was just my account that was broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue is with the windows 8 mail, people and calendar apps, which give the '*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is unavailable' message when trying to sync. This is happening both on my desktop pc with windows 8.0 and on my surface
 with windows RT 8.1 preview. My windows phone is still working fine, but I really need mail to work on my tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been with Hotmail/outlook for ~15 years and this is the first problem I've had. Very frustrating when a reliable service has problems like this. I hope they are sorted soon.</p>

            No error messages. I've been having trouble getting mail to download into my outlook ever since I've had it (months). I have 3 different accounts: 1) 365.edu, 2) live and 3) yahoo. I can send/receive through the edu account and receive yahoo, both with
 excessive prodding. The Live account, which is also my microsoft account rarely works. Seems to be stuck in offline mode and I have been unable to change it.<br />

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand, you're not able to sync your Outlook.com account to the Windows 8 Mail app. Let's see what we could do to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mentioned that you're not having issues in&nbsp;signing to your account thru a web browser. For this, I recommend that you communicate with the Windows 8 Forum moderators.

<p>Windows 10 installed on my pc on 8/6/15. I need my e-mail for an important financial transaction I was in the middle of. I have tried everything, including live chat with a tech. After about an hour he just disappeared from my screen, nothing was resolved.
 When I go to the mail icon I get 23 different messages scroll across the empty screen&nbsp; - "Not Synced Yet", "still working on it" &amp; the newest one, "we didn't find anything to show here.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?&nbsp; Fixing it today is critical.&nbsp; I need the ones that were already there &amp; any new ones.</p>

<p><em>Dear Smith,</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by the outlook unable to search your emails. You can try upon the following steps:</em></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em>Go to control panel</em></li><li><em>Run the indexing options </em></li><li><em>Now when you open indexing option a pop up window will be displayed as below:</em></li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa942c6e-e858-4216-b4b7-201419a453ba" /></p>
<p><em>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now come to option of Modify --&gt; Uncheck the option of Microsoft Outlook --&gt; Click Ok and then on main screen click close
</em></p>
<p><em>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now restart the system </em></p>
<p><em>6. After restarting the system --&gt; Open outlook --&gt; In the search box --&gt; write the text and then hit enter.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>See if these steps if it does not then open indexing options once again and after that click on advanced tab --&gt; Under Troubleshooting --&gt; Click Rebuild.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Now this would take time so it is advisable to perform the second alternative overnight while going to sleep and leaving the system on without sleep mode as if the system resumes after sleep mode the indexing will start from beginning.</em></p>

<p>Are you referring to the mouse/touchpad pointer? There should be a return to defaults settings in the mouse or touchpad settings in the devices in the settings menu. Have you tried any other troubleshooting steps?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are you running an insider version? Which one and which ring. If you are not running an insider version of Windows 10 you could get better service on in the Windows10 forum rather than the insiders forum.

<h2>            leave a copy of messages on server won&#96;t stay checked in Live mail properties</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, I can`t keep the box checked to leave a copy of messages on server (so I can download to my smart phone).</p>
<p>I can check it, hit apply, but&nbsp; if I close the program,&nbsp;when I&nbsp;re-open it, the box is no longer checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It used to work fine up until last weekend when yahoo / AT&amp;T decided they needed to change their email page.
</p>
<p>Could&nbsp;that be the problem? I`m confused...&nbsp; 8^)</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Let me help you with your concern. It seems like you are using Windows Live Mail. Please re-establish the connection of your email account to Windows Live Mail by removing the account and adding it again. For the steps on how
 to do this, you may refer to the article below:</font></span></p>

<p>Thank you for your very helpful reply! I followed the links &amp; instructions and now all is well!!!</p>

<p>I have the&nbsp; "leave a copy of messages on server" box checked &amp; so far it`s staying checked.&nbsp; 8^)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another slight problem with windows 7 home premium... I don`t know if I should ask here, or start a new thread, but... my desktop background is set for a slide show, which used to work, but one day</p>
<p>stopped on one picture &amp; no matter what I do, it just stays on that picture. I`ve tried changing the folder, tried a single picture, it won`t change at all. Can you help? Or can you direct me to the proper</p>

            Hi and how is your day?
<div><br />
<div>We too have had this problem.</div>
<div>We cancelled an account after saving the messages on the hard drive</div>
<div>then recreating the account, checking the settings - box ticked to ensure messages remain on the server-</div>
<div>but the same problem continues.</div>
<div>All the other accounts are ok except this one. We lost an important message completely today because it did not arrive on the pc and it was gone from the server.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We tried our internet company who could not help and referred us to microsoft.</div>
<div>Is there any hidden setting somewhere else on windows we could try?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your assistance would be much appreciated</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. We would like to verify if you have tried the steps provided in this thread? What was the result?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand, after exporting all your emails, you deleted your account, then you try creating it and reconfigure it in Windows Live Mail. However, you are unable to receive the emails. Is that correct? If yes, there's a possibility that the account
 is in deleting process since you've cancelled it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to verify if you are able to sign in to your account using web. What is the error message that you've encountered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thank you for your forum contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like a Software issue, therefore I would suggest to you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. A SoftReset, which means taking out the battery for about 30 seconds</p>
<p>2. If that does not resolve the issue a hard reset. Please make sure that you have backed up all your data before doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Cannot add Exchange Kiosk accounts to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy &#91;&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot add Exchange Kiosk accounts to Outlook</h2>
                    <p>After the change in Microsoft Policy last year regarding Shared Mailbox accounts and the iPhone Mail app, where Shared Mailboxes worked perfectly then suddenly after an O365 Exchange update failed to connect, we were advised we needed a licence for each
 of our Shared Mailboxes for it to function correctly. After a lot of complaint about the change in behaviour we agreed to purchase an Exchange Kiosk licence for each of our Shared Mailboxes (Info, Accounts, WebEnquiries etc. ) and convert them to full mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday we had an issue with one of the accounts and had to recreate the Outlook Mail Profile for one user, however when attempting to re-add the Kiosk account to Outlook (2016 on PC) we receive the following error message:</p>
<p><em>An encrypted connection to your mail services is not available.</em><br />
<em>Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection.</em>This led me to check if MAPI was enabled, I discovered it was disabled and not possible to enable on our Exchange Kiosk accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried upgrading one account to O365 Business Premium, Enabled MAPI and I was able to log in in Outlook 2016!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have Microsoft shifted the goal posts again? Do we now need a £15.60 per month licence for shared and alias mailboxes just so we can use them in IOS and Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is this simply a mistake? perhaps caused by the recent Exchange issues? Am I doing something wrong?</p>

            <p>Hi Andy,<br />
<br />
Based on my personal experience, Exchange Koisk Plan doesn’t support Outlook Anyway(MAPI), it supports POP way for the Outlook client. It’s not feasible to configure the Exchange Koisk accounts onto the Outlook client using Exchange way(Autodiscover). As a
 result, your scenario should be an expected behavior.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you want to access the shared mailboxes in your Outlook client using the Exchange way and in your iOS device as user mailboxes, you need to assign at least Office 365 Business Premium licenses to them.<br />
<br />
However, from my personal experience, if your goal is to access the shared mailboxes on your Outlook client and iOS devices, you can assign the Full Access permission of the shared mailboxes to your own mailboxes, for the Outlook client, the shared mailboxes
 will be configured under your main mailboxes automatically due to Auto-Mapping, for the iOS devices, you can add the shared mailboxes in OWA(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) and then access them
 using the application OWA for iOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back for any further concern.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />
Aaron</p>

            Dear Robert,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Outlook.com developers decided to upgrade UI (user interface) in order to add new features and functionality. Before there was an option to return to classic version using toggle option, but now it is missing. 
<br />
<br />It might be hard to adjust to new UI, but you can try to adjust to new UI (it took me a while). New UI has new features and "supposedly" is better than classic version, but it is harder to navigate, especially after classic version. In this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/get-help-with-the-outlook-com-beta-fa2e5110-fa17-4b3b-88c8-87812230a048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/get-he...</a> you will find lots of suggestions on how to use new UI.
<br />
<br />If you need help with folders please read this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/working-with-message-folders-in-outlook-com-6bb0723a-f39f-4a8d-bb3f-fab5dcc2510a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/workin...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with new Outlook.com version and do not want to adjust to new, all I can suggest is to submit your feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a> If there will be enough votes, maybe developers will make changes or return the option to go back.
