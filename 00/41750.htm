            <p>What do you mean by "itools", is this something that your have downloaded yourself?&nbsp; If so then perhaps you have downloaded the incorrect language version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is something that came preinstalled by an OEM then you could try contacting the OEM Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this help you in any way?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Will Not Start</h2>
                    <p>I get the following error when I try to start my Microsoft Surface Pro:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Windows Installation disc, insert the disc and restart your computer. Click "Repair Your Computer," and then choose a recovery tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, to start Windows so you can investigate further, press the Enter key to display the boot menu, press F8 for Advanced Boot Options, and select Last Known Good. If you understand why the digital signature cannot be verified and want to start Windows
 without this file, temporarily disable driver signature enforcement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \windows\system32\winload.efi</p>
<p>Status: 0xc0000606</p>
<p>Info: A component of the operating system has expired</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running Windows 10 insider preview and everything was working fine about two months ago. &nbsp;I have messed with all of the options in the UEI and even tried a bootable USB, but I can't seem to get it to boot from it. &nbsp;I have tried pressing enter and F8
 and nothing seems to work except the windows key, which bring up the UEI. I've also tried to hold the volume up button when I power on and it doesn't do anything different.</p>

<h2>            saving outlook emails to Onedrive</h2>
                    My HP laptop has been having problems so I had a "chat" with HP and it was recommended after checking out my laptop that I perform a system recovery.&nbsp; I have saved my files to Onedrive but how do I save my Outlook emails to Onedrive and then, once I do
 the system recovery, is there a way to put them back on the computer? I have Windows 8.1 and Outlook 2013.<br />

</p><p>If you are simply "refreshing" your data Should be safe.&nbsp; What is the problem that you are having that necessitates the "recovery"?&nbsp; Why didnt HP walk you through it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking Onedrive is not the best way to back up your data because you need to be able to access it before you can recover your data.&nbsp; The usual way is to backup to another HD locally</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The HP person gave me the directions to do the recovery but since I didn't have all my files backed up, we didn't do the system recovery. He typed that the recovery would take my computer back to its original state which did not sound
 like a simple system restore to me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop sometimes won't power off, is slow to power up and sometimes I get just a grey screen without it starting at all. I then have to hold the power key down to turn it off and restart it again.&nbsp; That is what prompted by chat session.&nbsp; I was told that
 after he scanned by computer remotely that my system files are corrupted. </p>

    <title>Windows 7 wireless insists on connecting to wrong access point - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 wireless insists on connecting to wrong access point</h2>
                    I'm using a Netgear USB wireless adapter model WN111 with Windows 7 64-bit, connecting to a D-Link wireless access point.<br />
<br />
Whenever I log in or wake the computer up from sleep, it insists on connecting to the wrong access point-- it connects to an unsecured Linksys device somewhere within range.&nbsp; I then have to manually connect to the correct access point-- my D-Link.<br />
<br />
I've gone into Network Sharing Center &gt; Manage Wireless Networks and removed the rogue Linksys network, but it always comes back.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or guidance?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it keeps picking up the 'rogue' network after you have deleted it. My Windows 7 does not behave that way&nbsp;and my research cannot reveal a way that I could make it do so. Maybe someone else can tell you why it does. However,&nbsp;as a workaround
 you could try the following in Manage Wireless Networks...</p>
<p>1. Don't delete the rogue network, move it down the list all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>2. Open up the properties of the rogue network and untick "Connect Automatically when this network is in range"</p>
<p>3. Open up the properties of your network and tick "Connect Automatically when this network is in range"</p>
<p>4. You could even try unticking "Connect to a more preferred network if available" for both of the networks.</p>
<p>Please mark this as helpful or answered if appropriate.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

<p>HI, thx for that! I did all that but then I realized the problem was disk space, and not permissions (I think). &nbsp;I found this out by going to the &nbsp;update website and initiating the update from the download manually. It said that I did not have the needed
 8GB to complete the install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That threw me, as I thought I had allocated dozens of GB more via the Parallels Desktop interface. Come to find out, all the extra space that I allocated is
<strong>still unallocated</strong>, and I can't seem to extend the C: drive to include the unallocated space -&nbsp;<strong>the option to extend is grayed out:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56a40969-7a62-4a5a-b88e-b3c313da012b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56a40969-7a62-4a5a-b88e-b3c313da012b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on this, or do I have to take this up with PD support?!? Perhaps it's because the Recovery volume is in the middle of the drive map, making the extend impossible? Just guessing now...&nbsp;</p>

Fixed it. The VM had run out of disk space and Parallels is crap at detecting it did not provide it, even after saying it expands the disk. But using third party software I was able to extend the disk using the unallocated created by Parallels. Thx!&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 ISO downloaded using Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know if I can use this ISO I just downloaded using the Media Creation Tool from Microsoft with any Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC that needs a new Windows installation as the Windows 10 DVD cannot repair the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, although this ISO does try to repair the system, I am not sure if it will be able to install the system with my OEM key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is... Will this ISO install the correct Windows version if I enter my product key during the installation or will it give me that error message saying that this is the wrong product? I only ask this because Windows only asks for the key after
 you deleted the partitions, very annoyingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's EULA is too complicated and all I wanted is a yes or no answer, really.</p>

            Hi Victor.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you're correctly booting the media then it should ask for the Product Key before properly deleting all partitions which is what makes a Clean Install.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />As long as you're certain you installed the correct version (Home or Pro) then it should activate after connecting to the internet.  
<br />
<br />Many retail keys are already issued a Digital License on the PC so it might even activate without using the Key, so you could skip it and wait to see after going online.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Hi Victor,
<br />
<br />As long as you install the same Edition (Home Pro . . .etc.) as was previously installed on that system. When you put that system on the internet, it should just automatically activate from the Microsoft Activation servers as it will have had a digital signature stored on those servers
<br />
<br />During the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue  . . .       
        </p>

            If you start the installation from within the current edition you have installed, it will reinstall that.
<br />
<br />So, if you are now running Windows 10 Home, it will download Windows 10 Home unless specified otherwise. 
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Hey Malte Boss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I see you are having a bit of trouble with some GTA V content you purchased. Most of the available add-ons for GTA V are account specific and cannot be shared via the home console setting. You will need to purchase the DLC under
 your own account. Make sure when you do, it shows up under your <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027310/microsoft-store-view-your-order-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
order history</a>. We hope to hear back from you soon. Cheers :D</p>

<p>Hi MALTEBOSS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. If your DLC or add-ons are shown as installed, then the game may have issues with recognizing the DLC. To check if your console has installed the content, check out this article:

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchased the content on the parent account, then the DLC can only be accessed by the adult account. The only way the child account could access the DLC content is if both accounts are on the same Xbox and that the parent account has the Xbox set
 as the Home console. This will allow digital content owned or purchased from the parent account to be shared with the child account or other accounts on the same Xbox. The parent account will also need to allow access to this content for the child account
 due to the age rating of GTA 5.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<h2>            Video Chat Freezing</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I'm on a Skype call, the screen of whomever I am video-chatting with will freeze for no reason. This has been happening for quite a while (over 6 months). I've tried dropping the call and restarting it, but I run into the same problem. I'm running
 the latest version of Skype, and my laptop is only about 2 years old. Would this be a hardware problem or something that Skype could help fix?</p>

<p>Hi Ruwim,</p>
<p>I too have been having this problem and it is extreme. I have been having the problem since I switched over to Windows 10 over a year ago. I read with interest what you suggested and so please find my diagnostic results in a Dropbox link below. I really
 hope you can help.</p>

<p>Hi Ruwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confused, I read and followed your reply very optimistically but what you suggested didn't seem to match with what I found on my computer. I tried to update the AMD graphics driver for my computer as you suggested. However, when I did so the program
 returned an error report saying that it could not find the original AMD driver on my system. I checked and I have an Intel (R) HD Graphics Family Driver. I went into the Intel site and tried to update the driver that I have but they said that I had the latest
 update installed. </p>
<p>Please find the report in this link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>On your second point, I do not appear to have 360 Internet Security Proactive Defense software installed. I cannot find it in my list of programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here once again for your reference is the diagnostic report that I originally sent you.</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/sjyvx2hy64ky5uz/DxDiag.txt?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please check this again and tell me where I am going wrong in trying to understand the support you sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help you can offer. </p>

<p>Dear Ruwim,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I tried to follow your suggestions but I am a little confused. I don't have an AMD driver installed, I have an Intel driver. When I clicked the link to try to do what you suggested I got a message saying that the initial AMD driver
 could not be found. sure enough when I checked I found I have and Intel Driver and when I tried to update it I was told that I had the most recent version installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I do not have the 360internet Security Proactive Defense software installed. Could you have perhaps been reading someone elses diagnostics.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise me what to do next.</p>
<p>Thank you/</p>

            Thanks for your help.<br />
I had,, before receiving your reply , in fact done an internet search and discovered that, in fact, many other people were experiencing the same problem , in being unable to connect to wifi.<br />
The problem seem to have been occasioned, after updating to ios6 and there were two possible options given to resove the problem, one of which succeeded for me.
<br />
Here is the internet reference which provided the answer/s.&nbsp; <br />
<p><b><span><a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/09/19/wifi-issues-ios-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>xperiencing

<p>
<span>The&nbsp; options given were:-</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>"Anyway, it sounds like Apple was able to correct this issue on their end, so no update will be necessary. But if you’re still having Wi-Fi
 problems, you can try the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Toggle your Wi-Fi off and on – Settings app &gt; Wi-Fi
<br />
</span></li><li><span><b>OR</b></span></li><li><span>Set your device’s HTTP Proxy to Auto – Settings app &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Blue icon next to the network you’re connecting to &gt; Scroll to the bottom."</span></li><li><span>--------------------------</span></li></ul>
<p>
It was in fact, the first of the two options which succeeeded for me.</p>

    <title>Family Safety, child can remove itself from family - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> byrton1990  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety, child can remove itself from family</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to disable a child from removing <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
itself </span>from the family?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am testing the child settings for our family. I logged in as a child account. From there I went to manage family settings online. I noticed a link that would remove me (the child account) from the family. Wouldn't that also effectively disable the child
 settings we put in place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is kind of a serious problem. That would mean creating a child account is useless when the child removes itself from the family.</p>
<p>

<p>-Which link are referring to particularly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the option you are referring&nbsp;to remove child account&nbsp;by itself can't be done, the option
<strong>Remove</strong> is graded out. Because, there is no permission as such given to child account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the screen shot the child account can still remove itself from the family.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some investigating and made some observations. The child account used to be an adult account. We removed it from the family and made it a standard user on the laptop. Then we re-added it to the family as a child. When you log in as the child, you still
 get the option to remove yourself, as you see from the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that the profile birth date cannot be changed. Under "Your Info" tab -&gt; "Edit Personal info" link. It says "Your birth date indicates that you are a child. Please reenter your birth date."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Xbox account and Skype account associated with the child account. maybe because one of them is possibly an admin that is preventing full child status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we get this "Remove Yourself" link removed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>

            My child also removes himself and then HE, not I, get the email stating so.&nbsp; The only way I know is because I forward a copy of all his emails to mine.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.&nbsp; What's the point of FS if the child can turn it off?&nbsp; It's bad enough that FS
 has NEVER kicked my child off when the time limits were up (except for the first 2 months on a new laptop then abruptly stopped and now won't work on any computer).&nbsp; Considering the company created the OS they should be able to create an app to control said
 OS!<br />

<p>
</p><p>After reading this posting, I went ahead change my children date of birth to make them as a "child". &nbsp;However, I got following errors: "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">Your
 birthdate indicates that you're a child. Please reenter your birthdate.".&nbsp;</span></p>

 can I proceed here so I can update their birthdate with the error?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other ways exist (I used to use this program called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mgtek.com/dopisp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>MGTEK</strong></a> that allowed you to sync music onto an iPod using Windows's own media player
 program.&nbsp; It's not official, Apple will tell you not to use it, and even Microsoft will tell you that WMP is deprecated, but it's there for people who like taking risks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Streaming, on the other hand, lets you send your media files to other computers or devices on your network, such as Xboxes or supported DLNA media player systems.</p>
