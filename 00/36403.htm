    <title>Issue reinstalling apps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue reinstalling apps</h2>
                    I installed windows 8.1, and after the process everything was fine, but when i restarted my computer later after doing some work it said windows preparing, and then i unlock my computer, and all my window store apps are gone. My downloaded applications
 luckily were still in my all apps, but the ones from the window store were not. So i go to the windows store and try to reinstall my apps, and it says installed, but then it shows a colour square in my all apps. I try to run it, but it says error, and I have
 to go to windows store to try again. when i try to reinstall it, it says cannot install due to group policy set by system adminstrator. I have no idea what it means or what to do?

    <title>USB audio with Win 7, plus Control Panel oddity - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB audio with Win 7, plus Control Panel oddity</h2>
                    I've posted everywhere I can think of, and it has been suggested I might get some pointers here.<br />
<br />
AMD-based Acer 5536G laptop. The following happens with hardware from Edirol and M-Audio and various host software. The problem shows on both Windows 7, 32 and 64-bit, but not on Vista 32-bit. All drivers are current and appropriate to the OS.<br />
<br />
Connect a usb1.1 audio interface, and run an audio application that uses asio (eg Adobe Audition3, Reaper, Wavosaur). Playback and record sounds terrible, unusable.<br />
If I monitor the USB data with xperf, it shows usb chaos. Add usb2 hub (powered from laptop) to chain, it goes OK, use a Tascam usb2 interface and that works OK.<br />
<br />
Back with no hub, I open Control Panel-&gt;Manage Audio Devices. Switch bwtween Recording and Playback tabs and the audio switches between working (Recording tab) and not working (Playback tab). These tabs, of course, show the wdm audio, not the asio that is in
 use. Disable the on-board Realtek HD wdm audio in Device Manager and the asio audio is solidly terrible.<br />
<br />
I suspect this relates to many postings on audio sites about usb problems, so need to discover how to diagnose something like this!&nbsp; I am running and re-running xperf, Process Monitor and Process Explorer but not finding anything useful. A similar-ish Lenovo
 Intel-based laptop works OK, although both machines have to have wireless disabled to record without glitches.

<span>Hi Billaboard,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in Clean Boot state and check which non Microsoft program is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may follow the steps provided in the below mentioned link to perform Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>I think you've answered your question : disable the wireless .</p>
<p>I take it your Edirol and M-Audio are sound devices, or is the Edirol a keyboard or midi sound generator ?</p>
<p>If the former,&nbsp; forget about the Realtek, its ____ compared. Plus, you can't run Asio with multi devices. Not even Asio4All, which is basically a WDM wrapper and not true asio.</p>
<p>Whatever, you run the risk of having multi conflicts having more than one sound device ruiing. Its possible, but you need to select them well in your DAW.</p>
<p>I would un-install all software/drivers relating your sound devices, reboot and then start re-installing them from zero :</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Install the M-audio, its drivers and so on, making sure you're going to use its Asio drivers. Re-boot</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Install the Edirol Sound device drivers</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable any wireless products, you're asking for trouble</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside your DAW, select your sound device, play with the I/O buffer settings and the latency to get rid of any clicks and so on.</p>
<p>Plus, if you can, don't use your laptop to power your USB devices, get a powered hub or use the transfos that came (maybe) with the devices.</p>
<p>Repost if any problems.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p>Many thanks for the answers. The situation is that I've been looking at this for over 90 days now and my aim is not to work around the problem but to sort out why it is occurring.</p>
<p>I have tried clean boot, fresh install of both 32 and 64-bit Win 7, disabling everything that didn't actually stop Windows working at all. I think that the problem relates to some part of the Win 7 code and the particular internal usb routing used with the
 chipset with AMD processors. What I am trying to find is how to fault-find and pinpoint this or whatever the exact problem is.</p>
<p>Jerry, The Edirol device is a UA-3FX, but I've tested with an Edirol keyboard that has an audio interface as well as midi. The M-Audio is a Fast Track USB. The Edirol chops the sound, the M-Audio has deafening continuous crackles. Both show the USB data
 changing from regular ISOCH_TRANSFER to repeating short blocks of CONTROL_TRANSFER +&nbsp; ISOCH_TRANSFER when switching between the tabs in Control Panel as described above.The M-Audio is a current device, and several other usb audio interfaces are still USB 1.1.</p>
<p>One of the weird things is that if I disable the Realtek completely, the asio fault is always there regardless of which tab I select.</p>
<p>I appreciate that disabling wireless can improve the situation, but what is now broken by Windows 7 that causes this? e are told that interrupt sharing nowadays is catered for in Windows and its hardware, and the systems are set up to allocate interrupts
 automatically with no human intervention possible. Yet everyone seems to say that Wireless networking should be disabled for audio because of interrupt sharing. I was working professionally with this type of audio in the mid-1990's and have been working with
 XP and wireless since wifi became common, and now that the systems are aimed at multimedia working, things no longer can be predicted to work reliably.</p>
<p>The clicks, dropouts etc are far worse than those caused by buffer settings, but I do appreciate those suggestions.</p>
<p>I do want to try to resolve this as my main retirement role seems to have become that of advising ex-colleagues on the purchase and use of audio editing equipment. At the moment I seem to be stuck with saying, like everyone else, use XP or a Mac, so I really
 do want to be able to point at a more precise problem.&nbsp; I also do really appreciate the replies and the trouble taken.</p>
<p>Edit: PS. The usb2 hub referred to was powered, but resolved the problem whether or not external power was used. A 1.1 hub did not.</p>

<p>HI,</p>
<p>Windows 7 is stable, its not at fault here. Its a well known fact that Wireless connections cause high latency, crackling, distortion etc in a DAW. Go to some of the DAW forums and do a search for Wireless devices, or ask a question. You'll see its not just
 you and certainly not Windows.</p>
<p>Its could be the drivers of your devices that are either shoddily written or&nbsp; (stab in the dark here and dare I say it) are not the correct ones.</p>
<p>Personally I would do the following as a test :</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stick to Windows 7 32 bits for the time being, there are more drivers available than for the 64 bit version.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstall everythiing (audio deives, USB hubs etc).</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; RE-boot and let W7 re-install the USB 2 hub on its own. Use only the usb2 hub, the 1.1 may be making a bottleneck, especially if your devices are supposedly usb2 equipped</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit Edirol, M-Audio websites and download their up-to-date W7 32 bit drivers.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Install ONE device - the M-audio - and try and get that working steadily.</p>
<p>Once you've got one setup working, you can go on to the other, maybe. Or just the the Edirol for midi work.</p>
<p>You don't need the Realtek device at all, disable it in the BIOS, the M-Audio can do the job perfectly.</p>
<p>Whatever you've read about having 2 or more sound devices working forgot to say that its a pig to set up. Yes its possible, for example, the Realtek the default device to play W7 sounds, WMP videos/mp3s/wav's etc and the other device, the M-Audio, to do
 serious work in a DAW, where you can choose a sound device that is not necessarily the default device.</p>
<p>I have a Presonus FS 26x26 on firewire. The first thing I did was to disable the on-board Realtek, I just don't need it AND the sound quality is better on the the Presonus unit, as would yours be on the M-Audio unit.</p>
<p>I ahve rambled a little, but good luck. Let us know the result</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p>Hi Jerry, First, let me say that I also advise people in forums to disable wireless if they are having click problems. But the fact remains that I have used laptops with wireless under XP for many years. Machines include an IBM R40, a Medion, 3 Acers and
 the Lenovo N100 that I'm typing on. All were used with usb interfaces and all gave no usability problems with the wifi switched on and connected. 2 of the machines had firewire and I have used my Tascam FW-1884 with them successfully, although not for more
 than a handful of tracks. I have also used Vista, and tomorrow I will re-install Vista in the Acer test machine just to confirm to myself that it records and plays back OK.</p>
<p>Now to the points</p>
<p>1) I have formatted the drive and re-installed Windows 7, 32 bit from scratch.</p>
<p>2) Nothing was installed except the various current specific drivers from Acer's site. I have in the past tried with just the Win7 raw drivers.</p>
<p>3) That's the point. The M-Audio is a usb 1.1 device. It does not need the usb hub, and the usb is "steered" within Windows 7 to use a internal usb 1.1 channel. If I install a hub, the usb is internally steered to a usb 2 channel and works. I have not installed
 the hub.</p>
<p>4) I have visited M-Audio and installed the current Win 7, 32-bit driver and connected the hardware.</p>
<p>5) Loaded a short audio file&nbsp; 48kHz 16 bit into the machine and installed an asio app, Wavosaur (like Reaper, Audition) Checked the M-Audio was set to 48kHz, put on the headphones and hit Play. The shower of clicks and bangs almost blew my head off.</p>
<p>The whole point, surely, of using a laptop for simple recording and editing is to be able to get serious quality using the usb interface, listen via the laptop speakers and log on via wifi. I have done this for years on XP laptops, but for some reason it
 doesn't work reliably on this more powerful machine. The processor is just ticking over, the machine is using under half the RAM, and I can run other apps at full speed at the same time.</p>
<p>I do think it all feels as though usb audio has moved much closer to the edge of something. I don't need to get this working without a workaround, but it would be nice to know what is going wrong. During the time I've been typing this I've been contacted
 by another broadcast presenter who asked what he would need to produce a 2 hour show at home. I want to know what to tell him.</p>
<p>The ramble was good. It made me think, but that once again didn't help. :-)</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<p>And just to confirm, I've now tested again with Vista 32-bit. It just plays normally with the out of the box OS.&nbsp; The same file, the same app, the same interface,&nbsp; the same laptop, If I understand the documentation from M-Audio correctly, it's actually the
 same driver, although I haven't checked what is actually installed by the driver installation in the way of files, as I only thought of this after swapping back to 7.</p>
<p>I then let it have two passes at OS updates and it still works. There are very occasional tiny glitches, which I'm fairly sure would be tamed by the standard tweaks.</p>
<p>The other thing that I forgot in the previous reply is that there is no way of disabling much, including Realtek audio, in the bios on this or most other laptops. I have actually tried this under 3 different bios's, the original and the 2 updates still listed
 on the Acer support site.</p>

<p>OK, but I re-iterate : Wireless devices cause parasites when recording in a DAW. You're geting interference from somewhere, and the logical things are either a conflict of sound devices or the Wireless. You're using off-board sound so there are no ground
 loops, electrical parasites etc.</p>
<p>Your point 3 is good, USB2 sockets are backwards compatible.</p>
<p>It <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>IS</strong> </span>possible in any BIOS to turn off the on-board sound. You just need to look carefully at all the menus within the BIOS.</p>
<p>BTW, when you use WMP (or whatever) does the same thing happen ?</p>
<p>Can you try the M-Audio device on a friend's PC to see if the same thing happens ?</p>
<p>Yours curiously,</p>

<p>Yes, wireless can cause problems within a DAW, but never to the extent I have here.</p>
<p>I have gone through the bios again, but there is simply no&nbsp; audio option visible. Just Info, Main, which has a few boot options and the SATA mode, Security and the boot order menu. In my experience this is normal on modern laptops.</p>
<p>Using WMP is a bit odd in that I thought that the M-Audio worked OK earlier when using that (which of course uses the wdm part of the drivers), but now it crackles like mad. I will investigate this further.</p>
<p>Most of my testing has been with the Edirol, as I've used that or other Edirol models for years on all the machines here. It works fine on all except the Acer Win 7 and to a lesser extent the Lenovo Win7 laptop with its wifi glitches.</p>
<p>The M-Audio belongs to my son. It is a cheapo model with plastic case and I've only tried it on 2 or 3 other machines. It works fine there, but its performance is comparatively poor as it does suffer from RF noise and what I think is quantisation distortion
 on audio "tails". He has replaced it with something else which he says sounds far better on acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>But the noise I am getting on this Acer Win 7 is in a different league altogether. You can't hear the music for the noise.</p>
<p>My postings on Microsoft diagnostic tools sites seem to have fallen on deaf ears, but what I really want to find out is how to track what is happening when I move from one tab to another in the audio control panel and the usb audio breaks up. I suspect that
 non-Microsoft things like asio have no hooks to monitor problems, but I really don't know.</p>
<p>I was pointed to xperf, which is the best tool I have found so far and is available free from Microsoft, but it doesn't seem to quite reach to this. It is a good next stage beyond the DPC Latency Checker, though.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing is that this Acer machine is rock solid on everything else I've tried under Win7 32 and 64-bit. It plays and edits video fine using the Realtek as the audio device, and I've hit no other problems. Looking on the internet, there seem
 to be few people using Acers for asio audio, but there appear to be substantial numbers of users of HP laptops with AMD processors that hint at similar troubles. Ah another idea - monitor the HP forums........</p>
<p>Oh and just in case anyone suggests this, I've tried the AMD dual core patch from their site which addressed earlier AMD dual core audio related problems. That, as I expected, did nothing.</p>
<p>I don't give up easily.</p>

<p>One last thing : if the Realtek is OK on everthing, and its the M-Audio that isn't, then its possibly the latter that is knackered.</p>
<p>Do you use a power adapter or USB power for the M-Audio ?</p>

<p>No, neither the Edirol or the M-Audio have power sockets, and the power taken, as listed in Device Manager, is well within the limits. Adding the usb2 hub clears the problem and that must add some power drain. I have all usb power set to always on, and have
 tried with all except the usb channel in use set to power down .</p>
<p>There will be a delay now while I re-install Win7 Pro 64-bit from a registered and soon to be activated fresh install DVD. The 64-bit was previously an Enterprise version on a 90-day trial, which is how I know how long I've been working on this! The 32-bit
 was an un-activated full retail version</p>
<p>I think the M-Audio is working correctly as it sounds fine-ish on the same machine when running Vista as well as on the other laptops here.</p>
<p>Anecdote coming up...&nbsp; My son lives and works in London, UK. He had been unhappy with the sound from the M-Audio Fast Track and so has asked me if I would test it for him. I agreed, so he carried it to work on the London Underground prior to bringing it
 to me. The person sitting opposite him leant across and asked if he was happy with the sound as he had one, too. They both agreed the sound was poor, particularly as a steady note faded away into lumpiness and sizzle. I have not yet tried a full test, but
 a quick listen seemed to bear out both their suspicions.</p>
<p>I can't say too often, though, that this quality problem is nothing compared with the showers of deafening crackles I'm hearing with Win 7 , or the parallel juddery sound from the Edirol.</p>

<h3> fjw50  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t login to my new Windows 10 HP PC</h2>
                    There are two user accounts on my PC-created originally in Windows 8.1. After upgrading to WIndows 10 I noticed that every time I tried to login to my account-the administrator account-after about 15 seconds of the welcome screen it goes to a blank screen
 with a white cursor. I couldn't figure out how to fix it so I had been logging in using my niece's account. Then, suddenly, Microsoft deleted her account without any warning or giving me any reason why and so when I tried to log into her account it kept telling
 me that the password was wrong. I've looked on this website and people have suggested various ways to try to solve the problem but since all I ever get is the login screen I can't try any of those methods. Does anyone know how I can get into the control panel
 or any other part of the computer to try any of the methods that I have seen described here?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Problem Reporting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanw284  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Problem Reporting</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago, I went into the Registry and turned off the problem reporting function, so my PC supposedly doesn't send problem or error messages back to Microsoft.&nbsp; I did this in an attempt to stop the insanely annoying phone calls from "Windows PC Services"
 (a Microsoft Pinpoint Partner).&nbsp; The calls started up again this week, and the "Support Technicians" (two different calls) told me they received error messages from my computer within the last three days (first call) and within two hours (second call).&nbsp; They
 claim they get the information from my system Event Log for 'Critical' and 'Error' messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first question is this:&nbsp; If I have Problem Reporting still turned off in the registry (and confirmed under Control Panel | Security and Maintenance settings), is there some other mechanism where error data would be sent to Microsoft, without me clicking
 'ok' on a dialog box asking permission to send it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>A little background information:&nbsp; I'm using a HP business-class mini-tower PC, running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, with 32GB RAM, two dual-core processors, plenty of hard drive storage capacity, Office 2013 Professional 32-bit (local, desktop version), and several
 other personal, desktop applications; dual routers with firewalls, plus local PC firewall and A/V.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in the IT field for a few decades and cybersecurity for about 16 years, so the "Windows Support Technicians" (who don't know when to shut-up) get a little annoyed when I won't give them remote access to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second question is:&nbsp; How do I file a complaint with the Microsoft Pinpoint Partner program regarding these idiots?&nbsp; I also plan to pursue legal action through the FTC and FCC for their business practices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Neither Microsoft nor our partners make unsolicited phone calls (also known as cold calls) to charge you for computer security or software fixes. Cybercriminals often use publicly available phone directories, so they might know your name and

            <p>Geethu, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand all that... it's the same information I have been providing in public awareness seminars for five years.&nbsp; It doesn't answer my questions.&nbsp; About a year ago, when this happened before, I was able to access an alphabetical list of Microsoft Pinpoint
 Partners, and found that prior technical support company listed.&nbsp; When I tried searching the Pinpoint Partners now, I can't get that list.&nbsp; So, how do I find out if this particular company, calling themselves "Windows PC Services" (www.windowspcservices.net),
 is an actual Microsoft Partner or not?&nbsp; If they are, where do I file a complaint to have them removed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then there is my other question - is there another mechanism or function/service within Windows that would send anonymous error data back to Microsoft (for product improvement or other purposes), other than the Windows Error Reporting function?
</p>

            <p>Thanks SO much for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had understood my message correctly, you would realize my whole point is to have them removed from any partner relationship that might exist with Microsoft, and to take federal legal action against them.&nbsp; I don't know where they got my phone number
 (unlisted, cell phone) and of course they won't tell me.&nbsp; They've called from six different numbers in three different area codes (all in the NY/NJ area) over the last few months and I keep blocking those numbers.&nbsp; My firewalls block both inbound and outbound
 traffic to/from their servers (by IP address and domain), at least the ones I've been able to identify.&nbsp; So, yes, I know lots about them and similar schemes.

            <p>I don't really care about the error reporting to Microsoft; I'm in favor of using non-personal error data from applications or services to be used in creating patches.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still need to know whether this company (Windows PC Services) is or is not a current Microsoft Pinpoint Partner.&nbsp; I was not able to search the partner page using a company&nbsp; name, as I was able to in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are a Microsoft Partner,
 where and to whom do I file a complaint to get them removed?&nbsp; Regardless of that answer, I am pursuing administrative and potentially criminal complaints against them through federal agencies.

</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
There is a small arrow present near System Tray icons in Windows Taskbar.</span></p>
<p><span>This arrow is used to hide inactive icons and once you click on the arrow, it shows all icons for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can
<b>enable</b>/<b>disable</b> this feature using Taskbar Properties. You can also customize which icons should be always visible or hidden:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Refer:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Are you saying that there are programs installed in the Notification Area that are hidden that you would like display at all times? If
 so please follow the steps mentioned below: </span></p>
<p><span>Click the
<b>'Show</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>icons'</b> button on the Taskbar (or click Start, type: Notification Area Icons, hit Enter on your keyboard)<br />
Click <b>Customize</b><br />
Click in the <b>'Behaviors'</b> list box for the desired icon or icons you want to be shown at all times<br />
Click <b>'Show</b> <b>icon</b> <b>and</b> <b>
notifications'</b><br />
Click <b>OK</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the icon is still hidden, click the 'Show hidden icons' button on the Taskbar again<br />
In the floating balloon, click the icon you want revealed and drag it into the visible region of the Notification Area</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<p>First, there is no such thing as "Movie Maker 10" made by Microsoft. The versions of Windows Movie Maker were followed by the year (2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recording narration feature was added in the last version which was Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp;To find out the version of Movie Maker, go to
<strong>File &gt; About Movie Maker</strong> and verify that you have version 2012, build 16.4.3528.0331.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have it, read the following:</p>

<p>There are numerous apps in the Windows Store that try to use similar names (e.g. Movie Maker 10 or Movie Maker - PRO). If you look you'll see that the developer is NOT Microsoft but is a different developer trying to confuse people into thinking it might
 be an app made by Microsoft.</p>

<p>I am using Windows XP SP2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have checked the following options and also run the Windows XP repair option. Still i can't find the welcome screen.</p>
<p>In USER ACCOUNTS&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt; Change the way users log on &nbsp;or off&nbsp; -&gt; Use the welcome screen and Use fast user switching&nbsp; Both are checked.</p>
<p>How to solve this problem? Please advice.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does this machine is part from Workgroup?</p>
<p>If it does and you are using one Admin account and a Guest a account with Fast User Switching feature enabled on this machine this scenario will happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rid of this try either to assign a password for the Admin account or create another account with Admin Privileges and see if the Welcome screen will show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which you are experiencing is an Auto login if I understood your issue right!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know</p>

<p>Can you tell me what happen for this changes to happen?</p>
<p>Did you install/uninstall any software/hardware recently?</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=305281</p>
<p>I read this can be the cause of Display driver issue, try to update your Video card driver from the vendor website.</p>
<p>Please select the right graphic/video card and download the latest driver for it (that if your Graphic is Radeon)!</p>

<h2>            Disabling Windows Defender through Group Policy enables Firewall blocking of incoming domain connections.</h2>
                    <p>Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with Windows Firewall disabling incoming domain connections after turning off Windows Defender (Windows 10). Our organization uses third party software for network security (webroot &amp; Malwarebytes Endpoint) so we don't need Windows Defender
 or Windows Firewall. We disable Defender through GPO but this becomes replaced with Firewall which in someways is worse. We used to have ESET which overrides both and doesn't block domain connections but ever since we moved away from ESET we have been having
 these issues. Is there a way to correct this en masse?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Brian
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience of having to suggest the re-route, but Technet has a lot of experts there that know the ins and outs of enterprise issues; especially domain configurations for clients and security. So, they will be better able to diagnose and determine whats causing of the problem.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your corporation.

<h2>            Xbox game pass, pass due</h2>
                    So, a month ago I subscribed to game pass and then a month later they pinned a pass due charge on a old card that I have on my account, but never used for game pass. Instead of charging the card I used when I started my subscription. Is there anyway to
 remove this old card and the past due flag on it? Or who would I have to get in contact with to resolve this issue? Thanks .

                    Win 7 (64) is not detecting my Realtek RTL8111 embedded LAN.&nbsp; It shows in Device Manager as unknown.&nbsp; When I try to manually install the drivers it errors that no appropriate drivers where found.&nbsp; Also Realtek's install package says device not found.&nbsp;
 It works fine under XP.&nbsp; Any Ideas?

            The problem was a brain dead old man.&nbsp; At some point I had turned off the embedded NIC and started&nbsp; using my old linksys standby card.&nbsp; Don't remember when or why. Discovered the problem when I went to pull the linksys out because it's not supported under
 Win 7.&nbsp; I hate to admit the amount of time I spent on this issue.

<h2>            I paid for the upgrade to Microsoft Solitaire Collection and NOTHING happened.</h2>
                    <p>Tonight I clicked on the upgrade for the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. I paid $9.99&nbsp; for the upgrade using my credit card. So fat nothing has changed. When I bring up the Microsoft Solitaire Collection I am still given the option to upgrade which I have
 already paid for. What can I do. So far it looks like Microsoft has taken my money. Either issue me a refund or tell how to get the UPGRADE I paid for. Thank you for your help.</p>

<h2>            XBOX 360 Live disconnecting. Error message&#58; &#34;modem set to moderate&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just bought my XBOX Live membership last night, as well as the gold pack in order to play GTA 5 Online. When I connected my account and started up the Live game, it connected briefly, installed a couple of updates, and then disconnected. I received a message about my modem being set to "moderate" and something about NAT or NAP... does this sound familiar?&nbsp; I spoke to my internet provider (my internet is connected and works fine for online and stuff--just had problems with XBOX Live) who said to speak to you. Anyway I want to get this cleared up because I spent money to play and am losing money waiting for this to connect. Thanks so much for your help,</p>

<p>After installing&nbsp;Win 7 on a old XP system the first update was Win&nbsp;update agent.&nbsp; After that install, when update was started it would run about 10 minutes and the cpu would top out&nbsp;at 100%&nbsp;.&nbsp; I tried re installing the operating system to have the same thing
 happen.&nbsp; Downloaded both Windows update checkers, ran them before, after and during, the failure.&nbsp; Sometimes the update screen would stop with a error posted, if you ran it while the cpu was at 100%.&nbsp; Search the net and the machine with the error code.&nbsp; This
 is what I did to fix the problem.</p>
<p>I installed KBKB3060716 not sure this helped but the point where it failed changed.</p>
<p>Set the update program to- important updates only.&nbsp; Reduce the number of up dates.</p>
<p>Set the program to never autoupdate anything.</p>
<p>Set the Windows Update service to manual.</p>
<p>rebooted</p>
<p>Open the C: drive</p>
<p>created atemp folder.</p>
<p>Open the Windows directory</p>
<p>Found the file&nbsp;Windowsupdate.log and right clicked cut</p>
<p>moved to atemp folder and clicked paste</p>
<p>Open Windows directory</p>
<p>Open &nbsp;SoftwareDistribution directory</p>
<p>Highlighted all folders and files and right clicked cut</p>
<p>&nbsp;moved to atemp folder and clicked paste</p>
<p>click start, typed run in search box</p>
<p>Typed in Cmd /c ren %systemroot%\System32\Spupdsvc.exe Spupdsvc1.old&nbsp; and entered</p>
<p>Started Windows update</p>
<p>Click&nbsp;install updates button</p>
<p>Went off and did something else for&nbsp;3 hrs.</p>
<p>When I checked the screen said it was ready to over 150 updates.</p>
<p>When I checked the windowsupdate.log file there was a line entry&nbsp;1 hour 10 minutes after the last entry about updating datastore, about setting a second timeout time 6hr later.&nbsp; No errors in the file that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I selected about 100 updated and started the install&nbsp;process.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message/code when you try to update or play the game?</p>
<p>2. Is the issue specific to card games?</p>
<p>3. Are you referring to Microsoft Solitaire Collection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The card games by Microsoft are called Microsoft Solitaire Collection (includes a version of Spider Solitaire). There is also Microsoft Mahjong, Microsoft Minesweeper, Microsoft Taptiles and others.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If updating the app does not work then, I would suggest you to completely uninstall and reinstall Microsoft card games and check.</font></span></p>

<h2>            win10 file explorer crashes with right click</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone have a viable, fix for this problem? I'm about to abandon Win10 for two reasons, one is I can't get to my files, and two Edge can't print PDF files. Both are very big problems. I have what I believe to be the most recent build of 10. I'm shut
 down without file explorer.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Texas,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the File Explorer crashes with right click on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the following troubleshooting methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the DISM tool</strong><br />
Use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows corruption errors. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
2. Type <strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth </strong>and press Enter.<br />
Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run System File Checker (SFC)<br />
</strong>Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "<strong>System File Checker</strong>" or "<strong>sfc</strong>". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions.
<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, sfc <strong>/scannow</strong> and then press Enter.
<br />
3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a
<br />
regular hard disk and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive. <br />
4. <strong>Restart</strong> your computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For resolving issue related to printing <strong>PDF files in Microsoft Edge</strong>, refer the suggestions by Giridhar from the following thread.

                    You should really add an option to disable the big as volume scroll thingy in the top right screen when using function keys. I have looked everywhere and only found other people making their own program to hide it.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Unable to open many files, task manger, etc.</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 7 about a week ago. Today, suddenly I am unable to open many files, apps, task manger, etc. I tried running file manger, but it will not run. I tried "Troubleshooter" but it will not run. I tried running file scanner in the command
 prompt but it says I must be Administrator (I AM the administrator!). I tried to use some restore commands but it will not run. Something is drastically wrong! Please help!

<h2>            Cannot Install a Printer Samsung ML-2510 - Windows Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    I just purchased a new Computer with Windows Vista Home Premium and I'm trying to install a Samsung ML-2510 laser printer&nbsp;and here's what happens: after I download the drivers the installer starts up, unpacks its files, then throws up an<br />
"Initializing..." dialog box. The progress bar gets to about 75% completion,<br />
then I get a blue screen of death. I've downloaded the latest driver software<br />
from Samsung and get the same result at the same point of the install<br />
process.&nbsp;I've tried disabling all of my anti-virus/firewall/etc. software and STILL get nothing.<br />
Any suggestions or assistance would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br />

<blockquote>I just purchased a new Computer with Windows Vista Home Premium and I'm trying to install a Samsung ML-2510 laser printer&nbsp;and here's what happens: after I download the drivers the installer starts up, unpacks its files, then throws up an<br />
"Initializing..." dialog box. The progress bar gets to about 75% completion,<br />
then I get a blue screen of death. I've downloaded the latest driver software<br />
from Samsung and get the same result at the same point of the install<br />
process.&nbsp;I've tried disabling all of my anti-virus/firewall/etc. software and STILL get nothing.<br />
Any suggestions or assistance would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I used the Universal Print Driver from Samsung.&nbsp; It installs, but then it asks if first time use.&nbsp; When I answer yes, it searches for the printer and "Windows Explorer" shuts down.&nbsp; The causes the print driver to abort.&nbsp; Any ideas???

<h2>            No audio on Skype for Business web on OSX</h2>
                    
<p>We use SFB for online board meetings. All of the board use Macs running either 10.11 or 10.10 versions of OSX. We have been using the Skype Meetings App&nbsp;successfully for the past year or so but for the last 3 weeks we have continuous problems with no sound.
 The Lync/SFB app on my iPhone works fine as does plain vanilla Skype client on my macbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we wait for Lync 2016 for Mac and/or the&nbsp;Skype Meetings App to work...are there any workarounds/fixes that the community know of to get the conferencing service working?</p>

<p>hi peter,</p>
<p>based on your description, i understand the skype meetings app stopped working suddenly 3 weeks ago and you are looking for an alternate way to get the meeting function to work. firstly, i’d like to confirm if you are referring to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/join-a-skype-meeting-with-skype-for-business-web-app-4828ad18-ed21-422a-a870-94d676d4b72a?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
skype for business web app</a>&nbsp;by mentioning ‘skype meetings app’. if yes, may i request some more information to better understand the current situation?<br />
1. how many users are affected by the issue? could you provide one of the affected accounts (<strong>no password</strong>) so that we can check if everything is working fine from the server side? you can access the private message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations<br />
2. please also provide the detailed steps of how you schedule and attend the meeting using the app so we can check if the issue can be reproduced from our side. some related screenshots are appreciated. to upload pictures, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> and <strong>insert/edit media</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/562762fb-283a-4f72-ab4e-e2f8e04222a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/562762fb-283a-4f72-ab4e-e2f8e04222a6" /></a><br />
<br />
3. does the issue occur on every user during each skype for business meeting using the web app?<br />
4. have you tried multiple browsers like safari and chrome to check the issue? <br />
5. please try uninstalling the plugin and then reinstall it and check if there is any improvement. to locate the plugin, you can open finder, hold down the option key and choose go &gt; library, then open the internet plug-ins folder.</p>
<p>any updates will be appreciated and we are always here to help.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
sam</p>

<p>hi sam,</p>
<p>1. all of our users (7) are affected, i've given one account via private messaging</p>
<p>2. we schedule meetings through the portal.office.com calendar application then click the link generated in the meeting invite. attached is a screenshot of the url (highlighted) as shown in my calendar.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b921e4d2-13b8-4dbd-984d-78d0b5efdf26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b921e4d2-13b8-4dbd-984d-78d0b5efdf26" /></a></p>
<p>3. yes</p>
<p>4. we have both chrome and safari users. both have problems</p>
<p>5. the app itself is not a plugin. we have all downloaded&nbsp;skypemeetingsapp.dmg this app is launched when a user clicks 'join the meeting'</p>
<p>could you confirm the current stable version of the meetings app so i can ensure all users have the correct version.</p>
<p>regards</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>I have checked the account, server side should be OK.</p>
<p>The current Skype Meetings App version is 16.2.0.40.</p>
<p>To better clarify the root cause of the issue, could you please check the following?</p>
<p>1.Make sure that all the users' browsers version is the latest and the plug-in has been enabled.</p>
<p>2.The OS system is the latest/the same.</p>
<p>3.To determine whether the issue is related to the network connection. Let's try using the app under another network environment (home/coffee bar etc.).</p>
<p>We look forward to your update.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>We ran another meeting today after having each board member go through the uninstall/reinstall process. Users that had previously had 'normal' Skype running could not get audio working. A reboot was needed. Can you investigate the co-existance of Skype and
 Skype for Business. BTW, users have no problem when they have both apps on mobile (both iOS and Android)</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>The official Skype for Business web app is a plug-in, the interface of which is different with the screenshot above. Could you please uninstall the Skype web app and try to join a Skype for Business meeting by using the Skype for Business web app to check
 the issue?</p>
<p>Please refer to the <b>Join with Skype for Business Web App if Skype for Business desktop is installed</b> in this article:

<p>Brook, I don't have the Skype Web App installed. The are no Skype Internet plugins on my computer.</p>
<p>What I do have on my mac (I'm on a MacBook Air running El Capitain) are:</p>
<p>Skype App (version 7.21)</p>
<p>Skype Meetings App (version 1.0.0.54)</p>
<p>The 'no audio' problem arises when I use the Skype App and then try to have a Skype for Business meeting. The audio problem happens wether I have Skype App open or quit it. The only way I can get audio working on a Skype for Business meeting is to reboot.</p>
