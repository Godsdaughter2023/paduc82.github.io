<p><span>Hi Bandit31,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you create a number column (Vacation Start(d)) (the total of the employee’s vacations) and a number column (Vacation Taken(d) (the vacation days taken
 by the employees) in the “PTO Request List”, you can create a calculated column to calculate the balance vocation days. However, if you want to sum the calculated column, you can’t use the out-of-the-box way to achieve that. You may need some customized codes.
 I suggest you post a new thread on our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointcustomization%2Csharepointdevelopment&amp;filter=alltypes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>Hello, I have a Samsung Omnia ICON (other countries outside of Australia is called Samsung Omnia &nbsp;i8000 or Omnia 2) with Windows Mobile 6.5. Samsung say that there will be an official rom update for upgrading to Windows Mobile 6.5.3 for this mobile

<p>If they release an updated ROM, it will only be available on the Vendors website (or sometimes it is on the phone carriers website depending on their agreements).&nbsp; Check the Samsung site to see if they have released an upgrade yet.</p>

<p><br />
Although the Windows Update program is onb your device (and it does work ...&nbsp; I used in during beta testing), none of the Vendors.carriers have implemented its use so for now (and the foreseeable future) it will not be something you can use.</p>

    <title>Why is Excel 2010 changing the cell reference in my conditional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyematt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Excel 2010 changing the cell reference in my conditional formatting formula&#63;</h2>
                    This is an intermittent problem, and I can't seem to find a pattern, but it happens approximately 25-50% of the time. &nbsp;This is a real-life example using a .xlsx file with Excel 2010 (14.0.6117.5003) SP1 MSO (14.0.6123.5001).
<div><br />
<div>I selected the range G6:K18, opened the conditional formatting manager, and created a new conditional format. &nbsp;There were no pre-existing formats for this range.</div>
<div>I entered the formula as follows:&nbsp;</div>
<div>=not(isnumber(g6))</div>
<div>in the formula field</div>
<div>I clicked the "Format" button, selected "Darker 50%" for the text color, and clicked "ok". &nbsp;The formula still read as I entered it. &nbsp;Clicked "ok" to get to the formula manager and "ok" again to apply the formatting, but the formatting was not correct (numbers
 were grey)</div>
</div>
<div>I checked the formula, and it had been changed to:</div>
<div>=NOT(ISNUMBER(C1048570))</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why does this happen, and how do I get it to stop? &nbsp;It's not a particularly serious problem, as if I change the cell reference back to g6, it generally stays that way. &nbsp;However, it is VERY irritating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks-in-advance,</div>

            <p>I suspect that K18 was the active cell in the selection when you created the rule. When you edit the rule, the formula is displayed for the top left cell of the range it applies to (G6).</p>
<p>If K18 is the active cell, you should use =NOT(ISNUMBER(K18)). Alternatively, make sure that G6 is the active cell within the selection when you create the rule.</p>

<div><br />
<div>Why does this happen, and how do I get it to stop?</div>
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>This is occurring due the way your original selection is made. It looks like you are selecting G6:K18 by starting at K18 and&nbsp;dragging&nbsp;up and to the left. While this does make the G6:K18 range selected, the selected range has K18 as the
<i>active cell.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</i><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwerwew.sn2.livefilestore.com%2fy1peSid3inrKaPBpCQqPC4neiVc45hjaz50KLgCSYy40Y8-hTu41nybZcnVn4xRZoC7xLfNhNa8eBl-zTOwAfVJIZC3R4VqKwZe%2fCF_ActiveCell.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /><br />
<br />
So your formula should have been,<br />
<br />
=NOT(ISNUMBER(K18))<br />
<br />
When you used your formula and then returned to it with the G6:K18 range selected
<i>but with G6 as the Active Cell</i>, Excel's CF used the relative G6 reference to start at G6 and go right 4 columns to column C and up 12 rows to row 1048570. It's row 1049570 because Excel wraps to the bottom and continues&nbsp;offsetting&nbsp;once you have&nbsp;reached&nbsp;row
 1.<br />
<br />
It may help to think if the formula in R1C1 terms. WIth K18 active using your formula becomes<br />
<br />
=NOT(ISNUMBER(R[-12]C[-4]))<br />
<br />
That's all pretty&nbsp;confusing. The solution is to make your initial range selection from top left to bottom right, not the other way around. In other words, always leave the top left cell as the
<i>active cell</i>&nbsp;if you want predicable results.</div>

    <title>How to open outlook.com features in new tab&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dreamquest&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open outlook.com features in new tab&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before the new upgrade to Outlook.com (2016) when I would select People or Calendars, while viewing my Mail in my browser (chrome), the feature would open up in a new tab. Now, the Mail window I am viewing migrates to People/Calendars.... which ever feature
 I selected. And, for me, that's not very convenient. So how do I get Outlook.com features to open in a new tab instead of using the tab I am currently in?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10 and google chrome as my defaults. These are the same programs I was using prior to the outlook.com upgrade which, when selecting an outlook.com feature, that feature opened in a new tab. Maybe this is a function of the browser, but
 I don't think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also hold Ctrl when you left-click "People", rather than right-click and open in a new tab there. Ctrl+click is also "open in a new tab".</p>

            <p>You can select multiple sheets much like you can select multiple files in Windows Explorer:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click the sheet tab of the first sheet you want to select, then hold down the Shift key while you click the sheet tab of the last sheet you want to select. All sheets in between will also be selected.</li><li>Hold down the Ctrl key to select or deselect individual sheets. This way you can select sheets that are not next to each other.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When you have selected multiple sheets, you'll see [Group] in the title bar of the window.</p>
<p>You can now print all selected sheets at once, or export all selected sheets to PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning: when multiple sheets are selected, changes you make to cells will apply to all selected sheets. So don't forget to select a single sheet again when you're done with editing/printing/exporting multiple sheets.</p>

    <title>Portal login still redirects to retired ADFS server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgq85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Portal login still redirects to retired ADFS server</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to get our O365 login working by authenticating a pilot group that's been sync'd to O365 via the Azure Sync Tool I downloaded from the portal when I logged in as Admin and setup on a 2012 R2 server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilot group, which is just one user, sync'd fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, when I go to sign in at portal.office.com with my *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it still gives the message "We're taking you to your organization's sign-in page".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then redirects to an <a href="https://ADFS.domain.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ADFS.domain.com</a>&nbsp;(where domain is our actual company's domain name that's online).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I connected via Powershell per online instructions, and ran the following command to convert the domain in question from "Federated" to "Managed":&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName domain.com –Authentication Managed</p>

<p>And now it shows as Managed instead of Federated.</p>

<p>However every time I try to sign in in the browser, I still continue to get the "We're taking you to your organization's sign-in page" message, which lands on the dead/unavailable adfs.domain.com site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ADFS server it's trying to direct to is not even around anymore. It was deleted my a terminated team member from before my time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't run&nbsp;Set-MsolADFSContext because the ADFS server doesn't exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we stuck with this forever? Do I need to contact a Microsoft tech support and is there a free line of support to fix stuff like this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi jgq85,</p>
<p>What you have done is correct. We can convert the federated domain back to standard, even if ADFS server is removed. Here is a related article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2662960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2662960</a> #
 Method 2: “Revert the domain federation back to standard authentication“</p>
<p>If there is any further update, please let us know.</p>
<p>Moreover, about the second question related to Skype for Business DNS, I suggest you post a new thread for a separate discussion. Our engineer will help you troubleshot it in the new thread. In this thread, we will focus on the federated/standard domain
 issue. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Hi jgq85,</p>
<p>Generally, we use method 2 in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2662960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.microsoft.com/.../2662960</a> &nbsp;to convert back to managed domain. Moreover, there is no additional task we take in Office 365 side. If the issue occurs in the future, please post back with the detailed information for further investigation.</p>

<h2>            Word for Mac 16.10&#58; Letter appear on top of each other</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after i installed the Update to&nbsp;Word for Mac 16.10 yesterday some letters&nbsp;appear on top of each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9e02bb0-24fa-4e1a-9f8e-e2dc02042cc2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9e02bb0-24fa-4e1a-9f8e-e2dc02042cc2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Changing the font and cleaning font cache does not solve the problem, there is only a little variation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition: If i change the font size the justification seems to be broken, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88bd75fc-7f30-445d-a7df-91476985ef2d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88bd75fc-7f30-445d-a7df-91476985ef2d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Working in such texts is quite impossible, the cursor is not where is should be, letters appear on positions away from the cursor position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advised how to solve this?</p>

<p>Hi Klaas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to guess that there is a bug and here is the way for you to report it directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Smiley face control on the ribbon (far right side). Choose the "What could be better..." option. Tell them the issue and if you can be on a page that shows the issue, it will automatically pick it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, make sure you include your email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will send them a link to this thread, but I also need you to send the information as I've outlined it above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps</p>

<p>Hi hamnbiskits,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you are having issues accessing your Hotmail/Outlook account. Let us perform the troubleshooting steps below to isolate if this is an issue with the email server:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Update and optimize your browser. Clear browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that this is not a browser issue. Once done, please try again to access your email using a different web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, add-ins etc. feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Try using a different account and check if the issue will still occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Try to access your account directly from OneDrive site. Go to this <strong>
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?id=root&amp;cid=C7E3B6219549BEB5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and log in to your account. Click on the box like icon on the upper left hand corner of the web page. Select
<strong>Mail</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. To make sure that Outlook.com is running normally, we suggest that you check the service status from this
<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Once done, try to access again your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there will be any difference after the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />
</p>

                    In some of my saved&nbsp; Word 2010 documents, large "@" signs appear randomly over the text.&nbsp; They won't move or delete or reformat.&nbsp; What are they, why are they there, and most importantly, how do I get them to go away?

            From&nbsp;your description, I assume they are not part of the text. Perhaps they are behind text, like a watermark? Activate the header and see whether you can select and delete the marks.

            Thanks.&nbsp; No, it's not a watermark.&nbsp; That was one of the first things I thought of.&nbsp; Sorry I didn't mention that as one of the fixes I tried.&nbsp; In any event, it wouldn't get rid of the little hyphens before some paragraphs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something I've never

<div>Have you considered uploading one of the documents to a common file area like
<a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a> or <a href="http://www.4shared.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
4Shared</a> and posting the link back here so others can see for themselves?<br />
<br />
Without being able to see the errant behavior for oneself, this would appear to be an&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;in throwing mud at a wall to see if anything will stick.<br />

If that is not possible, how about supplying a detailed list of what you <i>have</i>&nbsp;tried so attempts are not duplicated.</div>

            <p>Are the hyphens before paragraphs like bullets? Perhaps some AutoFormat As You Type option has fired? Are you displaying the text with nonprinting characters displayed? What styles are applied to the text in question? What font is in use? I've seen some

            No, the hyphens are on a line by themselves, just before the paragraphs.<br />
No, there is no auto format on.<br />
No, I am not displaying the text with non printing features on.<br />
It is is standard office style.<br />
The font was supposed to be Garamond regular 13 pt., but the saved text is in Times New Roman 12 pt.<br />
Yes, the signs appear in print preview.<br />
<br />
The signs and markings just appeared in a number of saved documents without my ever having touched them.&nbsp; I saved the documents, looking just fine, but wen reopened, these weird insertions are there, and won't delete.&nbsp; They're not watermarks either--or at least
 the delete watermark feature won't remove them.

            I looked at the document and didn't see anything that looked like hyphens, but I identified the A's and @'s as quotation marks in the WP Typographic Symbols font.

<h2>            Can&#39;t receive calls from Phone numbers, but can receive calls from other Skype IDs</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i've recently developed a problem with my Skype whereby i can receive calls from other Skype accounts, but not from phone numbers, which is causing me some problems as my Skype # is my direct line at work for customers to call me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen some people mention on other forums that they receive notifications that they have a missed call, but i don't even get that... I have no way of knowing that someone has tried to call me until they email me later to follow up and say they couldn't
 get through to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to call from a phone number, there is no dial tone or indication that it is connecting and just not being picked up the other end. It just doesn't connect in the first place, then hangs up with a "call failed" type notification on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried some of the tips i've seen on various different forums, such as looking into the Windows "quiet hours" settings, updating to the latest version of skype and temporarily changing the "allow calls from..." from anyone, to contacts only and back
 to anyone, but so far I haven't had any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions would be welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(At least in the mean-time i can still make calls!)</p>

<h2>            Lookup Sum total from one list to another</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm relatively new at SP and apply formulas to the settings.&nbsp; I have created a list that populates requested PTO time for each employee.&nbsp; I had grouped or summed each employee's hours under the filtering option.&nbsp; I'm stuck one a piece.&nbsp; I'm looking for one
 of two options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How can I pull into the Employee PTO list, from another list, the total hours allotted for that person and reflect another calculation that shows the difference?&nbsp; Total hours allotted, Total hours take and total hours remaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Or, pull the sum total from the Employee PTO list and reflect it under the other list that shows the allotted hours.&nbsp; I can't figure out or find any reading material that shows I can pull a filtered sum into another list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any feedback.</p>

<p><span>Hi Bandit31,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your post, I think “<em>total hours allotted for that person</em>” and “<em>sum total from the Employee PTO list</em>” are not actual columns.
 You must have selected <strong>Totals</strong> to display by modifying the view, as shown in the screenshot below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b1313ad-e548-48a3-8a1c-b9afb8a6b26d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b1313ad-e548-48a3-8a1c-b9afb8a6b26d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tested on my end by using Lookup column (Lookup column type let you choose values based on information that is already stored in the site. In other
 it lets you pull data from one list another in the same site) and I don’t see any way to pull “<em>total hours allotted for that person</em>” and “<em>sum total from the Employee PTO list</em>” as these are not actual columns,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have column type such as</span>
<strong>Single line of text</strong>, <strong>Number</strong> and <strong>Date and Time,
</strong>you can consider using <strong>Lookup</strong> to pull data from source list to destination<strong>.</strong> Rest other columns such as
<strong>Multiple lines of text</strong>, <strong>Currency</strong>, <strong>Person</strong>
<strong>or</strong> <strong>Group</strong>, <strong>Calculated</strong>, <strong>
Hyperlink</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>Picture</strong>, <strong>Custom</strong>
<strong>Columns</strong>, <strong>Yes</strong>/<strong>No</strong>, <strong>Choice</strong> are not supported when using Lookup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I’ll suggest you consider using workflow. Here’s a related thread for your reference.</p>

<p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have SharePoint 2016 and when I generate a Lookup column, I am not getting a sum total for each individual and is why I used the filter version.&nbsp; The column comes up blank.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm a novice, so would you be able to give samples of
 how you obtained the sum totals based on the look up column.&nbsp; &nbsp; It makes sense I wouldn't be able to create a workflow from a filter total as you need columns.&nbsp; Any help is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Bandit31, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have not clarified my point, I meant I tried using Lookup column but there is no way to pull sum total as it is not an actual column. Lookup only supports
<strong><span>Single line of text</span></strong>, <strong><span>Number</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Date and Time </span></strong><strong><span>columns</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may check the link in my first post, the thread is about SharePoint 2010, but you’ll get the idea on how to create the workflow to display sum from list to another.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, since you are using SharePoint 2016, I’ll suggest you post a new thread in
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?forum=SP2016&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>MS has changed the way search appears in start. It is a tile app. If you do not like that kind of presentation for search than you can let MS know through windows feedback.</p>

</p><p>Re: duplicate entries after import</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of three reasons that could be occurring</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) You "Allowed duplicates to be created"</p>
<p>2) The field values&nbsp;triggering a "duplicate" in Outlook differ in the CSV file from what is contained in Outlook</p>
<p>3) You did not map all the same fields - specifically those involving what Outlook uses to determine "duplicates" which for the most part are based on &lt;Names&gt; and &lt;Email Address&gt;</p>

<p>The language used for Spell Checking is a character format characteristic that is likely embedded in your Normal.dotm file.
<br />
<br />
Try this: <br />
Create a new document and type the following and press the Enter key: <br />
=rand() <br />
<br />
Press Ctrl+A to select everything and go to the Review tab. <br />
Under language - Set proofing language: <br />
Which is the language selection? <br />
Change it to the one you want and OK your way back to your text. <br />
<br />
Click in any word. <br />
<br />
Your text is probably in the Normal style. <br />
<br />
Right-click in Normal in the Quick Styles and select Modify to match selection. <br />
Then right-click again and select Modify. <br />
<br />
A dialog box will pop up. Check the box near the bottom that says New documents based on this template.
<br />
<br />
OK out of the dialog box. <br />
<br />
Close your document and Word. <br />
You do not need to save the document. However, if prompted whether you want to save changes to the template, say "Yes."

<h2>            Permission Mapping Issues for Calendar Sub-Folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd managed to provide calendar permission to one of my colleagues which is a sub-folder with an Owner level. In OWA, it could detect that the permission was provided but problem is that on the Outlook client, it doesn't mapped the whole sub-folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other of my colleagues doesn't have a problem with this but only points to one user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Functionality: Mapped sub-folders doesn't appear in Outlook client</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far here are steps taken:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Office and OS Update</p>
<p>2. Done re-profile (remove &amp; re-add Outlook account on Client)</p>
<p>3. Set permissions to Owner level </p>
<p>4. Synchronize manually the folders in Outlook client</p>
<p>5. Verified via Outlook Web App for the permissions and was able to add the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your kind advise on this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>System:</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Lu Bar,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the issue is that you shared a calendar to one of your colleagues and give him/her owner permission to access your calendar, but he/she cannot see the sub-folders of the calendars but can see the primary calendar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the subfolders, may I know how you created them in Calendar? Since you mentioned you could detect the permission in OWA, can the colleague see the subfolders in OWA? Other colleagues can see the
<strong>same subfolders</strong> that you shared?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try to remove the permission and re-assign to check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Besides, for the “what I want to accomplish is that I can see the primary calendar of the user with the right permissions but it doesn't include the sub-folders” you mentioned, if you mean you just want to see the primary calendar of the colleague?
 If I have any misunderstanding? Because based on your posting, I think you hope that the colleague can see the sub-folders.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p><span>Hello MargaretLaw-Homewood,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no option to link or merge Skype accounts. You may opt to delete one of the Skype accounts, but please be informed that deleting a Skype
 account will also delete its associated Microsoft account. Kindly refer to this FAQ:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you decide to delete and you can access both accounts, you can first transfer your Skype credits from one account to the other as a gift:

<h2>            My Office 365 for Mac completes intallation &#40;6.5Mb&#41; and never launches the Activation code Step. How to proceed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Split from this thread.</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I am having the same problem.</p>
<p>I have removed everything as suggested by the link in the first post.</p>
<p>When I attempt to reinstall I am faced with 'this will take 6.3 MB of space on your computer'.</p>
<p>The installer runs to the end, but Word doesn't open to activate and no Office 2016 applications appear in the Applications list.</p>

<p>I ended up trying to install using Terminal. </p>
<p>The output showed nothing was installed due to the version conflicting with another Office installation on VM that had shortcuts in the Applications folder.
</p>
<p>I removed the shortcuts and presto! installation succeeded.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 - open all files in ONE instance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tsdn2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 - open all files in ONE instance</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my Excel 2016 (16.0.10228.20051 32-bit):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one Excel instance running. (N.B. - the "<em>Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)</em>" checkbox in Advanced Options is NOT checked.)<strong> What I need is - for all Excel files that I am about to open to open in my first
 and only Excel instanc</strong><strong>e, always</strong>, and regardless of:</p>
<p>- how many files I open simultaneously,</p>
<p>- where the files are located (i.e. on local drive or on OneDrive so the system needs to download them before opening)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;and including when opening Excel files from other Office apps, i.e. Outlook attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior that I've been seeing in Excel 2016 is, at best, inconsistent:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When opening multiple additional files at once from disk (select multiple files/right-click/Open) - it opens the first
<em>n </em>files in the first Excel instance, but then from <em>n</em>+1 file it starts opening them in a new instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. A variation of the above is when in my first and only Excel instance I have a workbook open in XLSTART folder. Then upon opening multiple files at once, when it reaches it's
<em>n</em>+1 file and the new instance launches and tries to open the file in XLSTART folder again, but it is already open in the first instance, so the warning message saying "<em>this file is already open</em>" (or something like that) shows up and files
<em>n</em>+2, <em>n</em>+3, <em>n</em>+4, etc. till the last one, will all try to open in a
<strong>separate </strong>instance, each triggering the same warning message.</p>
<p>I'd like to state at this point that this is not file specific, the file <em>n</em>+1 is usually a different file every time.
</p>
<p>Also, I am aware of the workaround (i.e. dragging files onto open Excel window) and I am using it - the above is to demonstrate the symptoms I've been experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When generating Excel files by another application (call it AppX) - you might say that this is likely the AppX's issue - I have no means to verify this unfortunately, however, the randomness of the new instances launching in this case is similar to all
 other scenarios described here, so I doubt the cause is my AppX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Finally, when opening Excel files from Outlook email attachments - i.e. double-clicking an Excel attachment in Outlook's reading pane - it may open it in the first Excel instance, but may also decide to open it in a new one. From my testing, if the Excel's
 file previewer is disabled at that point (i.e. listed under Options/Add-Ins/Manage - Disabled Items) it will most likely open the attachment in a new instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's my observations, hope it helps to shed some light on the issue. I know how to open files in a new instance if I want it. The problem is, it happens when I don't want it and in some cases, I don't seem to have any control over this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>J.</p>

<p>Hi J,<br />
<br />
In Microsoft Excel 2013 and later versions, when you open multiple spreadsheets, they all open in the same instance of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the situations you listed except the AppX one from my side, and the result is that all the files open in the same instance instead of opening each one in a new instance.<br />
1. Open multiple Excel files at once from disk and all the files open in the same instance.<br />
2. For the XLSTART folder, when you click on a file, then all the files will open. So if you select all the files in XLSTART folder and open at once, it is normal that you get instances for the number of files.<br />
3. Double click Excel attachments in Outlook and they are in the same instance whether in the same email or different email. Even when the excel preview is disabled or enabled, the Excel files are still in the same instance .<br />
<br />

<br />
To better understand your situation and provide help for you, please confirm the information below:<br />
1. Please provide your Office product name and version to share with us according to this article:

What version of Office am I using?</a><br />
2. How many files did you open when you encountered this issue? Is the behavior the same when you open 2 vs 6 as an example?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Gloria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking into this. Yes, the issue is still very much here. I've actually re-imaged my machine yesterday only to experience the same issue in the new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. See my initial post for version ID. After re-imaging, I am using Office 16.0.10228.200<strong>80</strong> 32-bit - in which I continue to experience the same issue.<br />
2. It depends:<br />
- when opening multiple files at once (i.e. 11 files) 4-5 files will open in the first instance, before new instance gets launched for the remaining files.<br />
- for opening xlsx Outlook attachments, it can be as <em>early </em>as the first file (i.e. Excel running with one file open, double-clicking Outlook attachment launches new instance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I recorded the problem related to opening xlsx attachments from Outlook in a gif file below.</p>
<p>I start from un-hiding my personal macro workbook, so that you can see there are no other files open. Then I attempt to open Outlook attachment by double-clicking on it. It looks like it takes Excel a few seconds to react - perhaps this is useful in identifying
 the cause of the issue. And as you can see, it launches the file in new instance. See more comments below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9723e0dd-3f2e-40a8-a759-cc71c0c87098?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9723e0dd-3f2e-40a8-a759-cc71c0c87098?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your other comments:<br />
<strong>Safe mode</strong> - not sure why this was suggested, none of my Office apps want to launch while Windows is in safe mode (see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1a8bc89-7d72-445f-a8d6-2de1fa0bc135?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1a8bc89-7d72-445f-a8d6-2de1fa0bc135?upload=true" height="281" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>XLSTART folde</strong><strong>r</strong> - I'm sorry if that wasn't clear in my initial post. Let me explain it better. This isn't about opening multiple files from XLSTART folder. It's about opening multiple files (from any folder) when in my first
 and only Excel instance a file that sits in XLSTART folder is currently open (i.e. my personal macro workbook). In this example, the moment the 2nd instance launches and generates the "File in use" dialog box, every remaining file will launch a new instance
 for itself, each generating the same dialog box. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>My Excel is running (one instance only) and my personal macro workbook (located in XLSTART folder) is open in it. Now, I want o open 11 .xlsx files at once. I go to the folder with my files (i.e. C:\Users\Me\Documents), select all 11 files, right-click one
 and press Open. My files begin to open. Files 1-4 all open in my first Excel instance, but, for some reason, file #5 launches a new instance. The new instance tries to open my personal macro workbook in XLSTART folder, but it is already open in my first instance.
 So the "File in use" warning message pops-up in the 2nd instance and awaits my input/selection. Meanwhile, file #6 wants to open. I can only assume that it tries to use the 2nd instance, but because the 2nd instance is awaiting my input, it launches a 3rd
 instance. The third instance attempts to open my personal macro workbook in XLSTART folder and generates the same warning message. Then file #7 wants to open and it goes through the same cycle of launching new instance because the last one awaits user input
 and triggering the below warning message.&nbsp; At the end of this <em>loop</em>, I have
<strong>8 Excel instances open</strong>, 1st one has my personal macro workbook and files 1-4 open, and instances 2nd through 8th are displaying "File in Use" warning message.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89319514-744a-4eaf-b561-6bc1a6702134?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89319514-744a-4eaf-b561-6bc1a6702134?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is all clear now, let me know if not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Here's what the result of dragging 10 files onto an open Excel window looks like (all files open in the first Excel instance - as expected)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2e87c8-539d-48c4-942e-7732cb1dfd38?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed2e87c8-539d-48c4-942e-7732cb1dfd38?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>

</p><p>Yes, I have some of my document libraries <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-your-documents-folder-with-onedrive-0f4ddfd3-4a72-4013-9d94-181dab6be19a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi J,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to our test, when we open files which are protected or read-only (in this case because they are locked for editing), they will be opened in new instances.<br />
For example, when we open file A, B, C, D, E, file C is read-only, then we will get three instances: file A and B in one instance, file C in one instance, file D and E in one instance.<br />
<br />
Please let me confirm with you why your files are locked for editing. Is someone else editing them, or are you using something to prevent them from opening in edit mode directly?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Gloria<br />

<p>Hi Gloria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for this delay.</p>
<p>The test files I used to demonstrate the problem were NOT protected, read-only or locked for editing. I believe it should be quite clear from the first gif file I shared on June 29th (second post - i.e. dragging files onto open Excel window). If these files
 were locked for editing then they would have opened, a) with a yellow <em>bar </em>
under formula bar saying that the file is locked, etc., or b) if what you are saying in your post from 3rd July were true, they would have opened in multiple instances - but they didn't.</p>
<p>As for any regular, non-test files that I normally work with, they are very rarely read-only or locked for editing, so I am quite sure that the issue is NOT caused by read-only files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another test I've done in the meantime:</p>
<p>1. I have one Excel instance running.</p>
<p>2. In my Outlook, I pick three email messages containing xlsx attachments, none of which is read-only or locked for editing btw.</p>
<p>3. I double-click each of the three attachments allowing a few seconds in between for the file to open. Each of the files opens in my existing Excel instance.
</p>
<p>4. I close the three files in Excel and repeat step 3 two to three times, just to be sure this behavior is consistent.</p>
<p>5. I then single-click the attachments so that I get a preview of the file in Outlook's reading pane before double-clicking the attachment again. This time, nothing opens in my 1st Excel instance, instead, a second instance is open with the first file and
 all three files open in that 2nd instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>J.</p>

<p>Hi J,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback.<br />
<br />
First we would suggest you update your Office to the latest version: File&gt; Account&gt; Update Options&gt; Update Now.<br />
<br />
I have done the test as you mentioned, following are the result:<br />
(Three emails contain newly-created xlsx files attached and the files are not protected or set to read-only.)<br />
1. Have one instance running first&gt; double click three xlsx files without previewing&gt; When I double click first attachment, there is still one instance, when I double click the second attachment, there are two instances&gt; Finally I get three instances.<br />
2. Double click three attachments directly&gt; I get three instances.<br />
3. Single click the attachments to revert in preview mode&gt; Double click the attachments&gt; I get three instances.<br />
Note: When I open the attachments, they are convert to protected view automatically.<br />

<p>
</p><p>We can’t confirm the rules that makes Excel open one instance or another instance.</p>
<p>We need some time to do some investigations and if there is any update, we will reply to you as soon as possible.<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Gloria<br />

<p>
</p><p>Now you can see the last sheet Tab (weekly Report) where I link the daily data from the daily sheet. So lets say in June Weekend dates will be different from July but the report should be created based on the Week Days(WED-WED).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Second Question:-</span></strong></p>
<p>If you see the PTW register Tab you can see in the Column "F to I" where all the details are written in front of each Name. So if i write any name in the next row then other columns should be automatically filled with all the details that already mentioned
 in any of the previous row from "F to I".</p>

<p>What do you mean weekend days will be different in June and July? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean the reports should be from Wed to Tues (inclusive)?&nbsp; (don't want to double report Wed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint: make the input date on the Weekly report larger. And making it a drop down that only offers Wednesdays would be easier?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the "for changing date" field for? It doesn't seem to be connected. </p>
<p>What is the purpose of the May-19 on the same line?</p>
<p>What is point of having 5 week categories on the same page</p>
<p>The dates in the titles don't seem to relate to anything (is that something you want to auto update?)</p>
<p>Is it important to show the whole month of data on the sheet at the same time, or would it be acceptable to allow the user to pick the week of data they want to see? (from a "slicer")
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint: You might want to format the date field to display the day of week, if Wed-Tues is important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that weekly report is a good candidate for a pivot table. Unfortunately one of the things we can recreate are all the cool colored headings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the S.No column on each daily input. They appear to be repeated daily, they are definitely not unique to a specific vendor or permit.&nbsp; Frankly, it appears to be a carry over from paper days, where the fixed line number on the daily page was used
 as a quick reference.&nbsp; Is it still used in any way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we can recreate all of the functionality you need in pivot tables, and then maybe I can convince you that in the long run it is easier to work with I can see the book being restructured somewhat.&nbsp; The thing about PivotTables is that they hugely automate
 generating results.&nbsp; Rather than worrying about getting row/columns identified correctly and figuring out how to nest various functions, you can click and drag in a PivotTable to the same results. Effectively hiding the complexity. So that once you figure
 out how to get the right results for Monthly "Cold New &amp; Renew" columns, it is trivially easy to create results for the other 3 subcategories ... And so on.&nbsp; The beauty of using PivotTables, and their related features (like powerquery) creating new reports
 or variations on existing reports is VERY easy.&nbsp; As one expert said, using PivotTables he was able to create new reports as fast as the user could describe them, and then make on the spot modifications to meet further changes the user thought of.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
 are interested in pursuing the change to pivot tables I've included a link to a bunch of information and video examples that you can look through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All data input would be on a single "input" sheet.&nbsp; If daily "sheets" have a functional need, as opposed to a "perceived" need left over from paper days, then we should be able to recreate that display on single sheet with a user selection for the specific
 day to look at. So that would eliminate 30 daily tabs ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Re your "Second Question"</p>
<p>What is the function of the PTW Register?&nbsp; ie starting with what does PTW stand for?</p>
<p>Rather than "writing" names into the PTW Register, wouldn't it be better to pick them from a drop down list, to avoid spelling errors?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to use the "entered name" as the key to a lookup for the other columns "F - I" (or is that "G-i"?), so where do these other values come from.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now this example is rather overwhelming in its complexity. Rather than trying to understand all of the in's and out's of your business could we start simple and build up from there. To use a metaphor, rather than trying to swallow the elephant whole
 (like a python) can we break it down into bite sized pieces and work our way from the trunk to the tail ... &lt;g&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we simplify it, by removing some of the many repeating elements.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>to give a valid date range, pick 2 full weeks plus a day before and after that 2 week range.&nbsp;

</span><span>Like any Office tool, Excel has a lot of "hidden" features.&nbsp; I've been learning some of them. One of the really good parts of these features is the automation that is built in to them. Some of these features have been around since 2007,
 but they have been rarely talked about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to provide links to free webinars, videos and articles talk about these features:</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">PowerQuery &gt; PowerPivot &gt; Tables &gt; PivotTables &gt; PivotCharts &gt; Dashboards ...</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span>At the very end of the wiki there are links to free download PDF ebooks about these features.
</span><span><br />
<strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><strong><span>PowerQuery (Get&amp;Transform) </span></strong><span>is used to import data from more than 80 different data sources inside and outside of Excel. Then it allows you to "clean" and format the data. PowerQuery
 records your changes so you can import new data later and it will automagically apply the same manipulations<br />
<strong><br />
PowerPivot / Data Modelling </strong></span><span><br />
Power Pivot is a data modeling technology that lets you create data models, establish relationships, and create calculations. With Power Pivot you can work with large data sets, build extensive relationships, and create complex (or simple) calculations, all
 in a high-performance environment, and all within the familiar experience of Excel. In a nutshell, it allows you to use multiple data sources. Then you could import, merge and perform analysis on the resulting data.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Excel can “natively” only store 1 million rows of data. Well before you hit the 1 million row limit, Excel will start performing very poorly, particularly if you have lots of VLOOKUPs etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Power Pivot&nbsp;compresses the source data and stores it as a database within the Excel workbook. &nbsp;This &nbsp;means that you can store 10s (even 100s) of millions of rows of data directly in an Excel workbook in a highly compressed and performing way. You can
 distribute the result to other people without them needing to have access to the original source data.
</span><span><br />
</span><strong><span><br />
<br />
Table </span></strong><span>takes the data imported by PowerQuery then applies simple formatting and allows you to do some simple calculations on the data. The table data is then passed to Pivot Table<br />
<strong><br />
PivotTable</strong> does more complext automated calculations. The options are simply amazing.&nbsp;
<br />
<strong><br />
PivotChart</strong>s can be generated from PivotTables to provide a dynamic graphical interpretation of the PrivotTable generated data<br />
<strong><br />
Dashboards</strong> are simply collections of PivotTables and PivotCharts that provide the user with dynamic control of much data in a single compact display. Multiple PivotTables and their associated PivotCharts may optionally be connected to the same Slicers
 so all show date specific to the same filter criteria.<br />

            I assume that you always wants to generate the "latest" weekly report based on the input of date on "Date" tab.
<br />
<br />I can think of a simple way of doing that.
<br />
<br />The idea is this: by combining the "Year" and "Month" element from the date in "Dates" tab AND the sheets name, you basically have a date for each sheet. This can be easily accomplished in Power Query.
<br />
<br />So what you can do is you open up another Excel, and go to Data-From Excel and points to this database. Here you can use the above method to combine everything together, and basically have a date column for all the data.
<br />
<br />Then, you can work some Excel magic using Weekday() to calculate the desired Weekly dates and use this date to read from the returned table from Power QUery.
<br />
<br />Does this help?

    <title>Mail Merge in Word - Invalid Certificate Warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge in Word - Invalid Certificate Warning</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded to Office 365 and Windows 10, I've been having issues with using Word and Outlook for mail merges. I have a valid digital certificate, installed, and working perfectly fine when I send email directly from Outlook. But every time I use
 the mail merge function, when I click on "send email messages", I get a warning titled "Invalid Certificate" that states "Microsoft Outlook cannot sign or encrypt this message because you have no certificates which can be used to send from your email address".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only options are to change the security settings, and only then, I can only send emails if I completely remove the digital signature by unchecking the "Add digital signature to this message" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why this would work like this. My old setup worked seamlessly. I cannot describe how frustrating this is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your helpful information. According to it I tested it on my side with the same version but failed to reproduce this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, Outlook are able to auto-detect certificates imported into it and support sending digital signed messages. In your situation, issue could be related with specific desktop client, if possible and
 convenient, please import your certificate onto another PC desktop client to see if issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes issue can be related with Outlook profile corrupt. On your PC, create a new Outlook profile via Control Panel-&gt;User Accounts-&gt;Mail-&gt;Show profiles…-&gt;<strong>Add</strong>, add new test profile and
 configure only your current account (please do not delete the old profile for preventing data loss), then let Outlook launch with this profile, re-import your certificate (Outlook-&gt;File-&gt;Options-&gt;Trust Center-&gt;Trust Center settings-&gt;Email Security-&gt;click
<strong>Import/Export</strong>) and see if issue exists in new profile. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like you have selected an option to enable use of On-Screen Keyboard, hence starting On-Screen keyboard each time you sign in to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you follow the steps below to disable it and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></li><li>Type <strong>control</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Ease of Access Center</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Use the computer without a mouse or keyboard</strong></li><li><strong>Uncheck</strong> the box which says <strong>Use On-Screen Keyboard</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Ok</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the device and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps, do get back to us if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>
