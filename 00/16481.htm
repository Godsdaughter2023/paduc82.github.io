<h2>            Office 365 Outlook 2016 fails to connect with charter.net out-going email server after working for years.</h2>
                    <p>I have been using both Hotmail and Charter.net email accounts with no issues for several years with Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Just within the past 2-3 weeks, I can no longer send messages when on the charter.net account inside Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I can receive email from
 charter.net just fine, and can still receive/send emails with the Hotmail account.&nbsp; I made no changes to any email settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Charter several times to resolve the outgoing server failure.&nbsp; If I use the Charter email program on the official Charter website, I can send and receive emails.&nbsp; The reps all said there is an issue with the Outlook email program that has changed
 and will not connect with the Charter server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the Outlook auto-repair feature with no success.&nbsp; I have manually set the IMAP/STMP codes, set the incoming and outgoing ports as recommended.&nbsp; No change =- receiving emails from the Charter server but nothing will send.&nbsp; An error message says
 I must be logged on to the email server before sending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did something change with the last Win10 update?&nbsp; Any suggestions??</p>

<h2>            Stop SOME emails going to clutter</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quite like Clutter in principle, but is there a way to allow <strong>some specific</strong>&nbsp;emails through which Outlook think are clutter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For eg, I didn't read a regional daily newsletter for a week or so on hols and now it always goes to clutter. I tried clicking the little brush icon next to one of the emails on the browser app, sending it back to Inbox, assuming it would remember that next
 time like junk mail. It doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only advice I can find is how to turn clutter off completely, which I don't want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> ar8888  say:</h3>
<h2>            Captcha on Sign In Does Not Work</h2>
                    <p>On the community support site and live.com, I try to sign in to my actual account (different from this one). I know my email and password, but it always says that I've tried to sign in too many times (even if it is the first attempt in months), so it gives
 me a Captcha to fill out. It never accepts what I put in the Captcha field. It's been months since I was able to log in to my live account through a browser. How am I posting this question on an account? This isn't my real account. It's one I made up so I
 could contact the community. I already tried the Trouble Logging In links. Still wants a Captcha. Still won't accept what I put in. Just let's me reset my password, but still won't let me log in without putting in a Captcha after the password change. And it
 still won't accept my answer. Today I tried an audio Captcha, also didn't accept it. This is ridiculous. If the MS employee read this whole message and understands what the problem actually is, say Milk in your message. Don't tell me to click the trouble accessing
 your account links, as I've already stated, they do nothing to help me or to fix the problem. Then get rid of your freaking Captcha software because it is locking me out of my real account in browsers. It's not me, it's you.</p>

            <p>Hi Zubair Murtaza,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since your phone does not turn on anymore, I would suggest to either replace your battery or contact your mobile operator to get the phone replaced as it is either a battery or phone issue. And without being able to start the phone there is not much troubleshooting
 we can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Set my CountIf formula range to include all rows in sheet</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Looks like easy but I could not find out how to do it...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a sheet with 1000 rows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to set the formula &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=COUNTIF(B12:B1000,"&gt;' '") &nbsp;in Cell &nbsp;B11</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What happens is that Excel is changing the Range of the formula by itself &nbsp;so I found it to be &nbsp;=COUNTIF(B11:B503,"&gt;' '")....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not idea why.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I set the formula to COUNTIF to use a permanent range - (B12:B1000) &nbsp; &nbsp; or even better - &nbsp;(B12:B last used row) &nbsp;ignoring if I insert or delete rows ?</div>

<p>=COUNTA(Indirect("C3:C3000"))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the formula counts any non-empty cells.&nbsp; If you have a formula ="" and that is what you mean as NULL&nbsp; or you did a copy and paste special values on a cell with such a formula, then it will fail for those cells - they will be counted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean NULL and blank as being equivalent to empty (the cell contains nothing) then the above will work.&nbsp; The range will never change if you add or delete rows.&nbsp; Adjust the 3000 to cover at least as many cells as you will ever use.

<p>OK we have a fix. After MS worked on my PC for 4 hrs they got it fixed. Go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Microsoft Security Essentials\Support and delete MSSEOOBE.etl and reboot. After reboot this file should be recreated and the error should be gone. I have
 found that when you delete MSE this folder remains and the files get updated when you run MSE. It looks like the one file was not updating properly and causing the failure. After it was working I did another test. I deleted MSE and also all the files in the
 Support directory. I then reinstalled MSE and everything is still fine. If you look at the error under Detail it will point to this file.</p>

<h3> lemonline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E7 won&#180;t start</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, something weird happened to my E7-00</p>
<p>Short story: it wont start, unless it is in "offline" mode, just keeps rebooting. If I turn it on offline, and then change it to the general (online) mode, it reboots, and keeps rebooting forever (or hangs at the nokia logo)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long story; my SIM Card was very old, and I decided to change it for a new one. The company gave me one, much newer, smaller chip (it fits good now), but at the time they should change my line to the new sim, there was a problem with their system... So I
 speeded the last week waiting to the updated &nbsp;(without SMS, internet, caller id, voice mail..., just calls, like a cave men) also I was waiting for an upgrade of my monthly fee... Today (16) it would be enabled... So this afternoon I saw that something pops
 up in the screen, It said.. "new sim something... bla bla.. Restart" It restarted itself (I was very happy, thinking that afterwards I would have a normal service, with my new sim and new fee) but, I didn't´t turn on never again... The battery was about 50%
 charged, I tried a looot of things, hard reset, plug it to the charger, buttons combinations.</p>
<p>The only way I found to get it to start, is by plugin the USB cord to the computer. There it starts, but only in offline mode. I also made a backup of my stuff now, and even reinstalled belle trough nokia suite, so it is like new.. but when I put in online
 mode, it restarts and doesn't work any more.</p>
<p>Sorry about my English, it´s very rusty and I´m also very angry&nbsp;:thumbdown:</p>

<p>Puzzled here as E7 uses miniSIM which has been around for years NOT later microSIM, so wonder whether your old one damaged SIM card holder which is why SIM not recognised and device remains "Offline"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If E7 network unlocked any SIM should restore device to "Online" mode.</p>

<p>thank you both for your quick reply.</p>
<p>the phone now starts only when connected to usb, with or without sim, doesn´t matter wich sim is in it (tryed a few)</p>
<p>without is much faster because it does not try to go online. With a sim on it I must restart it a few times before it sets to offline mode and boots 100%, otherwise it gets stuck at nokia logo after people holds hands and restart (I guess thats where it
 seeks for network)</p>
<p>My new sim is a mini sim like the older, but the golden contact part its smaller.</p>

<p>There is nothing that a user can do here .. Anyways, servicing of Hardware is forbidden to discuss on this Forum as per the guidelines. If there are really no Nokia Care in your region, you may ask the retailer from where you bought the phone or check with
 some local Mobile repair shops ...</p>

<p>I would probably have wanted device firmware to be completely re-flashed so that it was in "Out of box" state to exclude any possible software issues at which point hardware may be implicated; unfortunately re-installing via Nokia Suite is not quite the
 same process as would be followed at Nokia Care facility if available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am loathe to suggest carrying out a "hard reset" as although telephony might be restored it may cause issues with Nokia Store and possibly Nokia Maps, as all data erased from both C:\ and E:\ by this destructive process.</p>

<h2>            Block all incoming contact requests</h2>
                    I was in a Skype conversion when a whole bunch of Russian&nbsp;spam bots joined and started spamming bitcoin scam advertisements. I left the conversation and now all legitimate conversation participants are getting spammed with contact requests from fake spam
 bot accounts. So far I have blocked almost 100 fake accounts (no sarcasm) and I wish there was a way I could just auto block all incoming contact requests or any other method to stop them from contacting me. i.e change account name. I have changed my Skype
 Username but they still manage to find and contact me.

 to page 1? Thanks.

            You can get the number to the left = View &gt;&gt; Handout master &gt;&gt; Left align the number (&lt;#&gt;) and move the placeholder (basically sway the number and Footer placeholders)<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge theres no simple way to reset the number but you could try. Hiding all the slides you do NOT want in the set of handouts and in the print dialog "Print all slides" UNTICK print hidden slides. Print and then repeat with the slides
 in the second section and so on. I haven't tested this but it should work.<br />

            In theory you can't "convert" an app from one OS to another. But, you are lucky that Microsoft and Apple have been so closely related in the past. MACs have applications called "emulators" that create a "windows-like" environment on the MAC where you can
 install Windows apps, like your edition of Office. <br />
<br />
Parallels is the name of one that I know of, but there are more. Google is your friend, it will help you find others and advice on the 'best" one to use.<br />

<h2>            Mail rules stopped working in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>My mail rules suddenly stopped working&nbsp;on December 17th 2018.&nbsp; When I try </p>
<p>to run rules I get message "The operation failed because of a registry or installation problem.</p>
<p>Restart Outlook and try again.&nbsp; If the problem persists, reinstall."&nbsp; Coincidentally there was an
</p>
<p>update KB4470640 on that date so I uninstalled and rebooted my computer but am still getting
</p>
<p>the same message.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is a fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rely heavily on "rules" to keep my inbox organized&nbsp;due to large volume of messages.&nbsp; Any help
</p>
<p>would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>hi clare,</p>
<p>windows live groups will no longer be available in onedrive after october 16, 2015. all files in groups folders also will no longer be accessible after that time. more information can be found in the article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/move-files-from-a-group-to-your-own-onedrive-0c35298e-14e6-4d27-a38f-b72dbf151678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
move files from a group to your own onedrive</a>.</p>
<p>in addition, considering it is an onedrive related question, i would suggest you post a new thread in our dedicated

<h2>            Cannot locate Outlook 2003 Contacts &#40;Address book&#41; on HDD removed from defunct PC and now serving as an external drive to a new Windows 7 machine.</h2>
                    <p>PC broke but salvaged the HDD which now serves as an external drive to my new PC. All my document sand web favourites are safe and accessible on the external drive but there is&nbsp;no sign of my e-mail contacts nor address book.</p>
<p>Outlook 2003 is working well on the new PC under Windows 7, whereas the external drive was from my scrapped PC using Vista. Have you any suggestions&nbsp;that I could attempt to try and salvage my precious contacts (address book) from my external drive or is
 it as I suspect already consigned to cyber history?? Help please.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ida,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Generally, the deleted files in the OneDrive for Business library will go to the Recycle bin and you can permanently delete them in the Second stage recycle bin. So about “</span><span>How to delete files from one drive?</span>”, do you encounter some
 issues in your environment? If yes, I’d like you to provide more detailed information about the symptoms of the issue you are experiencing for troubleshooting.</p>
<p><span>For your reference:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restore deleted files or folders in OneDrive</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, I’d like to confirm whether you are using the personal OneDrive online place (<a href="http://www.onedrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.onedrive.com</a>) or the OneDrive for Business library.</span></p>

            Hi Sergio,<br />
<br />
<br />
When you use application on your device and close them using the "x" button on the right top, it actually minimizes your application.<br />
This will keep memory occupied on your device. by sliding your finger from the bottom of your screen to the top it will bring up your task manager on your omnia. This will allow you to physically close these applications and free up memory on your device to
 run your other applications.

<h2>            Office 97 to Office 2010 starter</h2>
                    I own MS Office 97 standard edition and have my disk. I purchased a new HP computer with Office 2010 starter already installed. I want to load my Office 97 onto the HP, but not allowed to because the original was on a windows 98SE system and&nbsp;my disk is&nbsp;an
 upgrade from my original windows 95 which was upgraded to windows 98SE. Can I copy the entire&nbsp;application from my old machine to the new HP? Or do I have to purchase the entire 2010 product. I kind-a-like the 97 version.

            If the 97 is an upgrade, you must have a qualifying version (previous Office, such as 95). If you don't, you must purchase a newer version of Office.

<p>Both accounts are usually managed via TB, but also access via https://XXXXXX.mail.live.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-- I'll retrieve emails (via TB email client) and delete most, then when TB checks again a few minutes later, it will download duplicates of the same set of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-- Also, when via live.com (via FF browser), the older will reload to the inbox page while I am trying to do something else. This happens after several seconds -- enough time to get started on something else -- THEN RELOAD.&nbsp; The page also acts like It is
 continually retrying to load something.</p>

            I did. For whatever reason the certificates on the machine were missing. These are installed automatically by Microsoft either through the OS installation media or Windows update. To fix it, I had to go into the certificates section of IE on a working
 computer and export the certificates and then import them into the computer that wasn't working. Problem solved. This happened on 3 or 4 computers in my office.&nbsp;

<br />
Your answer is in your question. Home and Student does NOT include Outlook. You need to get at least Home and Business to have Outlook.&nbsp; A Home and student key will NOT activate Outlook.<br />
<br />
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010<br />
<br />
<br />
No problem. You can get an "anytime upgrade" to Home and Business. You just have to pay approximately the list price difference between the 2 bundles.<br />
<br />
<b><span>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What? – Anytime Upgrade</span></b>
<p><i>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</i></p>
<p><span>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</span></p>
<p><span>Pros and Cons:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.

<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is another similar story:</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I went to Office Anytime Upgrade under Start Menu <span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.</p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</span></p>
<p><span>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for roughly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that
 you'll have to manage 2 separate Office installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently
 spell checking dictionaries are maintained separately and a few other things.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</span></p>
<p><span>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else
 is NOT an option.</span></p>
<p><span>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly
 realize that for most people the PKC is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</span></p>

            <p>If your question is</p>
<p>"can a given entry within a distribution list be designated to be &lt;either&gt; "To" or "CC" - the answer is no.</p>
<p>If that's not your question, please be more specific as to what exactly it is that you are trying to accomplish. In a nutshell,&nbsp;a Distribution List (Contact Group in Outlook '2010+) by definition is a "single recipent" which in turn gets "expanded" so that
 all the members of the DL get the same message.</p>
