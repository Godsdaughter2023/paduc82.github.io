<p>I do not see any Combo Boxes in your file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, however, you propose to link your&nbsp;Combo Boxes to specific cells on the protected sheet, prior to protecting the sheet, unlock the linked cells:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the linked cells</li><li>Select <strong>Format cells ...&nbsp;</strong>from the right-click context menu</li><li>Select the <strong>Protection</strong> tab</li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Locked</strong> checkbox</li><li><strong>OK</strong></li><li>Protect the sheet</li></ul>

<p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did it. But I couldn't resolve my problem. You could be able to see it by opening it using excel sheets(don't open in browser). The combo boxes are in the cell A1 in every sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your kind cooperation is highly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            24 Hour Time Format into 12 Hour Format&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have the below date format some of them are in 24 hour format and some of are in 12 hour format with AM/PM after them. Now, i am trying to convert the times having 24 hour format like 15:30:37 PM, 14:00:00 AM etc into 12 hour format like 3:30:37 PM &amp; 2:00:00
 AM and other time values that are already in 12 hour format should remain the same. it should only convert 24 hour time format values into 12 hour time format with AM/PM as usual.</p>
<p>I tried the below formula-&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;=--SUBSTITUTE(TEXT(A1,"0.00"),".",":")</p>
<p>But could not find the desired output.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>15:30:37 PM</p>
<p>03:00:00 PM</p>
<p>03:15:25 AM</p>

<p>Hi Dharmesh,</p>
<p>=IF(TYPE(A1)=1,A1,TIMEVALUE(SUBSTITUTE(LEFT(A1,LEN(A1)-3),".",":")))</p>
<p>And format the cells to time AM/PM.</p>
<p>The Type functions returns 1 for a number and 2 for text. As time is in fact a numeric value, eacht time recognised as such, can be taken over.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, you have a problem with your data quality and it makes you live difficult. Do you really have timestamps like 13.45:27 AM &amp; 17.25:00 PM? With dots instead of ":" ? If the dot is just a typo then you don't need al these substitutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Dharmesh,</p>
<p>As far as I know, 22:00 AM does not exist because it is in 24h format. In 12h format it is 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>AM stands for "Ante Meridiem", "before noo"n and starts at 12:00 AM (this is midnight), 12:00 PM stands for Post Meridiem = noon. So do not make the mistake that AM stands for After Midnight".</p>
<p>So the sequence in this is:</p>
<p>12AM, 1AM, 2AM, .... 12PM(noon), 1PM&nbsp;up to 11PM</p>
<p>Wkr,</p>

<h2>            Show first instance of field value inreport access 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in need of assistance in creating a report. I have built a filter form which allows users to select multiple [Item Numbers] and insert them into a multi select list box which the report will be based on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report is for an inventory location program so there&nbsp;is more than one location per [Item Number]. What i would like to do is have the report open with the first instance of the [item number] with the lowest [bay number] on the top half of the report
 (which would provide the users with the most easily accessible [bay number]). If that is possible, my thoughts were to then use a sub report to show the rest of the [item numbers] with higher [bay numbers] on the lower portion of the page(designating that
 portion of the report as secondary locations). I want the user to be able to see the rest of the [bay numbers] just in case the items are not in there designated bay from the top of the report.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Any and all help is very much appreciated. Thanks aSibley</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Tom. I have built the query with the Min() and it works great until i add additional fields that i also need in the report. Here is the code(a variation of allen brownes code)&nbsp;i am using to create the string that it used for the report.</p>

<h2>            Mail merge by email with PDF attachment using Word 2011 &#40;Mac&#41;</h2>
                    I have been trying for a couple of hours now to mail merge with a PDF attachment from Word 2011 and keep going round in circles.&nbsp;I have only managed to attach as a Word doc, and everything I've read online seems to suggest a mail merge PDF attachment is
 impossible in Word 2011.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know for a fact that I can't do this? What version of Word would allow me to do it? I know it can be done, I just don't know exactly which tools to use! Any help would be much appreciated&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Office 365, Outlook&#58; Folder and subfolders disappeared</h2>
                    I am using the outlook app for Mac. Today noticed a folder and it's subfolders disappeared. I can't seem to find them anywhere. I logged into Office 365 online and the folders are missing there too. They aren't in the deleted or junk folders. When I do
 a search for the emails that were filed in the missing folders, the emails will show up from the search. How do I recover the folders?

<p>Hi ElizabethCIT,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your scenario, you can search the related email in your mailbox, the folder should exist in your mailbox as well, I recommend you try to re-add your account to Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, please also check whether you can find the folder via moving an email. Select an email, click
Home</span> tab, then type the complete name of the destination/specific folder you prefer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, since we have set a dedicated in-app support team for Outlook for Mac, therefore, to help you better, I recommend you contact the in-app team directly for further
 assistance. <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517?tm=1522738128774">

    <title>E72- Can&#39;t delete mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> writern  say:</h3>
<h2>            E72- Can&#39;t delete mailbox</h2>
                    Hello. I have a problem. I configurated&nbsp;the email, but entered a wrong code in imap-settings. I can send but not receive mail.(Custom, not OVI, Yahoo or Exchange). Then I created a new box but it wouldnt work, so I deleted it. Then I tried to delete the
 original box, but no such luck. It is impossible to remove it. I really have no clue about what to do. There is no way I can change the settings inside the box either. Anyone who can bring me out of my misery? :-)

            Well..what can I say. Sorry to have bothered you. I turned the phone off, ready to go to bed. But then changed my mind and turned it on again..Yep. The mailbox then was gone. So even if you delete it, it wont be removed before you turn off the phone and
 turn it on again. Sorry guys. (Lucky me, though)

<p>I am having the same problem. I added a gmail a/c to my E72 using the email services. After that, when I tried to remove the mailbox (by going to Settings-&gt;Options-&gt;Remove Mailbox), there is no error shown but the mailbox is still there. I retried many times
 to remove the mailbox but it never be removed and always stays there. I have also tried to turn off my E72 as per the advice found in this forum, but unfortunately after turning on, the Gmail mailbox is still there in my mail services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is this a bug in the E72 phone? Otherwise, can anybody advice me how to remove the mailbox without restoring the whole phone to factory settings?</p>

<p>When you enter the email menu, first select Options then Connect all.&nbsp; After the message connected appear then go to Settings.&nbsp; Then highlight the email you want to delete, then Options again then Remove mailbox.</p>

<p>Well, I do have a very similar problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I got the phone, I set up my GMail-account like one would set up any other mail account. Likewise, I set up my other mail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later on, I experienced a lot of&nbsp; 'memory full' errors (probably caused by some apps I installed) and decided to (soft) reset my device; the errors disappeared.</p>
<p>I then set up Nokia Messaging, where I configured those accounts again. It worked (and works) like a charm and since I did not feel the need to have them checked twice, I removed the one of the old mailboxes (the non-gmail one). No problem so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I seem to be unable to remove my old GMail mailbox, whether I am connected or not. I just get the dialog 'Remove mailbox?' and then, after confirming, the screen freezes and I have to close mail via the home button or restart the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The majority of systems experiencing this don't have an updated driver available, there was only one specific Atom variant that got a tweaked driver for this problem a build or two back. If you're not on that one platform and have older Intel graphics
 with a WDM 1.0 driver, like my test machines, it looks like we're not going to see a tweak/fix.

            <p>You have to disable the graphics adapter using Device Manager. Reboot when done the system will startup with the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.
</p>
<p>Your systems graphics&nbsp;is outdated you won't see any new drivers for this, so you have to live with the MSBDA or you need to upgrade your graphics controller (if possible!!).</p>

    <title>Word Tracked Changes problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickfawcett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Tracked Changes problem</h2>
                    <p>I raised a question over a year back and no one seemed able to answer it, so I thought I'd try again now. Using Word 2013, I find that once I've changed a word or sentence using tracked changes, Word will not find the word or sentence if I then search for
 it using Find (or Find and Replace). For example, I've just corrected 'It in interesting that' to 'It is interesting that', but when I then search for 'It is interesting that', Word does not find it. Working as an editor, I find this hugely frustrating. Can
 anyone tell me what the problem might be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another equally annoying and baffling problem is that using Find and Replace, Word refuses to find any word in the first line of a new page. For instance, if I search for 'and', it will be found time and again on a page, but when it appears in the first
 line of the next page, it simply isn't highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems extraordinary to me that Microsoft can put out a program with these apparent bugs, but despite numerous updates to both Office and my graphics card, nothing seems to make a scrap of difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help with either of these problems, I'd be hugely grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick</p>

            <p>For the first issue, the problem is that, until you accept the change, the text contains both the original word (marked as a deletion) and the replacement (marked as an insertion). You can see that if you go to the Review tab and set the Show Markup &gt; Balloons
 selection to Show All Revisions Inline. So while Word won't find "It is interesting" after the correction, it will find "It in is interesting". After you accept that change, then you'll be able to find "It is interesting".</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second issue, I do see that the Find and Replace doesn't highlight the found item on the first line of the next page. However, it does find (and replace, if that's what you're doing) that instance. If you click in the text outside the dialog box,
 the highlighting will appear. I think this has to do with the fact that moving the selection to that instance causes the screen to scroll, placing the the selection at the top of the window. It's a bug, but only a cosmetic one, and I know that Microsoft is
 reluctant to spend resources to fix things that don't cause data loss.</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back so quickly on this, Jay - appreciated. Your answer helps to explain things, but doesn't actually help me with the problem. In my editing I always have to leave tracked changes in, for the publisher's records, so if I need to go back
 and find a change, or check for consistency all instances of a word I've corrected somewhere, then I'm stuck. Likewise, while the missing word at the top of a page doesn't matter too much if I'm doing a Find and Replace, it matters
<em>very </em>much if I'm doing a search for all instances of term. The flaw may be cosmetic to Microsoft, but it's definitely not cosmetic to me. I'm shocked it they really are content to leave in a bug of this nature; I'm quite sure they could well afford
 to fix it. Even more puzzling is that Word 2002 never exhibited any of these problems, so in many ways 2013 is a regression. Disappointing, to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time to reply and for clarifying things. I'm very grateful.</p>

            <p>This is a change from previous versions of Word. Before, when we viewed a document in Final view (tracked changes not showing), we could search for corrected text. Now we can't, apparently. I agree with the original poster that this is a huge hassle for
 editors and others who have to retain tracked changes throughout the document development process. We'd essentially have to "Accept all changes" in a document to do the spell check or search, then note anomalies on paper, undo the "Accept all changes" action,
 and apply the edits. Evidently another case of someone fixing what wasn't broken.</p>

            Exactly right, Scott. Much in Word 2013 is excellent, but blips like this undo much of that good and in some ways actually make the program less effective than it was ten years ago. I cannot understand why Microsoft have allowed such a glaring problem
 to slip through the net, still less why nothing seems to have been done to address it.

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>In my version of 2013, you <em>can </em>search for and find corrected text in Final (i.e., "No Markup") view. The catch is that you have to refresh the search. Consider this scenario: With markup showing, I have the phrase "It
<del>in</del> <strong>is</strong> interesting" visible. A search for "it is interesting" shows "No matches." Then I switch to "No Markup"; the final text ("It is interesting") is plainly visible on screen, but the search window still shows "No matches."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the catch: When I switched from "All markup" to "No markup," I think the search paused; it certainly does (and says so) when switching from Final to All Markup. To find the final, corrected text, I just had to click in the search window to put the
 focus there. Then I hit ENTER to refresh the search. Word now finds the term without hesitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

            I tried it again this morning in a different document, and it found the "final" text in both Simple Markup and No Markup view, and it worked. Did an update get pushed out overnight? It wasn't behaving like that yesterday for a couple of us.

            <p>I spoke with the other editor who was having the problem yesterday. I was able to reproduce the problem in a different document. However, today, when we both tried to search again, it worked. Our versions of 2013 are installed on our machines, so it's not
 a cloud issue (at least I don't think it is or was); so it's weird that our independent installations would have the same problem one day, then not have it the next. Our IT department confirmed no updates were pushed through last night either, so it's not
 an update correction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got another note from her: she says searching for the corrected phrase is working in All Markup as well! It didn't work for me in that view this morning. What's the glitch?</p>

            <p>Hi Scott and Philip</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting no change, whether working in All Markup, Simple Markup or No Markup. For instance, I've changed 'A newspaper reported lately' to&nbsp;'A newspaper reported recently'. If I now search for 'reported recently', Find will not locate this nor is the text
 visible anywhere on the screen. It will, however, find 'reported' on its own, 'lately' on its own, and 'reported lately recently' - none of which I want to find. If, during the course of an edit, I suddenly have second thoughts about a change, and try to search
 for it (as here), Find simply will not pick up the new text, whereas Word 2002 would always pick up revised text without any problem. It's a mystery to me.</p>

            <p>I tried again this morning in two different documents. In the first document I tried, I hadn't searched it previously, it didn't work. I opened the document in which it worked yesterday, and it did work. I went back to the first document, and it worked.
 I went back to the document I worked on yesterday, and it didn't work, but then it worked later. Absolutely no reliable consistency. And yes, I am resetting the search every time by clicking in the document and placing the cursor near the top.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I think I've found the issue. I just tried it again in the two documents above. Evidently, if you have the "Find" tab highlighted in the Find and Replace (F&amp;R) window, it will find the corrected text in both Simple and No Markup modes. However, if you have
 the "Replace" tab highlighted and click "Find Next," it will NOT find the corrected text. I don't understand why this feature should be different from one tab to the next. The problem, then, is if you're looking for something to replace and you have to switch
 to the Replace tab to do that, as soon as you click the "Replace" button, it jumps to the next occurrence. If finding the corrected text isn't working when the "Replace" tab is highlighted, then I'm assuming it would skip over the next occurrence that has
 a tracked deletion in it. As such, you'd have to stop the F&amp;R mode, manually make the change in the document, then resume the F&amp;R mode. That qualifies as a time waster (and downgrade) in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole issue seems so finicky, though, so if others aren't able to reproduce it on their machines, there may be a bigger issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if you use the simple "Find" in the Navigation sidebar, it won't find and list the occurrences of corrected text in any mode.</p>

                    Whenever I open Microsoft Outlook 2016 it immediately shows that it is "sending message 2 of 5 or 1 of 4" even though there is nothing in my outbox. I eventually get a message that&nbsp;the operation has timed put. If I subsequently send an email it eventually
 goes out, but only after a delay of at least&nbsp; few minutes.

            <p>Expanding on Doug's suggestion, you can wrap a Content Control around the table in two different ways. Both allow you to stop edits and deletions of the content UNLESS the user is clever enough to work out how to remove the content control (eg. downsaves
 the the document to doc format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1. Select the table and go to the Developer Tab's Controls group and click the coloured Aa button (Rich Text Content Control). Now, click the Properties button and set the "Content control cannot be deleted" and 'Contents cannot be edited" attributes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2. Select the table and&nbsp;go to the Developer Tab's Controls group and click the Group dropdown &nbsp;and choose Group. This locks the content without a visible Content Control although it appears to be a type of Content Control anyway.</p>

<h2>            Reconnect Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com for uninterrupted email access - deletes all Outlook Rules and Favorites</h2>
                    <p>I recently received a second notice informing me that I needed to delete any Hotmail accounts I had setup in Outlook 2016 and reconnect them in order to continue to get my Hotmail mail in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; The heading of the email from Microsoft was this -
 "Reconnect Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com for uninterrupted email access"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process was simple enough and worked fine.&nbsp; What was frustrating to me was that "reconnecting" my Hotmail accounts to Outlook 2016 deleted all of the "favorites" I had setup in Outlook.&nbsp; These are the most used folders that I have setup in the left hand
 pane of the Outlook windows.&nbsp; After reconnecting my Hotmail accounts all of my Favorites were deleted and I had to set them up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was even more frustrating was that when I did this reconnect, all of my Outlook Rules were also deleted.&nbsp; No where in the "reconnect" instructions did it say that my favorites and rules would be deleted.&nbsp; I don't understand why these are even impacted
 by the fact that I simply reconnected a Hotmail account to Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that people should be notified in advance that reconnecting a Hotmail account to Outlook 2016 will delete your favorites and any rules that you have setup.&nbsp; And the reconnect instructions should give additional instructions on how these favorites
 and rules can be backed up and preserved.&nbsp; I have spent a lot of time setting up rules to sort and filter my incoming mail from the 12 email accounts that I have coming into Outlook and to just have all of these rules deleted without notice while trying to
 perform a "required" Hotmail reconnect is extremely irritating.</p>

<h3> philipepling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy record and its sub-records into a new record and new sub-records</h2>
                    <p>I have a database that has the following tables:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Illustrations] - Primary records are stored here. [ID] is the primary key.</p>
<p>[Assumptions] - Each record in [Illustrations] could have 0 to 15 associated records here. [ID] is the primary key. Linked to Illustrations.[ID].</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my [Main Menu] form, I have a IllustrationList that shows me the [Illustrations] records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to have a button that does the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no item is selected in IllustrationList, do nothing.</p>
<p>Otherwise:</p>
<p>1. Prompt for a new [Illustration Number] (not the [ID], this is a text field in the [Illustrations] table that identifies&nbsp;versioning. If the&nbsp;record selected in the IllustrationList&nbsp;contains&nbsp;"1" in the [Illustration Number] field, then the new record created
 by this code will likely wind up being "2", but could also have something else entered so I don't want to automatically increment this).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create a clone of the selected item on the IllustrationList in the [Illustrations] table. The only field that is not an exact copy is the [Illustration Number], which should use the value entered at the prompt in step 1.</p>
<p>3. Create a clone of each [Assumptions] record linked to the Illustration selected in IllustrationList, and associate these new records with the newly created record in [Illustrations].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got steps 1 and 2 working, but am having trouble figuring how to get step 3 to work since I don't have anything to tell the append query which Illustration.[ID] to link the new records in the [Assumptions] table to (I only have the original Illustrations.[ID]
 which is being pulled from the IllustrationList). </p>

            You'll find an example in CopyTree.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file copies the current record and all referencing rows in two other tables by calling a CopyTree function.&nbsp; In the function the primary key of the new row&nbsp; in the referenced&nbsp; table (Countries) is computed with:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get next CountryID value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngNewCountryID = DMax("CountryID", "Countries") + 1<br />
<br />
so, to insert a value manually you would need to replace this code with code which gets the new value manually.&nbsp; This could be from an unbound control in the form from which function is called, or by calling the InputBox function for instance.&nbsp; If doing this
 the value should of course be validated before executing the SQL statements, by code which confirms that it is not duplicating an existing value in the table.<br />
<br />
The example used in the demo is an absurd one of course, and deliberately so to reflect the fact that a more realistic scenario would not be where the whole tree structured hierarchy is copied, but where the relationship type between the referenced&nbsp; table and
 the table referencing it is a many-to-many relationship type, in which case it would be the relationship as represented by a row in the table which models the relationship type which is copied, i.e. the model would not be a tree but a 'convergent graph' in
 which there can be more than one path between two nodes.<br />

            I wound up getting an append query to work using a dlookup function to find the relevant ID using a unique copied field and the entered Illustration Number. I will take a peek at the demo file to see if I can simplify my code using it instead.

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main purpose of this database is to produce a report. Each record in Illustrations represents an exact set of variables that will slightly modify the report. Each copied record will be nearly identical to the record it copied but usually with 1 or 2
 items on either the main record or a sub record in Assumptions changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The copy process is intended to be&nbsp;used to avoid having to make a salesperson completely recreate the data for the subsequent illustration while still maintaining the prior versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea is that if a client requests a modification to Illustration #1, the salesperson can open the database, copy Illustration #1, update the 1 or 2 fields that need to be modified, and then produce the report based on the new record. For auditing purposes,
 changes are not permitted to be made to any record once the report is run, otherwise I'd just have them update the initial record as needed.</p>

            Ok, let me ask this. Is it always the same one or two fields that must be updated, or could it be any of the fields? The best way to do this depends on that answer.
<br />
<br />One other point that needs answering. You say that the IllustrationID is your PK, But the Illustration Number is a entered value and may not be unique. You also say the only difference is the Illustration Number. But how can that be, since your PK needs to be unique! Is the PK an Autonumber?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>It's any of the fields. </p>
<p>
</p><p>ID is an autonumber, to uniquely track each entry in Illustrations.</p>
<p>I have a "client name" text field and the "illustration #" field to track the sequence of illustrations for a specific client.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I would have built out Client as its own table and attached the Illustrations to it, but since these is for salespeople who want to control exactly what appears, including variations on the name on different illustrations, and who don't want to
 click more than 2 buttons to get a report out and thus would&nbsp;not want to have to deal with adding a client before they added an illustration,&nbsp;I dropped a level in the DB design and just put it as a text entry field.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wound up using client name and illustration # in my DLookUp to get my Append query to know which Illustration ID to use for the Assumption additions.</p>

            You seem to have taken the right path. That's basically what I was going to recommend. Use a Dmax (instead of Dlookup) to get the PK of the new Illustration record, Then run an Append query filling in the new PK as your FK.

<p>Hi TIA,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I want to share with you that in Office 365 Microsoft Teams there is no automatic members feature when you create a team.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, you can try to create a <strong>Private team</strong> and then invite the users with
username@contoso.com to become the private team’s members, and other users with
username1@sub1.contoso.com and username2@sub2.cotoso.com don’t have permissions to join in the private team as members if the private team’s owners don’t approve them, thanks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the related information about Private teams, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/make-a-public-team-private-in-teams-6f324fbc-6599-4612-8daa-ff5d35a746bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other concerns, please feel free to let me know, thanks.</p>

    <title>Command Button does not work when opened on network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmw85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Command Button does not work when opened on network</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a Word 2010&nbsp;template&nbsp;with a&nbsp;Command Button that is having the&nbsp;document Save, Print and Email with one click. I have the file saved as a .dotm. The file is located on our website so users can access the file from either work or home. I dont
 think there is an issue with the Visual Basic code but maybe a setting in word.</p>
<p>The problem lies that when you open up the template from the network you can not click the Command Button. One solution i found was to download the document to the local machine to use but the content of the file is updated regularly and can see a user saving
 a document and using that document and not getting the updated document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated been working on this for a week or so now and google hasnt yielded any results that have worked.</p>

<h2>            Only on channel on E71 audio out</h2>
                    
<p>When I insert a Nokia headset with two earbuds I only get sound out of one side. I also have a Nokia 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter but when I plug in headphones I get sound out of just one side.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; I would expect that I would get sound in both ear
 buds. Is there a setting that I need to change or is there a problem with my phone?</p>

            How many black bands does your adapater have on the plug end?&nbsp; Does it have 2 or 3?&nbsp;&nbsp; If it only has 2 bands then you might need to find an adapter that has 3 bands on it instead.&nbsp; Different parts of the plug match up to different connectors in the phone.

            Both my headset (2.5mm plug) and my adapter have 3 black bands so I think that I have the right plugs.&nbsp; Am I supposed to get sound in both channels??&nbsp; Thanks!

    <title>Recovered PowerPoint 2016 presentation missing huge sections of text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlywiersma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovered PowerPoint 2016 presentation missing huge sections of text in the notes box</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a scare with a PowerPoint 2016 presentation I had worked for 3-4 hours on. PowerPoint 2016 randomly without any warning said it stopped working and closed out. (another matter entirely. I have had this problem numerous times when using PowerPoint on
 the SurfacePro 3 particularly when I use the pen to write on the slides). I tried to search for the presentation in recent unsaved files. It told me it was not there. I then went to options, save, copied the link there to the internet and was able to find
 the most recently saved copy. Unfortunately, the notes I had written for each slide had enormous sections missing. I had expanded the notes box before starting to type because I noticed I would not have enough room for all the text I wanted. What I think happened
 is that the recovered version only preserved the text up to the point of the original size of the notes box and the text I had in all the extra space I gave myself to write in the notes box is gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows of a solution to this problem, that would be excellent as I need to present this on Wednesday. I am very disappointed with the situation and it does not give me a good impression of PowerPoint 2016. While I acknowledge that it was my fault
 for not periodically saving, I had autosave turned on so it was saving every 10 minutes anyway. The lack of recovery of the notes that I spent 3-4 hours writing today is what I am upset with that I had no control over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carly</p>

            <p>Thank you for keeping in touch!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did more research, and people across other discussion boards also only had the issue via WiFi, but it was always the case that the network was blocking access to the marketplace.&nbsp; Since you're on your cellular network's data connection, the only thing
 I can think of is that your provider is either blocking the connection, or that you are not getting a secure connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing we can try is to clear the cache and then do a soft reset.&nbsp; To clear the cache, go to Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet Explorer and tap on Delete History.&nbsp; Once that's done, to do a soft reset, remove the back cover and pull out the battery
 while the phone is powered on.&nbsp; This should be possible on the Lumia 710.&nbsp; Leave the battery out for about 30 seconds, and then put everything back together and turn the phone back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't resolve things, I recommend checking with your cellular service provider to make sure there weren't any changes to the network, or any sort of outage on their end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how we can be of further assistance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t like metro apps on my windows or on my xbox.</h2>
                    <p>I don't like them because for some reason it takes longer for me open up the application and get to what I need to do in that application. Do a test if you have windows 7 and open up calculator in windows 7 and then open up the calculator app in windows
 10. In windows 7 it opens up in a fraction of a second. They did this same nonsense with the Xbox One, Everything you did&nbsp;on Xbox 360 was snappy and then with Xbox One they made dedicated apps and everything slowed down, I'm not very happy about this. What
 is with&nbsp; the Windows icon too? Looks like a downgrade or something with no color or life to it. Just a box.</p>

<p>Apps cannot use hardware acceleration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to the sound blaster audio cards with Vista that no longer processed audio. &nbsp;&nbsp; It's done this way so tablets can have any random hardware can run them without hunting down drivers. &nbsp; So any extra hardware
 you have like a $500 video card or $200 sound card is ignored and the CPU does all the work. &nbsp; I think 8.1 might have fixed this though.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft also added a delay for desktop metro apps due to problems with tablets needing warm up time to launch them.&nbsp;
 Tablets sleep aggressively and everything needs to wake up and initialize so a several second delay was added.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use a registry hack to fix it if you wish.&nbsp;&nbsp; I for one don't want to run slower apps on my expensive hardware just to promote cheapo tablet
 sales so I avoid apps.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Overlapping music background in looped presentation</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">I have set up background music to a short presentation on a loop, but when it comes back to slide 1, the music begins again over the previous track (i.e. I get duplicate music tracks
 out of synch). This happens whether I select play across all slides or use the media options to end the music after 9 slides. What am I doing wrong?</span>
