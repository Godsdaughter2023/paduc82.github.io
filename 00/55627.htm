<h2>            When screen sharing I can no longer see the person with whom I&#39;m conversing.</h2>
                    I do online tutoring and I used to be able to share my screen and chat with my student and see him in a little video that I could move about on my screen.&nbsp;My laptop died and I had to buy a new one, now when I share screen he can hear me but neither of
 us can see each other. I get a lot of cues from being able to see him, I need to be able to see him so what do I do?

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to try checking if your permission to use the Camera and Microphone in the Skype app. To double check this, follow the steps below referring the screenshots:<br />

            Hi Beth
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.40.0.70.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved. 
<br />
<br />I would also make sure you have all the latest updates for Windows 10 installed, click Start . Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Download and install any pending updates.

    <title>Windows 10&#58; File explorer folder list auto-refreshes every few - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhp777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; File explorer folder list auto-refreshes every few seconds</h2>
                    <p>Please note: I have read numerous articles about the desktop and taskbar auto-refreshing, and how in File Explorer the cursor jumps from the bottom file to the top file, and how if you turn off slideshow and color changes this solves these issues. This is
 something entirely different!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is specific to Windows 10, and to the (File) Explorer, especially post-Creator's Update (all versions, including the latest). Sometimes, after I let the PC sleep and then wake it, in any Explorer windows I have open, the folder list pane (on the
 left) starts jumping around and adding or subtracting items every few seconds. For example, under Desktop / This PC, in the folder list on the left (NOT the list of files for a given folder on the right, so it is not that problem that has been reported often
 elsewhere), it lists 3D Objects, Desktop, Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. If I wait a few seconds, the folder list (under "This PC") adds [PC Name] "(AMS Server)" as well as [My user profile folder]. If I wait a few more seconds, both of the latter
 go away. Back and forth and back and forth, expanding and contracting the folder list up and down like an accordion every few seconds. And, if I run Task Manager, Explorer is crunching away at the CPU time constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close all of the Explorer windows and then reopen another, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I kill Explorer from the Task Manager and Restart it, this often fixes the issue. That is, new Explorer windows I open will remain stable without jumping around on the left side (folder list). However, sometimes it will not fix it; that is, even after
 that, sometimes, any new Explorer windows I open start the left-side accordion again. When killing and restarting Explorer doesn't work, I have to reboot the PC, which in most cases solves it. Sometimes not even that solves it, and I reboot a second time,
 and then it finally solves it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened on two different Windows 10 PCs. So I do not believe that this has anything to do with corrupt files and having to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it DOES seem to have something to do with is Sleep mode. Except for rare instances, this problem occurs most often just after I wake the computer from Sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the record, given the many articles out there relating to problems that ALMOST sound like this one, I tried a static desktop background, and I never have had the color-change thing turned on, and none of these fixes helped at all, so these are not
 the answers to this issue...</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Usually, the "<strong><em>File explorer folder list auto-refreshes every few seconds</em></strong>" issue usually occurs if there's a software/driver conflict on your computer. To check if there's a software/driver conflict, we suggest performing a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>. Once your computer is already in safe mode, please observe if the issue will still occur.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC.
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for the update.<br />

<p>I can give that a shot, however it may not help much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have to be able to do my normal work and then put the PC in Sleep mode and then later wake it, and I may have to do this a few times before the problem pops up. So, Safe Mode will have to allow me to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Considering the problem occurs on two different Windows 10 PCs, and one of them only a few months old (and came with the latest version of Windows 10 preinstalled), I really doubt it will be a driver conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) As noted in my original post, the problem also seems to revolve around the AMS Server thing, as that is one of the two items in the folder list that appear and disappear every few seconds when this problem does occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there's something about putting AMS Server to Sleep? (Mind you, I never asked for these PCs to have an AMS Server--whatever that is!)</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. <br />
<br />
AMS (Adobe Flash Media Server)&nbsp; works with the Flash Player runtime to create media driven, multi-user RIAs (Rich Internet Applications). You may try to uninstall this one, then see if the issue will still occur.
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for the result. </p>

<p>
</p><p>From our experience? No. They do not appear to be included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From our work with our Microsoft 365 project and the related agreement it did not include RDS CALs; formerly known as TS CALs. We have/had to separately purchase RDS CALs in addition to the others which were included with M365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, our M365 Agreement included Server CALs, Users CALs and ML CALs (Management Licenses for SCCM and so on) but no RDS CALs. It seems RDS CALs will need to be added as a separate item and will not be included under the M365 umbrella. At least not
 right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk to your Microsoft, Sales VAR or related vendor and ask them the same question explicitly. My guess is that it will need to be added separately as ours had to be. They were not bundled. This seems to be true for now as of Oct 2018. Take that for what
 it's worth.</p>

<h2>            Large volume of my incoming internet traffic routed through One Note - Why&#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
My internet security software (Kaspersky Internet Security 2009) is reporting a large volume of incoming traffic routed through MS One Note.&nbsp; Although we do have this installed as part of our Office 2007 Enterprise edition it is rarely used but is reporting
 around 80MB or more of incoming traffic per day.&nbsp; It is also reporting incoming traffic when none of the Office applications are used on a particular day<br />
<br />
I would expect incoming traffic to be reported through my browser and Kapersky but not something that is so rarely used as One Note.<br />
<br />
What does One Note do to be downloading so much traffic when not even active?&nbsp; Is this something to be concerned about?<br />
<br />
My set up is a PC running on Vista 32bit Home Premium, with MS Office 2007 Enterprise edition

                    Today I was trying to play my Bullet Witch since I haven't play it for a year, but when I try to play it, it gave me disc unable to read error and I was like WTH. I played it 1 year ago on my old Xbox360 elites and it works fine but not on my Xbox 360
 Slim. I tried to reset the laser, the achievement list does show up on my list but the game just won't read. The other old games works well. Does anyone know what have caused this problem and how to fix it? :(

<p>Greetings Rainy Candy</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you are having problems with your game.</p>
<p>In order for you to repair the Xbox 360 disc unreadable error, you have to determine first if the problem is caused by a hardware malfunction or not. Do the following steps so that you can figure out what is the reason behind the error you are experiencing.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Restart your console</strong> – Power down your console for a few minutes and power it back up and see if the problem is resolved or not.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Check for loose cables</strong> – Any loose cables can cause your gaming console to not function properly that’s why you have to make sure that everything is properly connected.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Plug out all the cables after powering down your console</strong>. Then place all the cables back in and turn the console back on.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Take out the hard drive of your gaming console very carefully and place it back in after a few minutes</strong>. You can try to do this step for about 2 to 3 times.</p>
<p>If the steps provided above did not help you fix your Xbox 360 disc unreadable error and your disck is in perfect condition, then it is most likely that your issue is with your hardware.</p>

            <p><span>Hi KillerRooster,<br />
<br />
1. Do you have any third party screen savers installed on the computer?<br />
2. Does the issue occur with any particular screen saver?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to run the fixit from the following link:<br />

<br />
<b>Method 2<br />
</b>Check if the issue persists in clean boot.<br />

Note: </b>Follow step 7 from the clean boot article KB929135 to reset the computer back to normal mode.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 3</b><br />
Uninstall all the third party screen savers, then set default Windows 7 screen saver and see if that helps.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your suggestions.&nbsp; I tried all of them but no luck.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poblem occurs in the screensaver dialogue box.&nbsp; The actual dropdown to select a screensaver is inactive and is&nbsp;greyed out.&nbsp; The value in it = "Blank" and I am unable to change it.&nbsp; the dropdown can't be selected at all. When I click on the "settings"
 button, I get an error message the says "This screensaver has no options that you can select" which is understandable given that the option selected is "Blank".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Lock Screen message won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 Pro (v 16299) has started showing up coming football matches on the lock screen.</p>
<p>I don't follow football and this is quite intrusive and not what I want. It makes me feel my personal life is being invaded,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single notification is turned off. I had a MS support person on and she changed some more settings in the registry</p>
<p>but still the lock screen messages remain. Anyway after half an hour she still could not fix it and then managed to lock herself out</p>
<p>and that was the end of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one have any ideas that go beyond "turn off lock screen notifications" because all that has been done to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Woah woah woah -- this does not involve the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's two possibilities:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you are seeing images or text you don't like on the lock screen, you should go to Settings &gt; Personalize &gt; Lock Screen and pick options you like instead.&nbsp; "Spotlight" shows random images downloaded from Microsoft, or you can choose just a regular picture
 that you decide on for yourself.&nbsp; You can also turn on or off the tips and other things that show there.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>If you see Calendar items for upcoming sports games, you should go to your Calendar and remove the calendar you don't want.&nbsp; For example, I don't want NFL games, so I can remove them here:</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ea51bc4-917f-4567-86dc-e5c7443f111a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ea51bc4-917f-4567-86dc-e5c7443f111a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Microsoft can't put that there, they have no access to your calendar or personalization options.</p>

<p>You are right.</p>
<p>It was the calendar. Once I turned it off the message disappeared.</p>
<p>Curious that the MS person did not think if this yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that using a grey on grey icon to show an active task is poor design</p>
<p>when they use grey on grey to show disabled features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Sometimes tech support can be a bit of a roulette game, depending if you get a technician that both cares and is knowledgeable with the task at hand.&nbsp; And the call center/tech support center agents probably get forced to work with a computer so locked down
 that he couldn't even open the lock screen settings or calendar to explore himself, so it'd rely on either his/her memory, personal experience on their own computer (if they own one), or their ability to search and find relevant info in their knowledge manual
 or just online at large.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"I think that using a grey on grey icon to show an active task"</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That may be something you can customize.&nbsp; If you are talking about the task that's active on the taskbar, you can go to the Settings &gt; Personalize &gt; Colors and adjust it a bit.&nbsp; I made mine this bright green mint color:</p>

            Hi Holby.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/446461...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>There used to be a time when the xbox was known as the best console for core gaming, the ultimate gaming system and now it seems all they are focusing on is Kinect, which in my opinion is the biggest load of crap ever, sure the technology of it is great
 but its just not for gaming, you just cant play real games on kinect.&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>Microsoft have said that all their 1st party games from now on will feature kinect, and we are also getting another whole new dashboard designed arround kinect (which if you ask me looks crappy, i just got used to this one) &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>Now whats funny is the Xbox facebook page asked a poll question yesterday which was "What were your favourite announcements from E3?" &nbsp;the first possible answer "hardcore games (gears 3 halo 4, MW3)" so far has 44,891 votes, and "kinect games" has only 1,144
 even the answer "other" has 2,396 votes.&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>So why are microsoft still trying to push kinect when no one really cares or wants to use it for their games. This E3 we had 2 exclusives, Gears 3 and Forza 4 because the rest are crappy little kids games like disney world, dance games and once apon a time,
 seriously? that stuff should of been on the Wii.&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>Now lets talk about Mass effect 3, this is a brilliant game and they have now added Kinect so you can say whats on the screen, but seriously whats the point? its actually much easier and quicker to just press the A button than it is to say 'i'm commander
 shepard i dont need your trust' and then wait 1-2 seconds for the game to recognise it, it might just be me but i dont want to play a game talking to myself the whole time.&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>Now Forza 4, yeah great you can move your head around in the garrage to look around the car and get close to the tv to zoom in and what not, but why look like a moron doing so when you can easily just move the analog, moving around my room does not make
 me feel more like i'm with the car and touching it. Also with the headtracking while your racing, you can look left and right to see out your car, but if your head is turned to the side then how are you supposed to see the screen any way so thats a bit pointless.&lt;BR&gt;</p>
<p>Any way i might have loads of people disagree with me and thats fine i'm just expressing my thoughts and feel free to comment what you think, do you agree that kinect is a waste of time and you'd rather have some core exclusive games? or do you prefer kinect
 and like that xbox is now becoming a kids party system?</p>

<p>Since over 10 million units have sold so far probably more by now it isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Kinect has amazing tech that games are just now starting to utilize. Things like MassEffect 2 voice commands are amazing among other things it can do.
 If your tired of hearing about it then just freaking ignore it.</p>

<p>OP, you're absolutely right. &nbsp;I can't believe MS completely abandoned all of the genres and franchises that made the Xbox great just so they can try and force casual gaming down our throat with the Kinect. &nbsp;I mean what happened to a new Gears of War, or
 maybe a new Halo game? &nbsp;What about the immersive RPG's like Mass Effect or Dragon's Age? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait? &nbsp;Oh, right, all of those games are coming out.</p>
<p>Honestly though, it's always fun to watch the forums catch on fire as soon as something like Kinect or Move arises. &nbsp;People assume it's the end all peripheral or the tool of the consoles destruction. &nbsp;They are completely ignorant of the fact that the devices,
 as well as the games that utilize them, are optional. No on eis making you play Kinect Adventures. And if you buy Mass Effect 3 or Forza 4, no one will make you use the Kinect along with it.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the advice. I attempted this method, but it didn't completely resolve the issue. For me, a simpler solution was found here:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/windows-8-keeps-loading-with-temporary-profile/583abee6-645d-42a1-88da-063547c6eea0<br />
<br />
 with the TEMP profile. I searched around within the Registry and found an entry here;</span>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</div>
<div>If you look within one of the sub-keys within that (on mine it was called 5-1-5-21-557812858-3650550099-3850275229-1001), you will find a key called 'ProfileImagePath'. Ensure that key is pointing to the right directory. Once I pointed it to the
 right hdd, my TEMP profile issue was fixed.</div>
<div>
<p>Hope this helps you out."</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 not accepting password after updating 18&#47;3&#47;18</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Following a Windows 10 update Yesterday (17-3-18), the lock screen is not accepting my password to enter into my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes that may be relevant:</p>
<p>1 - My password has always been blank / nil.&nbsp; I just hit Enter.<br />
2 - This user profile is not associated with my Microsoft Account (I know this because I tried that password and it didn't work either).</p>
<p>3 - I have tried dozens of possible passwords in case it had switched to something else inadvertently, but no luck.</p>
<p>4 - I am running Webroot SecureAnywhere Version 9.07.50 (latest for Mac).</p>
<p>5 - I am running Parrallels Desktop for Mac.&nbsp; Version 11.</p>
<p>6 - I tried System Restore, but still it didn't accept the nil password I have used forever.</p>
<p>5 - I really need to fix this today to get work done before I leave the office for 10 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for helping me.</p>

<br />There's no need to use a blank password since you can just remove the Sign in page if you want as shown here once you're back in:  <a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/skip-windows-10-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/skip-windows-10-lo...</a>

<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>

<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Thank you for coming back to me with very comprehensive instructions.&nbsp; I will have to leave it for now to pack.&nbsp; I will revisit your recovery methods after Easter.&nbsp; Hopefully between now and then, there might be a direct fix if it is a system issue that
 others discover when they log in on Monday morning at work.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the same problem. I couldn't log with my password after a system update. The solution was that the system rebooted my computer with a different keyboard (Azerty) so that when a typed my password it became wrong and it was refused. So I used the virtual
 keyboard (icon at the bottom right of your login screen) to type correctly my password and it worked.</p>

                    When I turn on my laptop, a box comes up and says:<br />
<br />
The file or directory C:\WINDOWS\system32\ole.dll is corrupt and unreadable. Please run the Chkdsk utility.<br />
<br />
Then I click OK, and this box pops up:<br />
<br />
This application has failed to start because ole32.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Then I press OK, and the two boxes pop up, alternating, about a dozen times. Then the box to put in my Username and password finally pops up, so I put them in. Then the box goes away, and nothing happens. The only thing on the screen is my background picture,
 but it stays like that until I finally have to turn the computer off again.

<p><span>Hey KNH888,</span></p>
<p><span>Any recent changes made to the computer?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend performing clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot helps in eliminating driver conflicts. This is because of the fact that in a clean boot configuration the usual start-up
 programs do not start. Also non-Microsoft services are not started in this state.</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer this article for detailed information on how to do this.</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>After the computer is in clean boot state, check if the images are still distorted in My Pictures folder. Accordingly follow the suggestions
 from the article above to determine and fix the problem.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t help, &nbsp;let’s<strong><span>run SFC scan</span></strong>
 to find missing or corrupt files that may be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows 7 system files are where they should be as they were by default and not corrupted,
 changed, or damaged. </span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and&nbsp; select Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You
 should see the following on-screen message:</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</span></p>
<p><span>Verification % complete.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Refer the KB article for more information:</span></p>

    <title>My computer can&#39;t locate Adesso divers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madisontomasko  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer can&#39;t locate Adesso divers</h2>
                    So a few years back, I had Windows 7 and I installed an Adesso z12 tablet. It worked like a charm until it recently broke, and my aunt sent me another tablet. The one she sent me, however, is a Wacom, and to install it I have to remove my Adesso drivers.
 When I search my computer for "Adesso", I get no results. I uninstalled all mouses and pointers that were inactive, and all human interface devices that were inactive, through the device manager. I am now using Windows 10, and nothing is showing up in my "Apps
 and Features" section that is associated with my old Adesso tablet. Until I find these drivers and uninstall them, I cannot use the Wacom tablet (it comes up with a message saying I have other tablet drivers uninstalled, and then closes the installation windows).

<h3> win8noviceal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open apps on taskbar do not enlarge when computer is awakened. Desktop icons also disappear.</h2>
                    <p>I have several tiles (Internet Explorer, Word, etc.) on the bottom taskbar. If one of these programs is open, and the computer is left idle for awhile, I am no longer able to open the programs so they are visible on the entire screen. Instead, if I right
 click on the tile, I see a small version of the open page.&nbsp; Desktop icons which were previously visible on the left of the screen are no longer visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have been able to temporarily deal with this situation is to restart the computer which is a pain. Seems like there should be an easier way.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

 since i dont have the patients to take it in somewhere, would buying a brand new hard drive and brand new windows 7 solve all my problems?

I am using Windows 8.1 Pro and has 750 GB of hard drive partitioned into 2. Local Disk C:(OS) and the other one is Backup Disk D:(Data drive)&nbsp;I turned

<p><br />
</p>
<p>My BIOS has also&nbsp;has a&nbsp;password, secure boot enabled, and&nbsp;UEFI enabled too. I also installed all the latest security patch in Windows Updates. Windows Defender is also up to date. I already removed the&nbsp;private documents(Bank details)&nbsp;on the Backup Disk:
 D and the remaining files will be some movies, music, and games installer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I want to know if this setup is&nbsp;enough before&nbsp;I take my Laptop in a Repair shop.&nbsp; About the serial number, I already got the processor id, motherboard serial number, memory serial number, and hard drive serial number. I do not know how to get the dvd rom,
 lcd screen and the wlan network card serial number. </p>
<p>I want to identify if some parts are replaced without me knowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

Unfortunately, I do not know how to dismantle a laptop. I only know how to change computer parts in desktop pc. The screen problem is kind of random. I doubt if it is a screen problem. Maybe the ribbon or something is loosen up. Is the guest account good enough
 for troubleshooting the screen? Some browsing or browsing video in guest account?<br />

The Backup Disk D: is where I store music files, video, and games installer. I already removed private documents.&nbsp;My system recovery&nbsp;is installed in a&nbsp;bootable&nbsp;flash drive.&nbsp;What are some other nasty things a computer technician can do with the guest account?
 I am going to let them troubleshoot the monitor in the guest account without password. Maybe while browsing or watching video in the IE while they are troubleshooting the monitor screen.<br />
