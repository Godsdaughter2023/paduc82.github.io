<h2>            Cant log in Nokia account on Lumia 525. Cant download any app either</h2>
                    <p>My phone is Lumia 525. Since few months ago, it couldnt download or update any app. When I go to ( Settings &gt; Nokia account ), the password fill is blank. Then I entered the password, it always said "Network Problem: We couldnt complete that operation. Please
 try again later". I even reset my acc and changed the password. Still cannot log in (I can log in on computer. Computer and Phone were using same Wi-fi).</p>
<p>Please help my resolve it. Thank you.</p>

            Nokia accounts don't exist anymore (for a very long time, now). And you dont need one to use the phone or to install apps. So... What you are saying about the password reset etc, it cannot be true because the nokia account system doesnt exist. You are
 mixing it up with the MICROSOFT account, which is a very different thing.

<h2>            After migrating mailbox from 2013 Exchange to O365, Outlook will prompt for a password every time it is opened.</h2>
                    <p>After setting up a Hybrid configuration between Exchange 2013 and O365, any migrated mailbox has an issue where Outlook will prompt for a username and password every time it is opened.&nbsp; We are currently using Office 2016.&nbsp; The user is logged in with the
 correct AD credentials associated with the O365 mailbox.&nbsp; We've looked at Autodiscovery as a potential culprit, but it appears to be working correctly.&nbsp; The credentials are properly synching via Azure AD connect.&nbsp; I've opened a ticket with Microsoft about
 45 hours ago, but to this point there is only a message stating "An engineer is reviewing your details now. "</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to confirm the following things.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Do you set up ADFS or just AD sync?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If you enter the correct password when prompting, is it working in Outlook?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Does the issue occurs to all migrated users or specific one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, please try to see if it works after you choose “remember credential” in prompt window. Also, we can try to check Credential Manager to clear this cached credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I notice you create a ticket also. I have sent a private message to you to request the ticket number. After that, we can help you monitor the progress of the ticket. Thanks.</p>

<p>Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; Here is the followup</p>
<p>1. We are only using AD sync at this time.</p>
<p>2. Entering the correct password works for allowing access to the mailbox in Outlook</p>
<p>3. The issue affects all migrated users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select "remember credentials", I no longer receive the prompts until I change the password changes.&nbsp; I tried clearing cached credentials as well.<br />
</p>
<p>I replied back to your private message with the ticket number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question I have now after more research is the modern authentication option in O365.&nbsp; We have a few email clients still running Outlook 2010, so we did not enable modern authentication.&nbsp; When I run the "Test Email AutoConfiguration" test from outlook
 logged in with the affected mailboxes, the "Auth Package" setting is listed as Basic.&nbsp; So I have two questions around this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is Modern Authentication required to pass through credentials from the PC to O365, and result in us not needing to log in?</p>
<p>2. If we enable modern authentication in O365, how will this affect clients using Outlook 2010?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<p>Hi SamuelPeña,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes for point 1. For point 2, Outlook 2010 does not support modern authentication. So, if you enable it on Office 365 tenant, Outlook 2010 still use basic to log in. Please note, Outlook 2010 reach support
 lifecycle. It is suggested you update to Outlook 2013/Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>After checking the ticket status, it is assigned to our engineer, and will reply to you later. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How do I wild card a domain in content advisor white list&#63;</h2>
                    I am wanting to use Content Advisor&nbsp;in IE to lock down the computer to go to only one domain. I want not to get the blocking messages below the domain name itself (e.g.
<a href="http://www.zinio.com/time-magazine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.zinio.com/time-magazine</a>). Somehow, intuitively,&nbsp;I would think I would need to wild card the domain name (e.g. *.zinio.com; or *://www.zinio.com, etc.). But these do not work. If this cannot be done in IE
 11, are there any programs out there (hopefully free) that will allow such filtering?

                    Hi so basically my account got hacked about 6 months ago. The hacker managed to get my xbox account banned and same with my email. I just figured about a recovery form and I sent one in. It was accepted and I was able to change password and the phone number
 back but I have to wait 30 days for the phone number to fully change. Every time I try to sign in and it tells me that my account is temporarily banned. I would like somebody to help me out and tell me how long its going to be banned or it I can get it unbanned
 now considering the ban wasnt even my fault. Thanks!

<h2>            When saving a file with Save As option it changes display attributes from landscape to portrait on Philips monitor. Office 2010 Windows 7 64 Bit.</h2>
                    I have never seen this before. When saving an excel spreadsheet using the Save As option on the file drop down, myself and several others on a shared network have found that the program automatically changes the display properties of our monitor. It is
 the Philips Brilliance model 235 PQ. How can we work around this?

<h2>            Create Group in Teams - Why would I not always</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since an office 365 group don't have a Microsoft Team if not created in the Teams App, question is, why would I not always create an Office 365 Group within Teams, to ensure that I would have a MS Team available if needed in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not aware that we can currently attach a newly created MS Team to an excising Office 365 Group.</p>

            Hi Nordmann1087,<br />
<br />
Microsoft Teams is built upon Office 365 Groups and provides a new way to access shared assets for an Office 365 Group.<br />
<br />
However, you can add Microsoft Teams to an existing Office 365 Group. If the existing group is private and has 600 or fewer members (the maximum number of members for a team). When creating a new team in Microsoft Teams, an owner of an existing private Office
 365 Group has an option to use the membership in the Office 365 Group to create the team. Users can add their existing SharePoint and OneNote files by adding a tab for SharePoint and merging OneNote files.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Severe issues with the 14328-160418-1609 preview edition</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This the second time that I give a try for this version. Last week, the system updated to this version and when the OS was fully loaded the Windows would no longer have a working start menu, the FN keys are no longer working and Cortana is not working. I
 can't even bring up Control Panel. Also when I try to open the file explorer located in the task bar I get the following msg : "Class not registered". I have ran the sfc /scannow command and I got the message saying that there were no integrity violations
 found. The only way to run a command prompt with admin privilegies is using the task manager. Last week, I restored to the previous build and everything started working fine. This week this update came up again and I decided to give it another try, however
 the same problems persist. I think I am not the only user affected by this. These issues make almost Windows useless since it is very hard to work without a working taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please guide me on how to fix these issues? Is there another update coming up soon that can fix these issues? I love windows 10 and this is the first time a previewer edition fails on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hello Inverness_87,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Basically, this should be adjusted from the sender's side, especially the email content (for example, the hyperlink in the email). I mean, the sender needs to ensure that he is sending a normal email. As for the recipient
 side, his email service will check whether the coming sender's email is legtimate or not, if the recipient side email service classify the coming sender's email fails its checking, then the email will be marked as spam.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As said before, to classify whether a coming email is a spam, which needs to check the "</span><span>compauth failure" values (not only the hyperlink I mentioned). Anyway, the recipient
 side can also try adding the sender as his safe sender so that the sender's email will pass the checking the email service.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            OneNote Not Syncing Properly &#40;</h2>
                    <p>I've had considerable difficulty getting OneNote to sync properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My notes are syncing <strong>fine</strong> on the following platforms:</p>
<p>OneNote Online, OneNote on iPad, OneNote 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>My notes are syncing extremely slowly on:</p>
<p>OneNote for Windows 10, OneNote for Android (phone), and OneNote for Mac</p>
<p>
</p><p>For individual sections, the error code appears to be:</p>
<p>(0xE0001459) = The internet connect (sic) was reset by the sync service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For notebooks:</p>
<p>We ran into a problem syncing your notebook. (Error code: 0xE0000007).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if I make a change on my iPad (one of the platforms that works), it will appear right away on OneNote 2016 (another platform that works).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to open notebooks on OneNote for Android or OneNote for Windows 10, it is very slow and I get error messages, etc.&nbsp; If I close and open a notebook, it takes a very long time to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried my wife's account in OneNote for Mac, she was having the same problem as me.</p>

<p>I just ran into the "internet connect was reset" error on my Android. I was able to clear it up by closing the notebook containing the section on each device and then switching the ISP for my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be that the best practice with using OneNote on a variety of devices/OSes is closing all notebooks on all devices, and then using OneNote 2016 to complete all major edits until re-opening those notebooks, but even then expect problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Major edits in my world are defined as the movement of many notes from one section/notebook to another and/or when making many quick edits to many pages using multiple devices at once. Even if you are using one device for one set of notes and another device
 for another set, OneNote can choke and take 24+ hours to sync. Even then some sync errors require babysitting, which I define as 1) closing and re-opening problematic notebooks, and/or 2) opening one notebook at a time on one device until synced before moving
 on to the next.</p>

<h2>            Resume ability to access AOL&#39;s Compuserve email on my phone</h2>
                    <p>Until recently, I've been able to check my AOL/Compuserve email on my Lumia 920 Windows Phone.&nbsp; Now, I get an error message stating that either my browser or my software isn't able to support my visits to check my email on Compuserve.&nbsp; What do I do to get
 back my email viewing on my phone?&nbsp; I'm gun-shy about upgrading to any new version, such as 10, because, as it is, I've lost precious photos I can't seem to find on OneDrive since upgrading from 8 to 8.1.&nbsp; Is there a software download that either Windows or
 Nokia can send to restore the capability I once had?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> isabelleheu  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE8 sound problem</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have trouble playing audio with IE8 WMP(and flash) plugin.<br />
<br />
1) WMP works well, other applications with sounds work well<br />
2) Internet option : multimedia, set to play sound within the page<br />
3) the default sound output is the laptop speaker, 2nd output in headphones<br />
<br />
First when i played video file,&nbsp; video works, sound worked through speaker <br />
i wanted to switch the sound output to headphone.<br />
as i couldn't put headphone as default device, i inactivated speaker as default device, and put headphone as default speaker.<br />
the sound didn't work.<br />
<br />
So i put back speaker as default device.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have one application IE, displayed in speaker application in sound mixer, to move to headphone.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Isabelle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question on the Microsoft community forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are having trouble with playing sounds in the Internet Explorer. Let me know if this is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>It is possible that Internet Explorer has been selectively muted in the Volume Mixer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>To check this:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open Internet Explorer, preferably to a page that should be playing some sound.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the volume icon in the windows system tray (in the right-hand lower corner of the taskbar), and then click on the link labeled "Mixer".</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>A panel will open showing the individual volume levels of all running apps that play sounds (you may need to scroll to the right to see all of them).</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure that the volume level belonging to Internet Explorer is not set to mute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Run a SFC scan and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “cmd” in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on Command Prompt in the list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Choose “Run as Administrator”</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “sfc /scannow” (Note: there is a space after sfc)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can refer to the link provided to understand the logs generated by the SFC scan.</span></p>

<div>Hi Thirumal R,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Via checking the email addresses in the NDR, we have found that both the sender's domain and the recipient domain are under the same Office 365 Tenant. However, the recipient domain has no any DNS records. As a result, the recipient has no any Office 365
 service like Exchange Online (mailbox). I mean, the recipient mailbox doesn't exist due to no DNS records. Meanwhile, I have checked the specific mailbox license condition but got no information about it. This is also an evidence that the recipient mailbox
 doesn't exist. Also, the NDR also indicates the issue factor is because it can't be found for the recipient. At last, as the recipient domain has no any DNS records, this should be the reason why all the emails to the recipients under the same domain bounced
 back (NDR generated). </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Here, I'd like to confirm whether you are the admin of your Office 365 Tenant. If not, you can deliver the above mentioned information to your admin so that the admin can take correct performance; if you are the admin, please try adding the required Office
 365 DNS records for that domain and assign the Office 365 license for the recipients. After that, you can check the result again. For adding Office 365 DNS records, you can refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider?view=o365-worldwide</a></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>By the way, I have removed the NDR message in your last reply for protecting your privacy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

<h3> xsatquest  say:</h3>
<h2>            HF-21W update cable</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I am looking for a mysterious cable called CA-138D ..<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where i can buy this cable or even if someone has a pinout.<br />
<br />
It should be a USB upgrade cable for the box so i guess that the one end is a USB plug, but what about the other end ?<br />
<br />
I am hoping that the other end plugs into the non-labelled 4 pin RJ-11 plug but fear that it would be CA-113CU cable connector port.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have ANY information on this mysterious cable.<br />
<br />
Having searched the web i find that it would possibly be easier to get the launch codes for the nuclear missiles in the USA than to have even a simple picture of that damn cable, let alone a cable schematic and noone i have asked to purchase from has even heard
 about it.

            Nokia only issued it to accredited installers in the Uk, not sure about other countries.<br />
<br />
It plugs into the serial port that normally holds the cable that charges the phone and holds the 3.5mm audio in lead.<br />
<br />
If you are in the uk you can find your nearest accredited installer here: <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/carkitfitters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Ok, that's sad.<br />
<br />
Dont quite understand why they have the update available for free download at their site when it is not possible for "joe public" to do the upgrade anyway.<br />
<br />
You would not happen to have a schematic of the cable. ?<br />
<br />
If not i will certainly try myself to figure out how to upgrade the unit and possibly make the info available here if i am allowed since it seems that there are quite strict rules as to what can be discussed.<br />

            I have a cable but not a schematic.<br />
<br />
Why go to all the hassle yourself instead of getting a professional to do it?<br />
<br />
The update takes about 30 seconds once the box is located so it's not exactly going to cost the earth.

            Hi<br />
<br />
No you might be right but the closest possible place to get it done from where i am is about 180 km/s away.<br />
<br />
I dont suppose you would be willing to ohms test your cable and tell which pin in the USB connector goes where ?<br />
<br />
I intend to ohms test the 113 cable myself and i guess that the 138 cable will use some of the pins not used by the 113 cable so there will probably not be many free pins anyway(possibly sharing earth though).<br />

            Hope that you have now been successful in updating your CK-300 software from v1.2 to v1.4. Although previously posted by "<span>confiture"</span>&nbsp;I can now confirm that at long last after this upgrade and using CarMenu .sis 2.6
 "Voice Navigation" commands are fed through car radio speakers instead of being muted as previously was the case.:smileyhappy:

<p>Yes i figured the schematic out and have 1.4 and 2.6 but the voice commands are not routed the right way when using garmin, only the internal nokia route program and this cost me money to enable the routing so i opted for garmin instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i&nbsp;get the time for it i will design a small electronic&nbsp;circuit that will enable my setup to work with the car kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have a mute signal IN&nbsp;and&nbsp;one mono signal IN on my radio so&nbsp;right now i only have audio when someone calls me&nbsp;or i call someone not for navigation and music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My circuit&nbsp;will&nbsp;put the signals from both outputs together and&nbsp;mute the radio when something comes thru either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sad that i have to do this as i bet that it would be a VERY small software modification for nokia to make a menu where i could select where the outputs should go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this thread is still alive. I was just wondering how you've managed to figure out the schematics of the CA-138D cable. My unit has FW 1.2 and I can't find any installer to upgrade the unit to FW 1.4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, your approach sounds like the way to go. Can you please inform me what signals the pins carry?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the proprietary Nokia connector on the carkit side looks expensive so I'm not sure I want to destroy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you or anyone else!</p>

<p>Sorry, should've mentioned it: I live in the Netherlands. Although there is a Nokia Repare Point (or whatever it needs to be called) in my city, the tech guy over there never heard of such a cable and actually couldn't believe that the new firmware was publicly
 available through the Nokia website. All of which made me suspicious to trust anything he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - as usual - I'm putting my money on the information from the internet&nbsp;

    <title>How do I completely delete Outlook 2010&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bwhughes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I completely delete Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Microsoft Office 2010 on Windows 7. My HP notebook computer is now just a little over 2 years old. It came with the Office Suite pre-installed and I use Word, Publisher, and Excel actively. All of the components of the Suite are listed in "All
 Programs" on my Startup menu, even though I have never used any but those three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I decided to try running Outlook 2010 for the first time. When I clicked to open it, it began running an installation process, which confused me, because I thought it was already installed. During the process of installation, the wizard asked me
 if I wanted to configure an email account, so I started trying to do that. Errors ensued when I tried to test the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted my email service provider, Earthlink, in chat, and the customer rep took control of my computer to get my account set up properly. She got errors and then told me that Outlook hadn't finished installing. She said you can't configure a new email
 account until the program is fully installed. I told her that that was exactly what the installation process asked me to do! Then she said, OK, now it has finished installing! I didn't see any evidence of that, but she was working quickly. I said "It has?"
 and she said "Yes." She told me all I need to do now is reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I rebooted. I tried to start Outlook and the SAME installation messages started appearing again. I don't recall what they were exactly, but something about a "single image?" Not sure about that, it was single-something. Then it appeared that Outlook was
 running, but no message appeared saying installation had finished. When I tried to configure my email account again, I got errors again. Earthlink had already walked me through the proper configuration for their servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I tried opening Outlook again and it still went through the SAME installation and configuration process with a series of messages popping up to show progress, and yes, it wanted something to do with a Single Image. But Outlook opened (with no indication
 that installation had been completed successfully) and I tried a Send/Receive. It failed and I got the error: "Task '[my email address] - Receiving' reported error (0x8004210A) : 'The operation timed out waiting for a response from the receiving (POP) server.
 If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).' "</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, all of that is backstory for the fact that I just want to delete Outlook. I don't want to contact Earthlink again, I just want to be done with Outlook. I think I'm going to get Eudora from my old computer and install that!! Good old Eudora......</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's the thing: I use a program called Revo Uninstaller for removing all traces of programs when I uninstall them. I don't even bother going through Add/Remove Programs, because I know that Revo will do what I need it to do. When I open up Revo, I don't
 even see Microsoft Outlook listed as one of the programs I can uninstall. I see Microsoft OFFICE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft WORD is my lifeblood. I rely on WORD for my livelihood. I also use PUBLISHER and EXCEL fairly often, as previously noted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DO have an unopened CD that came with my computer, Microsoft Office Professional 2010, "Intended for distribution with a new PC." Never used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Revo Uninstaller to remove ALL traces of Microsoft Office, will I LOSE any important files related to my three preferred components of the Office Suite? You can pick and choose what it actually removes from your computer, but I have NO idea which
 little bits I would need to keep and which it would be OK to toss......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANY way at all that I can uninstall Outlook ONLY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ASSUME (but am I right?) that if I were to delete the Office Suite, all of my important DOCUMENTS would remain intact and I'd be able to open them as always if I were to use my previously unopened CD to reinstall the Suite?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if I were to just try to run this CD? Would it FIX any problems with my installation of any of the components? Would it leave all my important documents intact?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALTERNATIVELY.... can I just NOT USE Outlook? Can I get rid of the shortcuts and remove it from my Startup menu so that it never reminds me that it's there? Would having this "corrupted install" of it on my computer cause me any trouble down the road if
 I never even want to use Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for answering as many of my questions as you possibly can!</p>

<p>You can if you wish modify your office installation to make Outlook unavailable, do not use any third party uninstaller.</p>

    <title>How do I abort a language pack installation&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralph.mackiewicz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I abort a language pack installation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to open a Word file that was written in Russian. I got an error that suggested that I needed to install the Russian language pack. So I went to the Microsoft site, downloaded it and tried to install it. When I ran the installer all the menus
 and text was in Russian which I don't understand. So I aborted the installation and restarted Word. This time it opened up the Word file I needed to open so I don't need to install the language pack now. Everything worked fine for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now every time I start any Office 2016 application I get a yellow bar telling me there are updates available and to install them. When I try to install them the Russian Language pack installation starts back up. At least I think that is what it is because
 the dialog is in Russian so I can't be sure. I run the 32-bit version of Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop the Russian Language Pack from installing? The last thing I want to do is have all my menus turn into Russian text and I can't trust the installer because it is in Russian so I wouldn't have the faintest idea what it is showing or what the
 buttons said before clicking them.</p>

<h2>            Text messages from ovi not coming through</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've been trying to download some games from ovi, including a paid for one. None of the texts have come through at all. I don't know who to report this to. (The only one I'm concerned about is the one I've paid for). I know that the number I've put in
 is correct - first thing I checked. Can anyone suggest anything please? I have a nokia 5230 and checked that the paid for game was compatible first.</p>

<p>There is no need to report this to anyone ..as its a long standing KNOWN issue yet to be resolved.. BTW you can got o the OVI Store site thru' your Phone browser and download directly by selecting the 'DOWNLOAD' tab... No need for sending and waiting to
 receive the link thru' SMS...</p>

<p>I don't get the texts either. However I've tried using my phone, and because I've already downloaded a program, that I currently cannot delete from my phone, OVI won't give me the "Download" button to press on, because it thinks I have it on my phone. Any
 suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to re-download foursquare, but it won't let me. :(</p>

            Negative, we thought it was a DNS or EHLO issue. &nbsp;Tried both of those with no luck. &nbsp;Called my ISP to make sure it wasn't on their end, they confirmed their IPs weren't blocked and that our DNS/Mail records looked good (we use our ISPs Barracuda Spam Filter).
