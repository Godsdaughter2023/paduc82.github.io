    <title>Surface pro 3 docking station replacement power cord&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface pro 3 docking station replacement power cord&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A cleaning person accidentally cut the cord on my docking station. It has been excruciating trying to find where I can buy a replacement. Every time I call support, they keep trying to sell me a power supply for the Surface itself which is a different connector
 than the docking station of course. Any idea where I can find one?</p>

            <p>Hello ZacharyWells,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us about replacing your damaged power supply for your Surface Pro 3 docking station. I'll help you with this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have verified that the Support team can send you a power supply for the docking station. However, you will have to make it very clear to the Support agent that this is what you need, not the Surface Pro 3 power supply. Try contacting them again, and let
 us know if you are successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Zack_T</p>

<h2>            Built in camera</h2>
                    My built in camera isn't recognized any more? I get messages telling me to connect a camera!! This is an Acer Aspire 5740 laptop with a built in Crystal Eye camera. I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 when the upgrade option was free, and the camera hasn't
 worked since then. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks

</p><p>Hi Charianne</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, hope this screen shot covers everything needed to identify my problem. I have tried to download and update camera drivers but with no luck, just get message saying I don't have a camera connected. I know I have, I used it before I
 updated windows, with Skype and PSP.</p>
<p>Any advice is welcome.</p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox Enforcement Team Phone Line - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slayer proz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Enforcement Team Phone Line</h2>
                    <p>Everyone who has&nbsp;been hit by any form of Xbox ban knows how stupid the entire process is. We cannot argue our case and can only submit a case review (of which we have no idea if it even works).&nbsp;I simply got banned for calling someone a
<strong>(Mod Removed-Profanity)</strong> in over watch as they were in fact lying and he was trolling. I received a console ban for that! 2 weeks i cant use any online features! I know it has to have been that situation&nbsp;as I have&nbsp;sent no messages like that&nbsp;for
 at least a few months. We get banned by the enforcement team without any real investigation into the full picture of the problem. We need a direct phone line to the people making these bans because they have no idea what the whole story is. Let me run this
 scenario,&nbsp;Timmy in call of duty who is 12 years old, starts trolling people in game. People start sending him abusive messages because hes trolling (fair enough). Timmy reports these messages causing everyone to get banned, yet the person who caused all of
 this is let off. not to mention he is a 12 year old in a 18 rated game. STOP BABY PROOFING XBOX LIVE. Family settings are there for a reason!!! People know the risk of speaking to people online. I still say ban anyone using racial or any other discriminatory
 terms but simply swearing at someone is stupid. This is the real world, not kindergarten. Grow up xbox. I know so many people who have left xbox for PC because of this exact reason. The 360 era of banning &nbsp;was perfect. What happened!?</p>

            <p>Due to poor communication after receiving a 7 day&nbsp;communications&nbsp;ban (first time ban ever)&nbsp;for insulting another user who first attacked me and the inability of the Policy Enforcement Team to follow their own listed attributes on their enforcement page I have come here to post this. The&nbsp;pet so called values:</p>
"Our Values
<i>Integrity</i>
<p>We are accountable for our actions; we must make consistent, unbiased decisions based on the best available evidence.</p>
<i>Compassion</i>
<p>The policy is our guide. We must do what is right, not always just what is written. Context matters.</p>
<i>Precision</i>
<p>With authority comes great responsibility; we must be precise in our investigations, documentation, reporting, and application of enforcement policy.</p>
<i>Team</i>
<p>Each individual is critical to our success. Each is trusted and empowered to do what is right. We learn from mistakes and always try to improve. We care deeply about our customer’s experiences on Xbox Live and are dedicated as a team to make it a safe and fun place to be!"</p>
<p>I understand the reasons for my suspension, but the inability for the Policy Enforcement Team to properly act with:</p>
<p>"Integrity"&nbsp;- the player who instigated the exchange and first harassed me remains un-banned and unpunished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Compassion" -&nbsp;Neither did you do what was right nor did you look at the context of the events even as described when you actually have a message trail you can follow, as the offending player called me a "Goof."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Precision" - &nbsp;An obvious failure has occurred with this system of investigation and documentation&nbsp;if they allow players who initiate hate mail to get away with it and punish a victim who will fight back and defend themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Team" -&nbsp;My favorite is the part where they claim to&nbsp;care about he customer's experience, yet they ban me, a 6+ year member for defending himself&nbsp;against hate mail, and I have had&nbsp;ruined my experience far enough due to belligerent players instigating hate constantly.&nbsp;I'm sure anyone who works at this SJW&nbsp;reddit fuelled &nbsp;sociology graduate&nbsp;PET must be aware of things such as these by now&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchoate_offense" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchoate_offense</a>
</p>
<p>This offending&nbsp;player displayed both&nbsp;<em>mens rea</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>actus reas;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;yet still goes unpunished!</p>
<p>The Policy Enforcement Team's inability to act appropriately&nbsp;has cost them not one, but two accounts now. Both the account Perfect Dark 51 and Starboss47 will be terminated due to the inability of the Policy Enforcement Team to act in fairness, this complaint will also be sent to every single place I can put it, good day</p>

            AGREED!!! I got banned without swearing, using racist terms, or anything in the policy. I am banned simply because the kid who was harassing me reported me. It is ridiculous that i cant even join private parties and chat with friends anymore. So what now,
 I am unable to play for 2 weeks? This system is ridiculous, and this will be my last month with live. This policy is just dumb.

<h2>            Microsoft software protection takes high cpu.</h2>
                    <p>I had trouble with microsoft software protection taking high cpu. I run the anti virus programs, ran the program in safe mode, and tried everything to prevent it from taking so much cpu.
</p>
<p>Today, I even reset the computer to factory setting. Only things i did after resetting were windows update and downloaded Malwarebytes to protect the computer and downloaded chrome. Microsoft software protection is still here taking 30-50 percent of cpu.
 I don't know think it is virus that caused the problem. I reset the computer and only did three things i mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i stop microsoft software protection from taking so much cpu?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What other security software do you have on your device prior to using Microsoft software protection? It's also possible that you have conflicting security software still partially or fully installed on your device when Microsoft security program was installed.
 Let's try to use a clean up tool to remove your prior security software and reinstall the security program again and check if it resolves the issue . For more information, see

<p>I am not sure what you mean by&nbsp;<span>What other security software do you have on your device prior to using Microsoft software protection? Because I never choose to use Microsoft software protection. I thought it was installed
 in factory setting. I don't know what this Microsoft software protection is.&nbsp;</span>If what you meant is what was secretory software installed in factory setting before I download anything , it was Norton. I deleted the Norton from control panel and choose
 to use malwarebyte.</p>
<p>I went to the link you provided me and check how to clean up Norton, it was a dead link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you help me understandin what Microsoft softare protection is?</p>
<p>Did I understand your statement correctly in regard to you wanting me to clean up left over of Norton security? If so, please provide a better link in how to do so.</p>
<p>Or I misunderstood you?</p>
<p>Or what you want me to remove is my current security program?</p>
<p>Sorry for confusion. I would like clarification.</p>

<p>You're answer here is snarky at best, and insulting to anyone who knows how software should work.</p>
<p><br />
This is one of the top results for people search as to why their system gets half crippled by Defender when they didn't schedule a scan, and don't have the ability to disable the real time interference, and your official answer is "how wonderful it is you get
 to experience this bug".<br />

                    <p>What do you think about tools that clean up and optimize the PC.<br />
Basically, I'm very cautious now regarding the use of external - not Windows 10 OnBoard Tools.<br />
<br />
With the registry cleaners, I've done more harm than good. </p>
<p>There are suddenly empty entries in the registry displayed which are actually in use.
</p>
<p>And so on ....<br />
<br />
In Windows Store a program is advertised, which appears like a recommendation of the editors ....</p>

<p>I recorded a video call and clicked on "end recording" just before i disconnected the call. I cannot find the recorded video on the chat history.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a folder where skype records the videos or if I can recover it somehow.</p>

            Hello Ricardo.
<br />
<br />After recording the file is saving in the chat and later should be manually download to the device (option is available 30days, after the file is gone).
<br />
<br />If you cannot see the fale in chat, unfortunately, it was not saved. No way to get it back, Skype dies have any recovery tools.
<br />
<br />You are not the first who reported about this issue with the service.
<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 changed my password without asking. How can I change it back&#63;</h2>
                    I'm a teacher and use my tablet for teaching all my classes, mostly without the keyboard attached. Last night I let my Surface Pro upgrade to 8.1 and when I went to school this morning I couldn't log in at the windows start up screen. It had changed my
 password! It kept asking for the 'most recently entered password'. How could I remember which was the last password I'd used before I went to bed last night? Luckily I was able eventually to guess which one it was and was able to log in and teach my classes.
 But how can I reset it? Whatever I type into the help screen I end up at the place for changing my microsoft account password, not the password I use for logging in to the computer.

<h2>            Microsoft Permanent PIN Removal Windows 10  Using Microsoft Account 365</h2>
                    <p>HI I am having major issues with this and have tried everything, I don't like using a PIN to access my systems and have tried many times to remove the pin and the only way so far was to select change pin and then hit cancel, however upon reboot it is prompting
 me once again to create a new pin which I cannot bypass without creating a new pin, I am using my 365 Login account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason I do not want to use a pin is because of issues with network shares which have their own credentials, for example I cannot access our new £1200 Synology box via a network share without manually overriding the login box on every reboot to
 several shares, and even when we say remember credentials, it simply does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please advise how we can disable the pin and allow us access to the network shares moving forward like windows 7 used to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Howell.</p>

            PIN Is one of several authentication passwords. If you are using an organization account already with a password, then you can remove the PIN even if you had to set it up.

Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in options &gt; remove under PIN

            Unfortunately this is not an option, the only option is forgotten pin, where we have to go through authentication, go to change pin and then select cancel, this removes the pin, however upon rebooting it will not let me back into the system without creating
 a new one.&nbsp;

            Try switching to a Local Account, remove the PIN, then switch back to your Microsoft Account.

Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in options
Click Switch to a Local Account instead

Restart then switch back to a Microsoft Account

<h2>            Windows 8 store not opening</h2>
                    I just bought a new Dell laptop 5 days ago. The store set it up for me. Windows 8 came with the laptop and the store will not open. I click on the store and it opens up for 2 seconds and then it takes me back to the start screen. Other apps such as weather,
 calendar, people etc. are doing the same thing. I can click on my desktop and that works. I can click on google chrome and that works. I have also installed new games to my desktop and they work. But I still do not have access to my windows store. I have done
 all mu windows updates and they are up to date. Any suggestions???

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Shannon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad to know that you are using Windows 8 on your new Dell laptop computer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description that you have posted, it seems that you are not able to open the Windows 8 Store App and the other modern user interface apps in the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed, let me ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you using the proxy settings to connect to the Internet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you installed any third party security program on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you receive any error message while trying to open the Apps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the Windows Store and to download and run apps, you need an active Internet connection and a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768. So, make sure that
 the screen resolution on the computer is set to the recommended value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow these instructions to verify this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the “Windows Logo” + “W” and type “UAC” and in the search bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Change User Account Control Settings” and verify whether it is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these methods and let us know the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Run the Apps Troubleshooter</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on this link and save the troubleshooter in the computer and then run it. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process and check
 if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Clear the Store cache</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to clear the cache for the Store and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the “Windows Logo” + “R” on the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type “WSReset.exe” and press “Enter”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reboot the computer and try updating the Apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then go ahead with the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3: What to do if you have problems with an app</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

            <p>I had similar problem. I was unable to connect to windows 8 store and apps. However I can access internet in all browsers and other applications. You need to install
<a href="http://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fiddler</a> and them exempt all apps.</p>
<p>It worked for me. Here is detailed tutorial with screenshots -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><a href="http://www.superpctricks.com/2013/11/windows-8-store-is-not-connecting-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows

<h2>            Migrate printers from one Win7 to another Win7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Most of what I find is migration from xp to win7 documents. &nbsp; I am looking for a tool or instructions for easy saving printer settings on one windows7 laptop so that they can be moved to a new laptop. &nbsp; This needs to be easy enough to send out in an email
 to 5K technophobe teachers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Migration tool works nicely for docs, but didn't take printers or settings. &nbsp; Is there an option??</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the reply Harkanwar. &nbsp;This is probably a great solution for most situations, but what I need is something a non-tech-minded teacher can do, like with the PrintMig.exe in Win7. &nbsp;I was pointed to that and it may well work for us. &nbsp;I've come across
 some examples of printers not migrating with that tool, possibly because they were network installs or something? &nbsp; (Usually, the Dell printer drives migrate, but several of the HP's did not.) &nbsp;I'm still working with that. &nbsp;Again, this has to be something
 5000 2nd grade-knowledge level people could do with little instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello Howard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for not putting up the steps in general terms. However, if you once try them step-by-step, I hope you'll be able to migrate the printers. Also, if your computer is connected to a domain network, then I would recommend you re-posting your question
 on the TechNet forum which is looked at by some of the best IT professionals in the world. I hope they will be able to provide you a general comprehensible solution or a simpler way out to solve the issue.</p>

<p>And are you sure it was a Ddos? Just sounds like a lag booting to me. But report through the dashboard is all you need to do. If you know it was a Ddos, then contact your ISP a well, but i doubt it was a Ddos atack.</p>

<p>OP-all you really can do is put them on the avoid list and forget about it.I run into lag switchers all the time.You can file a complaint but you really need to be sure they were cheating first.Ive had games where entire teams simply lagged out because one
 player &nbsp;had a really bad connection.Often that player tends to be me.Give them the benefit of the doubt.That same thing could happen while youre losing.</p>

                    I am not sure what has caused this, but it just happened about an hour ago and I have not changed anything at all during or before this time.&nbsp; Sometimes I will be several words ahead while typing, so it makes it very difficult to not have misspellings
 and other errors.&nbsp; In addition, having to double-click on any window or link is very annoying.&nbsp; I am assuming some setting somehow got messed up, though I'm not sure how.<br />

I would appreciate any and all help to solve this very annoying issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you!

<h2>            Avery Cardoza Casino program has no sound when installed on Win 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>When installing my Avery Cardoza Casino program it complains that the PC is not in 256 compatibility mode (which I ignore as it says it might make it run slow but it seems to function okay) and&nbsp;</strong><span>that
 the wavemix16.dll has not installed correctly it must be in the windows system directory c:\windows\system and wavemix.ini must be in c:\windows. &nbsp;It has a warning getmodulefilename()=C:\windows\system21\wavemix16.dll and then gives awarning Couldn't initialize
 wavemix and an error message Error initializing audio. &nbsp;How can I fix this? &nbsp;It last worked on Windows 98 and 2000. There is no support that I could find from the manufacture.</span></p>
<ul>
</ul>
</span><span>
<p>Computer OS: Windows 7&nbsp;Browser: IE</p>
<p>Already Tried:&nbsp;The troubleshooting program on Control Panel which allows you to run older programs in a compatibility mode. &nbsp;I tried Windows 98 and 2000.&nbsp;I would really love to be able to make this work without messing up anything else! Thanks!

<h2>            BLUE SCREEN  &#34;Unmountable_Boot_Volume&#34;__</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>original title:&nbsp;BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH. "Unmountable_Boot_Volume"__</p>
<p><strong>I start up my laptop, it will go through the normal sequence, but then stops right before it should show the login menu. Then either a light blue screen shows and just freezes, or a darker screen shows with words saying there was an error "Unmountable_Boot_Volume"
 and says you could have a hard/software problem. I have tried all the safe modes, even tried "last good config." but they all go to the blue screen. I tried getting into safe mode to try to install HP's latest drivers, but I can't.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before the problems even happened (and it's happened twice, but I fixed it the first time by clicking "last good config" but now that doesn't even work) it went to the desktop, but then all the buttons froze and all I could do was just move the mouse,
 but not click on anything, so I restarted and the blue screen of death spree began AGAIN.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I don't have a Vista disc, because I bought my laptop from Best Buy and they messed with it. I tried doing system repair and recovery but it does not do anything but "load files" and then windows loading and then
 BLUE SCREEN.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode now just brings up a black screen with SAFE MODE &nbsp;in the corners.</span></strong></p>
<p>I feel that I am running out of options except for updating to Windows 7. Please help if you can! &nbsp;Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Bluescreen errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other options and explanations of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error (as you discover them throughout this and the above processes) which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.&nbsp; You may need to get to them through the disk's command prompt
 and copy them to a flash drive to transfer to another computer that can access the internet.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting
 to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; Unless using the disk, it will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors
 on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>That's about all we can do using that disk (assuming you could make it).&nbsp; If&nbsp;that doesn't work or identify the problem, then we may need to work on your boot files
 - but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it.&nbsp; In the meantime, please reply with the results of what you tried above and we'll see where to go from there.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            Hello nancythayer1, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest following the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />
<br />-Open the Start menu 
<br />-Look on the lower left side, at the top of the stack of icons starting from the bottom of the screen. The top icons of for logged in user ids. Hover the mouse over the top icon (your current userID) 
<br />-In the screencap, you can see that in addition to the current Userid Icon (white circle with red maple leaf) I have 3 more user IDs. And I am currently signed in to the "Admin2" ID. 
<br />-Look to see if you are signed in to another ID. 
<br />-If you are, click on that icon to switch to that ID. Sign out of it, saving any open documents you need to. Then you can sign back into your main userid and exit without seeing that message.
<br />
<br />
<br />I also suggest following this method:
<br />-Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users to see if there are any other Accounts listed, back up any files from them and delete them there if so. 
<br />-Type netplwiz in Start Search, check also there to see if there are any other accounts to highlight and Remove. 
<br />-No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

            <p>The mouse works fine and always did.&nbsp; I just had a question on why I was getting the missing dll message.&nbsp; Evidently it wasn't needed and I got rid of the message by deleting the entry in the Registry.&nbsp; Initially I did not know what the dll was for and what
 affect the missing dll would&nbsp; have.&nbsp; Apparently for my mouse it had no adverse affect.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better functionality of the devices with the operating system, there are specific drivers required to run them. If there is a driver's incompatibility for that specific device, then, it might not run properly. You can download the required driver for
 the wireless keyboard or mouse and then install them on the laptop. That should help you avoid such issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also refer to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to know how to update driver on Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;"I &nbsp;had this issue after upgrade to 8.1, and I do have a Logitech mouse. </p>
<ul>
<li>I navigated to the System32 folder and didn't see the file to delete it. </li><li>Plugged in the USB dongle for the mouse and the hardware installation set ran.
</li><li>I did a reboot to check and make sure it didn't happen again, and the error is gone."</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I saw this answer and tried it and it worked.&nbsp; Very happy I didn't have to mess with registry.&nbsp; I have a Sony Vaio T series.</p>
