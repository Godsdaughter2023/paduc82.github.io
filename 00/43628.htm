                    <p>I did not realize child accounts were possible. My child has been playing a world on my account for a while, and would be unwilling to stop using it. Can I transfer it to a new child account? Or create a new Adult account and change my existing account to a Child account?</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for posting!&nbsp;Unfortunately there is not&nbsp;a way to transfer game saves between two Xbox Live accounts on Xbox One, which is where the Minecraft worlds are stored. Additionally, since your account has already been created as an adult account, it cannot be migrated to a child account. Once a date of birth has been set on an account, it cannot be changed. </p><p><br /></p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            If your hardware supports it you can run a virtual machine to run what ever OS your customer needs.&nbsp; Win 10 does not natively support IE 8 and in fact IE (any version) is being retired.

<h2>            Cold Calling from &#39;Windows&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>We just received a call from a lady with an Indian accent 'advising' us that we have a whole host of errors showing up on our desktop computer at home. She confirmed we would not be able to see these erros however, they were definately there and if I went
 to the computer and did as she told me I'd see them myself. I asked her where she was calling from as the line was REALLY bad, lots of interference, lots of feedback and she replied by saying 'Windows'. When I asked her if she could see what program was generating
 the errors she said 'if you don't believe me you can hang up the phone but you will still get errors'.</p>
<p>I asked again, what programs were causing the errors and why we weren't aware of them and she again said 'if you don't believe me then you can hang up the phone'. She then promptly hung up.</p>
<p>I have advised my parents that if they call again to take a name and number and we'll call them back however, I'm pretty sure it's the latest in a long line of scams? Can you confirm that 'Windows' don't cold call people?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<span>Hi Ahmed Shoaip – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
</span><br />
Windows cannot call you by phone, Windows is an Operating <br />
System (OS), it can only prompt you a messagebox or a <br />
balloontooltip for user attention. Anyway, I explain below. <br />
<br />
AFAIK, Microsoft will never call you, unless you personally tell them to <br />
do so, and then of course you have to give your phone-number so they <br />
can contact you by phone. Please do NOT trust such calls in the future. <br />
Also AFAIK, once you open a Microsoft Support case they will give <br />
you some support ID, that you must use, and if the support <br />
employee calls you (once you told him to do so) he will share some <br />
Support ID Code and you will know whether he is from Microsoft <br />
or NOT because your Support ID must mache with the <br />
code the Microsoft Support guy told by phone.

<h3> colinedmunds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery blue screen. BCD error code 0xc000014c</h2>
                    <p>Just had this happen to me after many months of trouble free use of Windows 10 since the original download upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the online advise seems to point to pressing the power off button just after the manufacturer logo and as Windows starts to load - ie when the spinning dots appear. Unfortunately mystify pc goes straight to the error message after the manufacturer logo
 disappears.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? Or doing I need to do something else? Eg bootable usb? Complete Tunstall from a disk?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is an example of something I've tried.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windows-10-usb-bootable-media-uefi-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

<p>Thanks for your advice - I'm trying it as I type. One other question, after choosing the usb as the device to copy the files to, how long should the download take? It's been "Getting a few things ready" for over an hour.</p>

            Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.

<p>Okay, tried that and unfortunately it didn't work. Probably because it doesn't enter the full boot process.</p>
<p>Basically, straight after the manufacturer logo disappears it jumps straight to the blue screen and the following error message:</p>
<p>File:\Boot\BCD</p>
<p>ErrorCode: 0xc000014c.</p>
<p>Even when i use the reset or power buttons, so I cant actually enter the recovery menu.</p>
<p>I'm at a loss what to do at the moment 😒</p>

<p>Thank for all your help recently, its been very clear and concise &amp; useful - even if it hasn't worked in my case.</p>
<p>I have however progressed 1 step and managed to create a usb bootable drive, managed after several attempts to get to the repair screen. None of the options seemed to work, but in the command prompt screen I entered the commands referenced in my original
 cry for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They all worked except for bootrec/fixboot which came back 'access denied'.</p>
<p>What i get now is one of two things, either black screen with the cyan window, or this error message 0xc000000f.</p>
<p>i cant seem to get back to the repair options again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas?</p>

<h3> rezard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore Disabled Audio Device</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a monitor with a speaker jack via HDMI.&nbsp; It all worked fine, and basically set itself up.&nbsp; I recently was in the Sound settings of Control Panel switching sound devices, and had disabled my monitor as my device.&nbsp; It had been a while since
 I did this, so I guess went about it the wrong way (the option "Don't use this device (disable)").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, my monitor has disappeared completely from the list.&nbsp; "Show disabled devices" is checked, but nothing shows.&nbsp; I've tried everything I could think of, but nothing gets things back how they were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>

<h3> gerry conway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I buy an activation code for Win 7 32 Pro online&#63;</h2>
                    I tried Win 7 64 RC and loved it. I purchased Win 7 Pro from Best Buy. It cam with a 32 &amp; 64 bit version. The 64 bit is on a new build. I installed the 32 bit on an old Sony VAIO VGN A170P running XP Pro. That required pulling and formatting the hard drive.<br />
I have everything running fine on the laptop and it seems to run better than it did on XP Pro. I like it, I want to keep it and I'd like to activate the Win 7 32 Pro on the laptop. Do I have to buy a new disk and do a reinstall or can I just buy an activation
 key online?

Would you have any other suggestions?<br />

At the site buy the exact same version you already have and select the download option. You will get a key emailed to you, then use the key to activate Windows 7. No need to actually download it since you already have it. There is no discount for a second key
 so it's the same price.<br />

(or you can have it shipped to you if you want another set of disks)<br />

            <p>Thank you for the detailed description. I have to apoligize<br />
for the fact that I have no idea what is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
I guess the transitions could be involved because they cause <br />
the photos to overlap each other. The duration of the photos <br />
and the duration of the transition can conflict if the duration of <br />
the&nbsp;transition is too great.<br />
<br />
FWIW...trying to create a project that is too complex can cause<br />
issues when trying to save as movie file.<br />
<br />
I wonder if you could use your Image Editor to append the <br />
text to the photos before importing them into Movie Maker?<br />
<br />

<h3> karl the ninja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Massive amounts of modded XBox360 consoles playing GTA 4 multiplayer</h2>
                    
<p>In expectations of GTA 5 coming out I have broken out GTA 4 and started playing it again, and have become quite frustrated with what the multiplayer has become.&nbsp; There are probably 100 users or so that come in and out of the games that are clearly using
 modded XBox360 consoles.&nbsp; With the modded consoles, players become invincible and then go out and kill everyone else in the game, they have the ability to remotely freeze other players' XBoxes, which then requires you to completely restart the XBox before
 getting back into the Dashboard, then the game, then multiplayer.&nbsp; You can find more about what they can do with their mods here: http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=458628&amp;st=0</p>
<p>If you guys could just join a couple free mode games and watch what the players are doing, it would be very easy to spot these guys.&nbsp; I am paying for XBox Live and I feel like there are literally SO SO many modders playing this game that you guys have turned
 a blind eye to modded 360 consoles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Sorry the folks that post on these forums have no say in who get's banned and who doesn't. The only people that do are the Xbox LIVE Enforcement Team. The only way to reach them is via the Xbox 360 console by filing a complaint against the person(s) that you
 believe to be doing this modding and what not.<br />
<br />
You'd want to file a complaint against them for cheating and system tampering.<br />
<br />
Instructions on how to file a complaint can be found <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/chat-terms-of-use-conduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>P.S</strong>: No one is turning any sort of blind eye, people with modified consoles and accounts get banned on Xbox LIVE every day. See this section
<strong><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/2366.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. This isn't something that happens instantly, and the enforcement team investigates each report sent in for a person that is reported for cheating/system tampering
 very carefully.</p>

<p>I contacted XBox Live support and they were the ones that gave me the link to this forum to post. &nbsp;I've been told it takes several complaints for someone to be investigated, and what I'm wondering here is why it would take so many complaints when the cheating
 is so obvious. &nbsp;</p>

 on Xbox LIVE and the only way the enforcement team hears about the complaint.</p>

<p>Feel free to switch to whatever platform you'd like, however, they have the same issues on their platform as well and they don't even have any sort of concrete way to ban someone. If they do end up banning someone's account, they just go and make a new one
 due to the nature of their free network for the time being.</p>

<p>So you guys have a concrete way to ban someone, but you don't even use it. &nbsp;This thread details that this problem has been ongoing for a long time: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=505459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.gtaforums.com/index.php</a></p>
<p>I have turned in complaints for a countless number of modders and I still see them popping into games, doing the same mods a month later, ruining the gaming experience for everyone else.
</p>
<p>Furthermore you gave me false information on the Playstation Network. &nbsp;This page details that people do get banned from the PS Network:
<a href="https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1260/~/information-on-banned-accounts-and-consoles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.us.playstation.com/.../information-on-banned-accounts-and-consoles</a></p>
<p>My XBox360 will be with me through GTA V, but I can't honestly spend another dime on XBox, XBox Live, or any of your live content when you allow modded XBoxes on your network that ruin everyone else's time. &nbsp;I hope that Steve Balmer's firing changes the
 way Microsoft does business because MS has lost their way when it comes to the wants of the gamer community. &nbsp;Way to kill the XBox brand.</p>

<p>I can assure you People are banned every day for various reasons modding and system tampering have got to be among the biggest set of activities investigated. As Hassassainade said reporting them via your consoles reporting feature is the biggest defense
 system we have. A lot of times what happens is people just decide hey im not going to report it leaving it up to the next individual affected which can have a snowball effect leaving those ruining gaming for everyone else unpunished. Report those players also
 choosing to avoid the players know to be cheating is also of great help </p>
<p>To avoid a specific player on Xbox Live:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Friends, and then go to the Players tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the player’s gamertag.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Submit Player Review.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Avoid This Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select why you want to avoid the player: Communication, Game Behavior, or Player Skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the specific reason why you want to avoid the player.</p>
<p>And In an answer to jumping on the playstation bandwagon that everyone seems to be doing after having a bad experience with their x box, My son plays exclusively on ps3 and there is just as much modding and Harassment going on on that platform, its unavoidable
 but if we all play our part and report the behavior we will see less and less of it</p>

    <title>External HD in Device Manager but not Disk Management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simongruber  say:</h3>
<h2>            External HD in Device Manager but not Disk Management </h2>
                    
<div>
<p>So I have this 1TB Western Digital external hard drive. I've had it for over a year now and it was working fine. I would swap it between my XBox 360 and the computerregularly.
 Then one day I brought it home, plugged it into the computer and nothing. My friend and I couldn't figure anything out. We went as far as to removing the hard drive and putting it directly into the computer. I considered it lost.<br />
<br />
Then yesterday, on a whim, I tried plugging it back in to the USB port. It showed up in Device Manager but said its drivers weren't installed. I then switched USB ports on the back of the computer and magically it was there again. I had full access. Stupidly
 (and you can see where this is going) I didn't transfer anything off the hard drive right away. I was looking at a picture and listening to a song off said hard drive when the drive suddenly went unrecognized.<br />
<br />
I can now see the drive in Device Manager both under Disk Drives and USB Devices. However it is not showing up in the Disk Management window. And yes, I checked both the upper and lower windowsand
 it is not listed. Going to the area where you assign disk drive letters doesn't show it there either. Normally it is E:.<br />
<br />
I also tried deleting the UpperFilters registry in regedit.
 There was no LowerFilters to delete. Obviously that didn't work either. <br />
<br />
I've tried several cords and all my USB ports with no luck either. <br />
<br />
I went to WD's website but they don't offer anything other than a partitioner which I'd rather save as a last resort as there are several things on the HD that I'd like to save.<br />
<br />
So it's not like this is a new HD that needs to be partitioned or an old one that just crapped out. I know the data is there I just need to get at it long enough to get what I need. Maybe I missed my window but maybe I didn't. Maybe someone can help. I'm at
 my wit's end on this thing.</p>

<p>Sounds like a partition problem (maybe corrupted partition tables) if the device is recognized but the 'disk' is not.</p>
<p>There are partition recovery/repair tools about.&nbsp; Western Digital in fact have some themselves though I think they are made for internal drives.</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd start with WD and start looking for partition recovery/repair tools.&nbsp; If this is the problem then it being the right kind of problem and you using the right kind of solution can fix it all easily.</p>
<p>If not, some data recovery tools may help you recover some files even if you are forced to recreate a new partition though I wish you lots of luck with that approach!</p>
<p>Good luck whatever you try and be careful not to overwrite what partition information you do have without having made backups (many partition edititing software will offer backups)</p>

<h2>            We have Topaz BSB signature pads not recognized in virtual environment</h2>
                    <p>I'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem. Windows 7 recognizes the device. Device lights up, captures the signature and puts it on the document.</p>
<p>If you change the signature pad, the new one won't work. However, if you log in as another user that hasn't had a signature pad associated with it then the sig pad operates properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory is once a user profile has an established sig pad it won't accept another even though Windows registers the device. The program we are trying to use it with is Meridian Link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback on this issue would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Rajith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We are able to capture the signature on the first device we connect using a particular profile. The signature shows up on the device screen as well as the Meridian link application and the connected document. When we change devices the signature is captured
 by the device, but it doesn't transfer to the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, we have installed the OS in the virtual environment. We are using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The signature pads are the same models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<h2>            Control Panel&#62;Performance Information and Tools&#62;Advanced Tools - Missing item after clicking &#34;Remove from List&#34;</h2>
                    <br />
In the Windows 8 Control Panel "Performance Information and Tools" there's the option "Advanced Tools" that shows detected performance issues. (Cannot remember the name of the item.)<br />
<br />
When you click a specific item a small dialog opens summarizing the problem. One of the buttons on this dialog is "Remove from list"<br />
<br />
However when I clicked "Remove from List" it was not my intention to remove the specific option from the Advanced tools list. I remember once a notification like this&nbsp; took me to the list of start up items that would slow down my PC, when I clicked the other
 button on the small dialog box.<br />
<br />
However now this item is missing from the Advanced Tools. (Windows 8 Single Language) Only 9 items are being displayed.<b> How do I restore the missing item without Restoring the system.</b><br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to anyone who's trying to fix this problem for me.<br />

            Hi Sharief,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the prompt reply. Now I have figured out that since you also see only 9 items, may be there was some performance issue mentioned under the heading
<b>Performance issues</b> (Now it says No issues reported) and on clicking that item, the dialog box would have given me the option to remove that item from the list. Your answer made me re-think what happened.&nbsp; If I find any additional information I will let
 you know by posting here.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.<br />

<h2>            Win 8 - File Explorer &#34;green bar of death&#34; &#40;GBOD&#41;</h2>
                    I have intermittent problems when opening the file explorer in Win 8 Home Prem (64 bit) where the nav pane on the left is only populated with "Favorites", "Libraries", and "Homegroup". &nbsp;None of my drives, internal HDD, SSD, or DVD, or external HDD (USB3
 &amp; firewire) appear. &nbsp;I get the GBOD slowly progressing across the top of the window, but it never completes and no error messages are ever generated. &nbsp;I have looked in the logs and I don't see anything there either (although I don't know what I am looking
 for, so maybe I am looking in the wrong logs!)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found virtually nothing like this in these forums or by googling it. &nbsp;The closest I have come, told me to do a clean boot with everything "extraneous" disabled, did it and again the same thing, GBOD on the second opening of the file explorer. &nbsp;I
 should note that file explorer almost always works the first time or two that I open it, but if I click on too many folders/drives/etc it will inevitably not work the next time I open it. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only post I found in this forum referenced a win 7 installation, and gave a (unacceptable) work around discovered by the orig poster, that if you right-click any element in the nav pane and select "open in &nbsp;a new window", a new file explorer opens
 and the nav pane is fully populated and everything works fine... that works, BUT, as the O.P. stated, this is just a work around and his users are tired of it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW, all the time I have pecking out this posting the GBOD has been proceeding across the file explorer window, nearly reaching the end, but not quite, and still nothing new displaying in the explorer window in ANY of the panes... and no error messages,
 pop-ups, etc. &nbsp;I just have to close the window &amp; reboot, or at least now I can use the right-click work-around, but.... that's not a FIX.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some one please help!!! &nbsp;I am fairly knowledgeable techie, but the inner machinations of the OS is NOT an area I deal with regularly, so please "speak slowly, and use small words"&nbsp;</div>

            Well, at first I thought I was fixed, File explorer opens and functions normally while navigating through folders and drives, but....&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Now the File Explorer works for a few clicks, but if I try (for example) right clicking to rename a file, I get a blue-spinny and cannot even close the window, move it, resize it, anything. &nbsp;I have waited to see if it will error out, but after nearly five
 minutes I give up and have to reboot. &nbsp;This is worse than before! &nbsp;Now I cannot even do the click and open in a new window trick. &nbsp;File expoler completely locks up. &nbsp;Note, all other apps running seem to be fine and the PC in general is functioning normal,
 but File Explorer is toast until I reboot. &nbsp; ARRRGGG!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyone have any ideas...? &nbsp;TIA!</div>

            This is crazy, I can only get a few clicks in File Explorer and then a single right click and it locks up. &nbsp;I can go into Task Manager and restart it, but I still can't right click anything in there without it locking up on me. &nbsp;Sometimes it will work
 a couple times after a reboot, but once it locks up the first time that is it until I reboot again.

<br />Try this procedure.
<br />Shutdown/restart three times via power button.
<br />Then Windows recovery environment will open.

<br />Those operations have to be performed on another pc if you are stuck on this one.
<br />W7 product key is different from you W10 digital licence.
<br />W7 key is the one you used before W10

<br /> Why do you want to install W7 ??
<br />If you have problems, reinstall W10, you won't have to buy a key for W10.
<br />For W7, you would.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

<div>I have recently installed Windows 7, on my Acer Aspire 5810T laptop, and I can't use the Wlan, Lan and the Sound on the laptop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div>In device manager, the hardware adapters for the above listed functions aren't listed.</div>

<div>Is this a hardware failure, or is there a missing driver for a controller ?</div>

<h2>            How to scan and clean up errors and&#47;or corrupt files that interfere with computer operation</h2>
                    
<p>I have problems with very slow startup and shutdown and the desktop appearing with different size icons along with occasional erratic behavior and unexpected restarts that lead me to believe I probably have some errors or corrupt files.</p>
<p>The system is an E6100 Gateway recently updated from XP to Vista Home Premium with the upgrade software.</p>
<p>Is there any software out there that I can use to clean up the entire system?&nbsp;</p>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />
