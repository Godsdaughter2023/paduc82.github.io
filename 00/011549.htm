            When you set up your account (assuming you mean a Microsoft account) on these devices, they should be added automatically. I am not sure that non-Windows cellphones can be added to a MS account, I would guess not.<br />

<h2>            Log out of Outlook completely</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add my Outlook address to my Yahoo account. There is a simple method to do this, (I've done it before)&nbsp;but now it keeps telling me that I am already "logged into Outlook" and thus can't perform the necessary steps until I log out. &nbsp;I have
 tried everything to log out of Outlook (shutting down all other devices, logging off of the Outlook page repeatedly - it seems to log me back on automatically), changing my password, logging off of Skype, etc.&nbsp;But I still receive the&nbsp;message that I must "log
 out of&nbsp;Outlook.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I want to know how to log out of Outlook completely and totally in every possible place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> mbush5800  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel mac - saving tab order in locked excel spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>I have a very &nbsp;large spreadsheet that is used for data entry. &nbsp;I have the cells that are used for entry unlocked and all of the labels locked. &nbsp;But I need to change the tab order (enter data and then either TAB or ENTER key to move to next cell) so that
 it flows properly. &nbsp;I have seen VBA code to do this but I have no idea how to make it run and I have also see using named ranges but don't know how to make it run when the spreadsheet is opened to fill out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a way to do this? &nbsp;The users are very basic users and probably wont be able to remember to run a macro or select a named range. &nbsp;Just looking for an easy, fool proof way to ensure the tab order is correct.</p>
<p>

            <p>You might consider making custom input forms using VBA Userforms, which you can't make in Excel 2016 but will work if you make them in Excel 2011. You can set the tab order for userforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way would be to make input forms using dialog sheets, another thing you can't make in 2016 but if you make them in Excel 2011 they will work in 2016. I haven't made a dialog sheet in a while, but I think you might be able to specify tab order in
 dialog sheets, too.</p>

<p>Hi and Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operating system "Visa 2003" does not exist and Vista was released in 2007. Do understand that Windows Vista is no longer under Microsoft's support and will not receive any new updates for bug fixes/patches/security flaws.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting a certificate error, check the time on your PC and make sure it matches the time in the BIOS. You should also take this time and upgrade your computer and Windows ASAP.</p>

            &nbsp;if you are prompted activate Windows 10 after installation, you can use the mitigation product keys for the respective editions.
<p>For Professional edition use this: NKJFK-GPHP7-G8C3J-P6JXR-HQRJR</p>
<p>For Enterprise edition use this: PBHCJ-Q2NYD-2PX34-T2TD6-233PK</p>

</p><p>Sometimes you just have to leave it for a few days or restart a few times and it will activate.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 gaming, windows background task causing performance issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonastone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 gaming, windows background task causing performance issues.</h2>
                    So i have browsed the forum and fail to find a topic that address the exact same issue i am having, so I hope making this post here is the right thing to do and right place for it. Here goes.<br />
<br />
Ever since November 2015 when i first upgraded to the newest insider preview version of windows, i have been experiencing gaming performance issues, for the longest time i was not aware of what was causing it, but i believe i have found the culprit.<br />
<br />
I initially thought it was the windows process "windows and compressed memory" which on occasion can eat up as much as 5% of my CPU and 2GB of ram, but that seems like it would not cause the kind of performance hit i was seeing.<br />
<br />
I have ensured all of my drivers are up to date and after installing the newest AMD drivers for my GPU today, i noticed games were running much smoother, then the performance issues started about 30 minutes after i loaded the game(in this case it was Black
 Ops 3 multiplayer)<br />
<br />
I tabbed out to see a windows system process running at 16-20% CPU, Service Host: Local System (network restricted), this process looked like this&nbsp;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/4I3RfNA.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Opens Imgur, probably best to open in new tab">Windows
 task manager image</a> note the process are all windows processes from what i can tell, ending the task and jumping back into game, the fps drops were gone, for about 20 seconds until the process spooled back up, waiting for 30s to 1 min the lag goes away
 and the process is back down to 0-1% cpu usage, until it spools up again at another random interval.<br />
<br />
I have to assume its this process as nothing else is running other than what i require to play games.<br />
<br />
Is there any reason why windows would not recognise the fact i am in fullscreen gaming mode and would try to do back ground processes while i am gaming? Is there anyway to disable these functions or set them to only do what they are doing while im gaming at
 a specific time of day, when i know the PC will be free?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
System specs:-<br />
Intel i7 3770K @4.5Ghz<br />
AMD XFX7970 3GB DD/1Ghz<br />
Asus P8Z68 Vpro gen3 motherboard<br />
16GB DDR3 1600 RAM<br />
Samsung 840 series 250GB SSD (primary)<br />
1TB storage drive.<br />
1000watt 80+ bronze PSU<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.

            <p><span>Hi Jonastone,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience caused to you.
</span><span>We will help you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with system. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your System Maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel.</span></li><li>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons.</li><li>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel.</li><li><span>Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>And also refer the link below to improve the performance of the PC</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/performance-maintenance-help#performance-maintenance-help=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/performance-maintenance-help#performance-maintenance-help=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong> <span>I suggest you to check in Clean Boot state as below and install the game, check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
<strong>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong>:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>“<span>How to reset the </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span>”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Retrieving unsaved data typed into response boxes on websites</h2>
                    <p>I'm slight uncertain how to ask, so here goes.</p>
<p>Answering a message sent to me on a website. One where you're writing inside the box, basically. It was extensive and more of a letter,&nbsp;but the length wasn't a problem, just stating because of my time consumed. There is no type of auto-<span><span>save
 option of course in this type of environment. Suddenly Internet Explorer just closed [IE version 9]. There were 3 windows open when it closed. When I re-opened it, asked if I wanted to restore session; answered yes. It brought me back to the page where the
 message was sent to me, but all of my typing was gone. Please tell me it's magically stored on my computer somewhere. I know that when I clear cache and temporary files it shows immense date involved with IE. Is this a possibility? Or have I really lost an
 hour's response?</span></span></p>

The fact that it is offering to restore sessions suggests there was a crash detected.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have expected a prompt about that but I suppose it is possible to disable that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Please tell me it's magically stored on my computer somewhere. I know that when I clear cache and temporary files it shows immense date involved with IE. Is this a possibility? Or have I really lost an hour's response?</span></span></p>

<p><br />
It's gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;FWIW when I have been working on one thing for any amount of time I back it up at least by pressing Ctrl-a, Ctrl-c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that would have covered you for just the crash of an app like you had.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then&nbsp;I usually quickly start musing about the
 possibility of an OS&nbsp;crash or power failure (which would make my ClipBoard "backup" so many lost electrons) so I open a file called Draft and do a Ctrl-v, Ctrl-s&nbsp; with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

<p>I have a Zune HD 32 and an HD Dock.&nbsp; I can't seem to get video out to my tv.&nbsp; The instructions I've found haven't been very precise for my particular Zune.&nbsp; Would someone please give me step-by-step instructions for the Zune HD 32?</p>

<p>Okay, here's what worked.&nbsp; I plugged in the AC adapter (the instructions in that link you gave made it sound like that was optional for the purpose of charging the Zune while you've got it docked, but it's not -- at least not in my case -- If it's not plugged
 in the TV says "no signal" from that input).&nbsp; I turned on the Zune, went to settings, display, video output and then tapped HDMI AUTO (if I chose to use HDMI cable) or COMPOSITE-VIDEO (if I chose to use that cable).&nbsp; Then I didn't worry about tapping any ON
 button, which I couldn't find, I just set the Zune in the cradle.&nbsp; The screen goes blank and then comes back on with the message: TOUCH SCREEN TO DISABLE TV OUT.&nbsp; Then I just use the remote and go from there.</p>
<p>I still think the instructions Zune provides could make things a little clearer from the get-go, like, First plug your dock into an outlet . . . .&nbsp; I know, I know.&nbsp; I already confessed to being an idiot, but there&nbsp;are a lot of us out here!&nbsp; : )&nbsp;</p>

    <title>creating page breaks on a form so each subform will appear by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lily az  say:</h3>
<h2>            creating page breaks on a form so each subform will appear by itself on the screen</h2>
                    <p>I have created an order form with 5 subforms.&nbsp; Each subform is designed for ordering a completely different catagory of product.&nbsp; The main form is in single form view.&nbsp; Each subform is in continuous view.&nbsp; I have 5 button controls at the top of&nbsp;the main
 form which will take you to the appropriate subform so you can enter the details of you order.&nbsp; When the user is&nbsp;working in a particular subform I think it is confusing for the other subforms to be visible on the same screen.&nbsp; I have tried insert page breaks
 on the main form just above each of the subforms, but that is having no effect.&nbsp; When the user wants to enter items in subform B, I want subformB to appear with the first line directly below the main form header.&nbsp; If the user then wants to enter items in subform
 D for the same order, I want the user to click the subform D button and subform D appears at the top of the page immediately below the header.&nbsp; Also, once the user has completed entering their order&nbsp;with whichever subforms they need, I would like them to be
 able to scroll through to review all parts of their order.</p>
<p>Can this be done?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How to position cursor in field using only keyboard</h2>
                    Is there a way to position the cursor in a field for editing using only the keyboard.&nbsp; I notice when I use an arrow key to move into a field, the entire field is selected.&nbsp; Using the right arrow key to supposedly move the cursor within the field only results
 in moving to the next field.&nbsp; I would like to be able to move into a field, and then position the cursor using only the keyboard to begin editing that field, without having to use the mouse to position the cursor.

            Generally pressing F2 puts the field into "edit mode", deselecting the existing text and positioning the insertion point at the end of it.

    <title>Lots of reasons why my Nokia 5800 Xpress Music sucks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> complainer---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lots of reasons why my Nokia 5800 Xpress Music sucks</h2>
                    
<p>Hi folks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got my Nokia 5800 Xpress Music a few months back, paying a bit more than I had intended for my phone. I use the phone mostly for web browsing via wifi and as a camera. It is my first touchscreen phone, and the touchscreen is quite nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now the bad news - there are just so many problems with this phone, ranging from the trivial to the serious. I've compiled a list, so I'm posting it below for the effort. If anyone has any suggestions as to how I can fix the big issues, I'd be delighted
 to hear from you. If anyone is considering buying a Nokia 5800, then don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All comments welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complainer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Bad Stuff </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Browser</strong></p>
<p>Browser is terrible – Crashes almost every session, within 2-4 minutes of use. I tried using Opera, but that lost bookmarks after every session. I tried 'UC Browser' from the Nokia store, and that was just very hard to use. So now I use the pre-installed
 browser, and I just put up with the fact that it crashes every few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘overview’ feature to move around large pages doesn’t work for me. It seems to frequently release for no reason while I am scrolling down long pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usability of the interface about network connections is terrible. When opening up the browser first time, it first asks me ‘Connection to server needed. Connect?’, and then searches for available networks and presents a list for me to select from. There
 is no point in the first ‘connect’ question. They should simply provide a cancel option from the second dialogue, and cut out the first dialogue. This problem is made much worse by the frequent browser crashes, so I end up having to go through these dialogues
 many times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pickup of WiFi signals is variable. I often find that when I attempt to connect to my home router, the phone does not find my router. If I retry after a few seconds from the exact same location, the phone finds that router. I don’t have this problem
 with other devices at home, just this phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PC Interface</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve been unable to connect to my phone using Nokia PC Suite. This seems to be a fairly common problem, and I’ve seen other posters on the Nokia support website with similar problems. Check my profile to find my posts on this issue. I can only connect to
 the phone as a file storage device, so I can drag and drop files to/from the phone, but I can’t do the backup/restore function or other useful Nokia PC Suite or OVI suite tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The folder structure used when connecting from a PC is unnecessarily complex. When I connect, I normally want to find my recent photos or sound clips. But the directory structure that appears is very complex. To find the most recent photos, I have to go
 down 3-4 levels. If some of the photos I was were taken in a previous calendar month, these are in a different folder. Several times I have disconnected my phone, only to find that some of the photos I want are left on the phone, because they were taken in
 a previous month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I use ‘Save to contacts’ to save a number to my contact list, it prompts me for ‘Name’. It actually means ‘surname’, but it doesn’t tell me this. I have to remember to enter the surname only, and then enter the first name by editing the contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult to get a photo that works well as a wallpaper photo. For many of my photos, the menus across the top of the screen block key parts of the photo. It would be really nice if there was an option to resize the photo within the available space,
 instead of having photo blocked by the menus. When I set a photo as my wallpaper photo, it would be helpful if it was moved or flagged in some way, to remind not to delete or move the photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I switch on the phone after losing battery power, the phone does not do the little vibrate buzzer that happens when I switch on the phone at other times. Just a small inconsistency with no apparent reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘screen flip’ that occurs when I turn the screen from portrait or landscape when browsing is just too slow. It takes maybe two seconds to respond, which is quite annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The radio application that came pre-installed on the phone is unreliable. The radio gets muted out for approx three to eight seconds on a regular basis. The sound just cuts out and then comes back after a few seconds. This happens at a range of different
 locations, so it is not dependant on signal. It happens both with headphones and speaker in use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GPS facility just doesn’t seem to work for me. Again, I’ve posted this on the Nokia support site, and a few other people seem to have the same problem. I don’t have a data contract, so I don’t want the GPS to connect over the data network. But I would
 have expected that I could use the GPS when within wifi range. It seems not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Games</strong></p>
<p>The Games that come pre-installed are terrible. I’m not a real gamer, and just use games&nbsp;occasionally, just to kill time, but the ‘Bounce’ and ‘RT GR’ games do nothing for me at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Making and Receiving Calls</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When I make a call from my contacts list, it asks me to choose between video call and voice call. I’ve never made a video call in my life. I’m pretty sure that the Irish network doesn’t support it. So why do I have to choose this every time. Surely there
 could be a global setting for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I make a call, it pops up a message ‘Active Diverts’. I don’t know what this means. Why does this appear for every call? This kind of technical message just confuses the vast majority of users, and creates a barrier between users and the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no facility to set up a group logo for a contacts group. This facility used to exist on a previous Nokia phone, and was very handy for quickly distinguishing between family/work/club contacts. There is group ring tone, but no logo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Good Stuff</span></strong></p>
<p>Camera quality is great – I particularly like that the automatic rotation of video clips, depending on what way I hold the camera when shooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The photo viewer is nice, with good zoom capability and easy flicking to next or last photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The speech synthesiser which announces incoming calls is great, particularly when I’m cycling or driving.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you should update to the latest firmware if you're not on v51.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browsing:</p>
<p>Depending on the version, Opera browser does crash or freeze or a bunch of other issues. However, Opera 10.1 beta 2 is working very well. Make sure this is the version you are using. If you are still experiencing issues (and not loading a huge, data hungry
 website), I recommend soft resetting the phone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions. I've installed that Opera browser, and it does seem to be remembering my bookmarks and start page settings so far, so that's a good start. It did crash once on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re, the wifi - it's not so much that I'm expecting brilliant performance. I'm expecting consistent performance. Why does it not see the network one minute, and then see my wifi network a minute later, in the same location?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like I'm stuck in firmware upgrade hell. I tried installing and running the Nokia Software updater, but that isn't seeing my phone - presumably for the same reason that Nokia PC Suite can't see my phone. I tried updating on the phone via *#0000#
 - that is trying to connect via a data connection, which I don't have - so it is failing. I tried setting up a new server profile using the details on&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/41776A85-06D3-4661-A035-B163668C738D">this
 thread</a>, but it won't let me save a server profile with server ID of Nokia, telling me that a server profile already exists with this ID, even though there is no other profile visible on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really shouldn't be this hard&nbsp;:smileymad: I'll try the Software Updater from a laptop in work tomorrow, and see if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other comments and suggestions welcome.</p>

            1. You can remove the prompts on the browser whenever you use it by editing its settings to simply automatically connect, but that would divert it to your mobile connection. Furthermore, it seems that your stuck on old firmware, and all your browser issues
 arent present on mine with the latest firmware.<br />
<br />
2. I use Ovi Suite. Transferring photos from phone to PC takes one click.<br />
<br />
3. Saving to surname in contacts AFAIK happens when the contacts are saved to SIM. I dont know about you, but whenever I save contacts, the phone always gives me both the first name and last name fields to fill up.<br />
<br />
4. Screen rotation would take variable time depending on your current RAM usage on the phone. The less RAM you have free, the slower it takes.<br />
<br />
5. If you are not using the A-GPS function on the GPS, it would take like a day of getting the first ever fix before you can use it. Many people who use the phone without A-GPS and network connections needed to leave the phone on a windowsill overnight just
 to get the first fix and have the phone be able to acquire GPS signals in under 5-10min. There are also a lot more quirks in using the GPS without network connection.<br />
<br />
6. As for games, that's why Ovi Store exists.<br />
<br />
7. In making a call, simply highlight the number you want to call and hit the green button. It would make a voice call immediately.<br />
<br />
8. Active diverts would likely mean a network setting on your SIM, where the numbers calling you while you are on the phone are diverted to somewhere like a voice mail box. It has nothing to do with your phone itself.<br />

<p>The firmware does indeed seem to be the big problem. I managed to install Ovi on a work laptop and connected to my phone from there. I did the firmware upgrade, and the browser is much, much more stable as a result. It doesn't crash, or at least, hasn't
 crashed over a few days of fairly steady usage. The unnecessary prompts on connecting are still there, and I don't have the opportunity to use settings to avoid these, as I use wifi networks, and not the GSM data network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is now a new problem with the browser interface. The newer version of the browser has an auto-hide feature, so that after a second or two, it hides the browser controls, and leaves an arrow superimposed over the bottom right of the webpage. To
 get at the browser controls, you have to hit the arrow first. So know, I have to hit this arrow for every single operation within the browser. To do a simple 'back' to previous page, I now have to hit the arrow, and then back. To get to my bookmarks, I have
 to hit the arrow, then the menu, and then bookmarks.I shudder to think how many extra clicks on this arrow I will be making on this phone over its lifetime of use. I can see that for some people, it might be useful to dedicate that extra space to displaying
 webpage instead of control. For me, I'd far prefer to have the controls, but I don't see any setting to switch off the auto-hide feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also has some problems with clicking links on some webpages, particularly Flickr. It basically seems to ignore quite a lot of clicks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'll be able to use OVI in work now, so the single click transfer will be great. I'll try reinstalling OVI or PC Suite at home, and see if the firmware upgrade has fixed the problem with connecting in PC Suite mode from home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation. I've changed my setting to save to phone, not to SIM. So I now get prompted for forename/surname for new contacts. Still, they could easily have prevented this.</p>

<p>Thanks. Leaving it overnight seemed to work, so at least now I'm able to track my location on Google Maps. There does indeed seem to be a few more quirks there, so I'll need to spend a bit of time to understand what works or what doesn't work for me here.</p>

<p>Yes and now. Yes, this is a network setting, but it's not true to say that the message has nothing to do with the phone. Somewhere in the phone OS, somebody has written a bit of code that says something like "If this network setting is on, then display 'active
 diverts'". This is classic tech-centered approach, and is a long way off the kind of user-centered design that Nokia often boasts about. They are displaying a meaningless error message to users, and this is what creates barriers between users and their technology.</p>

            1. Well, that's the new browser. I would suggest you use Opera Mini instead. Doesnt have flash, but if you dont need flash, its really great. I use it like 90% of the time over the default browser, especially since it has tabbed browsing.<br />
<br />
2. I am not sure how they could easily prevented the saving to surname part, since the SIM memory on reads one line for names, unlike phone memory which reads multiple lines. The only difference that could have been done was for SIM memory contact names to
 be read as first names instead of last names.<br />
<br />
3. For RAM usage, try RAMBlow from Ovi Store. I cant remember if there is a free lite version, as I am using Memcheck, which you cant install if you dont know how to sign apps (If you do, go ahead and search for it). On around 30mb free RAM (I have a number
 of background apps running), screen rotation takes usually less than a sec, I also have theme effects turned off.<br />
<br />
4. Google Maps uses an internet connection, so I would suggest you use Ovi Maps. Its free anyway. Basically the onboard GPS would only be able to retrieve your location within 10min if you opened it less than 5km from where you last closed it. Greater than
 that, It would take anywhere from 15min to 1hr or even more before it gets a fix.<br />
<br />
5. I am not sure about you, but I like knowing if my calls are getting diverted to voice mail or somewhere. Its a matter of preference.

<p>Hi Marcelito,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 has a feature that enables you to use your desired language on your applications. If you don't want to permanently change the language, but instead want to switch back and forth between languages or edit documents in multiple languages, Office
 lets you do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two methods to have Office applications on a different language. Kindly check the articles below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <em><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Language-Accessory-Pack-for-Office-82ee1236-0f9a-45ee-9c72-05b026ee809f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install a Language Accessory Pack.</a></em></p>
<p>This will change the language of the Office User Interface (ribbon, menu items and commands), change the Office Help language, or add proofing tools for another language while keeping your default Office language.</p>
<p>Under Windows 10, select your preferred language and click <strong>Download. </strong>
Check your Windows system type (32-bit/ 64-bit) through this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and see <em>system type</em> on your Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-or-permanently-change-the-language-of-your-Office-installation-f5c54ff9-a6fa-4348-a43c-760e7ef148f8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Uninstall Office with Control Panel and install in a different language.</em></a></p>
<p>To change your Office 365 language is by installing it in a different language. Proceed to the section of the article that says<em> Uninstall Office with Control Panel and install in a different language</em> and follow the steps under Windows 10. We recommend
 that you <span>use the easy fix tool to completely remove Office from your computer. Refer to the section that says
</span><em>Uninstall and then reinstall Office.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us with the results.</p>

                    I've had this error for a few hours now, I assumed it was a temporary server issue but now I'm unsure. Here is the error: "You don't have permission to access "/D/6864/193170/000/sslcachekey.bayw.mail.live.com/" on this server."<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the reason is for this so I thought I'd post and ask for help here.<br />

There does however seem to be an increase in the number of people reporting this. &nbsp;It is fairly obvious there is a problem with&nbsp;Access Denied You don't have permission to access "/D/864/193170/000/sslcachekey.bayw.mail.live.com/default.aspx" on this server.<br />

            It appears to have resolved itself for the time being, I just cleared my cookies and cache, whether or not that fixed it or if it was just a coincidence in timing, it seems to be working now.<br />

Thank you for the response, however, and I shall do that if it happens again, where can I locate the status page in order to report it just in case?<br />

    <title>TempVars Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerryd_861  say:</h3>
<h2>            TempVars Question</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I'm having trouble getting TempVars to work. Maybe I'm just not understanding the syntax correctly, or TempVars can't do what I want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Forms. On Exit from the first Form, just before control is passed to open the second Form, I execute this Macro:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SetTempVar</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Name Label_Var</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then following the instructions I read on a different site, I replaced the Control Source name on the second Form with Label_Var. The second Form opens, but there's nothing in the control that should contain the TempVar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another way to do this? Am I doing something wrong? I just want the value that's in the Control on the first Form to show up in the corresponding Control on the second Form, and I was under the impression that using TempVars was the was to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            One way would be to use a macro triggered on open 2nd form (first not closed) to SET VALUE in 2nd form and then close first form.

            <p>Nope, afraid not. Got an ugly error (2950) which I don't even understand, but I think it has something to do with the fact that you can't use SetValue to set the value of a control on one form to the control on another form. I think it wants you to set the
 value of a control to a literal string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, according to what I've read and understood, you shouldn't have to use SetValue. The TempVars is supposed to make a variable available across all Forms as long as the variable exists. So, my question continues to be a very basic one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a control on one Form called Hdr_Label, how do I create a TempVar that contains the value of Hdr_Label on the first form?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then, how do I access the value of that TempVar to populate the control on the second form called Dtl_Label?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first Form, shouldn't I just be able to code: TempVars!LabelVar!Hdr_Label?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the on the second Form, code: Dtl_Label!TempVars!LabelVar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I've got the syntax mixed up, but everything I've read indicates that once you set a TempVars, it's available across the board until it's removed. So how do I set a TempVars on the first Form based on a Control value, and then use that TempVars to
 populate the Control value on the second form? I should think there would be a simple way to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nice try, but this simply doesn't work. It puts up a message box. I'm not trying to populate a message box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been struggling with this for over a week now, and to be honest, I'm about to abandon the whole project over this. This should be such a simple thing to accomplish. I can't believe Access has no way of doing it. Yet every reply I've gotten to my question
 has offered solutions that either don't work or are simply unrelated to what I need to do, and nothing I've tried works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me explain this one more time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Form. The Form has a Control on it called <strong>HdrLabel&nbsp;</strong>which is bound to the same field name in the underlying Table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on exiting the Form, I have a macro: SetTempVar</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Name &nbsp;Label_Var</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expression [Forms]![New_Entry]![HdrLabel]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then open a second Form which has a Control on it called <strong>DtlLabel</strong>. That Control is bound to the same field name in its underlying table. But the two fields/controls need to contain the same value because each is the primary key and the
 two files are linked by that key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, when the second Form opens, I don't want the users to have to type in the Label id again, because they could make a mistake and foul things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>HdrLabel</strong> Control from the first Form needs to simply be populated in the
<strong>DtlLabel</strong> Control on the second Form. I don't know why this is so difficult. But no one seems to know how to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of times, something I did caused the program to blow up with an error, which was a good thing, because when I clicked on Debug, I was able to hover my cursor over the TempVar value coming into the second Form from the first Form, and it was there
 and correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is not with setting the TempVar on an Event on the first Form. It's getting that TempVar to appear in the Control on the second Form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I just can't believe Access has some very simple way to do this. I mean it's like Programming 101. And yet no one has been able to provide an example of code that actually works.</p>

            <p>This is from <strong><span><span>SetValue Macro Action</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
Example
Set the value of a control by using a macro
</p><p>The following macro opens the Add Products form from a button on the Suppliers form. It shows the use of the
<strong>Echo</strong>, <strong>Close</strong>, <strong>OpenForm</strong>, <strong>
SetValue</strong>, and <strong>GoToControl</strong> actions. The <strong>SetValue</strong> action sets the SupplierID control on the Products form to the current supplier on the Suppliers form. The
<strong>GoToControl</strong> action then moves the focus to the CategoryID field, where you can begin to enter data for the new product. This macro should be attached to the Add Products button on the Suppliers form.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Karl. Please, no disrespect intended, but something I find intriguing, if not amusing, is the lengthy, labyrinthine, convoluted solutions developers come up with for something that is very basic and should be very simple. To kill a fly, one needs
 a fly swatter, not an arsenal of nuclear weapons. I may be new to Access, but I'm not new to programming. I spent 25 years as a professional applications programmer for a number of major corporations, working in a mainframe environment, and even though the
 programming languages we wrote it were not Access, I have a comprehensive understanding of database structure, program design and flow, and how all programming languages process data. And I know when something should be really simple to accomplish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is by way of telling you, and anyone else reading this, that I stumbled on a solution to the problem which is so direct and simple, you're going to be amazed when I share with you what it is. I won't claim that it's the only way to do it, or
 even the right or best practices way to do it, but I can tell you that it works every time and like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You Set whatever TempVars you want in your initial Form. Then in your second Form, the one in which you want your TempVar to populate a Control on your second Form, no Event code or Macro is required. You simply click on the Control you want to populate,
 open its Property Sheet, and put your TempVar in the Control's Default Value. It works perfectly. Every time you open the second Form, whatever was in the value of the TempVar from the first Form is automatically in the Control on the second Form. Period.
 End of story.</p>

            <p>Jerry, </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, nowhere in this thread did you mention instantiating the Tempvar. Before you can assign a value to a Tempvar it needs to be instantied using:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tempvars.Add tempvarname&nbsp;"value"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you&nbsp;do that somewhere before opening Form 1? Again, there was no mention of it so I wonder if you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have recommended setting the default value of a control on a number of occasions. just because it requires no code. Usually, I use a reference to the value on the calling form, but a Tempvar is a good choice since it makes it independent of the
 calling form. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is another option here, that of a subform. It sounds like you&nbsp;are trying to populate a foreign key, so use of&nbsp;subform is another option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would explain more about what you are trying to accomplish rather than just the specific question we might be able to help further.</p>

            <p>Scott, what I was trying to accomplish has been accomplished. Yes, of course, I set my Tempvar on Exit from my first Form. And I never remove it. Each time an entry is made on the first Form, it refreshes the TempVar value with whatever the user typed into
 the Label Control on the screen. Then, as I explained, in second Form, I simply put the TempVar I created into the Default Value for the Control I want to be populated with the value that's in the TempVar coming from the first Form. I'm sure there's probably
 some other way to do it, but everyone who replied to my original question gave me complicated solutions, none of which worked. I'm sure you're familiar with the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid. That's my philosophy and approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a SubForm, yes, I'm familiar with the technique, and I even have one further down the line in the application flow, but to use a SubForm to solve the specific issue I was having would (1) have required me to re-design two separate Forms I had already
 spent a lot of time working on and making look just right; and (2) again, it's taking a more complicated route to do something really simple. I've never encountered a programming language before (at least one that's worth anything) that doesn't have a very
 direct and easy way of passing values as parms from Point A to Point B in a program stack or flow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some reading about the OpenArgs in Access, but from what I understand, it's limited in its capability of passing only a single parameter. It can be "fooled" into passing multiple parms, but only by concatenating them into a string, and then, of
 course, once they're passed, having to figure out how to break them apart into their individual components in order to use them. Again, that just adds unnecessary complexity to something that ought to be simple. But then Access is not exactly the type of high-level,
 robust programming language that a major corporation would rely on for its business critical applications. Perhaps in the next version of Access, Microsoft will beef up the parm-passing functionality.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Of course not, but this does show how&nbsp;a TempVar variable can be set in one form, then read in another, which as I understand it was one of the things you were struggling with, when you wrote "The second Form opens, but there's nothing in the control that
 should contain the TempVar."</p>
