<h2>            Outlook 2016 Send an email message with a follow-up reminder for yourself is not working</h2>
                    <p>The feature in Outlook 2016 that sends an email message with a follow-up reminder for yourself is not working correctly.&nbsp; I've done this for years and just recently is hasn't been working correctly.&nbsp; Now when I flag the message I'm composing with a follow
 up for yourself, after I send it Outlook automatically changes it to "Recipient Received: Follow Up."&nbsp; The flag doesn't show up in my To-Do List.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the action I'm doing for Flag for Yourself, but after I send it Outlook after a few seconds changes the sent message to Flag for Recipient:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Send-an-email-message-with-a-follow-up-reminder-740a3b9e-e837-4711-938a-08dd0ea5ac64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can actually see it changing in my outbox after a few seconds.</p>

            The repair didn't fix the issue.&nbsp; Then I uninstalled and reinstalled Office 365, and the issue still exists.

            <p>I am having the same problem, on a couple PCs (a desktop and a laptop), both are running the current Threshold production build 10586.218.&nbsp; Both machines have ample RAM and free space on the hard drive.&nbsp; I have tried shutting down all non-Microsoft services
 in msconfig, running the Windows Update Troubleshooter, manually clearing the update services, and running the WuReset.bat (all of which have been mentioned as possible fixes on various MS support blogs).&nbsp; Also, for the last couple of tries, it gets stuck
 at 32% install, after it has downloaded the update (where it currently sits, I waited at 32% for over 12 hours last attempt).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; This time it only lasted at 32% for about an hour, then it proceeded to the restart screen.&nbsp; After the reboot and installation,
<strong>all is working well now, in 14332</strong>.&nbsp; The latest round of steps I took were as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Run Troubleshooting,&nbsp;View all, run Windows Update as administrator, let it fix anything it finds.</li><li>Go to Settings/Update, Advanced options, uncheck Give me updates for other MS products, Choose how updates are delivered, turn off Updates from more than one place.</li><li>Run msconfig, Selective Startup, uncheck Load startup items, Services tab, check Hide all Microsoft services, Disable all, OK</li><li>Reboot, and try to update again.&nbsp; If it successfully installs, or if you decide to give up for a while, remember to run msconfig again, and set it back to Normal Startup with your other services (otherwise you may be missing some important antivirus or
 other services).</li></ol>
<p>I'm not sure which of these made a difference, as I could swear that I had tried these before.&nbsp; Perhaps there was a bug on the server side, which has now been rectified.</p>

<h2>            How to connect Remote Desktop in Windows Mobile 6.5 to W7 server behind router</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm struggling to set up a Remote Desktop connection from a Windows Mobile 6.5 device to a Windows 7 server hiding behind a router (Port 3389 forwarded).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a Mobile Remote Desktop Client issue because</p>
<ul>
<li>The remote desktop connection works fine when accessed from another PC (W7 or XP) whether through the LAN (192.168.x.x) or the external IP 188.220.xxx.yyy but all I get on the WM6,5 device is Status Connecting . . .<br />
</li><li>The connection from the WM6.,5 device to the server is fine because if I type the server external IP address into the WM6.5 browser, I get a web page with the servers published webapps.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find Remote Desktop on the device or a download a version specific to WM6.5 so I downloaded RD6.1 which posts say works with WM6.5<br />
<br />
In the screen where you fill in the connection details I've tried <br />
the external IP address of the router 188.220.xxx.yyy<br />
the external IP address of the router 188.220.xxx.yyy:3389<br />
the dynamicDNS name of the router.<br />
and in all cases all I get is the message 'connecting'<br />
<br />
and I've tried it with wifi connected to the routers external IP and also my neighbour's wifi.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing?<br />
</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with the Junk Mail Reporting via SNDS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have listed all my IP's and i can see a couple are being blocked</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to sign up for Junk Mail Reporting it asks for name email etc. I do this and says i have joined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after about 10 minutes i click on Junk Mail Reporting and it asks for the same information again and to join</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried in firefox, chrome and Edge with the same issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work a few years back</p>
<p>
</p><p>I submitted an email to <span>Sender Information for Outlook.com Delivery</span></p>
<p><span>i received an email back today with just the IP's on it with nothing else</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am a web host and a couple of IP's have made it onto your block list. This used to be a pretty simple thing but with your JMR system not working what are we supposed to do?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also i can not find a category that fits this issue. Come on Microsoft....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>

<p>Hi Manfred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why this issue happened. It could be due to the add-ins installed on the Office application or conflict from the antivirus that's being used on both devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you also tried performing safe mode? Click this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow
 the steps on how to start your Office applications in safe mode. Check first in Word or in Excel. If the issue does not occur in safe mode, disable the application add-ins and COM add-ins one at a time to check which add-in causes the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which antivirus software are you using? Check it's settings to verify if it causes the issue or if it's conflicting the security patch.
</p>

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. Yes we started both Word and Excel in safe mode. Checked on the add-ins - only default Microsoft Office add-ins were enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Symantec Endpoint Protection v14 and yes it is reporting: "Product Error requires attention" and the SEP system tray icon to report "There are multiple problems (2)".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later today I followed the troubleshooting guide from the support.office.com website.</p>
<p>1. Attempt to disable any add-ins with easy fix tool (again only the default office add-ins were enabled</p>
<p>2. Uninstalled office with o15-ctrremove.diagcab (downloaded from the website)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will download and run "OffCat" tomorrow and will get back to you with more details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Manfred</p>

<p>Hello Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran "OffCat" I got the message: Office 2016.....is not the latest version. When I checked the&nbsp;update status before it was telling me it was up to date. Anyway I now preformed the update and "OffCat" didn't report issues. Can't attached screenshots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After working with a fresh installed Office 2016 for a short while it's crashing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled&nbsp;Symantec Endpoint Protection and enabled Microsoft Defender. I ran a full scan of the computer - no Viruses found!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What else can we do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>Hi Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a clean boot and have asked my customer to work with Excel/Word using the same files it was crashing with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the event logs and found several error messages before I started in clean boot.</p>
<p>Here a snapshot: Event 1000, Application Error</p>
<p>Faulting application name: EXCEL.EXE, version: 16.0.8827.2148</p>
<p>Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version: 10.0.16299.15</p>

<p>Fault offset: 0x001349b5</p>
<p>Faulting process id: 0x958</p>
<p>etc.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My customer told me Outlook is crashing as well! Not just Excel and Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I upload the event logs? </p>

<p>Hello Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the SFC and DISM tool. No errors were found! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered the issues might be linked to my clients NAS device. My client is using a Synology NAS server that had problems with its network connection. It was dropping the connection randomly.&nbsp;With a Word or Excel file open, it crashed when my client was
 trying&nbsp;to access or save the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mapped file share was not lost when the network connection dropped for a few seconds. Question does Microsoft Office not cache open files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Column headers in pivot tables&#47;graphs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckblechle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Column headers in pivot tables&#47;graphs</h2>
                    When you create a pivot table it adds the function you have done to the data to the data name in the pivot table eg. the source data name is "labor cost" but the name of the data in the pivot table becomes "sum of labor cost". How can i get excel to stop
 modifying the data name when i create the table? If that is not possible how can i get a pivot graph to use the actual source data name instead of the pivot table name for that data eg "labor cost" not "sum of labor cost"?

<p>First you can't stop Excel from giving the field the name Sum of.&nbsp; So where do you change the name? You can type it right over the name in the pivot table, usually the top left corner cell.&nbsp; Or you can right click the field in the pivot table and choose
 Value Field Setting and edit the Custom Name box.&nbsp; Follow Luke's suggestions regarding names.&nbsp; For example change Sum of Labor Cost to Labor Costs.</p>

            <span>One way would be to delete the axis altogether or use a Custom Number format like ;;;<br />
Then setup a manual set of cells with the 0 K 1 2 3 4 etc. which would be located behind the chart and then resemble the Axis Labels<br />
or<br />
Setup a Text Box/es with the same Sequence 0 K 1 2 3 4 etc. and place that where the axis would be<br />
Once properly located and sized, The Text Box could be grouped with the chart so that they remain fixed to each other</span>

            Can not see a way to actively delete custom number format. <br />
But if you stop using the format and then restart Excel and open the workbook it appears to cleanse itself.<br />

            <p>Yes it is the built in app for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account was signed in but it would not sync to my online OneDrive account nor the OneNote 2013 program I also have on the computer (which syncs to OneDrive just fine). I tried to find the files on my computer that would be backing up from the Windows
 10 app but there were no options (that I could find) to trace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for future solutions, I re-synced my 2013 notebook with the last backup saved and then synced that notebook to the app. From there, I copied/pasted the newer notes that stopped syncing into the app to that notebook and that seemed to solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just weird that it stopped working in the first place; is there a place to find the backups from the app?</p>

    <title>Music stops playing on MS Surface when screen turns off. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Music stops playing on MS Surface when screen turns off.</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Surface.&nbsp;I have my mp3's in my default Music folder.&nbsp;When I play an album,&nbsp;a song will play but it will&nbsp;not play the next song if the screen has turned off. I always need to hit the power button again to turn the screen back on in order
 to play the next song. This makes this&nbsp;device useless as a music player as I have to turn it back on every few minutes.&nbsp;Often the song will start skipping as well when the screen turns off. This is for the Music app but also any other music playing apps I've
 tried such as Music Info. And please don't tell me this is by design. It is not by design. It's a bug. It would be nice to know when this will be resolved. Playing an MP3 is a basic function that should just work out of the box. It really can't be that hard.
 If a $30 mp3 player can do it I sure expect my $700 tablet to.

            Greetings Gglazer,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you've having and issue with the music app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When your Surface is playing audio, the screen goes to sleep, and the song/track ends, how long do you wait to press the power button to turn the screen back on?<br />
Does the next track start playing if you wait 2-3 minutes?<br />
How often would you say the audio starts skipping once the screen goes to sleep?
        </p>

            Thank you for the reply. I've waited varying amounts of time. Probably close to a half hour at the longest. It does not try to play the next song until I wake up the Surface by pressing the power button. Now as a&nbsp;habit, i'll just reach over and turn it
 back on when i see it turn off out of the corner of my eye so I can keep the playback consistent. The audio skipping is a lot less than when I first received it when the until was released. When it happens a song will be playing and when the screen goes black
 and shortly after the skipping/distorted effect starts. When turning the screen back on the song resumes normal playback shortly after.&nbsp;

            i know not a complete answer, but one option is to stop the screen from going to sleep and maybe turning the brightness way down so it doesn't completely kill the battery.&nbsp; So, how to keep the screen from going blank since if you have your Surface synced
 to Exchange, it overrides your settings and sets it to how your office has it set (10 mins for me).&nbsp; If you press the Windows key- X if gets you to a menu of tools.&nbsp; Select Mobility Center and then in the dialog that appears turn Presentation Settings to ON.&nbsp;
 While this is on, your screen will stay on forever.&nbsp; Again, they need to fix this bug (although i don't have this happen when listening to music with xbox music, just with 3rd party apps), but it makes it so we can listen with other, better apps, until they
 fix this.

Have you tried using Ray's suggestion of using the&nbsp;Presentation&nbsp;settings?&nbsp;
<div><br />
For now, using Presentation mode or leaving the screen on, may be your best work around.

            I am having this issue on my surface pro with xbox music. flip the touch cover over the screen and playback will stop within 5 seconds. leaving the screen on is a very short term workaround. Is there a community visible bug tracking/reporting system where
 we can see the status of this sort of minor but frustrating usability defects?

            As a more effective work around I can recommend using Start-P to switch to second screen only if you have a keyboard attached. Start-P again will restore the display.

            <p>I have the Surface Pro with iTunes installed and I don't have this problem.&nbsp; With iTunes, the music will continue to play after the screen times out.&nbsp; This happens whether or not the keyboard is attached.&nbsp; If I have the keyboard attached, I can flip it back
 away from the screen and I can still listen to music when the screen times out.&nbsp; This works great when on a plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only time the music stops is if I flip the keyboard over the screen which then puts the Pro to sleep as designed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't tried with music in the Music folder.&nbsp; I will test this soon.</p>

            I am seeing this with various&nbsp;Windows 8 devices (I have&nbsp;a Surface Pro, a Dell PC and HP Laptop)&nbsp;with all the music apps I have used - the Win8 Music app, Zune, Pandora, I-Heart-Radio, etc. Screen goes to sleep, music stops. Screen wakes up, music resumes.
 I tried setting the PC to never sleep, so it only the screen that is sleeping.

<h2>            ATP - Alert Policies for detected security events</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
we have office 365 Enterprise E3 subscription with ATP as add-on.&nbsp;<br />
we have configured a policy for safe attachments with 'Replace' option (Block the attachments with detected malware, continue to deliver the message), and applied to all the domains available in our directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have also configured alert policies, to get alert triggered once a malware file detected in a mail message.&nbsp;<br />
but still no alerts generated in the dashboard under security&amp;compliance - view alerts section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>we disabled all our policies and enabled again the default policies supplied by Microsoft office 365.<br />
<br />
we test it, using a malware file (from own) in a mail message sent by an external user.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
the current issue is, the mail delayed for a time and once we have a detection event in the dashboard under Threat Management, security alerts still not generated and shown.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
can you please guide us, or give us the best practice to define a policy for alerts.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5310 problems uploading firmware</h2>
                    Evening all,<br />
<br />
After a long day trying to update my phone, I offically throw in the towel.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled nsu /reinstalled too many times to count, tried the majority of fixes proposed in the discussions. Removed batteries, had my phone freeze too many times.<br />
<br />
Anyone got a quick fix to this, I really am tired of fighting it.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            I also have the same problem in my Vista machine. The fone just hangs and the progress indicator of the Nokia Updater doesn't move from 15%. It's very frustrating. I hope Nokia address this glitch. I'm want the damn update badly!

    <title>Excel 2010 Data Bars Not the Correct Length - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banditob1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 Data Bars Not the Correct Length</h2>
                    <p>I'm having some problems with data bars that I hope someone can explain to me. &nbsp;This may get a bit long, so please bear with me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a worksheet with a column containing percentages that represent the level of completion of some tasks. &nbsp;They begin as all zeroes and I select the range of cells and apply Conditional Formatting--&gt;Data Bars--&gt;Gradient Fill, Green Bars. &nbsp;Everything
 is good so far, with no bars showing in the percentage cells. &nbsp;Now, if I change one of the cells to 10%, the data bar appears, but instead of filling up 10% of the space for the cell, it fills up 100%. &nbsp;Hmm, "Strange," I think to myself. &nbsp;So I change another
 0% to 50% and the 50% cell's data bar fills it completely and the 10% cell data bar shrinks a bit, but is still clearly more than 10% of its cell width. &nbsp;So, they appear to interact. &nbsp;I enter 100% into a cell, and then the 10% and 50% cells now look correct
 and the 100% cell is completely filled. &nbsp;Just for the heck of it, I change another cell to 200% and it becomes full and all the other data bars adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I investigate a bit further and find that the data bars' default setting for minimum and maximum values is set to Automatic, so the above behavior begins to make some sense. &nbsp;So, I change the rule's default from Automatic to Percent, which sets minimum to
 0 and maximum to 100. &nbsp;So, I think, that will correct the behavior and I'll get what I want; 10% will have a 10% bar and 50% will have a 50% bar as expected, and the values will no longer be dependent upon one another. &nbsp;But no, this is not what happens. &nbsp;The
 behavior remains the same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I try setting the rule to Number and enter a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. &nbsp;Now, I get the behavior that I wanted all along. &nbsp;It's not the way I probably would have designed it, but at least I now know how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I go back to my workbook and select another sheet where all values are 0% except for one, which is 70%. &nbsp;I apply the Conditional Formatting to create the data bars, and&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without</span></strong> changing
 any settings (everything is still at the default of Automatic), the 70% bar fills only 70% of the cell width. &nbsp;What??? &nbsp;Why are data bars behaving differently on this worksheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I check another worksheet that already has data bars applied and it looks generally okay (it has some cells with a maximum of 100% in them), but I notice that two adjacent cells--one above the other--both are at 95%, but one fills the entire cell
 width and the other fills about 95% as it should. &nbsp;I monkeyed around with various settings to try to correct the 95% cell that was 100% filled, but could find nothing that would correct the issue. &nbsp;I finally cleared all conditional formatting from the sheet
 and reapplied the data bars and that corrected the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in summary, I'm seeing inconsistent behavior with data bars; sometimes they work as expected where 70% amongst other values of 0% shows up as 70% filled and sometimes shows up as 100% filled unless there is at least one other value that is set to 100%.
 &nbsp;Also, in the third and final case, it appears that they can somehow get corrupted such that almost anything can happen. &nbsp;Is what I'm seeing normal with data bars? &nbsp;Which behavior should they have: &nbsp;the initial behavior where they're dependent on the maximum
 value or the second behavior where the data bars act independently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any input those of you with more experience may be able to provide!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;I am running this on a Dell laptop with Windows 7 Enterprise and SP2 as well as Office 2010 with SP2, so I should be up-to-date with all patches, etc.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem and tried many different approaches to make it work as it should. Without success!! When you select percent, even when you select 0 and 100 as the min and max, the highest value of the series still shows a full bar. There are some
 workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Add a dummy cell to the range, enter 100% as the value and the rest of the data bars should be at the correct length. Downside is you have a dummy cell in your table. (Unless you hide it in a discrete location)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Better solution is to edit the conditional formatting rule, change the minimum type to number and value to 0 (zero), then change the maximum type also to number with a value of 1. That should fix the issue.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem and may have found a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you select the data you want to add databars to, enter 0% and 100% in any random cells, and include these in your range. You can then add the databars without needing to the use 'more rules' section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me as Excel always fills up the data bar with min and max values, therefore if you enter 0% and 100%, these will automatically be your highest and lowest values.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 License Renewal Scam</h2>
                    A computer tech told me I needed to pay $299 to renew my license for Windows 7. &nbsp;He said when I bought the computer the license was usually only good for 3 to 5 years. &nbsp;He told me that some of the features had been stopped because my license was expired
 and it made my computer run slow and in a very short time my computer would crash. &nbsp;I do not buy it. &nbsp;It sounds fishy to me, what do you think?

<p>It's a SCAM. There are all sorts of those Tech Support Scams. There are phone scams, email scams and browser popup scams. Which type was the one that tried to scam you? Someone called claiming to be Microsoft? MS will never contact anyone unsolicited by
 any means!</p>

</p><p>I have taken my phone to two mainline stores (one claiming to be a Windows Phone expert, and we have tried everything including deleting the account that is causing the problem and the other account as well. We still end up with the same error message.</p>

</p><p>The two stores said thay have never come across this issue before, and don't have any idea how to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on refresh it seems to do exactly that. I am able to receive and send emails with no problems. Just this annoying message keeps popping up each time I select refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only suggestion was "I reset the phone back to the default settings", I did this once before and it took me two days to get all my settings correct. I would not want to do this again. Would a possible future update solve this issue?</p>

<p>His phone now shows "<strong>Last updated 29 days ago</strong>" (as on 010916)</p>

</p><p>Hi Sam,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's work on this together. <br />
<br />
Just to confirm, what email account are you trying to add on your phone?<br />
<br />
Also, do you happen to recall the first time that the erro messgae showed up? Is there anything that you installed on your phone recently prior to getting this error?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

            Hi Billy,
<p>I had two accounts (POP3/SMTP) business accounts with Demon/Vodaphone and another with 34SP that’s an IMAP.</p>
<p>I have a Windows 10PC,<span>&nbsp; </span>that did run Office 2010 and Outlook main and Calendar. Due to MS changes with OneDrive I signed up for Office 365 that now includes the later version of MS Outlook, this gives me up to 10 devices that can run Office
 365 (currently this is on my PC my phone and my wife’s phone and a little used Toshiba laptop. We started to use Office 365 early in July 2016.</p>
<p>My Phone is a MS Windows 950XL and my wife’s is a 950.<span>&nbsp; </span>We both use EE for our phone accounts.</p>
<p>The first time I got the error message was 30days ago (as on 030816) We have had so many updates with our phones it's difficult to be specific about dates.</p>
<p>I have always recorded dates on my Outlook Calendar, but this new version seems to delete them after a few days so all my records are disappearing, it's really annoying. I can no longer get my phone to synchronise with my PC which is causing me a great deal
 of problems.</p>

fact: I purchased a Reba album and can play it on my PC without Groove...but this article says I can sync my PC with other device like phone, tablet and Xbox....I'm lead to believe I can cancel the Groove subscription and still have and play music I purchased
 only on my PC which is fine with me...I did sync the music with all my Windows 10 computers through the trial version of Groove...the question remains do I need Groove to keep the purchase or to sync other purchases pass the trail period ?...I can see a problem
 with not subscribing ..."trial and error" seems to be my only choice...

            <p>Groove is a muti-faceted music store/player. You bought an album, so you have the rights to do anything with that you want, with or without Groove. You can burn it to a CD, copy it to another computer, etc. I assume it is in MP3 format so zero "DRM" to contend
 with down the road. </p>
<p>Groove is also a music subscription/rental system. The songs you download to a device (this is where there is a limit to devices---ONLY in downloading) are good as long as you keep up the subscription. Stop paying and the license expires, leaving you with
 a bunch of files that won't play (there are utilities to clean them off your computer).</p>
<p>Groove can also stream your own stuff from OneDrive that you uploaded there (like The Beatles, which are not available in the Groove catalog). You can obviously also download your own stuff from OneDrive, too. Groove can also stream "radio" and your own
 created playlists from your collection (songs you pick to&nbsp; from the catalog) or a mix of your "collection" and similar stuff the computer picks. You can stream on anything at all, just about---iPhone, Android, PC, Windows Phone, tablet, iPad .....or Xbox.
 Xbox is only one of the streaming devices you can use. There is no limit to the number of devices your account can stream to. You can always stream your own OneDrive files---Groove member or not.

            You have to copy then from where they are located on your computer using the file explorer not Groove. If you need to know where it is located on your c drive, when you are in Groove you can select a song and choose properties and it will show you the
 location of the file.

<p>I am worried that I'll exceed allocated space for OneDrive and have to pay for more space...</p>

<h2>            Outlook adding reminders to Calendar invites that don&#39;t have them set</h2>
                    <p>Our team has a practice of sending calendar invites to the rest when they are taking a day off, with the following settings:</p>
<p>1. time set to Free</p>
<p>2. do NOT request responses</p>
<p>3. turn off reminders</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first two of these work flawlessly, but somehow a reminder gets set on the recipients' side. Any idea why this happens - and how to stop it?</p>

<p><span>Hi Darkhorse65,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Based on the settings, this is an expected behavior. When you set Turn off reminders, the setting goes just for your Outlook. The idea behind this is to give recipient control under reminders.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>As a workaround solution, the recipient could dismiss the reminder as soon as he receive it. The second possibility would be shared mailbox calendar.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Yes, I have exactly the same issue.</p>
<p>Running Win10 on a Lenovo W510 laptop and since the install I'd not had to reboot.</p>
<p>To fix an issue where the audio from the docking station wasn't working I had to install the Lenovo audio drivers and this forced me to reboot.</p>
<p>Now my start menu is just as Pedro shows above.</p>
<p>

    <title>Memory Corrupts on Re-start of 5500 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herculesksp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Memory Corrupts on Re-start of 5500</h2>
                    I have a Nokia 5500 that came with firmware v3.14 and I upgraded last week to v3.55 using the Nokia Software Updater successfully. But since then I have been having a problem with my memory card. Everytime I switch off and on the phone and try to access
 the memory card, it says that the memory card is corrupted. After a format it works till the next re-start.<br />
<br />
I tried formatting the phone and also doing a full format using windows but even now whenever I restart the phone the memory card gets corrupted. I wonder if this is a problem with the new firmware.<br />
<br />
Has anyone faced such a problem and can anyone guide me on how to rectify this problem. Would it help if I somehow revert back to the older firmware? If yes, then how do I reinstall the older firmware version?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />

            Sad to say, I have a similar and recurrent problem with my E61. Out of nowhere, it will report "Memory Card Corrupted," and the only "solution" it offers is to Format the card. Brilliant. I've accepted that option twice now, and have also done reformats
 in my PC Card reader in both FAT and FAT32. No difference. The E61, when so inclined, reports the "Memory Card Corrupted" and I'm back to square one. A REAL annoyance as I have serious applications (e.g., TomTom Navigator on my card). Nokia has been quite
 unhelpful with my previous queries about SD cards. The essence of what they told me was that if it's not a NOKIA brand card, then they won't do anything. But, the bigger question is: what CAN they do? There's NO reason to think this is a card-specific issues.
 It's much more likely that it's a NOKIA phone defect. Having a Nokia-branded SD card would mean only that I had the dubious satisfaction of getting the same message with a "supported" card. Not exactly a motivation to buy an over-priced No

            Oops. I had solved this problem. I wonder why I didnt post this earlier. After numerous formatting and reformatting of the memory card on the phone, off the phone(PC), formatting the phone memory etc I figured out the solution.<br />
<br />
Actually, I had set a password for the memory card and a passcode for the phone itself(upon startup). Now I somehow thought that maybe after the firmware update, the phone is not caching the password and is hence thinking that the card is unusable. I removed
 the phone passcode and I dont think that solved anything. Then I remove the memory card password and voila, It worked!<br />
<br />
I figure that the phone sets a flag saying that the password is stored but either the stored password gets corrupted or erased and the OS is unable to read the card. So it thinks that the card is corrupt.<br />
<br />
Do try this out in case you have set the password and I do hope it works for you also. Btw, I do have an original Nokia card and their service center was of no help to me.

            Thanks. I might try your "solution," had my Nokia E60 not once but twice and without so much as a "by your leave" set a "random" password on two different unprotected SD cards, rendering them totally USELESS! Fortunately Kingston (who indicated they'd
 seen the exact problem from other Nokia phones) graciously replaced both cards. The fault was Nokia's. The problem was mine. The fix was provided by Kingston. There is DEFINITELY a Nokia problem here, IMO. In my contact with Nokia they inevitably blame the
 entire problem on use of a non-Nokia SD card! As if these things aren't made to standards. And whose "standard" is more likely to approach industry specs for these cards? Your choice: Nokia or Kingston?

            hehe... thats debatable. Of course Kingston would be better in terms of SD standards but then Nokia is the preferred choice when it comes to SD on Nokia phones standards. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I do believe Nokia overprices their products, but since I got my 512 with the phone, I didnt have to really make a choice. When the 2gig cards come to India then I will think about which is better.<br />
<br />
On the same lines, I think the developers at Nokia are overlooking very small things. This problem should have been tested by the test engineers or at least a fix should have been provided once the problem was reported. Similarly I downloaded the S60 SDK and
 there is such a trivial issue in that which is not fixed by nokia and which causes the full installation to abort.
