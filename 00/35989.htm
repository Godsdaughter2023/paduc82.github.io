<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It sounds like you have a dual boot setup, if so what other operating system do you have installed?&nbsp; Like Sandeep asked above, why are you in the Widnows recovery system?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does your computer start up without any errors?&nbsp; If not, what are the exact error
 messages?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please let us know status.</p>

<h3> troothteller  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4461619 On Windows 7</h2>
                    This morning I received on Windows Update KB4461619 for Word on Windows 7, 64-Bit.&nbsp; The links to the right side, "Support Information" and "More Information" brought up nothing.&nbsp; Searches on this site and on search engines brought up nothing.&nbsp; So, as I
 did with the last group of updates which caused my system to hang, I hid this update.&nbsp; Since there is no information or articles on it, I will not download it to install.

<p>DP09, having read your link to the article, the update appeared critical enough to download and install.&nbsp; However, I am sorry I disobeyed my first inclination.&nbsp; After installing, I gave the system a restart.&nbsp; Twice my Windows 7 failed to restart normally
 in Windows.&nbsp; My Office system is a 32-Bit version; so I downloaded the correct update.&nbsp; I am now in Safe Mode With Networking trying to reverse this last update.&nbsp; However, from program lists I am able to view in both Control Panel and a third party uninstaller,
 this update appears to only affect Publisher.&nbsp; So, I cannot understand what the update contains that could cause my system to hang without loading the full Windows.&nbsp; Thanks for researching the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This updating problem is worse than I thought.&nbsp; In the wee hours of this morning I downloaded and installed two important updates, as Microsoft labeled them, a Security Rollup and a malicious software removal tool.&nbsp; From my past threads I guess that Microsoft
 labels all their updates that scan for particular malware KB890830.&nbsp; Anyway, I downloaded and installed these two updates.&nbsp; Afterward, as I always do to make sure they don't make my system hang, I shut down the computer.&nbsp; This morning after waking up I powered
 up the computer and did a few odds and ends before going out for a few hours.&nbsp; While preparing to exit, I noticed after about an hour that my Windows still underwent the configuration process to finally install the two updates.&nbsp; Upon my return I expected the
 process to continue; but I guess it took longer for these two updates to install.&nbsp; Then, after the Word update installed, it caused the system to hang on two restart attempts.&nbsp; After the second, I uninstalled these last two as well, KB890830 and KB4503292.&nbsp;
 This mirrors other occasions where I started threads concerning previous updates.&nbsp; A previous thread concerned a particular malware fix with three other updates, KB4464567, KB4499406 and KB4499164.&nbsp; A month ago I started another thread about another group
 of four hanging updates, again with a software removal tool as one of that group.&nbsp; Sometime after that one, reflecting some disappointing Microsoft employee behavior, I started one about a locked account.&nbsp; I suspect that Microsoft is trying to coerce us to
 upgrade to Windows 10.<br />

<p>I'm sorry to read of your troubles with this update and ones in the recent past.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is for Word so I don't understand why Publisher is involved but at least you know how to uninstall it etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for KB890830, I don't install it as it doesn't seem to do much of anything and for me has never found any infections but I did notice though, in August 2016 it started to send Heartbeat reports to MS (GWX starting rolling out the previous month). Up to
 you but I use a good anti-virus and have safe browsing habits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you install the roll-ups the only thing I can suggest you do each month (before you do install) is search for that particular KB to see if anyone has problems with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you are aware, there are practically no MS employees actively answering questions here. The majority of the people who help are users like you and I who volunteer their time freely but have way more experience and expertise and for that I am grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can solve your ongoing update problems :-)</p>

<p>DP09, thank you for your suggestions, even though I already implement them.&nbsp; I am already aware that some updates are to prepare us to upgrade to Windows 10 whether we want it or not, or whether or not we have a computer designed for it.&nbsp; For this round
 it occurred to me to try these updates again with Sophos disabled, a package I will never buy again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>As for KB890830, I don't install it as it doesn't seem to do much of anything and for me has never found any infections...</em>"&nbsp; I have known some users to try to run the tool manually for a specific malware rather than wait to let it detect the malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On rollups, "<em>...see if anyone has problems with it...,</em>" I usually download and install the ones labeled Security, not Preview as past experience causes me to remember crashes on the latter type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>...there are practically no MS employees actively answering questions here...</em>"&nbsp; Referring to the locked account, I received private email advising me to telephone the company.&nbsp; So, it was during direct contact that I encountered the rude employees.&nbsp;
 I followed up with a personal letter to headquarters to which I received no reply.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I try to help where I can and try to share the limited knowledge I do possess, sometimes it helps and sometimes not!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no experience with the Rollups as I only install the Security Only updates and they suit me just fine. I may be leaving myself open for a fall but while I still have the choice, I don't have to take what is heavily pushed and has been for some time
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I misunderstood about your locked account (I didn't visit your profile and do my homework beforehand), I thought it had to do with the updates corrupting something along the way and not an actual account.</p>

            No need to apologize.&nbsp; We are both victims of a "big brother" organization.&nbsp; Probably I would have had less trouble if I remembered to disable my antivirus before updating Windows.&nbsp; Your solution on handling Rollups reflects common sense.&nbsp; The locked account
 reflects my having to verify my identity by receiving a text message.&nbsp; I do no texting; but Microsoft assumes that everybody does.&nbsp; Maybe they want everybody onboard doing it.&nbsp; People getting the last laugh are those who do not use computers at all, the same
 thing I said three years ago when the news went after Broom Hillary over her private email.&nbsp; Woody's site sounds familiar, though I do not know if it concerns Microsoft directly.&nbsp; There I will look for a forum that applies to my circumstances.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br />

<h2>            How to prevent screen from dimming automatically.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I just purchased a Razer Blade Stealth laptop and am having issues with the auto dimming of the screen. Whenever the background of the display is darker (webpages, looking at photos in the Photos App), it drastically decreases the brightness of the
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into the control panel and ensured that "Enable Adaptive Brightness" has been switched off for both on battery and plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also gone into "Intel Graphics Settings" and made sure "Display Power Saving Technology" has been disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice this has become very frustrating very quickly and I cannot find any up to date information anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Skype not working on Windows mobile&#40;Microsoft Lumia 640XL&#41; WIndows version 8.1 U2</h2>
                    <p>Last 3-4 days, I am unable to login on my skype account.</p>
<p>It always says, check network settings, whereas there is no issue related to network.</p>
<p>The same account works on my desktop.</p>
<p>Windows Mobile - Microsoft Lumia 640 XL -Windows Version 8.1 U2.</p>
<p>Its very difficult to manage by not to be able to login on skype through my windows mobile.</p>
<p>Kindly suggest a solution soon.</p>
<p>It isn't even allowing to login through Microsoft outlook&nbsp;account.</p>

<p>4 days ago Skype cut off in the middle of a conversation without any warning on my Lumia 640XL phone and now Skype will not sign in.</p>
<p>What about some warning if you are going to drop support?</p>

            I've updated my phone to windows 10, but skype still won't start on it. Nice... This is why I regret the day I started to use Windows! But this is my first AND LAST device with this wonderful software.

            What is the exact version of Windows 10 that you have installed?&nbsp; The Anniversary update or greater is required.&nbsp; It will not start/function in older releases of Windows 10 on your mobile phone.

<p>Version is 1511, OS build: 10.0.10586.107</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might accept this answer: "<span>It will not start/function in older releases of Windows 10 on your mobile phone.</span>" if Skype was developed by some other company, but it is not, that is a Microsoft product, just as
 Microsoft Lumia 640 XL...</p>
<p>I bought this phone and it worked fine, and now I can't upgrade it (which is ok, because it is not a brand new model), but I can't use the old Skype version which was working before on my phone. This is crazy!</p>
<p>

<p>There are 4 releases of Windows 10 for mobile phones. The only Windows 10 Mobile version that has no supported release of Skype is the first release. The Skype release that existed on 1511 was retired along with Windows 8 Mobile&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA34763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">and
 is no longer supported</a>. Upgrading from one unsupported OS to another unsupported OS build of Windows 10, does not resolve your issue. The latest versions of the Skype App are incompatible with that build and require at least the first update for Windows
 10 Mobile which is 1607, the Anniversary Update. I do not know which phone you have. The Lumia 640 XL mentioned by the op, supports the Anniversary Update and the Creators Update. I used to own a Lumia 640 before it was stolen. The last release I ran on it
 was the Creators Update. I currently own a Lumia 650 and it runs the Fall Creators Update. I recommend you update your phone over Wi-Fi, when possible, to avoid service provider charges. If you have a really old Lumia phone, then the last option may work,
 if not, you would have to use other methods that cannot be discussed here. You can search areas online like the xda developer forums where people modify their old devices to run other versions of Windows 10 or Android, that may allow that latest versions of
 Skype to function. The alternative to that would be to purchase a newer phone from any vendor with a supported OS or OS build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Properly updating the Windows 10 Mobile Phone OS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. People contact their mobile phone provider to see if they can push out an approved firmware update.&nbsp; If not, other options are available.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Check for updates</strong> in the OS. If it will not go beyond 1511, still claiming it is up to date, then the updates will have to be pushed out through other means.</p>
<p>3. Use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/13778/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Upgrade Advisor App for Windows 10 Mobile</strong></a>, this App is designed to download the latest approved build of Windows 10 for your mobile phone.&nbsp; Once updated, you can Check for updates to download the latest updates for that build. This method
 should work.</p>
<p>4. If for some odd reason you are still unable to update your phone, you can try signing up to be a
<a href="https://insider.windows.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Inisder</a> and download the
<strong>Windows Insider App</strong> from the store, using your phone. It can reconfigure your phone to obtain newer releases through check for updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the detailed answer,&nbsp;I really appreciate.</p>
<p>I've tried 2. and 3. without any success (the only thing I saw that the phone was up to date).</p>
<p>Also tried 4., but when I searched for available builds the result was: "No builds"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Won't try the firmware change, because I don't want to waste more time on this...I simply won't use skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for you help.</p>

            Hi Shep.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br /> Have you Checked for Updates at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update and then expedited install of them all to get any needed patches or drivers, giving restarts and then going back to check until no more are offered?  
<br />
<br />Have you tried updating the Display driver from the PC or Display device's Support Downloads webpage?  Note this is not the Monitor driver but the Display adapter's driver.  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then try Uninstalling Driver in Device Manager (reached by right clicking Start button) by choosing Display adapter, then Driver tab, then Uninstall.  Restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />You can also Roll Back the driver in Device Manager on the Display device's Driver tab, or to try all previously installed drivers choose Update Driver, then Browse PC, then Let Me Pick.  Work backwards trying each driver until you find a good one.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br />If all else fails you can also try to System restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Shep, this is widely reported at the moment!
<br />
<br />The Fix: your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If there is no roll back available or that does not work, go to the Support page of the manufacturer of your PC/Laptop 
<br />
<br />Download the Device Driver they recommend for your Display Adapter/GPU and install that version, until Microsoft come out with a fix . . .       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />

            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to connect the Bluetooth device to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I would like to know some more information related to this issue to help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do have issue connecting to a Bluetooth device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Do you get any error message while connecting to a Bluetooth device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Which device are you trying to connect to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, you may follow the&nbsp;suggestions mentioned below&nbsp;to add a Bluetooth to your PC.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no Microsoft software to access Bluetooth from command prompt.<br />
<br />
To access Bluetooth from command prompt, there may be a third party software. You may use your favorite search engine to find a software to access Bluetooth from command prompt.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software

            1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />You should see your product key there. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work try the following: 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />To know the activation key of Windows without any program you must follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the start menu and type "regedit", right click on the search result and select the option "run as administrator".
<br />
<br />After opening the registry editor, open the path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt; SOFTWARE&gt; Microsoft&gt; Windows NT&gt; CurrentVersion&gt; SoftwareProtectionPlatform
<br />
<br />After clicking on SoftwareProtectionPlatform look for the entry BackupProductKeyDefault and the value that appears as a third party in the list is your Windows activation key.
<br />
<br />The key has a format of five groups of five characters each.
<br />
<br />It looks something like this: TG59Ñ-W3M1G-FGBSX-4YWX6-6F2CY. (This is an example)

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

            Hi Bhavesh, 
<br />
<br />I feel like you may need to take ownership of that folder, even though it’s yours, the reset may have caused the permissions to go wonky. 
<br />
<br />Is your OneDrive folder currently still in C? 
<br />
<br />Here is a step by step guide with photos:

    <title>Two Microsoft accounts and one skype account on the same email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mishaikin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Microsoft accounts and one skype account on the same email address</h2>
                    <p>I have the following issue:</p>
<p>- my skype account says it has Microsoft account linked to it (it doesn't say which one though)</p>
<p>- my Microsoft account (which I use for Office 365) though registered on the same email address as the one of my skype account, doesn't seem to be the Microsoft account to which my skype is linked :(</p>
<p>As a consequence of that, when I login with my Microsoft account (email) into skype I do not see my contacts from my skype account (which is registered on the same email). And also I cannot use my free skype minutes from my Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total mess. I cannot understand how it is possible my skype account and my current Microsoft account to be registered on the same email, and at the same time to be different accounts. Can it be fixed?</p>

<p>Thanks, but when I login with my email (Microsoft account for 365) I don't see any skype name on that page.</p>
<p>When I login with my phone number or skype name I see my skype name. And of course the same email address is valid for all these accounts. I am at a loss how to get them merged.</p>

<p>Try out the older XAML start menu and check if your menu helps.</p>
<p>Use method 10 from the following article:</p>

<p>Also search for a wiki article here in the list which mentions how to increase 30 day rollback time after an upgrade.</p>
<p>hope it helps.</p>

            I gave up after three weeks of really enjoying WIN 10 - when the critical error loop hit, I tried a solution. It worked until I shut off the pc and returned to use it...the critical error was there again. Having only a couple days before the end of the
 time period I went back to WIN 7. &nbsp;When needing a PC to get work done, this dealing with a Microsoft Blip is just too much effort. &nbsp;I'll try again some months from now, but they have to get this thing worked out.

 so. Maybe, just the way to get a gamertag is waiting, or getting lucky.</span></p>

<p>That is weird because the guy who I was talking to from Microsoft said that gamertags get reserved on an account stored in the system. But maybe because the gamertag I want is a 5 letter word that people use everyday :(</p>

<p>I think by "reserved" you mean "spaced." When someone spaces a gamertag, it "reserves" all forms of that gamertag, regardless of where any spaces are placed. For example-, there is a gamertag "P il l" but no such gamertag as "Pill." But if you try to create
 the gamertag "Pill," the it does not let you because the letters P I L L are already in a gamertag with no extra letters/numbers, just spaces.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

    <title>Storage Space Disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayr_601  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Space Disappearing</h2>
                    Over the past few weeks, I've noticed that that the amount of available space on my hard drive is disappearing at an alarming rate; I've lost around 30 GB in less than a month. This doesn't seem like a virus, since it's way too obvious, (and too large),
 and multiple scans with my anti-virus have found nothing. If it's a legit program updating itself, I haven't seen any update notifications, and it'd be a massive update. Right now, I'm down to less than 1GB available, and uninstalling programs before only
 seems to be a very temporary solution.

            Hello, I understand that you are having some trouble with disk space. There are a few possibilities that are happening to your Windows. One is that there is a process (like an iTunes Backup) running in the background causing it to lose more space quickly. Second is that you may want to delete the temporary files. However this large amount of space used is probably due to some program downloading and installing in the background. Open task manager and see what is using up your disk space. Hope this helps!

            Hi rayr_601,
<br />
<br />You can use disk clean up to free up storage of disk space, usually temporary files use a lot of space on the hard drive.
<br />
<br />Go to file explorer, right click on disk C, click properties, General, disk clean up.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Thanks, but I've done that several times already. It's never cleaned up much space - well under 1 GB.

            I know it was just an example, but I don't use iTunes, and I'm not sure what I have installed could be backing up this much. I've already run the disk cleanup a few times, and it never cleaned out much, so my temporary files aren't the issue.

    <title>Black and White 2 graphics issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nebulousarray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black and White 2 graphics issue</h2>
                    Here's a tough nut to crack. Anyone who's tried playing B&amp;W2 knows that it comes with a whole host of patch this, compatibility that. I went through everything, and as elated as i am to have it open and play, there is a huge issue with the graphics. They
 flicker like an old vhs, miscolored bars stretched across the screen for cutscenes, and the landscape is a nightmare when the game finally loads. It flickers and flashes through character models and makes them look horrid too. Otherwise, and funnily enough,
 the game runs great. No lag, very responsive. I've tried every compatibility/resolution/ color reduce combination i can think of but none of them will get rid of the flicker. Is it just the curse of trying to play the game on a modern pc? Please help, i'd
 love to relive my childhood sans nightmarish seizure lights!

            Hi  NebulousArray
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<p>Thank you Andre, but is this for a faulty graphics card/driver issue in general? Or would it solve the problem for just this one game? Because as far as i've seen it's just the one game that's been an issue...</p>

            If its just the game thats affected, then I recommend you try compatibility mode to see if it works better.

<p>Sounds like an issue that's more often seen on older games (eg- Diablo II ) that used earlier types of 3D acceleration.</p>
<p>It's not a common issue with DX9 games from 2005. This is sometimes fixed with a patch from a fan&nbsp; site, or a tweak to the
</p>
<p>games .cfg\.ini file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using a monitor or TV ?</p>
<p>If your machine has both dedicated graphics and integrated graphics try using the integrated graphics.
</p>
<p>I have a&nbsp; couple of games that work on Intel HD graphics that don't work on Nvidia graphics.
</p>
<p>I also have a couple of games that work on AMD dedicated graphics but not on the other two. One of these, Crimson Skies</p>
<p>( from 2000 ), has a similar issue with the textures going black (unplayable) when using Nvidia or Intel graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you are using a disc based version, and have already downloaded and installed the patches and have a noCD fix
</p>
<p>to prevent Win10 from blocking the game. <em>Direct Play</em> is also enabled ?</p>
<p>Other than Compatibility settings, what else have you tried ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

<p>I had a person on the B&amp;W site tell me to set the CPU affinity to just 0 but that did nothing, and i ran a diagnostic from the disc and i'm wondering if the "display dorver" having unknown compatibility might have anything to do with it... I'm not super
 experienced with computer stuff but I kinda get what you mean? If it helps you any I have an intel core i3, no idea if it's even good for gaming.... but something must be okay with the computer because like I said other than the graphics flashing, it runs
 like butter. I should mention that the game isn't entirely unplayable, the landmasses are visible... honestly I should just post a video to youtube and link it so someone can see. Also i'm just using the laptop monitor. No idea what direct play is? I'll look
 into the dedicated/integrated bit in the meantime. I would say that my gpu might be to old but i'm pretty sure the game is older so? I dunno.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking a minute to help!</p>

<p>Yes, it's hard to say what the source of your problem is. I also saw some posts from people with graphics anomalies, but it doesn't
</p>
<p>affect everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I would say that my gpu might be to old"</em></p>
<p>- Only if there are no dedicated Win10 drivers (a common issue with laptops more than a few years older than Win10) .
</p>
<p>Having to run games&nbsp; with the generic drivers supplied by MS via Windows Updates could affect performance on older gpu's.
</p>
<p>- What brand and model gpu ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have an intel core i3, no idea if it's even good for gaming"</em></p>
<p>- i3's are OK for gaming, and being dual core, they should actually be less of an issue regarding old games not being coded
</p>
<p>to run on more than a single core than a quad core cpu would.</p>
<p>You may face problems with some recent release games that require quad core, and even though the i3's have Hyper-Threading,</p>
<p>some games require four physical cores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility the problem is due to Hyper-Threading.</p>
<p>It's a long shot regarding the flashing problem, but a lot of 'older' games don't respond well to Hyper-Threading, so you may want</p>
<p>to experiment with disabling HT in your machines BIOS.</p>
<p>Your user manual should show which section of the BIOS used on your machine has the HT option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This game is recent enough it shouldn't be affected by Direct Play being disabled, but anyone who plays older games,
</p>
<p>particularly pre-2004 release games should have Direct Play enabled. I have no idea why MS have it disabled by default. I haven't
</p>
<p>hear of any ill effects having it enabled.</p>
<p>Go to <em>Programs and Features &gt; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn Windows Features On or Off</span></em>. Scroll down to and enable
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

            So I somehow have it functioning now. No clue how. There are only 2 graphical anomalies that occur occasionally, one being the ants sometimes become infinitely tall when i zoom in all the way on them, and the second only happened once but the skybox had
 an LSD-like criss cross drunk rainbow. Otherwise, no flashing landscape. I'll take what i can get. Thank you so much for all your help though I seriously appreciate it!

<p>Hi Bucky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like your Surface Book has not recognized the driver you reinstalled for Windows Hello to work. Did you restart your device twice as suggested? If doing that does not do the trick, you can perform a two-button reset instead. This will allow your
 Surface Book to restart with the new driver software in full operation. Here's how you can do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off your Surface Book.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button simultaneously for at least 15 seconds.</li><li>Release both buttons and wait for about 10 seconds.</li><li>Switch on your Surface Book normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Not working in Windows 8, Please help tried everything</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently purchased HP G6 2016tx windows 7.</p>
<p>I upgraded it to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that my Bluetooth device is not working. It was working flawlessly in windows 7 and now no response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message I get is “ Please turn on the Bluetooth device. Cannot detect Bluetooth audio.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to enter the bios/uefi to enable the Bluetooth but there is not option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the wireless in windows 8
<span>&nbsp;</span>there is no Bluetooth icon switch to turn on / off. 
<span>&nbsp;</span>there is no Bluetooth icon switch to turn on / off. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My HP laptop has only one common physical button this toggles between airplane mode on and off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Device manager I am able to see Bluetooth device, and right click tells me that this device is working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default
<span>&nbsp;</span>under Bluetooth device, it had taken Microsoft generic Enumerator and Microsoft generic adaptor.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>under Bluetooth device, it had taken Microsoft generic Enumerator and Microsoft generic adaptor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later I installed the windows 7 device driver (in windows 7 my system had
<b>Motorola Ralink Bluetooth 3.0 + HS </b>installed) it got installed but I did not get the Bluetooth icon switch under wireless/ turn on / off wireless.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Also when I entered the bluetooth settings and save any setting error message “ Please turn on the Bluetooth device. Cannot detect and Bluetooth audio” is shown.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Also when I entered the bluetooth settings and save any setting error message “ Please turn on the Bluetooth device. Cannot detect and Bluetooth audio” is shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the drivers in
<b>windows 7 compatibility</b> mode <b>Motorola Ralink Bluetooth 3.0 + HS
</b>got installed but I did not get the Bluetooth icon switch under wireless/ turn on / off wireless.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Also when I entered the bluetooth settings and save any setting error message “ Please turn on the Bluetooth device. Cannot detect and Bluetooth audio” is shown.</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Also when I entered the bluetooth settings and save any setting error message “ Please turn on the Bluetooth device. Cannot detect and Bluetooth audio” is shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the
<b>services.msc </b>under this I checked the Bluetooth from manual to automatic and restarted the device but<span>&nbsp;
</span>no response. Again I performed the above options but no response. Also worth to mention that I restarted the system each time after the above activity. And also removed the previous drivers before installing the new ones to avoid any layer level clash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried the windows 8
<b>troubleshooting</b> options and performed the steps but no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to install other OEM device driver to check if they can handshake with the device. Some of them refused to install. But
<b>Ralink Bluetooth 4.0 adapter</b> got installed but I could not perform any Bluetooth related activities like transfer of files or connecting Headset etc, what I observed in other laptops of a similar make was under Bluetooth devices they had Microsoft
 generic adapters installed and also Ralink Bluetooth 4.0 adapter. But anyways I could not dual install both.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I also tried some other drivers suggested in other threads but they don’t work.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I may also request you to check the<b> Motorola Ralink Bluetooth 3.0 + HS
</b>driver file and if you could suggest some registry re entry and installation digital sign check/ uncheck (actually this should not be problem if I install in windows 7 compatibility mode but installing in compatibility mode does not enable the device).</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>I am very sure that my device is
<b>Motorola Ralink Bluetooth 3.0 + HS </b>because this is what is show in the
<b>windows 8 compatibility</b> report which was generated by the windows upgrade assistant; and the report showed that this device is compatible and it does not require any attention, but the reality is it does not show up at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind help requested.</p>

<h2>            Windows product key not working after updating to windows 10 &#40;from Win. 7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>HI, </p>
<p>I recently noticed that after upgrading to windows 10 (using an ISO image from the Microsoft website) that my windows hadn't been activated. After trying to activate it I keep getting an error relating to my product key and then being asked to buy a new
 one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My key&nbsp;had been&nbsp;fine on windows 7 since I purchased it but now for some reason it isn't working at all. Anyone else getting this error?</p>

            <p>I couldn't upgrade my Win 7 [an OEM Windows came with my laptop] by "Windows Update" icon after synching with Windows Update many times. The "Update History" showed that "upgrading to Windows 10" failed 10 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an article about using "Media Creation Tool" to upgrade to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Downloading by "upgrading another PC" to save "download capacity" with my ISP.</p>
<p>2. Trying to upgrade with the tool in an USB stick.</p>
<p>3. The option "upgrade win 10 express" didn't work as the "Win 7 product key" didn't work.</p>
<p>4. Using "custom installation" on the partition of Win 7, it worked.</p>
<p>5. The issue to activate Windows 10 showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I have to reinstall Win 7 again! Crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I really like my Windows 7. I had to upgrade to Windows 10 to avoid Internet's attacks by junks out there [hopefully Win 10 has less bugs or&nbsp;hackers haven't distributed those]. I guess, they liked to scrap my lap top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes: the Win 10 updates had failed around&nbsp;10 times, probably junks had deposited tons of sh*tty stuff in my previous Win 7 earlier. Anyways my computer was like a free market.</p>

            <p>James i'm in the same boat I have this laptop I'm on now and I started with the oem activated windows 7 then I purchased windows 8 FROM MICROSOFT when it came out then later I got the 8.1 free upgrade.</p>
<p>I am in the insider program and the day non beta/full version&nbsp;came out&nbsp; my hardrive went out and I put a new one in and re installed 7 activated then 8 activated then 8.1activated &nbsp;then 10 no activation</p>
<p>Now I get the Error code: 0xC004C003 The activation server determined that the specified product key is blocked and when I called Microsoft support they treated me like a criminal and acted like they did not believe me I even told them the windows coa from
 my laptop and gave them my upgrade code that I got from them when I paid for my upgrade</p>

            I was told over the phone that it should be sorted in a day or two however nothing has changed so I will call them again. Thanks for your reply and I'll let you know what they say if you like.&nbsp;

            <p>Please let me know if I have to reinstall Win 7 and HOPE for upgrade to Win 10&nbsp;worked. My laptop is so well known to junks out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Actually if I bought a new laptop, I would have to return it before 30 days - 90 days warranty period by a retailer. That laptop would be scrapped by junks after free-return period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways it'd be easier for MS to add an option to enter Win 7 and Win 8's product keys in Win 10 screen. MS has offered&nbsp;free upgrade, and some posts said that users could use Media Creation Tool.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2015-08-12: I'll put back Win 7 and see if Win 10 upgrade icon showed up. MS shouldn't mention anything about ISO image and Media Creation Tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates 2015-08-12 an hour later:</p>
<p>* Fantastic the moment after Win 7 complete installation, junks shutdown my screen. My laptop is stuck in standby mode. I haven't entered my Win 7 product&nbsp;key yet.</p>
<p>* Perhaps I should keep my pirate Windows 10 for 30 days, because I couldn't activate by my Win 7 key within Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2015-08-13: my computer stuck in standby mode. Win 10 was better to get out of standby mode.</p>
<p>- You should take advantage of free upgrade to Win 10, if you had Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2015-08-18: Finally my computer had Win 10 with key activated. However&nbsp;junks shut&nbsp; it down stuck in standby mode, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I'm not sure if those destructive bugs had been distributed widely. The junks had so much fun.</p>
