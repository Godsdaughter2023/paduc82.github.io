<h2>            Formula  - Sum Small ignoring blanks and zeros</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to sum the smallest numbers in a league table, to show the lowest 8 scores from a series of 12.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the formula below, which works however I have a problem, some of the cells maybe blank or have a zero value, and I need to ignore these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(SMALL(C7:N7,{1,2,3,4,5,6,8}))</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could help me it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use this formula instead:</p>
<p><strong>=SUM(SMALL(IF(C7:N7=0,9.99999999999999E+307,C7:N7),{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}))</strong></p>
<p>But to enter this formula you have to press <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Enter </strong>
simultaneously because it's an array formula. otherwise, it will return a <strong>
#VALUE!</strong> error.</p>

    <title>Ongoing Troubles when Linking Excel Graphs to PowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ongoing Troubles when Linking Excel Graphs to PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please help! I have just learned the wonders of linking Excel Graphs and other info into a PowerPoint presentation. I was thrilled! Basically I have a master excel spreadsheet with about 18 tabs each which correspond to a slide with a graph on a powerpoint.
 I have spent hours learning to link the two so that whenever I make a change in my Excel the Powerpoint slides update automatically. EXCEPT&nbsp;I am having TWO main problems that I can't seem to get over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Huge Issue! Say I go through my Powerpoint and paste special and link all the data from graphs in Excel. Then, I am done for the day. I save and close the PowerPoint. When I re-open the Powerpoint, the links are broken! Thus this prevents me from having
 a rolling copy of both my Excel and Powerpoint which I can update each month for my reports...&nbsp;Are the links only a one-time use? Can they not be saved? If not, what is the point of linking data in the first place??? If you open a PowerPoint, you have to create
 all the links. Then you edit. and PowerPoint updates.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be the same amount of work to copy &amp; Paste your graphs into the PowerPoint each time? After all if you creating the links each time, you're doing just that! Seems like I'm either missing something
 or the links are not very helpful for routing tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Continued from above. When Excel&nbsp;graph is linked to Powerpoint:&nbsp; If you delete data in Excel, it erases that corresponding data in the Powerpoint. When you create new data even in the same cells, it does not create anything new in the PowerPoint. Is it
 true, that you can only edit existing data via a link, but you cannot create new data? If so, this is also quite frustrating. I guess linking Excel and Powerpoint is not useful at all for time-series data. If you have to update as time goes on, you'll always
 need to create something new. No luck with the link. Great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps these are limitations to linking data. Is there anything I am doing wrong? Is there any work-around? PLEASE HELP, Thank You</p>

<p>Hi MossLev9,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First, check If you recently installed an update and have McAfee antivirus installed on your PC, you may experience problems editing chart data in PowerPoint.<br />
Refer to the article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-in-powerpoint-for-windows-1d7a6c03-c55b-4613-b999-46e6b98573b4?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fixes or workarounds for recent issues in PowerPoint for Windows.</a><br />
<br />
If you are not affected by McAfee antivirus, then move on.<br />
I have tested the issue you describe. Following is my steps:&nbsp;<br />
1. Select the chart in Excel&gt; Copy&gt; Paste Special in the home ribbon in PowerPoint&gt; Paste link&gt; Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object.<br />
2. Make a change in Excel and the PowerPoint slides update automatically.<br />
3. Save both the Excel file and PowerPoint file and close them.<br />
4. Open the Excel file and make changes in all charts, then save and close.<br />
5. Open the PowerPoint file and there will be a Microsoft PowerPoint Security Notice.<br />
Click Update Link&gt; All the charts update. (It seems that your file is large, you may need to wait for a while.)<br />
Click Cancel&gt; All the charts don’t update and I update the link of each chart.<br />
All links in these two methods above are not broken according to my test.<br />
<br />
To better provide help for you, please confirm the information below:<br />
1. Could you please provide the detailed reproduce steps, the related Excel file and PowerPoint file to us for test via

<h2>            Lumia 530 update</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a while ago there was new update available to Lumia 530. It requires minimum 1,1G free space.</p>
<p>Phone is just recently bought and has only 2 additional applications installed, Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>All photos and other data has been deleted, but still there is only around 770M free space and update cannot be done.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Even if FB and WA would be moved to memory card or deleted, there would not be enough space for update.<br />
How can this be, how to proceed with update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and BR</p>

<p>From this update onwards, updates should be downloadable to memory card, in the meantime you will may have to use the software recovery tool to apply this update. Make sure you have all your pictures, videos and music first to your computer or OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your contacts are safe in your Microsoft Account, as long as you have the back-up options switched on your settings and app list and SMS messages are also safe - these can be restored as part of the initial start-up process after the software recovery,</p>

    <title>Word 2016 Content Control issues &#40;plain text, rich text, check - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimberlyb.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Content Control issues &#40;plain text, rich text, check boxes, and repeating sections&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello!</span></p>
<p><span>I have created a form as a template in Word 2016 (via Office 365) that uses Plain Text Content Controls, Rich Text Content Controls, Check Box Content Controls, and Repeating
 Section Content Controls. Most of them are contained within tables. It needs to be locked for editing (one way or another) mostly to prevent accidental editing - not worried about maliciousness. I'm having difficulty with all of these things misbehaving.</span></p>
<p><span>1) For the Plain Text Content Controls, I have set a custom font style (Palatino Linotype 10pt, not based off of "normal") to use when inputting text. Some of them also
 need "Allow carriage returns (multiple paragraphs)" selected to allow multiple lines/paragraphs. In those cases, the pre-selected style works on the first line (and any that word wrap) but then reverts to the "normal" style (Times New Roman 12pt - and sometimes
 pulls other formatting, like bold) for all lines after the carriage return. See below screenshot (from dummy form with same settings):</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9bd45d2-e4e7-4677-bde0-788322e77534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9bd45d2-e4e7-4677-bde0-788322e77534" /></a>I
 did discover that if you copy/paste (not shown above) from within the document, it will make it work correctly. However, if you copy/paste from a separate document not only does it not work, it also REMOVES the selection of using a custom style (this also
 occurs in the Rich Text Content Controls). Changing the "Advanced Option" for Paste to "keep text only" does fix this issue; however, that setting is not tied to the template, instead it is tied to each user (I think).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) You might think I should just use Rich Text Content Controls to avoid (most of - see copy/paste) the above issues and you'd be right. EXCEPT then you get a whole different set of issues to figure out. First, you can no longer tab out of a RTCC to continue
 to other controls as it will just insert a tab into the RTCC. The workaround for that (per Greg Maxey: http://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/content_control_grouping_and_navigation.html) as I understand it, is to put the RTCCs in tables (which I had already
 done for other reasons), &nbsp;group ALL the content controls (or even the whole document to prevent editing) either with the "group" function or inside another RTCC, AND deploy the VBA code he provides (now need to "enable" macros every time - annoying!). The
 code works for me when the whole form is NOT grouped (by either method) but once I add the grouping (again, either method) it breaks in that trying to tab out of a RTCC doesn't go to the *next* control but instead selects the entire document (selecting the
 group RTCC or just the group). Tabbing a second time doesn't help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3) So, I could just not group everything, but then there are no editing protections. I think by now *we all know* that "Restrict Editing &gt;Allow Filling in forms" will break other things (like tabbing through check boxes!) and is really intended to be used
 with the Legacy form tools, not Content Controls. I found (also on Greg's website: http://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/content_control_fillin_form.html) that instead one should use "Restrict Editing &gt; Read Only (with exceptions)" and select all the content
 controls as exceptions for "everyone" (or use the VBA code from the link - works nicely!). Unfortunately, THIS breaks Repeating Section Content Controls in that the blue + no longer creates additional lines, it just moves you to the next control (when you're
 lucky) or to the next paragraph break even if it's not an editable region (and now tab really doesn't work!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Speaking of Repeating Section Content Controls, when tabbing INTO one from any other one (including other RSCCs) there is a really weird thing that happens (reverting back to NOT using "Restrict Editing"). Instead of tabbing to the first contained content
 control, it tabs to JUST BEFORE it. See screenshot below (from same earlier dummy form):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bba6216-a66c-4819-b9c8-1a19bab4aeac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bba6216-a66c-4819-b9c8-1a19bab4aeac" /></a></p>
<p>I tabbed from the last "Phone Number" control (strangely still grey "highlighted") and expected to have the grey highlighting around the "Movie" control. Instead, as you can see (hopeully), the cursor is sitting outside the "Movie" control and I was able
 to type in the cell ("I can type here but shouldn't be able to!"). This also occurs when tables are not used for RSCCs. (I posted this part as a reply to someone elses stand-alone question earlier [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10/repeating-section-content-control/6808a75f-887f-4a8a-8ebb-7caeef3eecee]
 but figured I'd include it here too.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize this was all quite long and convoluted so...</p>
<p>TL;DR = if someone can help with points 1 (please don't suggest Rich Text) and 4 above, I would be eternally grateful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Kimberly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's focus on the first point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to move forward, could you please provide the following information to help better understand your situation?
</p>
<p>1. Please clarify "Allow carriage returns (multiple paragraphs)" selected to allow multiple lines/paragraphs" with detailed steps and related screenshots.</p>
<p>2. Please clarify "word wrap" in "the pre-selected style works on the first line (and any that word wrap) but then reverts to the "normal" style" with related screenshots and how you create it.</p>
<p>3. Please record a small video about how you create the Plain Text Content Controls, apply custom font style and then encounter the font style issue( please add comment in the video about the desired
 results). Then upload it to your OneDrive, and share with us its public link here.</p>
<p>4. Your Windows OS version (e.g. Windows 7) and Office version. &nbsp;For the Office version, please click File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information, and capture a screenshot of the Product Information like

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to look into this. Sorry for the delayed reply - I wasn't working Friday or over the weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a big long reply typed up for you with answers to your questions and screenshots and the whole 9 yards. However, when I was doing a dry run of the video you requested (your point 3), I couldn't duplicate the issue. That's when noticed something strange:
 the "end of row" paragraph markers (they look like a circle with four dashes around the outside in the "corners") in my new table (where I couldn't recreate the issue) were slightly different compared to the ones in the old table that was having the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like how the paragraph mark "contains" paragraph data, the "end of row" (and "end of cell") marks contain table data. Even though when I select the whole table, the mini formatting toolbar shows the correct Font and Size (Palatino Linotype, 10pt), when
 I click JUST before the "end of row" mark it shows Times New Roman, 12pt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, this is an easy fix IF you even know it is a problem (I don't know about anyone else but I certainly don't have memorized what those markings are supposed to look like in each font!): simply highlight the entire table and change the Font and Size
 to the correct setting (or just apply the needed style).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally don't think this setting should affect the style selected in a Plain Text Content Control. After all it is called a content CONTROL - it should control the content and other settings shouldn't interfere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my point 4 (re: Repeating Section Content Controls issue with tabbing), I've created a new thread
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_other-mso_o365b/repeating-section-content-controls-tabbing-issue/32bf7b9e-187c-41ea-bc4f-76d372979e6b?tm=1503950249656">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kimberly</p>

<p>Hi Kimberly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updated information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f69bc02d-cb4d-4b6e-8a9a-1420a3e9366f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f69bc02d-cb4d-4b6e-8a9a-1420a3e9366f" /></a></p>
<p>Still, I can't figure out how to reproduce your form. About the above description, could you please record a small video about how you create the Plain Text Content Controls form, and then encounter
 the font style issue( please add comment about the process and desired results,&nbsp; and record audio in the video ). Then upload it to your
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Personal OneDrive</a>&nbsp;, and share with us its public link (right click) here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And please also share your sample document public link, so we can investigate the actual document from our side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>I should be able to get videos up by Thursday.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, I discovered that my above "fix" does not hold over a save and re-open!! :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>For right now, I can answer your previous questions (quickly) which might assist temporarily (until I can make the requested videos):</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;<span>"Allow carriage returns (multiple paragraphs)" selected to allow multiple lines/paragraphs" means, I need to have the "Allow carriage returns (multiple paragraphs)" property of the Plain Text Content Control selected
 (enabled/checked) so that I can enter more than one line of text within the Plain Text Content Control. Please view this Problem Step Recorder file for step-by-step instructions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlPa73yE5xw5hXiK7n_jyhmZq5So&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2) "Word wrap" from&nbsp;</span><span>"the pre-selected style works on the first line (and any that
<strong>word wrap</strong>) but then reverts to the "normal" style...</span><span>for all lines after the carriage return</span><span>" means that I CAN get additional lines in the PTCC that
 have the correct style with the automatic word wrap feature (that exists is almost all word processing programs, not just Word) - that is "</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">a feature that automatically moves a word that is too long
 to fit on a line to the beginning of the next line</span><span>" - but any line NOT generated with word wrap (i.e.: after a carriage return) does not have the correct style. See this updated screenshot that might help:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06b4089d-0ae6-465f-899f-314614564220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06b4089d-0ae6-465f-899f-314614564220" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Kimberly,<br />
<br />
About this behavior, would you mind using the following workaround?<br />
<br />
When you see the style are changed after you hitting the Enter key, please select the first line with correct style and click "Format Painter", select all the content so that the style are changed to the correct style.
</p>
<p>After that, the style will keep the same even if you hit the "Enter" key in the Plain Text Content Control.</p>
<p>

    <title>N8 Ovi Maps Lags Actual Location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jm24---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 Ovi Maps Lags Actual Location</h2>
                    
<p>I thought I read about this problem somewhere but cannot remember where.&nbsp; I tried searching but did not really find an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I use Ovi Maps on my N8, either just as a map while driving or to navigate, it appears the icon representing my current location is always a little behind my actual position.&nbsp; For instance, when my car is in the middle of an intersection Ovi Maps shows
 that position only after I am a few car lengths past the intersection.&nbsp; This happens at all speeds.&nbsp; I have it zoomed in a fair amount so that I can read all the street names.&nbsp; This makes it hard to navigate where there are roads really close together since
 you cannot easily tell where to turn.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jay</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm from the maps team and I have a couple questions for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which version of Maps are you using? 3.04? 3.06? The new version that came out in Ovi Store on Friday?</p>
<p>2. If you have upgraded your Ovi Maps, did you see the same problem in the previous version?</p>
<p>3. Which software version do you have? You can find out by typing <span>
*#0000#&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thats star, pound, zero, zero, zero, zero, pound. The star can be hard to notice.<br />

<p>Thanks for the replies.</p>

<p>I just downloaded and installed the newest version from the Ovi store and will try it out the next time I drive.&nbsp; I do not have PR1.1 so I am on the initial firmware (011.012).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will post an update once I try out the latest version.</p>

<p>Forgot to mention that I was using 2D mode when the lag was occurring.&nbsp; Tonight I had a destination to navigate to and the mode was 3D and for the most part it appeared not to lag as bad or as much.&nbsp; But it still lagged... but not as consistent as 2D mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing is I read in another forum that the Bubbles app from beta labs ships with a new version of the QT framework which causes problems one of which was the maps lagging.&nbsp; Could this be an issue?&nbsp; I really do not want to uninstall if it is not
 the cause, but if that is a known issue then it will have to go.</p>

<p>The latest version from the Ovi store did not correct the issue.&nbsp; I also uninstalled Nokia Bubbles (along with downgrading Qt framework) and still have the problem.&nbsp; I just installed the latest Ovi Maps from Beta Labs and also upgraded my maps, still have
 the problem.</p>

<p>As mentioned I have the zoom level set to where the red triangle is about twice the size of main roads (not sure how to read the gauge - might be 230 yrds or so).&nbsp; I have the map auto-rotating around my position.&nbsp; In non-navigating driving (i.e., no destination
 set) the red triangle is centered on a side road when I am completely thru the intersection, sometimes by a car length.&nbsp; This may not sound like a problem and most times it is easy to figure out, but where I live there are side streets very close to one another
 and at times it is difficult to know which one to turn.&nbsp; Also, the rotating/scrolling of the map does not appear to be very smooth or quick, but I am not sure if that is how it is supposed to work.&nbsp; Also not sure if there is some delay when the map moves (i.e.,
 only every half-second it is updated, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, I am trying to figure out if it is a problem with the N8 GPS, other N8 hardware, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Videos auto-rewind when they shouldn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Videos auto-rewind when they shouldn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p><span><span>PROBLEM REPORT<br />
<br />
Powerpoint 2010 </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 7&nbsp; 64-bit<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Powerpoint 2010 does not behave properly when using videos.&nbsp; Two things I've noticed:<br />
<br />
1) If you insert a video into a slide, it will auto-rewind even when the setting is turned off.&nbsp; Here's the procedure.&nbsp; Insert a video into a slide. Set the video to play automatically, and make sure Auto-Rewind is OFF (should be the default).&nbsp; Duplicate this
 slide a few times.&nbsp; Or just create a few blank slides before or after the video slide, just so you have a multiple slides in your file.&nbsp; Playback the show. It will work normally. HOWEVER,&nbsp;if you use left-arrow to backup in the show, any frames with video will
 auto-rewind when the video ends but before advancing to the next slide.&nbsp; This is a huge problem when sending files to clients who might want to jump around and review different slides in Slideshow mode.&nbsp; It's especially problematic when one video ends on a
 slide, and the next slide is essentially a new video which begins using the ending frame of the previous slide's video.&nbsp; The continuity is destroyed when the auto-rewind starts happening.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p><br />
2) Similar problem occurs when using Trim Video.&nbsp; If you trim a video's end point, and you playback the show, whenever that slide is advanced, the video will auto-rewind before the next slide comes up if a slide transition (like
<strong>Fade </strong>is used).&nbsp; If there is no slide transition, then I'm not sure the problem occurs. In some ways this problem is worse since it doesn't require you to back up with the left arrow key.&nbsp; It happens in the first run-through.</p>

            Not sure what you mean by "Auto Rewind"<br />
<ol>
<li>You see it rewind?</li><li>It shows the first frame?</li></ol>
If 2 then it's normal to display the poster frame (by default frame 1) when the video is not playing.<br />
<br />
You can set the poster to the last frame. Move the play head to the last frame and in Video tools &gt; Format select Poster Frame &gt; Current Frame<br />

            By "auto-rewind" I mean it instantly jumps back to the first frame.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
And no, it is not normal.&nbsp; It is a bug.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense for it snap back to the first frame when finished playing.&nbsp; That is not conducive to a well-prepared presentation.&nbsp; Furthermore, Powerpoint 2007 does not snap back to the first frame.<br />
<br />
Even more to the point, Powerpoint 2010 does not snap back to the first frame, either -- not if you only advance from slide to slide.&nbsp; The only time the problem occurs when you advance, then backup and then advance again.&nbsp; Or if you
<br />
This is not normal behavior.&nbsp; The video should stay frozen when finished, and as the slide transitions to the next one.&nbsp; I wish I knew how to get this message to Microsoft.<br />

            As Echo said but note it doesn't snap to the first frame normally - it shows the<span style="font-weight: bold"> poster frame</span> when it's not playing. When you back up it will always fail to animate and be "not playing". The poster frame does not have
 to be the first frame, maybe the last frame would be better for you.<br />

            If you back up, meaning hitting the left arrow key, I don't expect videos to play, however once I begin advancing again, it should work the way it does normally (videos starting on first frame and freezing at end)... but it doesn't.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I said backing up, I just meant if you step back, say 5 slides, and then start&nbsp; going forward again.&nbsp; This is something a person might do if they're reviewing the powerpoint, admittedly not something that is commong during a presentation (but possible).&nbsp;
 When someone backs up even a tiny bit, and then resumes going forward normally, the videos don't work the same way anymore.&nbsp; This is a bug.<br />
<br />
Also, Powerpoint 2007 does not act like this at all.&nbsp; (And by that, I mean it behaves normally and predictably).<br />
<br />
Your solution of having the poster frame set to the end, does not work either because it will cause the video to look strange at the beginning, as it will JUMP back to the first frame to begin playing.&nbsp; A polished presentation does not have videos frames flipping
 nonsequentially. It just looks bad. It looks like something is wrong... and in this case it is, Powerpoint 2010 is not handling videos sensibly or properly.<br />

            <p>It is clearly a bug.&nbsp; The problem happens with WMV files which are Microsoft's own native format.&nbsp; If powerpoint doesn't work with WMVs then I would assume this is a full-blown bug.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com creates folders in another language - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook.com creates folders in another language</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a strange problem with my outlook.com account. Whenever outlook.com automatically creates a folder in Onedrive (eg when saving attachments) it creates it in Dutch rather than English. For example I just saved some attachments from an email and now
 have a folder called 'E-mailbijlagen' in my OneDrive rather than 'E-mail attachments' there is also a 'Documenten' folder as well as a 'Documents' folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com is set to use English (UK) as my default language. At one point in the past I did live in the Netherlands, but this was a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to change the default language or region setting within outlook.com other than the country region for my account (set to UK) or the outlook.com language (set to English (UK))?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking at my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how this will help though. I have a problem with outlook.com (webmail) automatically creating folders in Onedrive.&nbsp;The desktop outlook client isn't involved in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce the issue&nbsp;go to outlook.com and use the 'save attachments to onedrive' option in an email. When I did this for the first time it created a folder in my Onedrive with a Dutch name rather than an English name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These folders don't appear in outlook.com they appear in onedrive.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

 programs are you trying to run under Internet Explorer?</span></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any software/hardware changes or any new updates installed after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Temporarily disable the antivirus software running on the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span>Warning:<br />

 If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>

            I found out eventually that there are actually three upgrades.
<div>Its the process described on several websites to force the update process but you have to do this three times before the phone completes the upgrade.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first two leave the phone on 7.5, the third update is in two parts and on completion you have 7.8</div>
<div><br />
<div>All good but a long process.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found a link to a Microsoft discussion about extracting the client from the Office package, but can't seem to find the page anymore. Anyways, there was a installer for Onedrive For Business which didn't work, since it falsely said the the Office version
 was 2013 while it is indeed 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided is for Ondrive, not for Onedrive For Business.</p>
<p>My customer used to have Ondrive for his personal files logged with his Live-account a and Onedrive for Business logged with his company account to sync the company files. Now the Ondrive client with his Live-account remains, but the Onedrive for Business
 client is missing, so he can't sync the company files.</p>
<p><br />
Please, provide help on how to reinstall the Onedrive for Business client.</p>

<p>For OneDrive, we have the new OneDrive sync client (onedrive.exe) and the previous OneDrive personal sync client (groove.exe). The link I provided is for the new OneDrive sync client. After you follow the steps above, go to your SharePoint Online library
 and click “sync”, follow the instructions to sign in with work or school account, you should be able to sync SharePoint documents. And you can refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/which-version-of-onedrive-am-i-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which version of OneDrive am I using?</a> to check if it is the correct version.</p>
<p>You can post back if you still have any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You need to go to the SharePoint Online document, click “sync” to launch the client to sync your library. May be this is the step confused you that “OneDrive for Business client is missing”? As you can’t sign in account to your OneDrive client to sync
 SharePoint library, so you think the client is not for OneDrive for Business?</p>

    <title>How can I exclude few rows of source data from pivot table after the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennybrooks  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I exclude few rows of source data from pivot table after the table has been created&#63;</h2>
                    It's been a while I have been struggling to find a better solution for this problem.<br />
<br />
I have created a Pivot Table, no worries there. The data contains a list of user actions. There is a timestamp kind of ID that groups multiple user action line-items.<br />
<br />
So the pivot table does not use the ID mentioned above as either row or column headings. But, since I know that some ID-s are false data (e.g. created by a non-human script) - I need to exclude some ID-s from the final pivot-table rendered.<br />
<br />
One way to do this is to somehow remove all the ID-s from the source data and re-do the pivot table. For some strange reason, excel does not support re-rendering the pivot table if you have "filter data" switched on - on the source data. At least I could not
 find a way.<br />
<br />
Any better solutions apart from the above?<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since some of the values are wrong, replace the value of the wrong entries with something (may be a # or leave it blank in the source data)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Do the changes only in the IDs column<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Now in the pivot table add the IDs column to the Report filter section.&nbsp;</li><li>After addition, you may see a combo box containing all the unique entries in the IDs column.
</li><li>Click on the option select all and un-select the alphabet/blank field. </li><li>Now click Ok to Apply the filter.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<strong>There you go!!</strong> Your Pivot table is ready and you have excluded the wrong entries from affecting your pivot table.<br />
<br />
Hope your objective is achieved without recreating a new pivot table. </p>

                    <p>I am using Windows 8.1 and Office 365. I use to just have header at .5 in my documents. But since I have been using Word in Office 365 I try to adjust my header to .5 and it sets it at .65 and I have to adjust the title to 6 from the top in order for it
 to show on the page. Plus on the second page it prints without a header (on a 2 page document). I have never had this type of problem in the many versions of Word before. why?</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<strong>Headers and footers have not changed since Word 97. Controls for them and the interface have changed, but not the document structure.

<p>
</p><p>If you go to edit the header in your problem document, does it say "Header" or "First-Page Header?"
<br />
<br />
If you want, save a sample document with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I or someone else can take a look at it.

</p><p>Hello Lili,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per your concern below :</p>
<p>Make a Private Listed Yammer group - Private and Unlisted</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Yammer network has Yammer connected Office365 group feature enabled, then option for Private Unlisted will not be available.
<span>&nbsp;</span>You will have to delete the group from yammer and create a new Private Unlisted group again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note : If you delete the group from Yammer it will be deleted from Office365 as well, so check if the group is in use before deleting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find the support article for Yammer connected Office365 groups.</p>
<p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/yammer/manage-yammer-groups/yammer-and-office-365-groups</p>

<h2>            Conditional Formatting fill problem</h2>
                    I'm trying to apply a conditional format where I want to change the font only (italic) if the rule is met. &nbsp;Excel keeps changing the fill color and I can't make it stop. &nbsp;I previously applied manual colors as a visual "grouping" aid but the conditional
 format keeps overwriting those colors with a fill color. &nbsp;In the fill dialog box there is no option for no fill. &nbsp;There is a clear button in the lower right but that appears to just reset it to the default. &nbsp;There is a "No Fill" option that when selected become
 "No Color" which overwrites the manual fill to white.

            Ah! I see it now.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I was able to reproduce the difference in formatting between Excel 2010 and Excel 2011. Interesting difference. The difference shows up in the VBA code recorded between the two versions, as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think the reason you get the result you want in Excel for Windows is that the Windows version is not properly maintaining the background setting. In other words, you’re able to get the result you want due to a bug in the Windows version. So don’t go
 complaining to Microsoft about this difference, because I think the proper fix would be to make the Windows version behave like the Mac version, which would not be the result I think you want to have.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, the macro code made in Excel for Windows, when run on the Mac, produces the result you want. Here’s the code recorded in Windows that accomplishes what you want on the Mac:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub SetFormatting()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.FormatConditions.Add Type:=xlExpression, Formula1:= _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "=IF($E$3=1,TRUE,FALSE)"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.FormatConditions(Selection.FormatConditions.Count).SetFirstPriority</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; With Selection.FormatConditions(1).Font</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Bold = False</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Italic = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.FormatConditions(1).StopIfTrue = False</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Obviously, you would substitute the formula you want as the condition to be met. This should solve the problem for you.</div>

            I find it odd that you would call the windows functionality a bug when it does exactly what it implies...no color means don't apply a color. &nbsp;If I want white I can select white. &nbsp;In the Mac version it offers the same option but "no color" means white.
 &nbsp;And you think the latter is what Microsoft intended? &nbsp;OK, I think you're nuts. I can't in any universe think that the design intent was to force the user of conditional formatting to change the color. &nbsp;I can elect to not change the font and I can elect to
 not change the border, but i cannot elect to NOT change the fill color.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the code, that verifies that MS intends for the user to NOT change the fill color and that the dialogue box implementation is a bug in the Mac version.&nbsp; 100% positive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Oh, and by the way, the line that says: "=IF($E$3=1,TRUE,FALSE)"&nbsp;</div>
<div>can be written much simpler as: "=$E$3 = 1"</div>

            <div>I didn't mean to imply that the Mac dialog is perfect. In order to work the way you want it to, the Mac Format Cells &gt; Fill &gt; Background Color Dialog needs one additional option: Keep current fill color.
<div><br />
<div>The way the Mac version works is that "No Fill" does what it says it will do. The cell background is set to "No Fill" when the conditions are met, which means the cell will have no fill color.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the Windows side "No Fill" does not do what it says it will do - format the background without a fill color. Instead "No Fill" ignores the setting altogether. Instead of setting the cell fill property to "No Fill" as promised, it does nothing. Because
 the "No Fill" setting produces a format different from what it says it will provide, I consider that a bug.&nbsp;</div>

            This is where we differ (respectfully). &nbsp;I believe "no fill" means don't apply a fill. &nbsp;In windows that's what it does, with additional options of any color you wish.
<div><br />
<div>In OS X it does what you say...wipes out the current fill. &nbsp;There is no option for manage the font and border only, leaving the original alone. &nbsp;That's what is busted. &nbsp;Windows is fine as is.</div>

            The background color of a cell on a new, blank worksheet is “no fill.” If you change that setting by applying a color fill, then that setting is now the color that was chosen. To restore the state to no fill you would choose “No Fill.”&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>That is entirely different from “don’t change the fill color state” which is what the Windows version does and is what you want to have on the Mac. The windows dialog box is inconsistent with the command to set the cell to “No Fill." If you choose “No
 Fill” then the cell state should be “No Fill” just as if you choose “yellow” the cell state should be “yellow.” The Windows version does not let you remove the fill even when you tell it to do so.</div>

Let's go back to basics.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I <b><i><u>need</u></i></b> the ability to conditionally change the font and/or border of a cell without changing the fill property. &nbsp;If it's yellow, I want it to stay yellow. &nbsp;I can do that in the windows version<b>
<i><u>but&nbsp;I cannot in the Mac version</u></i>.</b> &nbsp;If you want to call the windows version a bug, knock yourself out; whether it's a bug or a lack of functionality I don't care, but I cannot do what I need to do in the Mac version that I can in the Windows
 version.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>We are just going to have to agree to disagree. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, note that in the Windows version there is &nbsp;"clear" button that removes all selections and allows no change to the fill properties of the cell. &nbsp;It also exists on the font and border tabs</div>
<div><br />
<div>That same button exists on the Mac version, but only the ones on the font or border tabs work (i.e. no changes to font or borders). &nbsp;The one on the Fill tab results in changing the color. &nbsp;There is no way you can tell me that the windows version is wrong
 when 5/6 tabs all work the same and the one that doesn't is on the Mac version.</div>

            For the time being I'm afraid the only way to get conditional formatting to do your bidding on the Mac side is to use the Macro I provided. Yes, it is true that conditional formatting works the way you like it to on the Windows side, but as I said, I think
 you're exploiting a small bug that I doubt anyone will notice and should continue to work indefinately.
<div><br />
<div>The MVPs have made a plea to Microsoft to have future versions of the Office interface more closely aligned with each other. We've asked that as far as is practical that toolbar and Ribbon controls be made to look similar, be placed in the same order and
 work the same way on both platforms. There are thousands of controls, and as a practical matter not all of them are identical and work the same way on both platforms. I do think Microsoft heard our pleas and I hope that in future versions of Office that there
 will be more consistency across the PC, Mac, and Web versions of Office. Time will tell.</div>

<h2>            Counting rows in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to count the actual number of rows containing data for a specific column in a worksheet. If I use the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim intNumberOfRows As Integer<br />
intNumberOfRows = Sheet1.Range("B1").Offset(Sheet1.Rows.Count - 1, 0).End(xlUp).Row</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the worksheet itself, the correct number of rows (=809) is returned. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I use the same code as the first thing that happens in a macro saved in PERSONAL.XLSB, it always returns "1".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas as to what's going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much!</p>

<p>First, with the new version of excel, I would change the "Dim intNumberOfRows As Integer for</p>
<p>Dim intNumberOfRows As Long, </p>
<p>Try this, use the DebugPrint or change the cell reference D1 that i'm using.</p>
<p>Sub CountX()<br />
Dim st As Long<br />
st = WorksheetFunction.CountA(Range("B:B"))<br />
Debug.Print st<br />
'Range("D1") = st<br />

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal.xlsb is just another workbook so when you execute that line in personal.xlsb it checks sheet1 in that workbook and not the workbook you want, try this. Where the book we want is Book1.xlsm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim intNumberOfRows As Long<br />
&nbsp;intNumberOfRows = Workbooks("Book1.xlsm").Sheets("Sheet1").Range("B1").Offset(Sheet1.Rows.Count - 1, 0).End(xlUp).Row</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it more generic you&nbsp; can use activeworkbook as well</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>intNumberOfRows = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("B1").Offset(Sheet1.Rows.Count - 1, 0).End(xlUp).Row</p>

<p>Hi Lara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested it on my Publisher(1809(10827.20181)) and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would suggest you follow the suggestions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can turn off Office file validation via Group Policy. <span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
You can download Group Policy Administrative Template files from </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">The Microsoft Download Center</span></a></span><span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><span>.</span>
 Then you can find this policy setting under </span><strong>User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates\Microsoft Word 2016<span> &gt; Word Options &gt; Security &gt; Turn off file validation &gt; Enabled</span></strong>.
</span><span>For more details, you can refer to this article:</span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/prevent-file-format-attacks-by-using-file-validation-in-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Prevent file format attacks by using Office file validation in

<p>
</p><p>At the same time, I want to confirm the information below with you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please go to Publisher/Word File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information and provide the screenshot of it.</li><li>Is the same situation happening when an Excel file or a PowerPoint file is opened by Publisher?</li><li>Are you opening a Word file by clicking File &gt; Open &gt; select Word file?</li></ol>

                    Hi,<br />
I bought an N95 8gig phone because it seemed to have some good features.I wanted to set up a WiFi connection to my router for internet access.To do this I have to go in my router and find my key.....no problem,done that.Now I have to tackle an almost insurmountable
 problem and transfer that key into my N95.I have typed all 26 characters in 3 times on the minuscule keypad and have had enough.On my Ipaq I can do basic 1993 Windows 3.1 stuff like highlight,copy,and paste....but on the N95 NO WAY! Ho do I do masic stuff
 like copy/paste/highlight all etc. on the N95???????

            you can also try this one:<br />
Create your connections as normal (using WLAN Wizard, Define Access Point etc).<br />
Open up "Settings", go to "Connection" and click on "Wireless LAN".<br />
Now press "Options" and then "Advanced Settings" , click "Yes" to the prompt. Now change the "Automatic Configuration" to "Disabled", once done scroll down to "Power saving" and disable this.

            Hi Jerico,<br />
So that means I am always connected to the router at the expense of battery power.....hmmmmm? Also does it leave my phone/router wide open to allow others to discover it and connect to it?<br />
<br />
I`v been watching "The Real Hustle" on More 4 and a guy(the bearded one) in a shopping center with a PDA and a small application was connecting to pedestrians phones which had "bluetooth discoverable" switched on and he was calling all these chat lines using
 their credit. He got a kickback from the chat lines through some sales scam they were running.<br />
<br />
As for reading the manual.....write a decent concise one and I might start.We are using this stuff long enough now for standard conventions to have been established anyway.Thats why Pal devices are such a pleasure to use.

<h2>            N900 Not booting</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys and most respected N900 gurus here,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Something is not right with my N900, I woke up today and found that my N900 is switched off and i try to switch it back on but it wont boot up, it got stuck on the Nokia logo and then thats it, it just goes blank and completely off again, also the LED
 is glowing lemon-green while the screen is blank and going off. I remember before going asleep that the battery power is on 50% or more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My recently installed items are Black Plastic Theme, some loopable wallpaper from N900wallpaper website and the multiplayer Super Mario from the Extras-repo which I wanted to try but got really sleepy, also its OC'ed to 1Ghz under ideal settings using
 Titans kernel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried removing the battery and waited 30 seconds and plugin the USB cable (PC-to-N900 coz thats how I always recharge) and it booted up like everything is okay. Can someone give me an idea of what could be possibly wrong with this coz I was really
 alarmed and kinda freaked out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replies are really much appreciated..</p>

            i don't know why but it sometimes just happens, i wouldn't worry about it<br />
open the terminal and run<br />
<br />
sudo gainroot<br />
apt-get clean<br />
<br />
this just clears out any random files that are floating around<br />
its also worth removing the battery every so often to stop static build up which can cause boot problems

<p>its the new black plastic theme. if you were using it when you were updating it, you get this issue when you try to reboot it. next time, swap to another theme, then update the theme before rebooting.</p>

<p>i had the same situation a few times before, nothing to be freaked out from, when my n900 usually acts like that, its becasue of leaving it with a long streaming video, gpodder downloading, and the browser downloading, all at the same time, all night.....
 or sometimes i leave the device running until the battery runs out, and than leave it till it turn of all by itself, than i have the same situation .......</p>
<p>but seriously dude be cool, the device is good .</p>

<p>By any chance had you ever run Standalone System Sweeper, the predecessor of WDO? If so you&nbsp;may find the WDO entry in the MPLog for Standalone System Sweeper also located in C:\WINDOWS\. At least that's where I happened to find it as I had run&nbsp;SSS before
 it was rebranded to WDO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps try a search for MPLog-03132013</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try logging in as an Administrator if you are logged in as a standard user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure about the attributes/permissions of these logs, so just to make sure it isn't a simple matter of how things are configured to show, in Windows Explorer / Tools / Folder Options / View, select the radio button to "show hidden files and folders",
 uncheck the box to "hide extensions of known file types" (not really&nbsp;critical or helpful here&nbsp;- but typically useful and while you're at it...), and uncheck the box to "hide protected operating system files" (but be careful ongoing that just because you see
 something doesn't mean you should do anything to it because this removes the minor protection of hiding them - but does help you in terms of seeing everything).&nbsp; Click Apply and then OK to save the changes and then refresh the view of that folder and see if
 it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then a simple search may not find these logs as I suspect they will not be part of the index (assuming you're using the indexing feature).&nbsp; That means to locate them with a search, you'd need to do an Advanced Search and check the box
 to "include non-indexed, hidden and system files".&nbsp; You could start with a more targeted location of say C:\Windows and if that fails, try going with Everything.&nbsp; I'd also suggest trying just MPLog rather than anything more specific so you'll have a better
 chance of finding the general area in case, for some reason, that specific scan didn't create a log, then you may still find the location of others from the past (assuming this isn't the first time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, try running WDO a few more times and repeat the above to verify it wasn't just a fluke that the log didn't get created (especially if it did find something and the process of removing what was found might somehow have wiped the log - which is so unlikely
 I hesitate to even bring it up, but this should clarify it for sure since subsequent scans should be clear if the first cleared your system).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, if that too doesn't work and since whatever reason you had for running WDO rather than some other program in normal mode on the computer may have cleared some but not all infections, you may want to try some alternatives if WDO at least got you
 to be able to use the computer normally again (if that was a problem or even if not).&nbsp; I'd suggest Malwarebytes - Free, ESET Online Scanner, TDSSKiller, and Hitman-Pro (trial) which if all clean would probably rule that out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to be honest, after that I'd be somewhat at a loss to explain and would need time to think about and research where to go from there.&nbsp; But post back with details of what you did and what happened and we'll try to come up with something else to try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

            Our network security team blocks a computer when it is found as infected based off of network traffic. &nbsp;
<div>The issue I am having is this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>A user reported he couldn't run some programs and sounded like spyware. &nbsp;When he got here I logged in as local admin and saw that Microsoft Forefront was not running. &nbsp;I immediately shut down the computer and ran the Windows Defender Offline tool and it
 was able to update and clean the infection.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reinstalled Forefront, updated, scanned then without issue and the following couple days without issue. &nbsp;The network security team with a delay then blocked the machines IP saying it was infected a day and a half later.</div>
<div><br />
<div>They are now wanting a log showing that the machine was cleaned otherwise I will have to reimage the machine. &nbsp;Normally this is not an issue but this is a manager and he has a lot of data. &nbsp;The machine has shown no signs of infection and was cleaned by
 WDO just now I have to prove it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For finding the logs I have a machine I just imaged with windows 7 and ran the WDO offline on. &nbsp;I indexed the C:\ and searched for mplog after showing hidden, unhide known, and unhide operating system files. &nbsp;I am not finding a log yet. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there some way to pass to Microsoft that the ability to save a log to the flash drive after scan would be useful?</div>
