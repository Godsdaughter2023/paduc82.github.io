<h2>            Unable to establish bi-directional communication with Lexmark X5495 &#34;all in 1 printer&#47;copier&#47;scanner&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Bi directional communication between PC and printer is not established. "I can't get my printer to print".</p>
<p>I have a Lexmark X5495 "all in 1 printer/copier/scanner".&nbsp; I have never had a problem like this before. All drivers are present, I uninstalled the software , then reinstalled it. I keep getting the same problem "bidirectional communication has been lost".&nbsp;
 I checked the USB cord, the power cord and unplugged same , to no avail. I even made sure my firewall was accepting my printer. NO LUCK. ANY IDEAS?</p>

<h2>            Batman&#58; Arkham City Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing Batman: Arkham City recently on PC but every time I finish the boss fight with Ra's Al Ghul the controls freeze so I can't use the remote control batarang to disarm him, or use anything else for that matter.... I've tried leaving it for a while,
 repairing, removing and re-downloading the game but nothing has fixed this problem. I've looked online but nobody else seems to have had this problem either, can anybody help?</p>

<h2>            Loss of Drives</h2>
                    I have 3 devices with Windows 10 Installed (Asus All in 1, Asus 2 in 1, Asus 10' tablet). All were working fine until this last update. I can no longer access any external drives. I lost my wireless storage, my computers do not see my phone (Nokia/Lumina
 830 w/ Denim) and the OneDrive by phone shows and the one my computers show are entirely different, they don't contain the same files. If I were to guess, the computers are seeing the old "SkyDrive" folders, while the phone is seeing the current OneDrive folders.
 The phone will charge while connected to a computer, however there is no icon show the phone. There is an icon for my wireless storage, but when clicked an error message states it cannot find it. As stated before everything worked fine until this last update
 (8/21 and 8/22 are when they installed).

            I ran methods 1 &amp; 2. I am confused by the results. Please note that I am a beginning beginner here, but it appears several files are unrepairable and that the source file is corrupt as well. The final line of each states "source file in store is also corrupted".
 To add to my confusion the final line for the sfcdetail log reads "Verify and Repair Transaction completed.

<p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click

            Thank you Mayank. I have successfully installed Windows 10 on the first day it was available. My issues started after the last update. Something in the update must have affected my anti-virus software, Kaspersky 2015. Once I disabled Kaspersky all my problems,
 save one are gone. The only issue I have not resolved is My phone and my computers don't see the same OneDrive files. I am working on that.

    <title>Integrated Camera Is Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akira kurusu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Integrated Camera Is Not Working</h2>
                    <p>This is very very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all. I was a Windows 8 user. I upgraded to Windows 10. Found out my camera was not working, so I decided to try and go back to factory settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mistakenly wiped the entire drive instead, while still on Windows 10. So when everything was booted back up again, and I had found the real option to go back "Return to a Previous Version" it wouldn't let me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Alienware m14xR2. It comes with a recovery tool called AlienRespawn. I then decided that using that would be the solution, since AlienRespawn restores my computer to factory settings. Well, that just made everything worse. Windows would not boot
 at all. Nothing would work. So I had to create a USB tool and use the command prompt to restore the boot files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm back here again, on Windows 8. A lot of my drivers were missing, such as my network drivers. But, my camera was working again. It was. And THEN, I restarted my computer one time for updates since I was starting from scratch again, and now the camera
 doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager, it is showed as 'integrated camera' under Imaging Devices. In properties, it says the following. "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45) To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what is wrong, or what to do. If I uninstall the driver, and then scan for hardware changes, it will NOT show up again. I have done it before. I have tried downloading Dell SX2210 Monitor Webcam but that didn't work. I've looked everywhere
 honestly. But nobody seems to have an answer to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have 2 unknown devices listed under "Other Devices" if that helps.</p>

<p>I really need this camera working. I have looked all around for people with similar problems. Nothing is helping. I assume it has to be a driver issue. But what drivers? There is nothing for a generic integrated camera that came with my Alienware m14xR2.&nbsp;It
 even said the device was working properly a couple minutes ago..</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR Camera has stopped working.&nbsp;<span>In device manager, it is showed as 'integrated camera' under Imaging Devices. In properties, it says the following. "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer.

<h2>            Ctrl Alt arrow key and hidden task bar issue in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved my keyboard and accidently hit ctrl, alt and one of the arrow keys. &nbsp;It made my desktop display upside down, I googled the issue on another comp, I realized what happened, and used ctrl alt and arrow key to change things back to right side up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, when it is in the correct orientation the bottom part of the desktop is hidden. &nbsp;I can't see the search box, task bar, time/date stamp etc. &nbsp;They're there and if I hover over something by placing the mouse pointer all the way I can see the
 preview pop-ups. &nbsp;If I go back to making the orientation upside down I CAN see the task bar fine. &nbsp;It's upside down, but it's visible. &nbsp;It's only when I have it displayed to the normal right side up that it becomes hidden. &nbsp;I've tried numerous ways to fix
 the issue and have run out of ideas. &nbsp;Can anyone assist?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Thanks for the help everyone! &nbsp; Updating the driver didn't help, nor did the script to reset the taskbar settings. &nbsp;I did, however, discover a tab for my video card that included some "Scaling" options. &nbsp;Apparently my accident involving a change of orientation
 via a keyboard shortcut somehow altered this setting. &nbsp;Once I re-applied "Maintain Display Scaling" again, everything went back to normal.</p>
<p>

            Hi, angelthetic
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you check these methods to repair any Windows problem.
<br />
<br />1.- Run System File Checker (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>) or SFC to fix any system file corruption from the resident component store.
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD (<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-command-prompt-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-comma...</a>)  execute the following command:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />This does not require Internet access.
<br />If this not help, you may need to repair the Windows Component Store itself.
<br />2.-  To do this, you need to Run DISM. (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-command-line-utility-repair-windows-10-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-dism-com...</a>)
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD execute the following command:
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />This will fix any system image corruption from a Windows Update source. This may require internet access.
<br />This should resolve all issues.
<br />3.-  Additionally if you feel, you may run SFC again.
<br />This will fix potential system file corruption from the new repaired component store and verify that DISM was successful in repairing the errors.

<h3> alexander603  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I recover my old email after re-installing Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Under the guidance of MS Support, in&nbsp;order to solve an issue,&nbsp;I had to re-install Windows 7. After the installation, all of my old email was missing. The &nbsp;MS Support staffer told me he&nbsp;wasn't trained to recover my email and sent me a link to try on my own.
 I failed miserably. I managed to get some email (Comcast) but only from the date of the re-install and none of my old stuff. In fact I somehow managed to do it in triplicate. As you can see I am not a computer person. Can anyone help me? I need step by step
 instructions. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Also see if there is a Windows.old folder on your hard drive.</p>
<p>The Windows.old folder has two purposes:<br />
1) Can be used to un-install Windows 7 and return your PC to the previous version of Windows.<br />
<strong>2) Contains in effect a backup of all your personal data files, documents, photos, Etc. from the previous version of Windows.</strong></p>
<p>Note: Change Windows Explorer option to see the Windows.old folder: <br />
Click Start and in the 'Search' box enter:&nbsp; "hidden"&nbsp; (without the quotes) <br />
Click the "Show hidden files and folders" option at the top of the list.<br />
In the 'Folder Options' Window:<br />
Click of the 'View' if it is not already selected.<br />
In the 'Advanced settings'&nbsp; list locate 'Hidden files and folders'.<br />
Now click on 'Show hidden files and folders'<br />
Next uncheck the following:&nbsp; <br />
'Hide empty drives in the Computer folder' <br />
'Hide extentions for know file types'<br />
'Hide protected operating system file'</p>

            Hi Arun, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If the ISO installation doesn't work, you can perform a clean installation which will resolve the issue most effectively. It will completely wipe your PC however, so make sure your files are backed up and you have the ability to reinstall your apps.
<br />
<br />Here's an article that explains in detail how to clean install:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>
<br />
<br />You'll need an 8GB or larger USB flash drive, and the media creation tool from this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-10-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/...</a>
<br />
<br />On another PC, follow the steps in the article I linked and you'll be able to clean install Windows 10. That should fix the problem.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi Arun.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow these steps for Overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing from the old version, which almost always works, or you can abandon the questionable install and go for the very best possible install to replace it by follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.

<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Havia assinado o serviço Xbox Live de R29.90 ao mês, e depois de um certo período eu assinei o serviço Xbox Live de R$179,90 por ano.<br />
<br />
Eu notei que era cobrado todo mês esses dois valores, entrei na minha conta do Xbox e notei que havia a opção de "Renovação Automática" cuja qual eu já havia desmarcado. Porém eu contínuo recebendo essas cobranças, peço por gentileza que esses valores sejam
 estornados, visto que não há motivo algum de cobrança uma vez que já havia cancelado os serviços de renovação automática.<br />

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I had signed the Xbox Live service R29.90 per month, and after a certain period I signed the Xbox Live service of R $ 179.90 per year.</p>
<p>I noticed that was charged every month these two values, I entered my Xbox account and noticed that there was the option of "Automatic Renewal" which which I had already cleared. But I continued receiving these charges, I ask please that these values are
 reversed, since there is no reason to charge once had canceled the automatic renewal services.</p>

<h2>            Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 not working on two OSes</h2>
                    Hello, in October I bought a new laptop that came with Windows 10. The Wi-Fi cut out very frequently and wouldn't come back on for minutes at a time, forcing me to stop what I was doing every instant it turned off and manually turn it back on. Sometimes
 doing this would continue chains of disconnection. It doesn't seem to matter what level of battery I was/am on, and all of the power-saving features have been turned off. I tried everything I could, pulling all-nighters to try internet fixes from people having
 this same problem.<br />
<br />
I instead decided to dual-boot to WIndows 7. The Ethernet at my campus wouldn't work with either version (but I only found out recently) leading me to believe it was both ethernet and Wi-Fi malfunctioning. So I was led to believe eventually that the campus
 internet was just bad (although it worked FLAWLESSLY on the other laptop I have been using for the past four years)<br />
<br />
So this Thanksgiving, I came home. Ethernet works, so now I know that the campus ethernet doesn't work. However, the Wi-Fi (using my very reliable internet at home) is doing the same thing it was doing on the campus Wi-Fi. I Googled for issues with my wireless
 adapter, Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260, and sure enough lots of people have this issue on both systems with it.<br />
<br />
I should mention that for these past two months nearly I've been using my phone as a USB tether (and the phone is on the same wireless network I'm trying to connect to with no issues)<br />
<br />
My phones, my other laptop, and everyone around me (at campus and in my 6-person home) all have working internet at all times.<br />
<br />
This is really infuriating as I live in bed and survive off of Wi-Fi. Sure the tether works, but is that really acceptable? I've tried all I could to solve this on both systems but there's nothing I know to do.

            <p>I can only offer one suggestion:</p>
<p>Buy a wireless USB adapter.&nbsp; Cost about $20.&nbsp; They typically work better than the built-in ones and are portable as well.&nbsp; AFTER you install the USB adapter and its drivers, disable the internal wireless facility.</p>

<p>I had the issue that the adapter wasnt working at all, sometimes it was responding, sometimes not.
</p>
<p>What i did was to open the laptop and remove the power first at all ! and then remove the intel wifi adapter. then i put back the adapter and power and now it works! i know that this could void warranty but it worked for me and hope that works for you all
 too... </p>

<p>my experience has lead me to believe the problem is the massive Proset bloatware, not the barebones drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i never could get the intel dual band wireless-ac 8260 chipset to work reliably in several new (VERY expensive) Panasonic CF-54 laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything I could think of and many suggestions from intel and the internet as well. nothing worked. the chipset was balky in connecting if it would connect at all, and when it did connect, it was almost always REALLY, REALLY, REALLY slow! And this
 was the case on multiple routers, both old and new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In complete despair, I finally decided to completely nuke the MASSIVE (and as far as I could tell - nearly useless) set of bloatware known as Intel Proset/Wireless and instead just install the basic Intel WiFi drivers and let Microsoft manage the WiFi, which
 Microsoft has almost always done flawlessly.</p>
<p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Downloaded the barebones Intel drivers for the 8260 wifi chipset from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27206</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't be fooled by the the Proset page title: the first set of downloads on the page are the barebones drivers WITHOUT Proset. (When the filename does not include the word "Proset", then they are barebones.) For my Windows 7 x64 system, I downloaded
 was WiFi_20.0.2_Driver64_Win7.zip:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/downloads/eula/27206/Intel-PROSet-Wireless-Software-and-Drivers-for-IT-Admins?httpDown=https%3A%2F%2Fdownloadmirror.intel.com%2F27206%2Fa08%2FWiFi_20.0.2_Driver64_Win7.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/downloads/eula/27206/Intel-PROSet-Wireless-Software-and-Drivers-for-IT-Admins?httpDown=https%3A%2F%2Fdownloadmirror.intel.com%2F27206%2Fa08%2FWiFi_20.0.2_Driver64_Win7.zip</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Unzip the downloaded driver file, but don't do anything else with it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Go to Programs and Features in Control Panel and Uninstall the installed Intel Proset/Wirless software. Remove everything, including "settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Next, manually delete the two intel wifi driver files from Windows/system32/drivers, namely netwfw02.sys and netwfw02.dat OR netwfw04.sys and netwfw04.dat (or perhaps some other number besides 02 or 04). This is a precautionary step, because uninstalling
 intel driver software lately does not actually delete the old driver files, and I've had replacement intel driver installs silently fail&nbsp; because they were unable to delete and/or replace existing driver files, leaving a total mess. (The worse case i've encountered
 is that uninstalling&nbsp; the intel HD Graphics 520 display drivers leaves over 200 driver files that have to be manually deleted AFTER uninstalling, because if they are not manually deleted, the new driver bundle will absolutely NOT install correctly leaving
 things like graphics acceleration completely broken.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now go back to the unzipped barebones wifi drivers folder and execute DPInst64.exe followed by executing iprodifx.exe.</p>
<p>And that should be it. Windows should popup a balloon&nbsp; from the taskbar telling you that a new wifi device has been installed and you should be good to go. Not only should the intel wifi now function flawlessly, but you've also eliminated a massive amount
 of unnecessary bloatware, including several background processes that run at all times, consuming both CPU and memory.</p>

    <title>Integrated Laptop Webcam not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Integrated Laptop Webcam not Working</h2>
                    My Dell Inspiron laptop (signature edition) has a problem with the webcam. For some reason, 90% of the time, the camera doesn't work in either windows Hello or even the basic camera app, but will spontaneously decide to work without any real reason. I
 have updated all of my drivers and have uninstalled and reinstalled all of them and to no avail. &nbsp;I am getting very frustrated because I cannot find a solution to the problem anywhere and I need my webcam to work so I can Skype family members while I am away.
 Any help would be very much appreciated.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have just updated my PC to Windows 10 Pro and it seemed to work before the update. Just recently I updated the drivers and did a troubleshooter on the devices and drivers and my camera has been working consistently with Skype which is a relief. But
 I am still not having any luck with my Hello feature, I just get the message "the camera is not available. Please enter your pin" or something along those lines. I had an avast and comodo combination for my computer virus protection, and I read that there
 was a problem with the compatibility of windows 10 recent update and that combination so I have uninstalled comodo but I have kept avast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on further steps or information would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

<p>The only reason why I'm participating in this thread is cuz it's a Minecraft thread. What's UHC anyways?

<p>Yes I have the Xbox 360 version and Xbox 1 version. I have some friends who have it on Xbox 1 but 80% of my friends (and my best friends) only have an Xbox 360. I live in NZ so time zones may be a hassle if you live in the US/UK, not necessary NZ, or Australia
 which is only 2 hours behind NZ time. I manage to catch my US/UK friends during weekdays only if I stay up real late or get up real early, otherwise weekends are the best time.

<p>Wait Geek, you up? What time is it for you? I have lots of US friends are most of them aren't up this time. It's 11:30 pm for me. Going to sleep in a few minutes. We play a few PVP games but usually just stick with normal survival or creative games. I don't
 think the OP's GT is weird. It suits Minecraft. Butter aka gold. And no, I am not SKY does minecraft. I created my GT when I first joined Xbox late 2010 and didn't copy anyone else I just came up with it, my friends call me Sky, Smiles, Bird, or by my first
 name. I'm not really really into PVP games but I can give it a try and have done so several times. I was playing with one of my Australian friends we were playing survival normal. He kept on dying. He raged and enabled flying and invisible on himself and me.
 If you want PVP real bad you can also try Halo and COD too. </p>

<p>I prefer to call you SSB. :P</p>
<p>As for Halo and CoD, I already play those games online for my PvP experience. I don't need MC for that.</p>
<p>As for why I was up, I'm a teacher who subs, so if I'm not already scheduled to work that day, I'm usually up early waiting for a phone call in the hopes of working that day. I'm usually awak at 6 a.m. eastern time as a result. ;)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Limit Wifi Speed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> afong m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Limit Wifi Speed</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<p><br />
I am using Windows 10 Pro. Recently more than a month already(after installing Windows 10 2018 update ), I notice my wifi speed is really slow. After I did some trial, I notice I get 30mbps on windows startup, then after 5 minutes, my speed gets limited to
 6mbps until I shut down my comp. This led me to believe there is a background app that is limiting my wifi speed.<br />
<br />
I have disabled all external programs from starting automatically, and most probably it is a system or Windows related app that is slowing down my wifi.<br />
<br />
All my other devices gets 30mbps on wifi except for Windows 10 Pro.<br />
<br />
I have tried all tweaks and tips from discussion forums but none have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the network speed tests a few minutes after starting up Windows 10 Pro. No antivirus running, all startup programs disabled. It suddenly drops from 31,79MBPS to 4MBPS? This happens regularly and persistently.</p>
<p>

            ok it seems that I have gotten hold of the problem. It was not Windows 10 or any of its update, but rather there is a setting on my router that is causing this behaviour. What a frustrating experience. I am glad I have solved this problem.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just have encountered the same problem. I work with an ethernet-cable and without any apps running I got a solid 82Mbps download speed on both my desktop and laptop. Just now (after I downloaded the latest windows updates), my download speed dropped to
 4Mbps when nothing is running. If I try to download (For example a small update in Steam), my speed drops to 1Mbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to tell me what kind of setting this was on your router that caused this behaviour? It is indeed very frustrating that this is so slow, and I really need since I'm working in the web developing sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<h2>            Gears Of War 3 travando ap&#38;&#35;243&#59;s tela de loading</h2>
                    
<p>Bom galera é o seguinte. Comprei o jogo via marketplace faz uns 3 dias. Joguei normalmente tanto campanha como online e tudo mais, mas agora quando tento entrar para jogar online após a tela de loading (quando fica escura para começar a partida) o console
 simplesmente trava. Não consigo nem acessar o menu através do botão cromado no meio do controle. Já limpei o cache do console e rebaixei o jogo mas mesmo assim o erro continua. Agradeço se puderem me ajudar.</p>

<p>OBS.: Outra coisa que percebi foi que meu save voltou para o ATO I quando eu já estava indo para quase o II.</p>

<p>BodaoMetal o meu ta com o mesmo problema aqui. Comprei faz uns 3 dias tb e joguei campanha e depois algumas partidas online. Sempre com muitos bots e apenas uma ou duas pessoas. Ontem (12/01) a coisa piorou, depois de achar uma sala entra na tela de loading
 e o console trava por completo. </p>
<p>Reinicei o console e quando abri o Gears recebi uma punição que meu nível caiu do 4 para 1. Tenso!</p>
<p>Gostaria de saber o que está acontecendo por que isso ta tirando minha paciência.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I've added "Malwarebytes Anti Exploit Premium" software and there is no major change in any setting of this Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Method 1 in your reply. It just leads to some database.</p>
<p>Coming to the 2nd method, I tried it but no change in the error. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The <strong>Proxy server</strong>" checkbox is not marked at all. </span></p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestion? </p>

    <title>EA Origin and Xbox One does&#38;&#35;39&#59;t allow userid management - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            EA Origin and Xbox One does&#38;&#35;39&#59;t allow userid management &#47; children&#38;&#35;39&#59;s accounts in particular</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had my 7 year old son try to register his ID to play FIFA 14 online features. It involved picking a name/password and adding my email as the parent. Once added I was emailed a parental notification with a link to ea privacy should I be concerned.
 I was surprised that Fifa 14 online features didn't work so tried to investigate the account. I was expecting to be able to access his account via my own origin ID bound to the same email address. There was of course nothing on the Xbox One to let me do that.
 I tired the origin website. I could log in as me, but no sign of parental controls nor his ID. So I tried to login with is ID, but I couldn't as it only allows login via an email address. I downloaded the origin PC client and that then allowed me to login
 with an his ID (not email). However there there was not indication it was linked to me as a parent and apparently, as the xbox passes the Date of Birth Across as recorded on the Xbox it had created a "minor" account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to then remove the account altogether as it was pointless. Opening up the EA games on xbox one only shows you a fixed page of the user id. There is no logout, decouple, request removal etc. Email privacy at EA led only to the usual talk to the
 help desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having talked to the help desk they verified my ID, but then asked me to verify my sons ID. This of course should have been verified as it was already attached to me as a parent email. i.e. if it was me as the parent then they should take that as permission,
 if someone chose to use me as a parent without my permission they should equally remove the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way they asked med to verify his account on our xbox one was to go and download an EA demo game on his account. This of course wouldn't work as I had already downloaded all the demos on my master account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now faced with having to go through this all again with them on the phone. I am not sure that removing his account won't break the link on the xbox one on his account for good. i.e. his account will be invalid as it does;t exist all the ea games will
 look at the local account details and attempt logon to origin and fail. With no "Origin Logout" we are stuck. Yes we can create another account, something I may end up doing, but he will lose whatever save games he has at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EA/Origin should provide the service to allow account management of children's accounts and also to respect the parents choice in what is suitable to play. I can't seem to tell who thinks what is best for my son, but I am pretty sure it is not the software
 company!</p>

<p>Which is why I always tell parents to make their children's account info as their own and just make the child choose the name. This whole EA account thing is just horrible and comes as no surprise they have no easy way to fix this type of debacle.

<p>Update....</p>
<p>With a bit of extra clicking around randomly I managed to get onto his web page version.
</p>
<p>Using the Origin PC client logged in just using ID not email (as it allows both) I logged in.</p>
<p>When I hit help on that app it then opened up the webpage but this time passed the login credentials.
</p>
<p>It has an email address to set to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>I was not able to hit save and change the email, but I was able to set an extra security question on the account?</p>
<p>I manged to find a button to unlink the account from the xbox one. I was hoping that then sparking the Xbox One up and an EA game it would realize the account was not the one I wanted to use.
</p>
<p>However instead it tried to login and then told me I could use it until I hit re-link. No option to change the id at all.</p>
<p>This is not a very good system!</p>

<p>It is a nightmare dealing with EA and their Origin account system for children. I dont think anyone under 13 is allowed to play using Origin. Quickest, easiest solution is to setup a new xbox profile for your son and set his age to at least 13.

<h2>            Microsoft stole my operating system...</h2>
                    <p>Further to posting re Microsoft 10 download which left me with no operating system no Microsoft Office no files no drivers I have tried posting on here for help. The Microsoft Community is obviously as implicated with stealing my property from my computer
 as the company Microsoft is: (Microsoft just another word for junk). IE: My home was entered via the internet and my property stolen from within my computer. I do not believe there are any humans beings at Microsoft to speak to a customer? Can someone prove
 me wrong, has anyone ever spoken to a human being from Microsoft? Microsoft are clearly pulling a scam with Windows 10 using a confidence trick to strip working computers (Well should I say as well as any Windows product can work) in order to up sell equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft however have the wrong guy here as I wont be going away...naming and shaming is my hobby when I get crossed by Shysters which Microsoft clearly are.</p>
