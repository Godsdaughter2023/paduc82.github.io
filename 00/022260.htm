<h2>            A simple solution to the Start Menu vs. Start Screen argument</h2>
                    <p>**Major edit coming soon, with photoshopped images to SHOW my ideas and everything! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read through many different posts regarding the UI of Windows 10 vs 8 vs 8.1 etc and find that we're stuck on a strange argument.</p>
<p>One party seems to think that the only solution to having live tiles in a large, desktop-sized arrangement is to replace the start menu with the 8 &amp; 8.1 start screen currently in use. The other party wants the old-fashioned start menu back and to do away
 with the start screen entirely. So, let's do the best of both worlds. In essence, take the current desktop and merge the start-screen-metro UI directly onto it. Then implement an updated but still fairly old-school start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, allow the placement of currently implemented live tiles directly onto the desktop in a grid exactly like that of the start screen. You would basically be replacing the old-fashioned and less informative icon. When you want to add a shortcut to
 your desktop, right-click and pin in it to the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu could then be in the same corner as always. Spruced up a bit (maybe customizable to look more or less like the Start Screen's down arrow list of everything on your pc) but otherwise the familiar start menu of yesteryear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution offers the best of both worlds: works on a tablet interface, removes the current duality of navigation on Windows 8.1, gives back the start menu, can still utilize swipe navigation (swipe up from the bottom on the desktop to open your start
 menu), let's the user personalize the **** out of their live tiles without the limitation of space in a small start menu, upholds the ideas of both the start screen's awesome tile customization while being the familiar navigation of the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, community, what do you think? Good compromise?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit** Feb 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thank you to everyone who has replied with a relevant, on-point idea. I truly appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I'd like to address a notable elephant in the room...</p>
<p>This Metro-style start screen has sparked some heated arguments. I'd like to take a moment and request open-minded consideration. Touch compatibility should be considered, the tablet experience, the phone experience, the potential to make Live Tiles do more
 rather than less... Clinging to an outdated, counter-intuitive experience simply because that's what you're used to doesn't advance the fundamental interaction between humans and devices. (A lofty goal but absolutely within possibility.) It's important to
 be risky, as Microsoft has done, even if met with opposition. Don't believe that? Watch a two year old pick up any tablet and learn how to interact with it quickly, easily and generally better than any adults in the room. Tell me that isn't intuitive... So,
 again, let's be open minded. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're a start menu enthusiast, what would make your start menu better? What could potentially improve your workflow? A Live Tile of most commonly accessed folders? A scaleable start menu that allows you to rearrange and add or remove options as you see
 fit? Let's hear it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I know that outside developers and programs allow you to change the layout of Windows, the start menu and so on, but we have to remember that not every user has the savvy, patience or care to find, install and configure these programs to their liking.
 We're not talking about what the user can do with programs. We're talking about what Microsoft can do to make Windows better for every user, so let's stay on point!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, please like this discussion if you've read this far into it or replied!</p>

            <p>even better...</p>
<p>Let us select the desired groups from the start screen that we want pinned to the desktop.</p>
<p>I have more tiles on the start screen than can be displayed all at the same time on my dual monitor's desktop. So. If I could select just some groups from the start screen, I would pick a group or two that have live tiles. That way I woulden't have to launc
 mail or switch to the start screen only to discover I have nothing urgent, I'd also have the weather and some of the people I follow, live on the desktop.
</p>
<p>Another group of tiles would be the ones that launch legacy (desktop) programs... no need to switch to the start screen just to be switched back to the desktop. I'd have modern apps return me to the start screen when closed, and legacy programs remain on
 the desktop when closed. The thing I use every day would be on the desktop or in the first few groups on the Start screen, less used tiles would be at the far right end of the start screen only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW. I've been using windows 8.1 like that for a while. It is a pain to create such a system manually using third party customization programs, but it can be done. It would be better if it was built into 10 as a simple drag and drop of a group&nbsp;heading on
 the start screen to the desktop tile.</p>

            <p>Your suggestion makes perfect sense. &nbsp;If you use classicshell it will do basically what you're talking about. &nbsp;It will give you a full featured start menu whether you are in start screen or desktop mode, and you don't need to logoff and log back on to switch
 between start menu/desktop and start screen mode. &nbsp;Why Microsoft can't do this is beyond me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have observed, the start screen itself is really not that different than a desktop with icons on it - just that you can make them "live tiles" so putting live tiles on the desktop, similar to gadgets/widgets makes perfect sense, but instead Microsoft
 wants to live tiles on the start menu and not on the desktop - maybe because that would perfectly replace a start screen and for some reason they don't want that?</p>

<p>That is not true. I just installed classic shell and I can not get to the start screen or any tiles.</p>
<p>Classic menu can not switch between modern and classic at all on my win 7 pc. touchscreen desktop, Nor does it switch between touch and mouse automatically like win 10. &nbsp;(IE: go to start screen on 8 and move the mouse, the "all programs" arrow appears. Touch
 the screen anywhere, even just a little and the "all programs" arrow hides. The screen will accept the up swipe gesture because it switched to touch input. Now move the mouse just a tiny bit, and the arrow appears, you are back in mouse mode. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Classic shell only emulates some of the windows 7 start menu. I have to right click the shell and exit clasic shell to get to the jump lists for the pinned start items. after doing that, the only way to get clasic shell back is to restart.</p>

<p>I use Start8 from Stardock and love it.&nbsp; I am very close to W7.&nbsp; I am just 1 click to anything&nbsp; want.&nbsp; I am using Start8 on a couple of W8.1 notebooks and I can't tell whether I am on W8.1 or W10.&nbsp; I brought over a new notebook that was running W8 when I
 got it and what a mess. &nbsp; I took it to W8.1 and couldn't wait to get Start8 on it.&nbsp; Just seems so damn easy.&nbsp; Classic Shell is similar.&nbsp; I even took Start8 off the W10 just to be fair for another try and damn, it was painful so back to Start8.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I am not a fan. I usually have lots of programs open on my screens. That means the desktop is covered up by them. I would have to minimize all my windows to gain access. Yes, I know I can use the WindowsKey-D shortcut to minimize all and use it
 again to bring them all back; however, that is more work then using the Windows 8.1 start screen where I only have to tap the WindowsKey. Most users wouldn't be willing to put forth that much effort. The start menu, on the other hand, is a single-click allowing
 users to navigate their applications easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the other consideration. Those on a touch-device (e.g. Surface Pro 3 with no keyboard) would find that difficult to navigate as the size of items on the desktop are not optimal for touching with a finger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last thought on this is what you are asking for doesn't seem too different from the startscreen in Windows 8.1. Yes, it is on the desktop and so you have access to the taskbar. That really isn't different from the current iteration of the startscreen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the startscreen upset the majority of users, how would this proposed change be any different?</p>

    <title>Is MS Word 2016 the same on a Mac and a PC &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dale brandt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is MS Word 2016 the same on a Mac and a PC &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was at Best Buy checking out the MacBook Pro and was playing with Word 2016. &nbsp;I tried to set margins on a simple document to 0.5" on all four sides. &nbsp;It did not allow me to do so for the bottom margin, displaying a message, and then resetting it to slightly
 greater than 0.5".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog box where you set the Print parameters was rather primitive, relative to what I see on my HP laptop running Office 2007. &nbsp;It presented me with fewer margin selections to choose from. &nbsp;When I tried setting a set of "custom" margins, it did not
 save the settings , showing them as it did with others...didn't give it a name showing the margin settings, but some generic name. &nbsp;Then, it did set the margins to what I specified. &nbsp;When I tried to create a second new set of different custom margins, it saved
 them under the same name as the previous set, wiping out the previous margins settings...they were no longer in the list to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A tech answering questions for me on a new HP laptop running Windows 10, showed me Word settings on his smartphone, and those printer selections for margins were what I was familiar with. &nbsp;(I don't know if he had Windows 10 on his smartphone.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point I am trying to make is that the Print dialog box on the MacBook Pro gave me much less selections of settings than what I am used to seeing when working on a PC running Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the version of Office/Word for the Mac less capable (watered-down) relative to the corresponding version of Office/Word for Windows , or is this a new look/feel to Word 2016 on both platforms, or both ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about the other Office programs for the Mac ? &nbsp;Are they the same as on a Windows machine ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            <p>Setting margin values is done in the <strong>Format&gt; Document</strong> dialog pane. There also are some margin presets on the
<strong>Layout</strong> tab of the Ribbon &amp; that dropdown palette for <strong>Margins</strong> includes the
<strong>Custom Margins</strong> listing which launches that same dialog pane as well. Margins also can be adjusted using the devices on the Horizontal &amp; Vertical
<strong>Rulers</strong> when they are displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Margins are a property of the document controlled from within the program being used, but on either OS &amp; in any program they must be in compliance with the capabilities of the selected printer. Otherwise, you get the notification which you can choose to
<strong>Ignore</strong>. That's primarily so that a document intended to be printed elsewhere still can be created. If you do create a document with dimensions that aren't supported, adjustments may have to be made in the Print dialog if the printer allows
 doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that you had difficulty with the custom presets because there was no actual printer installed on the demo Mac. Further, it sounds like you had the first preset selected when you attempted to create the second one. That would effectively enable
 modification of the original rather than creating a new one. To create a new preset you first need to click the ✚ below the list of existing presets, then supply a name along with settings for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to sell you on a Mac, nor do I mean any disrespect, but it sounds like you simply need more exposure to how things are handled by OS X. As John indicated, there is nothing you've mentioned that isn't doable, it's just a matter of familiarity.
 The entire issue of printing is controlled by the operating system in conjunction with the driver software for the printer.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0xc000000f</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago my computer just stopped and I got the 'blue screen of death' (BSOD) with the note that 'a required device isn't connected or can't be accessed'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a number of ways to get things going again but to no avail. &nbsp;I have no access to Windows now on my computer - I am only able to use it because it has an OS installed on it by the manufacturer - the OS is called Nautilus and is somewhat limited
 but does have a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been running Windows 10 for about a year following the free upgrade and as such I do not have any media with Windows 10 on it or any product codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can recover or reinstall Windows 10 without losing all my apps and other software? &nbsp;(I have managed to back-up my files to an external hard-drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated....</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Kaushik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be the scroll lock is turned on, causing the arrow keys to scroll the workbook area or the panes in the Excel worksheet have been frozen. We recommend that you check if the option to use the scroll bars to move through a worksheet is enabled or
 turned on. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File &gt; Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Display options</strong> <strong>for this workbook</strong>, make sure that the
<strong>Show horizontal scroll bar</strong> and the <strong>Show vertical scroll bar</strong> check boxes are selected.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>

            May I suggest that you use the search feature to find help with updating as it has been posted many times, also are you on a Preview build or a Public build. as this is the forum for testing newer builds of Windows 10 before being released to the Public
 and isn't a support site for RTM versions of Windows 10, as it is manned by unpaid volunteers.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The updates are downloaded and installed on the computer as and when the manufacturer releases the updates for that particular program, application or driver installed on the computer. Some of
 the manufacturer’s will not release the updates via <strong>Windows updates</strong>, in such cases you are required to go to the program, application or driver website and check to download and install the updates manually on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you facing issues downloading any updates on the computer?</span></li><li><span>If yes, is the issue specific to one update?</span></li><li><span>When you say “I am guessing its the Bing Bar that is being installed”, what exactly are you referring to?</span></li></ol>

    <title>How to execute a shell command in Excel 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> felice_1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to execute a shell command in Excel 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    In Excel 2011 for Mac, you could either use a `system` call or `MacScript("do shell script ""command""")`, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/12320294/918626.<br />
<br />
In Excel 2016 for Mac, I can still do: `MacScript ("do shell script ""open /Applications/Calculator.app"" ")` but already something like `MacScript ("do shell script ""source ~/.bash_profile;open /Applications/Calculator.app"" ")` fails (which worked on 2011).<br />
<br />
I saw http://stackoverflow.com/a/30949324/918626 regarding `MacScript` in general, but I wonder if it is also the easiest way to call a shell command?

            <p>As Ramit explains Office 2016 runs in a sandbox which means it only gets access to predefined resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the sandboxd messages in Console can help to determine why an operation failed. I suspect there isn't ONE best way to call a shell command as it depends on what the scripts does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Within the limits of the sandbox a system() call still seems to work. Leaving the sandbox is possible using AppleScriptTask in theory. However, I couldn't get it to work reliably with anything but the most basic script.</p>

            Yeah, I made the same experience... system and MacScript seem to both work for very simple things. AppleScriptTask was about the same experience... unfortunately....

    <title>share access database on network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> femstyle  say:</h3>
<h2>            share access database on network</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have to admit that I don't know Access well.</p>
<p>I have a network with a desktop computer and a laptop. I created an Access database on the laptop, split it into front end and back end and transferred it to the desktop. In the meantime, I got rid of the laptop and replaced it with another laptop. Now,
 I would like to access the database from the new laptop.</p>
<p>Do I have to split the Access database again? Or do I get problems when I have two back end databases for the same database.</p>
<p>I can access the backend database from the new laptop. I tried the same steps that I tried the first time when I transferred the database to the desktop, but now these steps don't work. When I click External Data » Access » Get External Data » Import tables
 and I want to select the file, I receive the message that the path is not valid.</p>
<p>It would be great if anyone could help me. I hope my message is not too confusing, I really don`t know much about Access.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            You don't split the database again.&nbsp; You just take a copy of the frontend and put it on the laptop and as long as it has access and read/write/delete rights on the share and folder of the backend on the desktop, you can access it while connected.&nbsp; Hopefully
 you are using a WIRED network and not WIRELESS as Access is notoriously bad when it comes to dropped connections while someone is using it.&nbsp; That can cause corruption.

    <title>Cross Platform compatibility&#47;When my students use my spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan_w_williams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross Platform compatibility&#47;When my students use my spreadsheet with protection on a mac and I open it on a PC, I receive a message that the file is damaged.</h2>
                    <br />

<div>I have spreadsheets that have fixed cell locations and have hidden features that are protected with a variety of passwords and locking features.&nbsp; These spreadsheets are backwards compatible to the .xls version
 of Excel and saved as .xls.&nbsp; The files are not binary. When users of PC versions of Excel (Excel 2007, 2010, and 2013) turn these in for grading, they work fine.&nbsp; When users of Apple OS versions of Excel turn these in for grading and I open them in Excel 2010
 or Excel 2013 (I do not recall a problem with Excel 2007, but that was long ago), they are reported as damaged and possibly having a virus. Sometimes Excel reports that it repairs the file and strips out some elements of the file, which may affect its predefined
 grading features. [The mac users also report other problems such as error messages with saving and an inability to format fields where I have set the field formatting as permitted.]&nbsp; I do not own a mac and do not care to own a mac, so the solution is not to
 make mac equivalent spreadsheets.&nbsp; Is there a PC solution that will solve the reported damaged problem?&nbsp; Solving other components of the problem (usability by mac users) would be great, too, but the primary problem is the reported damaged problem.<br />
<br />
It appears there are a growing number of mac Excel users, so this problem that used to be a minor inconvenience is now somewhat critical.<br />
<br />
I posted this under the current version of Office for Mac, but it seems to apply to all versions.<br />

            The PC and Mac versions have different protection options. There is nothing you can do except to use the least common denominator of protection which is simple cell protection. Many of the advanced protection features are probably lost when saving the
 file as xls. What happens if the files are saved as xlsx? This is probably the most compatible version across all platforms (but the protection incompatibility remains.)<br />

            The files were originally developed as .xls, so nothing is lost there.&nbsp; It is the platform issue that is causing problems.&nbsp; I can understand that students cannot access some of the intended capacity, I see this as their choice if they want to use a mac;
 but the "damaged file, maybe a virus" issue still seems strange.<br />

            <p>I'm going to guess that these workbooks use the Tables feature or the List feature. There was a full revision in the way Excel works with tables between Excel 2008 and Excel 2011 on the Mac and I think between 2007 and 2010 on the PC side.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The short story is the List feature introduced in Excel 98 on the Mac was finally adopted and called the Tables feature on the PC in 2010. However, the implementation was not a direct port from the Mac and some changes were made. Depending on which version(s)
 of Excel are involved and what update levels within the versions, I would expect you and your users to experience these warning messages. Generally, you should be able to click through the warning message and everything should be OK (assuming all updates to
 Excel have been installed by the various users). You should not lose any data, despite the scary sounding warnings. You will lose formatting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In a classroom situation, sometimes you have little control over the software and hardware being used. Ideally, everyone would have Office 2011 on the Mac, and either Office 2010 or Office 2013 on their PCs.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On both platforms it is essential to install the Office and OS updates that come along. Checking these on a weekly basis is a good idea.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should not use the old file formats. Doing so is adding additional opportunities for problems. Stick with Excel Workbook (.xlsx), Excel Macro Enabled Workbook (.xlsm) or Excel Binary (.xlsb) file formats. On the Mac, Excel 2004 (with updates), Excel
 2008, and Excel 2011 support these formats. On the PC, users of old versions of Excel should install the free
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><strong>Office Compatibility Pack</strong></u></a>, which provides support for the current file formats. Installing the compatibility pack does not give old versions of Excel any new features,
 however, so if you use the Tables feature in Excel 2011, 2010 or 2013 these tables will not work as you might expect in older versions of Excel, and you should expect warning messages to display going back and forth between older and newer versions of Excel.</p>

            My software is completely up to date.&nbsp; Also, I do not use the list or tables feature.&nbsp; So, thanks, but this isn't it.<br />
<br />
It is impossible to make files available to others who do use the old file formats unless they are in the old file format.&nbsp; Students cannot be predicted to be up to date and they cannot be predicted to be using their own computers.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;It would seem to me that part of teaching students would be how essential it is to keep their software up to date. Help your students with old versions of Office for Windows by pointing them to the compatibility pack. Show them how to use Office Update
 to keep both Windows and their Office applications up to date. This is something an every day user of Excel would take for granted, but I think you could take a moment to review this information and how it important it is.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another aspect of your teaching I think ought to explain just how much changes from one version of Excel to the next. Excel is not a toy like a web browser. It is serious software for business, education, and research. I think Excel has changed more than
 any other Office application over time. Pretending that you can share old and new Excel files without complications I think is unrealistic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact, this Q&amp;A we're having shows the importance of contrasting the underlying differences between Windows OS and Mac OS and especially
<u><strong><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/word-help/compatibility-changes-between-versions-HA102919731.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">from Excel 2003 to Excel 2013</a></strong></u> for Windows in your class. Choices must be made when designing workbooks
 that are expected to be used cross-platform. The most important new features in Excel 2013
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/excel-help/version-compatibility-between-powerpivot-data-models-in-excel-2010-and-excel-2013-HA103929426.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u><strong>work very differently even from 2010</strong></u></a>. This reality ought to be &nbsp;be explained, not shied away from. The concepts of updates and new versions are important content for your course.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PC users of Excel can <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/starter-help/check-file-compatibility-with-earlier-versions-HA010357401.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
check compatibility with older versions</a> when saving. So can <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/is-your-document-compatible-with-office-2011-for-m.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mac users</a>. Showing your class how to use these tools is every bit as important as showing them how to lock and unlock cells, IMHO.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft has made it easy for you to cover the basic features of Microsoft Excel. Everyone can have the same experience using the free Excel web application at SkyDrive.com. &nbsp;The web version is good for elementary school spreadsheets and beginner Excel
 courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you start including topics like locking and unlocking cells (presumably to
<a href="http://www.dummies.com/Section/Content-Search.id-324209.html?query=excel+forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u><strong>make forms</strong></u></a>) then you have to decide where to draw the line on version compatibility. If you want to show the latest and greatest, then you may have to accept the fact that not everyone will be able to have hands-on. PowerView and
 PowerPivot in Office 2013 are just fantastic. As a Mac user, I yearn for them. But even though I can't touch these two features on my Mac, I sure would feel cheated if I took an Excel course (beyond basic skills) and they weren't covered.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do get a sense from your comments that you want to abrogate responsibility for dealing with software in today's world where Apple is bigger than Microsoft plus Google combined, and "the cloud" is dumbing everything down. The software is what it is and
 as an instructor I think you have an obligation to help explain it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BTW - I suggest dropping lock and unlocking cells in your intro workshop, as this feature is not supported in the Excel web application. However, Tables is supported in the web app, and Tables is a far more useful tool than lock/unlock for most users. Make
 life easier on yourself and show them Tables instead of lock and unlock cells using the Excel web application for your introductory level course.</p>

<h2>            Updating Off Page References</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to get Off Page References in Visio 2010 to automatically update with the page it refers to? In other words, when i drop the off page reference shape on my sheet it also creates the matching on a new page or existing page. What i would
 like is for the original shape to say "TO Page #" and the matching shape to say "FROM Page #" and keep them in sync if the shapes are moved to other pages later on. Any assistance would be great! Thank you.<br />

<p>I am surprised that you find that it doesn't work in 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to reiterate.</p>
<p>You have one version of Excel running.</p>
<p>You set the option true</p>
<p>You double-click another Excel file.</p>
<p>It should open in a new instance of Excel.</p>

            We've had a couple of cases where this has been set then the user gets an error when double-click a excel link, but I can't repeat the error, it works fine starting a new instance.

            <p>I have a similar question. &nbsp;I currently have an excel file open and I want to know if there's a way to open a hyperlink within that file, into a separate instance of Excel. &nbsp;I have two monitors at work and want to open the second file (the hyperlink) into
 a new instance so I can copy data easily between the two files utilizing both monitors. &nbsp;I tried the "ignore&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">other applications that use DDE" and that didn't seem to work. &nbsp;It just opened the link in the
 same instance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Or maybe there's a way to open it in the same instance and click that file and drag it out of the current Excel instance into a new one. &nbsp;Much like Google Chrome does when you click and drag a single
 browsing tab. &nbsp;Chrome takes that tab and opens a new window. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What I have to do now, is manually open the 2nd instance and open the file and browse and it takes forever, because the files are buried in multiple layers of folders. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any suggestions would be great! &nbsp;</span></p>

</p>
<p>Why aren't there any updates? Its really sad that the software is so downgraded. It would be really helpful if it could be upgraded, because I would really hate to have to sell it after having it for barely a week.</p>

            <p>Hi Wilson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Do you mean to say the website that you have added in the "Compatibility view settings" are deleted after you restart Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>- Do you have the setting "Delete Browsing history on exit" checked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I tried on my system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Go to Internet Options using Search in Charms bar.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; In the General tab, place a check mark on "Delete Browsing history on exit" and press apply.</p>
<p>- Open a website and then add it to "Compatibility view settings" using the tools options in menu bar.</p>
<p>- Once you have closed Internet Explorer, the website added to the "Compatibility view settings" will be deleted and I have to re-add it.</p>
<p>- In the General tab, uncheck the option"Delete Browsing history on exit" and press apply.</p>
<p>- Now save the website in "Compatibility view settings", close and open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>- Website will be present in "Compatibility view settings".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the option "Delete Browsing history on exit" is the one that is causing issue with Compatibility view settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this not your case, then try to run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Type “Troubleshooting” without quotes in the Search box and select it.</span></p>

            Did you do "Go back to an earlier build" by any chance? If you did, you cannot go back to that build, you will need to wait for another build after that one.

All you can do is either wipe the drive and start again with an earlier build, or wait, there should be another new build in the not to distant future, hopefully with the issues fixed.</p>

            Wait for the next preview build to release. &nbsp;In the meantime you can still use the power options by right clicking on the Start Button and using that menu. &nbsp;Please read the announcements in the Insider Hub for known issues and workarounds (when available).
 &nbsp;Your issues are widely discussed in threads in this forum also. &nbsp;Please read before posting.

<p>If the above doesn't solve it.. There are different solutions reported on this forum..</p>
<p>1. Remove the SIM then insert and check..</p>
<p>2. Switch the phone Off.. Put it on charging and switch it ON..</p>
<p>3. Change the Network mode to MANUAL... It starts searching for a new network and asks if you want to go ONLINE...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>..Hope something works.. but pl. post your feedback</p>

    <title>Not receiving certain auto-forwarded e-mails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosskaminsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving certain auto-forwarded e-mails</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have seen similar questions to mine but have not yet found an answer in these forums or elsewhere.</p>
<p>I have an Office 365 e-mail address that is owned by my employer. (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>I set up a Gmail account for some business reasons but have set that account to forward all incoming e-mail to my company e-mail address.
</p>
<p>I have several other e-mail accounts at different domains.</p>
<p>Here's the issue: Any e-mail I send to the Gmail address from a domain other than companyname.com gets forwarded just fine to companyname.com. But any e-mail I (or anyone else with e-mail @companyname.com) sends to the Gmail account never arrives at companyname.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
When I add an additional forwarding rule to send to one of my other domains as well as companyname.com, the forward arrives at the other domain 100% of the time but again it never arrives at companyname.com IF the originator was at companyname.com. (It does
 arrive at companyname.com if the originator was any of my other e-mails.) The "message source" includes "X-Forwarded-To" and "X-Forwarded-For" that include both *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as well as my other e-mail address for e-mails which don't arrive in my
 companyname.com email box.</p>
<p>I would also note that my companyname.com e-mail address has several aliases, e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Having Gmail forward there also doesn't work and it strikes me as unlikely that Gmail would have any rule that would block a forward to an e-mail address
 that it couldn't know is the same -- might not even know it's really the same domain -- as the originating address.</p>
<p>I have tried using a "connected account" within Outlook 365 settings but the problem is that it checks the Gmail account inbox so infrequently that last night it took 20 minutes for me to receive the mail sent to Gmail in my companyname.com inbox. (And for
 some reason, Outlook 365 and Gmail can't communicate via IMAP.)</p>
<p>Also, I have added *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in the list of Safe Senders but that didn't help.</p>
<p><br />
Sorry for the complicated question but any help would be GREATLY appreciated!<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ross in Colorado</p>

<p>Hi Ross,</p>
<p>I just tested from my side with a gmail account and Office 365 accounts. I did not encounter the problem you are having. So to have a further investigation of the issue you encountered, I would like to confirm some information below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Regarding “<strong>When I add an additional forwarding rule to send to one of my other domains as well as companyname.com, the forward arrives at the other domain 100% of the time but again it never arrives at companyname.com</strong>”, do you mean when
 the email sent from other domains, the emails are successfully forwarded by gmail and received in other domains mailboxes?<br />
2.&nbsp;Can you share with the message headers via private message regarding “<strong>The "message source" includes "X-Forwarded-To" and "X-Forwarded-For" that include both
</strong><strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong><strong>”</strong>?
<br />
3.&nbsp;Do you mean all users in the domain of companyname.com have this forwarding issue?</p>
<p>I have sent you a PM to request the information. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.

<p>hi ross,</p>
<p>thanks for the detailed updates.</p>
<p>i have checked the entire mail header and found nothing unusual. to move forward on this case, i’d like to further confirm the following details:<br />
1. could you receive emails sent directly from a gmail account in your office 365 account successfully?<br />
2. regarding the third question above, what ran actually would like to figure out is whether the issue can be reproduced if another office 365 user sets up forwarding (forwarded to his own office 365 account) with his own gmail account, then one of other office
 365 users sends a test email to that gmail account. could you help confirm it? i’d like to figure out if there are any company wide rules that may block these kinds of forwarded messages.
<br />
3. please turn to your office 365 administrator to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
run a message trace</a>&nbsp;and check if the forwarded email ever reaches office 365. if yes, then share with us the trace result as below:</p>

<p>1. Yes, I can do that successfully</p>
<p>2. One tech support person said he reproduced the problem with his own accounts, but he also said he didn't receive forward from Gmail which was sent to Gmail from non-company account so I'm not sure he set it up right.</p>
<p>3. I'll try. They are getting tired of trying to help me with this!</p>

<p>Hi Ross,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, we may still need to further confirm if the issue can be completely reproduced on another user in your organization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have read the entire thread again and found the issue seems a bit odd, could you help involve your admin in this thread so that we can further check some organizational level configurations?</p>
<p>Your time and efforts will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Ross,</p>
<p>Based on the current information, emails sent from yourdomain.com to the Gmail account can be forwarded successfully to an external address but cannot to your own Office 365 mailbox, this indicates that the forwarding function is working fine. Since you
 have added the email address as a safe sender but the issue persists, there might be some server side rules or configurations that may block these emails. Therefore, we may not be able to further analyze this problem without your administrator’s involvement.
 Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have re-considered your situation and thought of a temporary workaround as below: you may try to disable the forwarding rule in your Gmail account and
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Connect-email-accounts-in-Outlook-on-the-web-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
set up the Gmail account as a connected account in Office 365</a>&nbsp;to access all the emails sent to the Gmail account. Note that in this case, all the incoming emails in the Gmail account will go to your Inbox folder in Office 365.</p>
<p>Let us know if anything is unclear.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>
