<h2>            Not able to install drivers for Cannon MX350 printer.</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Canon MX350__</p>
<p>Hi, I recently bought a cannon mx350 printer.&nbsp; Windows help and support (auto updates) believes it is not working properly and wants me to install a driver or similar. I cannot install it (though it does download). Why would it think the device is not working
 properly and how can I install this?</p>
<p>The printer appears to be working fine</p>
<p>There is no mention of any similar driver on the microsoft.com site.</p>
<p>Apprecaite any advise or direction</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Lethal42,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What happens when you try to install the drivers of the printer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try these steps to install the printer drivers &amp; check if it works fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. If you have installed any printer softwares, uninstall it completely from&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add
 or Remove Programs</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. You may manually download the latest printer drivers from the&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction/office_all_in_one_inkjet_printers/pixma_mx350#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>manufacturer’s
 website</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Install the setup files as administrator. Right click on the setup file, click “Run as Administrator”.<br />

<p>Have you installed Windows 7 without the Product Key (it is possible on a clean install), or have you only started the Install&nbsp;and crashed out at the Product Key request?&nbsp; In either case, does your Product Key match the edition of Windows 7 that you are
 trying to install.&nbsp; A Home Premium Product Key wont work in Windows 7 Professional, or Ultimate, or Basic, or Starter,&nbsp;or vice versa.<br />

If you are sure you are entering the correct Product Key for your Windows 7 edition then perhaps the best place to&nbsp;next got to is the Microsoft Phone Support, or the&nbsp;Activation Center.<br />

That disk may have been for a trial version of Windows 7. What Product Key <br />
did you type in? (Do NOT post it here... just note, it would not be the same <br />
as the one for Windows XP.) So unless you have a different Product Key I <br />
would suggest putting Windows XP back on your computer and confirm if the <br />
disk they gave you was for a trial/upgrade... Which you then have to pay <br />
for OR where is the correct Product Key.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to the extra page pop-up every time you sign in on a device that isn't trusted? Where in the extra page prompts you to enter a security code to sign in?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then you can get the new security code to your phone or your alternate email address, or you can obtain one through an authenticator app on your smartphone. You can provide new contact info and mark out-of-date email addresses or phone numbers to
 be deleted. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to wait 30 days to use account information because we don't fully delete any of your old info for 30 days, and you won't be able to sign in to your Microsoft account with the new info you add until the 30 days have passed. We're sorry for any inconvenience,
 but this waiting period helps to deter hackers from updating your security info and gaining access to your account without your knowledge.</p>

            <p>Hi Clive,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete your out-of-date security info and replace it with current info.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a 30-day waiting period before the old info is permanently deleted—in case you find your lost phone, for example. For details, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-8/delete-security-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I replace all my security info?</a></p>

<h2>            Xbox One Will Turn on for 30 seconds, then Turn Off</h2>
                    <p>So, when i power my Xbox One on, the light turns on for about 30 seconds, my TV does not recieve ANY signal (no green screen). Then, it will shut itself off. I have purchased replacement power bricks/cords and tried to “reset” them. It has not worked. Any
 potential solutions?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hey there </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure the console is in a open space and nothing on top bloking the vents. Also the console works best when pluged right into a wall socket with no extensions or surge protactors has they are own too cause power issues with the console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails and you already replaced the power brick then the issue is with the console itsself and it would need too be sent too Microsoft for service. you can set this up online here

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype web link</h2>
                    <p>Our organization moved to office365 and since the deployment we have been told to use&nbsp; Skype for business for meetings ect.. The issue is that some users when setting up Skype meetings have a "web link" for clients to use and others only get&nbsp; "Join meeting".
 I notice the versions between the two users of office365 one was on (2117) and the ones that had it were (2242) what gives? do we have to update everyone to a higher version than (2117) in order to see the "web link"&nbsp; when setting up a meeting? or is this
 a feature some where in outlook that needs to be enabled? any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Omar_234,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, when we schedule a meeting in Outlook Calendar via clicking the New Skype Meeting button, we will get the "Join meeting"
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82ed7c56-de72-4d6d-acca-26f53d1ee47a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82ed7c56-de72-4d6d-acca-26f53d1ee47a?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>So can you confirm if all users are invited by this way? As when we are in an Skype meeting, we can send the meeting link to users in the invitation email.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90dd6d16-4f29-472b-b43b-83caf5e287f0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90dd6d16-4f29-472b-b43b-83caf5e287f0?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, all users have an Office 365 for Business account now and use it for the Skype meeting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please make sure they are in the same version and the client is running with the latest version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

            Rudy, That's the issue, not all our users are on the same version of office365, those that were early adopters do not have that link below "Try Skype web app" they only see the "Join meeting". I have to manually update the entire version of office365 in
 order for them to see that link below the "Join meeting" for&nbsp; clients to connect. Is there a patch or something from MS that would allow any version of office365 to have that link below the "join meeting"&nbsp; for Skype for business? because I cannot update everyone
 one by one.

    <title>Reset to factory settings but keep Office package - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zakross  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset to factory settings but keep Office package</h2>
                    <p>Hello to you all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I am constantly on the move, I switched to using laptops almost exclusively. However, I still have two desktops PC that I think are still somewhat valuable (i7-3770 3.40Gh, 12GB RAM, 2TB HD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 for one of them for example).
 Therefore, I wish to reset them to factory settings and put them for sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only detail: on one of these two desktops, I have a fully functioning license for the Office package (one PC, lifetime), which is clearly added-value on resale. I cannot find my license key and I suppose that if I simply reset to factory settings, I'll lose
 the access. As a consequence, I've got a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the latest version of Windows 10, it looks like there is a "reset to factory setting option" somewhere. Is it reliable? I seem to remember that in the old days, resetting to factory settings was a bigger hassle, with the need to establish backup copies
 &amp; all</li><li>Is the Office license key directly linked to a Microsoft user account? Or is it PC-specific and will (as I suspect) be lost if I reset to factory setting?</li><li>Depending on 2): how can I safeguard my Office license key / access for the resale?</li><li>Bonus: any idea what would be the fair market value for the PC for which I gave the specs (not sure whether I can ask this here, please ignore if I can't)</li></ol>
<p>Many thanks for your assistance on this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your query regarding factory reset, it is quite complicated. Because you might lost everything with factory reset. Unless you have the product key of Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.But even you have the product key of one of that Windows, you
 might encounter some issues when it comes to Office. Because every office application is asking for licensed number. If we may ask you, do you have Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Game Lag... all installed games.</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering what I need to do to play games on my new laptop without horrible lag. Games like Skyrim, GTA 5, the Telltale games etc. are unplayable. Is there a fix or do I need to upgrade hardware?</p>

<h2>            Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation High CPU usage after installing Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this problem with my PC that's absolutely driving me crazy. I've noticed Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation process has been utilizing 25%+ CPU power consistently and jumps up to 50% at times. I updated all the drivers for sound card and peripherals
 but had no luck. My HP Envy x360 starting to get really hot and the fan was going nonstop at high speed and it drains the battery very quickly. I decided to try uninstalling Skype then restart my PC, and somehow Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation never went
 above 1% of CPU usage. However, the second I reinstall Skype, the same problem came back. I have tried with both Skype for Windows 10 and Skype for Desktop, both exhibit the same problem. Please help! Thanks.</p>
<p>

            Please report this problem as a bug - I doubt your the first person to have this issue and not the last. This will enable the Developers to see and hopefully fix it as soon as they can. You can do this by:-
<br />
<br />1) Launch Skype
<br />2) Click on your round profile picture at the top left hand corner of the screen.
<br />3) Scroll down to 'Help &amp; Feedback' and Select it 
<br />4) Scroll down and Select 'Report a Problem'

<h2>            How do you manually install windows6.1-kb976902-x86.cab&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Window 7 Professional N 32 bit.</p>
<p>The workstation sits behind a firewall that does not allow automatic updates so I download and apply them manually. For the Jan 2011 update we have KB976902. I downloaded the update (windows6.1-kb976902-x86.cab).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mu questions is how do you install this? Every other update has been a .exe or .msu. I can open the copy the contents of the CAB file but what do I do next?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thks.</p>

 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.

</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>

<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

            <p>My problem seems to be solved. I upgraded my PC with the help of ISO image downloaded from Microsoft site. Up grade went smoothly and when I check for update in windows update it downloaded and upgraded the driver for Geforce GT 230M and now it is working
 well. Thanks to Mr. Andre DE Costa for prompt reply</p>

<h2>            Problem deleting multi-gig files</h2>
                    I can't sign in because I am signed and can't sign out but I can't participate in the community unless I'm signed in.&nbsp; I ties up my laptop with these incessant delays. Can't I just delete the file?&nbsp; Windows 10 does this only when the file is too large
 for the recycle bin.&nbsp; I do considerable research for articles I write and consequently have large temporary downloads which are read, noted and disposed of.&nbsp; Thus, I find myself staring at my laptop screen waiting to Windows 10 to finally delete the file.&nbsp;
 Any help is graciously solicited and appreciated.

            Hi Leroy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can always sign out of the forums by clicking on your profile icon in top right, then Sign Out.  Then you should be able to sign in again.  If not empty your cookies in the browser's settings.  
<br />
<br />As to files that are too large for recycle bin, is it giving you the option to delete it anyway?  If so then does it ever delete or just hang?  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help and this is chronic then you may have install or profile corruption.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<p>Space is not the problem.&nbsp; I have multi-terabyte drives attached to my desk-bound laptops.&nbsp; My problem is the time-consuming delays disposing of the huge files which for organization considerations I cannot afford to let them accumulate on my drives.&nbsp; Often
 I only need the file for a half hour to an hour.&nbsp; This poses a problem when Windows 10 takes 10 or 15 minutes to scan, re-scan then dispose of the file.</p>

            Ok, thanks for the clarification. You need to use the built in Storage sense then. 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Change how we free up space automatically
<br />
<br />Click in the Storage sense list box and choose 1 day, do the same for temporary files.

<h2>            Multiple My Documents folder in C&#58;&#92;Users</h2>
                    I recently installed several programs that created folders in My Documents to store assets, etc. I was surprised to discover that instead of using the existing MY Documents folder in created a new folder with the same name in the same root folder. I didn't
 think it was possible to have two folder with the same name in a given parent folder.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Which
 operating system do you use?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 are the files that are present in all the ‘my documents’ folder? Are they different files or the same files present in the documents folder?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This may happen if one the “My documents” folder has been stored on different target location.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>I
 would suggest that you check both the folders location where they are saved using the below method.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click
 on any one documents folder and then click Properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the Location tab, click Restore Default, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Check
 what happens, try these step on both the my documents folder</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails then try checking the target location of both the folders by using the find target option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click
 on any one documents folder and then click Properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the Location tab, click Find target</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Check
 where the target location of both the folders is and check if any one goes to the Charlie user name location and later delete the one which goes to wrong location.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Redirect a folder to a new location</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Redirect-a-folder-to-a-new-location" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Redirect-a-folder-to-a-new-location</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check in a new user account whether the issue persists. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Create a user account</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I understand you are having issues with in-gameplay. Here in Xbox Forums, we do not have the appropriate tools or resources for in-game play. I recommend reaching out to the game developer for more assistance.

<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t boot up.</h2>
                    <p>I'm installing Windows Vista on an HP Mini laptop. After the installation is done (or more specifically, after the "Completing installation" screen), I see my cursor on a black background and nothing else. I left it for a few hours, but it just sat there.
 So, I restarted the computer and now it's hanging at the green moving bar and won't get out of it. Not even safe mode will work. It gets stuck at loading the "crcdisk.sys" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now running Startup Repair on the installation USB, which has also been sitting for hours. I'll try chkdsk and get back to this.</p>

            <p>Most Win OS installation cds have "Tools" incorperated in the cd,since vista installed failed,then on pc</p>
<p>start-up,enter the BIOS,chk owners-manual for the key to press,dell &amp; most are the F2 key,which-ever</p>
<p>it is,on start-up,tap the key.Once in BIOS,install OS cd,set to boot to cd (boot priority) HD is 2nd,</p>
<p>save &amp; exit BIOS..Look for "press any key to boot to cd" once started,best bet,delete the partition,create</p>
<p>one,format,use default settings,the rest is auto..Also,unplug all other hardware connections (printers/</p>
<p>networking cable/etc) make sure USB drives are not connected,reconnect all once the OS is running,</p>
<p>connect 1 at a time..Also,with laptop,connect the battery charger,if it wasnt connected before,internal</p>
<p>battery might be bad,thats ok so long as power charger is connected,plug-in,wait 20 minutes before</p>
<p>start-up...Also,any program/software/etc fails to progress after 12-15 minutes,then disable the software</p>
<p>or shutdown pc,these actions are called a "Open Loop" condition,no progress at all,these are usually</p>

            I would imagine that the computer's not compatible with Vista, seeing as they don't have drivers on their website for Vista (but for some reason, they do for XP) for this machine. This was all just a test to see if I could do this, anyways. I'm gonna try
 XP after I restore the computer, and maybe upgrade to Vista from there.

<p>try this defraggler, free version, I run it all the time, and the only thing it does not defragment automatically is mpcache, something to do with Microsoft Security Essentials,but you can click on view files and defragment separately.</p>

<h2>            Used Games</h2>
                    
<p>I truly hope M$ changes their stance on this before the console launches. While I can understand the frustration M$, developers, and publishers must have with the used video game market, charging money (supposedly full retail price) to play a used game is
 absurd. In fact, there are court cases going on right now to determine ownership of digital sales.</p>
<p>If I sell my car, the buyer of my car does not have to pay the manufacturer any monies. Yet I have never heard of the automobile industry crying about the used car market and trying to implement safeguards to prevent it. Essentially, M$ is saying that when
 I purchase a game for $70 from them, I don't actually own the disc. I only purchased the right to play the disc myself. I can do whatever I want with that disc but anyone else who wants to play that disc (that cost me $70) must also pay the same $70 to gain
 the right to play it. A great deal for M$ but you'd have to have an IQ below 70 to even consider this as an option.</p>
<p>I'll wait for more details to come out before making a final decision but I must say what seems obvious at this point. If Sony does not follow suit with this concept, the XBox One will only be competing with the Wii U as the PlayStation 4 will dominate the
 market again. Honestly, perhaps that's the way it should be. Sony will have had four consoles and aside from a lackluster start of their third console, they have never tried to screw their customers over anything like this. Sure they could do the same thing,
 but something tells me they want their place at the table back.</p>
<p>I owned the original Xbox. For the first time in my gaming life, the 360 was my only gaming console. I would be sickened to know how much money I gave M$ through the 360 alone. If this is truly what they are going to do, I am done with M$'s console adventures.
 Call me whatever names you like. If you don't see a problem with this practice, there is nothing for us to converse about anyway.</p>

<p>I agree completely and will be waiting on more details. I understand the argument of continued server costs for online side of games but i only tend to play single player and then sell the game on to partly funding my next brand new purchase.
</p>
<p>if they do go forward with this i would need to log in to my account if i was to say take a game round a friends or just loaning a game to a friend they would need my account or pay a fee. And what about a console with multiple accounts would you have to
 pay extra so as the rest of your family can play the games on their accounts?</p>
<p>I think Microsoft should of had this as a feature of Xbox gold and allowed someone to play their games on another console without the disk and allowing to stream from either their home console (not sure if that's even possible) or from cloud rather than
 it being another way to gain extra cash.</p>
<p>my opinion is if Microsoft do go forward with this i won't be buying Xbox one unless Sony go the same route or developers start to ditch the ps4 in support of this system.

<p>Hello fellow gamers. I'm in compliance with you guys on this. If I purchase a product in the USA. According to the constitution, I own that product. It's mine and mine alone. That's like saying you bought a gun, but in order for your friend or relative to
 use said firearm, they must 1st pay the company before they could use it. This is BS!!!! You (M$) are going to tell me and every other person on this planet what they can and can't do with things we personally buy (Like games). Really... I mean REALLY. So
 if SONY doesn't follow this direction..I might go with them. </p>
<p>This sounds like a retarded headache of a scam to me. It also sounds like a challenge to all the hackers on a global scale. When this system gets released, they are going to decimate this console to death. Also mandatory installs for every game. REALLY!!!!
 With only a 500gb HDD to start. Why not start with a 1TB drive instead. </p>
<p>Unless Micro$oft comes up with some changes by E3, SONY has already won over %60 of the Xbox users already.

<p>Worst of all, with this crap in place, you can't even loan a game to a friend. &nbsp;They'd have to pay to play a game that they are just borrowing! &nbsp;And what about game rentals, huh? &nbsp;The Xbox One looks like a contender in every way except the business end of
 it, and the gaping flaws with the business model could destroy the whole console.</p>
<p>I've been an Xbox fan since the launch of the original. &nbsp;Please, Microsoft, abandon this blatant attack on your fans!</p>

<p>Honestly I have always bought a brand new game from my local GameStop and never even returned a game as well. The only time I have ever personally bought a used game was Civilization Revolution because I couldn't find a new copy because most stores no longer
 had it in stock. It feels as though I am getting some sort of punishment for something I never did!

<p>I feel more like Sony has a Double (triple puts them 2 close to scoring position).&nbsp; They did say they would leave this up to the developers, the used games stuff.&nbsp; So, they need the developers to drive them in.&nbsp; Not a sac fly but a solid hit.&nbsp; I could very
 well see EA following this games route in place of the online pass.&nbsp; I do not however see this going over well, especially outside the U.S.&nbsp; If MS loses a lot in Europe they would fall way behind and that would effect many games.&nbsp; That would make a world of
 difference.&nbsp; And I would say that MS would not be that stupid but all people make mistakes and MS is run by people.&nbsp; For me, I really do not care about Kinect (am not complaining about it and understand that some do like it) and all those tv features.&nbsp; I personally
 have money set aside for multiple consoles already and these kinds of things will influence my decision.&nbsp; In fact I am going to be cautious&nbsp;now because they may decide to postpone this feature and implement it later.</p>

<p>What the hell are you doing ! &nbsp;I am &nbsp;Ret disable Vet with kids who love to play Xbox but now new systems and new games only ! &nbsp;Xbox you need to rethink this people like me will keep the Xbox 360 and not buy the Xbox one, we do not have the money to buy five
