    <title>unable to edit data in a chart in word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to edit data in a chart in word</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with editing the data of my created chart in Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked 'select data' or 'edit data' under 'chart tools' , a dialog box will appear saying 'The linked file is not available. To edit, the link, click the File tab. Click the Info tab, and the under Related Documents, click Edit Links to Files.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instruction but the 'Edit Links to Files' option is not there. So I proceed to use the 'Funnel button' which appears when you click on the chart. A similar message as the dialog box appears and the 'edit links to files' link is at the bottom,
 but nothing happens at all after I clicked it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried and retried, nothing seems to work unless I delete the whole chart and recreate by inputting the new data, which is a real hassle when I have reedit the layout for tons of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has a solution to this? Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            Is the data in an Excel sheet? Does it help if you start Excel before attempting to edit the chart data?

            Yup, the data is done on a separate kinda like dialog box Excel. I did try starting Excel before creating my chart but it still doesn't work. The Excel used for the data is a very simple version of the usual Excel, at the top left corner there's only 'save'
 (which has been locked from use), 'undo', 'redo' and something that looks like the Excel icon which says 'Edit data in Microsoft Excel' when I hover over it. It actually closes the Excel that I had been editing my data on and I had to redo it again.

                    Ok. a colleague of mine emailed me a file for me to revise. i went into my yahoo, went to the email and opened up the attachment.&nbsp; it was&nbsp;microsoft office doc.&nbsp; the file opened and i made many revisions to it.&nbsp; i periodically clicked on the save button
 while working so i thought i was fine. well, later i closed the document after i was done because i was going to email the revised copy back to them.&nbsp; well, i went to go look for it and I could not find it anywhere! where did it go?&nbsp; i thought that maybe it
 had gone somewhere into a temporary folder but i couldn't find my file in there. i ran a search for the file (scanning the whole computer) and nothing turned up. I really need to get that file back because i do not want to have to start all over again and
 sacrifice the time i put into it.&nbsp; please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Usually if an Office attachment directly opened and worked on from the email, the changes are stored in a temporary file. Temporary files as the name suggests
 are not permanent and are usually cleared when the file is closed or if the computer is shutdown.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try looking for the file in
<em>Temporary Internet files</em> which is different from Temp folder. Check the link below on how to open the
<em>Temporary Internet files.</em></span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></span></p>
<p><span><em><span>Note: In future download the attachment and save it on the hard disc. Access the saved document from system and edit it.</span></em></span></p>

            Please confirm you are running the Repair from the installation disk rather then from Programs and Features.<br />
<br />
Since setup cannot find a file on the setup disk, it appears there is a problem with the disk.&nbsp; Although it is not scratched, the problem may be as simple as a finger print or smudge. Try carefully cleaning the disk.<br />
<br />
Actually, it is easier to run Repairs from Programs and Features<br />

<p>The factory installed trial is typically called something<span>&nbsp;
</span>like “Microsoft Office 2010 Single Image” because it allows the factory to install all 3 trials (Home and Student, Home and Business, and Pro) at the same time. (For this problem you can ignore Office Starter, and an entry that is just "Microsoft Office
 2010") <span>&nbsp;</span>If you are uninstalling the factory trial to clear up conflicts with another installed copy, you MUST do an Office Repair of that other installed copy, boot the computer and you will probably have to also do an activation of the
 installed copy.</p>

            Hi,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4c23e13b-a0de-43c7-a8f1-0b3aae670afa" title="pavithrajayabalan">pavithrajayabalan</a>. Does this only happen with the Xender app? Is there a notification
 that the file was successfully transferred to your Lumia 540? Have you tried using another app to transfer the file? As for your Facebook concern, how are you accessing your account? Is it via the Facebook app or through the phone's browser? Any error message?
 May we suggest that you use a computer or the phone's browser to see if you can gain access to your account. Let us know the outcome.&nbsp;

<h2>            Spaces don&#39;t show as non-printable characters &#40;dots&#41; in document although non-printable characters are turned on.</h2>
                    Everything else like paragraphs etc. are visible except spaces. I don't get why because I explicitly marked the box to show spaces as non-printable-characters. I need to correct errors like double spaces in my master thesis. Hopefully anybody can help
 me because it's driving me crazy and I couldn't find anybody with this problem in other forums.<br />

            The odds are that they are there but they're virtually impossible to see. Apparently the developers wanted to make the space symbol "less distracting" but didn't take into consideration the significantly higher resolution of today's displays... My iMac
 runs at 2560x1440 so the character is difficult to see in any version of Word, 2004 or later. What makes it even worse is that the NPCs don't render any larger even at higher Zoom levels &amp; the space characters are a pale gray to begin with.<br />
<br />
To confirm, open a new blank document &amp; press the space bar several times. You'll still have to squint, but without any dominating text around around them the dots should be a bit more noticeable. If you're still convinced they aren't there you can launch Word
 in a new user account to see if there's any improvement. I doubt there will be any difference because all NPCs are a part of the same functionality, so it's unlikely that some would be working &amp; others not. If you're convinced that the space characters definitely
 are not displaying at all but do display in the other account, follow the procedures here for testing your Preferences &amp; your Normal.dotm template:<br />
<br />
http://word.mvps.org/Mac/DamagedPrefs.html<br />
<br />
http://word.mvps.org/mac/MacWordNormal.html<br />
<br />
You're certainly not the first to have the problem, but the buzz has died down a bit since the latest version has been on the street for some time. Please take a moment to use Help&gt; Send Feedback to voice your complaint to Microsoft. Perhaps if they get enough
 negative feedback they'll finally get around to correcting it.<br />
<br />
BTW: The individual check boxes simply determine which elements display at all times, even when the Show/Hide ¶ button is toggled off. There's no need to check them unless you only want to display certain ones but not the others.<br />
<br />

That was the THIRD THREAD ON THIS MATTER - they have all been closed - and still they come up with the same responses for you to provide the same information, seems they have given up asking which browser now.... &nbsp; UNBELIEVABLE. &nbsp; There are so many problems
 with Outlook and they haven't fixed any of them.

<div>Totally agree. &nbsp; We just want to abandon this outlook rubbish and move to another service. &nbsp;Because of contacts in 42 countries which we don't want to lose, we are still hanging in there hoping it will be sorted or put back to hotmail. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Great pity microsoft doesn't have the same interest in fixing it - appalling lack of response from them..... just the same old questions about which browser etc as if it is just on the user's computer !!! Even a child can see that is not the case - so
 it is just insult after insult to users. &nbsp;</div>

            My main gripe with Outlook, apart from the many bugs and inconsistencies, is that it is an INFERIOR PRODUCT to Hotmail.
<div><br />
<div>A product that is OVERLY DRESSED-UP with fancy windows effects and colors. A product that quite clearly has not been properly tested and is not in use by the developers themselves. The developers who appear to have never heard the old coding adage to EAT
 YOUR OWN DOG FOOD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We have a saying in our part of the world which seems quite apt: Outlook is&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>MUTTON DRESSED AS LAMB</div>
<div><br />
<div>But why? Why did you change it? Why remove an old, WORKING, product and replace with a new inferior one?&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            compare dates and prevent entry of earlier date - data validation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my spreadsheet I have a received date column and completion date column.&nbsp; I need to prevent the entry in the completion date from being earlier than the received column.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recevied&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completion</p>
<p>2/15/2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2/18/2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is allowed</p>
<p>2/15/2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2/10/2013&nbsp;&nbsp; this is NOT allowed, 2/10 is prior to the received date of 2/15</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The users will enter both dates manually, so I want to use data validation to prevent the earlier date from being entered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - in data validation is it possible to force two date criteria?&nbsp; I want to force entry of mm/dd/yyyy and also prevent a date in the future from being entered.&nbsp; In data validation, If I choose custom, I lose the ability to date and force my format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
                </div>

                    <p>So yea.... GFWL is KAPUT........ </p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than downloading a cracked version of my software (which works by the way), is my only other option (to run my legally retail purchased software) to run Windows Vista or 7 on a second computer?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like Windows 10 is going to be just like Windows 8.1 as far as backwards compatibility goes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah yes- running two computers (or 1 with VM) is SO much better! And for the Microsoft support staff (or groupies) YES I have tried compatibility mode (lol like that ever works), tried installing GFWL in the correct order (cannot install window essentials
 as it installs from the installer as Server 2012 NOT Windows 10), and tried every other fix available via GOOGLE (lol bing). Hell I even tried calling tech support. Turns out Microsoft and the developer both tell me to contact the other as is the usual case
 after money has been exchanged).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know making software (from 2010) compatible for windows 10 / windows 8.1 is very difficult but come on guys..... Its not like the problem is with just these two software titles. I guess I have answered my own question here and this has become a rant.

            There is a way to get GFWL working on technical preview. You need to download windows marketplace and run the installer in compatability mode with administrator preivelages. let it update, and also i suggest keeping backups of your XLive folder in your
 USER\APPDATA directory. It is buggy but it does work. i needed it for lots of my games was was extremely dissapointed to see that its been purposly blocked form even working just because MS is doing away with it. People still need this software to use products
 they have purchased. There is no point in places like steam being able to sell games that require GFWL if it cant even be installed on the OS.<br />

<p>Yes, that is the EXACT error message - "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook" in a box with a big RED X.&nbsp; Nothing else there.</p>
<p>IK tried following tip&nbsp; "829918".&nbsp; When I click on "Mail" on the Control Panel, I get the message&nbsp; "Your system needs more memory or system resources. Close some windows and try again"&nbsp; I have a new 2.3 Ghz dual processor PC with 4 GB of memory.&nbsp; I closed
 all windows and got the same message.&nbsp; I shut the system down and rebooted.&nbsp; Then I tried opening "Mail" again from the control panel with NOTHING else running... received the same message.&nbsp; I also get this same message when entering "control panel"&nbsp; in the
 Run option and clicking on "Mail (32-bit)".&nbsp; There is NO "Mail" option, just the&nbsp; "Mail (32-bit)"&nbsp; option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.;&nbsp; I also went through the process of deleting the "Outlook.xml' file and tried running&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Outlook.exe /resetnavpane&nbsp; command.&nbsp; That also gave me the "Cannot start Microsoft outlook"&nbsp; message.&nbsp; I also reinserted the outlook DVD and did a "repair"...
 didn't help.&nbsp; Then I completely removed the outlook software and reinstalled it.&nbsp; same problem.&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Any more ideas on how to fix this????</strong>

<p>No other Office/Outlook versions installed? If yes, uninstall them.</p>

<p>No, I am not sure about that. You can repair Office 2007? If you add<br />
another user account to Windows for testing purposes, does that help?<br />
Create a new Outlook profile with a new pst file.<br />
Any luck?</p>
<p>Do you use a pop account in Outlook? Try to repair the pst file to see<br />
if that helps:<br />

<h2>            How do I sync Outlook Contacts and Calendar between two computers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop running Windows 7 and Office&nbsp;Outlook 2010.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 2 running Windows 8 and Office Outlook 2013.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to keep the contacts and calendar sync'd between the two.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here's what I have tried...&nbsp; I created a PST file with the calendar information from the Win7/Outlook 2010 computer and posted it to my SkyDrive.&nbsp; I was able to see it with the Win8/Outlook 2013 computer.&nbsp; One of the problems is that I am not able to set
 reminder times for may meetings on the SkyDrive version.&nbsp; I also haven't tried to accept a meeting notice and have it place it in the SkyDrive calendar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; I have read about programs that will handle Sync'ing the information, but I would like to accomplish this without another program if possible.&nbsp; If I do need to use another program, any suggestions?</p>
<p><br />

Before we proceed, I need some more information to help you better:<br />
<br />
1) What do you mean by '<font><em>I created a PST file with the calendar information from the Win7/Outlook 2010 computer and posted it to my SkyDrive. I was able to see it with the Win8/Outlook 2013 computer.</em> '?
<br />
<br />
2) Did you transfer the Outlook data file (*.pst) through SkyDrive and imported it into Outlook 2013?
<br />
<br />
Since you have a Microsoft (SkyDrive) account, I suggest you to configure it in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 to synchronize Email, Calendar, Contacts and Tasks.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following articles for instruction on how to setup the email account in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013:<br />

</p><p>1. Error code 0x803F8001 while updating Extras &amp; Info on Lumia 640 XL.</p>
<p>2. Default Camera which is given in drop down tray of the system stops functioning.</p>
<p>3. Device get heated relatively when compared to Windows 8.1, apologies for my ignorance towards temperature part which has to do anything with OS version on device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Phone lags its speed compared to Windows 8.1 version.</p>
<p>5. Images in low light are like VGA picture even when Flash light is ON which is 13 MP main camera.</p>
<p>6. Considerably Front Face camera with 5MP has low image quality with its predecessor.</p>
<p>7. Camera freezes after taking 30 snaps due to which device had to rebooted couple of time to make it functional.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Caller image is not displayed as full screen with Windows 10 OS unlike its predecessor, it just shows small bubble, which looks like mole on face when compared to big screen 640XL.</p>
<p>9. Most of the Apps does not function which were used previously on the same device 640XL with Windows 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>10. Neither Bing nor Microsoft Edge accepts WIFI connectivity, it asks for Cellular data to be enabled and vice versa in some case when in same place.</p>
<p>11. With 8 GB (7.2 GB) internal memory 5.1 GB is used by System, have moved some of the apps from device to SD as we are facing problem with SD in this version I had to hold it back to Device which is consuming about 1.2 GB of device space which brings total
 of 6.3 GB out 7.2 GB on Device memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request Team to share fix or any source to get this resolved.</p>
<p>Note:This is based on experience as I've bought Lumia 540 and Lumia 640XL in same week which happened to September 1st Week of 2015, I have upgraded only 640XL with Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Safe Search on Bing</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; How do I lock my save settings on Bing.&nbsp; I have set my Safe Search to strict within my Windows 8.1 under my&nbsp;PC settings and that seems to stay the way I want it to.&nbsp; However, my settings that I keep making on Bing keeps on resetting back to the default

            It's not officially available for download to the public. There was a site that had the download, but it has been blocked.
<br />
<br />
If you can find it anywhere, the key setup file you need is: <span>
SetupConsumerC2ROLW.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; That will start the installation process.<br />

            <p>Yes, it is available, but you'll need to get Microsoft Office Pre-installation Kit (OPK) to get the download files. However, you'll need to be a Microsoft Partner to get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can easily find the SetupConsumerC2ROLW.exe setup file on the Internet. It should be available on download sites.</p>

Er, why is that? I'm just stating facts. Also, you said to ignore "Hey, just go to file share site and download and install it, tee hee!"&nbsp;. But then, it is not the case. The Microsoft Office Starter Installer (aka setupconsumerc2rolw.exe) is not a spyware or
 what, it is actually leaked by Microsoft itself, so it's usable.

Kidding for asking the files...I can't even get it now. The new TOPK doesn't include it. Forget it. But excuse me, I've never heard an example of malicious code on the setup executable.

I've been reading that too. Starting now, MS no longer distributes Starter to the OEMs. Apparently they will be switching to Office Web Apps as the "free" distributable.
<br />
<br />
I've read this in several articles in the last couple of days<br />
<br />
<b><span>Starter has gone the way of the Dodo, as of June 21.</span></b>

</span></p>
<div>
<p>
Microsoft’s note on its site about the new OPK states “Effective immediately, the Office 2010 Transition OPK replaces prior versions of the Office 2010 OPK.”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Starter is being replace by Office Web Apps.</p>

    <title>Excel as a BI solution - options&#63; - how can I accomplish these - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelday2580  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel as a BI solution - options&#63; - how can I accomplish these things&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently a Business Objects user. I would like to know how I might be able to use Excel and/or Power BI (and maybe SharePoint) to solve the following...
</p>
<p>I need an online web based solution with security around who can see and access each report/visualization.
</p>
<p>I need to embed reports&nbsp;within a website.</p>
<p>I need to be able to display reports that are basically just the data displayed on&nbsp;one or more&nbsp;worksheets (with some tabs hidden if possible) via the web. This is just numeric data used for&nbsp;financial reports&nbsp;and not a visualization. Formatting is very specific
 and can easily be accomplished in the Excel workbook by formatting each cell. This is something that can be much more difficult in something like a Web Intelligence report from Business Objects.</p>
<p>Cell level formatting needs to show and formulas need to work when viewing via the web.</p>
<p>I need to be able to make selections on the report/worksheet with selection lists etc to alter what data is shown.</p>
<p>I need to be able to refresh the data against a database (sql server or other) and provide prompt values that can be selected and sent as part of the query ('where' clause) so that only the specific data requested by that user is returned.</p>
<p>Basically, I want end users to be able to create reports with Excel, add in some database connectivity to supply the data interactively, and host them via a browser where the end user can refresh the data but not alter the data or formatting. I want to have
 the ability to embed that Excel file within a website.</p>
<p>I have looked at PowerBI a little and I like the visualizations but, for now I just want to be able to show highly formatted numeric reports with a&nbsp;few visualizations thrown in.</p>
<p>I would like to have the ability to schedule reports with prompts to refresh and send to users as an email attachment or URL link back to an instance of the file that ran and saved with the requested data.</p>
<p>There seem to be a lot of options and I get confused with what is truly possible.</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated. The goal is to reduce development time and use Excel skills that already exist but still have the functionality of a toolset like Business Objects to refresh data on-demand with prompt selections, schedule reports to various
 locations (email, file locations, etc.), display reports via a browser with security, etc.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Generally there are two options you may consider:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-a-Business-Intelligence-Center-dcd208d0-f50b-46fb-ac8a-3c9a8b2ab357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SharePoint Online Business Intelligence Center site</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Power BI.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence Center site is a site template in SharePoint Online with which you can create sites to manage BI contents. You can add Excel contents to the site page, and manage other contents and permission like other sites in SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>Power BI is designed in a more visual and interactive way for your data. You can check the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-au/article/Differences-between-a-BI-Center-site-and-Power-BI-for-Office-365-sites-a1455d75-9304-4c89-905a-d3402f7c61ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Differences between a BI Center site and Power BI for Office 365 sites</a>.</p>
<p>Also, we suggest you turn to our <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Power BI site</a> for more expert advices about Power BI. You can also sign up and start using Power BI for free.</p>

<p>That is strange ... not sure what is happening.&nbsp; Do me a favor and try this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a test contact on your device with a name called "test device".&nbsp; Add a phone number and address.&nbsp; Now create another test contact but this time on your PC.&nbsp; Call it "Test PC" and also give it a phone number and address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now sync your device with your PC and let me know what sync'd.</p>

                    I was charged on the 3rd of September for the XBox Music Pass, and just received an email that I need to pay again? I can't find a number or email for any kind of support with a person that I can discuss why this is with. I don't have the money to pay
 twice a month for something that I don't use an excessive amount. Help?

<h2>            Company Contacts and Office 365</h2>
                    <p>We are migrating to office 365 and I am trying to find the best way to manage company contacts.&nbsp; Currently we use External Contacts in AD with Exchange 2010.&nbsp; I don't like this approach because I am the only one that can manage them.&nbsp; The article below has
 some suggestions, none other than using contacts is&nbsp;adequate as we nee to access them in Outlook,&nbsp;but I am curious as to why Public Folders is not one of the options?&nbsp; Is PF still a viable option to manage company wide contacts?</p>

            <p><span>Hi DigitalMan161,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, you can use the options listed in the article above to manage contacts in Office 365. Besides them, you can also use other options such as public folder or shared mailbox for the goal. So the quick answer to your question is
 yes, you can use public folder to manage/share your company contacts. And it meets your two requirements: Others can manage the public contacts if they have corresponding permissions, also, you can access the public folder using the Outlook client.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_manage/shared-contacts-calendars-for-select-group-of/9d4c2807-abfd-449a-ac75-0007c854dd10?auth=1">
thread</a> about sharing contacts for groups of users for your reference. In your scenario, since the default permission level of a public folder is set to author which means your users can edit/delete their own created contacts in public folders, you can change
 the permission accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some articles for reference: </span></p>

            <p>Do you have any earlier version of office installed on the computer?</p>
<p>You will find the Office applications by going to
<b>Start</b> -&gt; <b>All Programs</b> -&gt; <b>Microsoft Office</b>.</p>
<p>If you do not see the Office application in
<b>All Programs</b> list, then the Office 2010 trial applications might have been disabled.
<br />
If you have the disc for the earlier version of Office, then uninstall it and repair Office 2010 Home &amp; Student trial.
</p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>1. Click on
<b>Start</b> -&gt; <b>Control Panel</b>.<br />
2. Go to <b>Add/Remove Programs</b> -&gt; Select <b>Microsoft Office 2010 trial</b>
<br />
3. Click on <b>Change</b> -&gt; Select the <b>Repair</b> option -&gt; Click on
<b>Continue</b>.</p>
<p>Ensure you have the disc for earlier version. If the Office 2010 trial ends and you decide not to purchase/ Upgrade the product, you will have to uninstall the trial and
 install the Microsoft Office suite from the disc.</p>
