<h2>            recover lost emails</h2>
                    My computer was wiped clean due to malfunction (and thus so was my Outlook account)...My account was programmed so that once I deleted an email, it would then delete the email from my hotmail account. &nbsp;Is there any way to recover those emails?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting us here in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand, you want to recover emails after they were deleted from your Outlook since your computer has to be cleaned. Let me assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be aware that when emails are deleted from mail clients or applications, there will be no way for us to get them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mentioned that your Outlook was set to delete messages from your account. Doing this, the&nbsp;emails were already deleted by the time your mail client has downloaded it and saved them on your computer. I hope you understand that we are not saving deleted
 messages in the system to ensure privacy and security of your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions about retrieving your lost emails, it is best to contact us through private support. This kind of issue require exchanges of sensitive information. To avoid posting them in this public thread, please submit a private support
 request. You can do this by going to this article: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> leslie f miller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a Yammer profile link in Word</h2>
                    <p>We sometimes have the need to post a link to someone's Yammer profile in Word documents we're creating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when we paste that link into Word and click it, we get an error message. If we take that same Word document and convert it to a PDF, however, the link goes straight through to our Yammer profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like it must be a bug (someone on my team said the pound sign is converting to a percent sign and numeral) because your own products should be able to work together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us a workaround so that we can use links to our Yammer profiles in Word docs?</p>

<h2>            How To convert a lot of WPL playlists in M3U format &#40;Windows Media Player&#41; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I manage my musics using 40 automatic WPL playlists (Window Media Player WPL extension).
</p>
<p>It's interesting because they upgrade automaticaly when&nbsp;I change ID3 Tags.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, to use it on iTunes or in my car, i need to convert them in M3U format.</p>
<p>I know that we can individually do it, by playing a WPL playlist and save as M3U format but its boring to do it 40 times.</p>
<p>I tried freeware WPLtoM3U converter V3.1 but it don't work on Windows 10</p>
<p>So, do you have a solution to transform a lot of WPL playlists in M3U format ?</p>
<p>Should be nice that we could select all WPL playlists in windows media player and then right click "save as M3U"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank's</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t update my N70, fw 5.0609.2.0.1 with NSU</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
As you can see in my title, I can't update my N70 with NSU v 1.1.27en. I bought and use this phone in France and its product code is : 0529147 .<br />
<br />
The actual firmware is v5.0609.2.0.1 . On NSU step 2 of 3, the software tell me "Your phone have already the latest supported software. No update needed", which is wrong : fw v 5.0638.3.0.1 is the new one.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I've read here that some N70 could not be updated by Nokia Sofware Update. Is mine a part of it? If somebody has an idea or a method which functions to make this update, do not hesitate to answer me. Thank you in advance!

            The GENERIC-firmware of the N70 is updated; this doesn't mean that the Operator-variants, i.e. Vodafone &amp; T-Mobile, updated THEIR firmwares as well . . .<br />
<br />
Nokia Software Uploader looks for the Production-Code of your GSM.<br />
With NSU, you can NEVER change your Operator-Firmware to the GENERIC Nokia one!<br />

            Thank you for your answers. SO even if I flashed my N70 from Orange fw to Nokia fw, I cannot update my phone via NSU, that's right ? SO the solution could be going to a Nokia service point to re-flash my mobile ?

Only if Orange releases a later firmware variant than the one you have, also you will have Orange branding again.<br />

Official service points are instructed not to reflash operator branded handsets with generic firmware, if they do they risk losing their franchise.

    <title>Mathematics Add-in for Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> car780  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mathematics Add-in for Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to reinstall Microsoft Office on my laptop, and when I did so, the new Office 2016 was installed. I find the mathematics add-in for Word and OneNote very useful, but I wasn't able to install it, as it isn't compatible with the new office suite.
 Does anyone know of a way to roll back to office 2013? I'm a subscriber to 365 University, so I don't have a product key. This means I can't just download and use an installer for office 2013, as I need a key. Any help with this issue would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            <p>In general, MS "official policy" is that they do not allow "retrograde upgrades" from Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reality has set in and in some very specific cases, ie company running Exchange 2007, they will support backing out.&nbsp; People with Viso and / or Project 2013 are also candidates.&nbsp; Everyone else is stuck with 2016, they have to suck eggs ... &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, a few people have figured out how to use an Official MS tool to allow any consumer to upgrade back to 2013.</p>

</p>
<p>I had the same issue, I kept getting the answer that it was IMPOSSIBLE from multiple Answer Desk associates! &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After almost giving up, I found a way to download and install the software manually using their own Development Tool. &nbsp;Another good thing about using this tool is that I can keep a copy of the program offline in case I run into issues down the road and want
 to reinstall Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tool to use is the Office 365 Development Tool for Click to Run, normally used for administrators to use for installations across multiple PCs.</p>
<p>The download for the executable is at:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=36778" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=36778</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After downloading the tool, you just need to edit a couple of configuration files. &nbsp;One to download the Office archive and one to install the archive.</p>
<p>I found some tips on how to use it at: <a href="https://blog.vsean.net/post/175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>example for Office 365 Home I used.</p>
<ol>
<li>&lt;Configuration&gt;</li><li>&lt;Add SourcePath=”C:\Office15\” OfficeClientEdition=”32” &gt;</li><li>&lt;Product ID=”O365HomePremRetail”&gt;</li><li>&lt;Language ID=”en-us” /&gt;</li><li>&lt;/Product&gt;</li><li>&lt;/Add&gt;</li><li>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</li><li>&lt;Configuration&gt;</li><li>&lt;Add SourcePath=”C:\Office15\” Version=”15.0.4753.1003” OfficeClientEdition=”32” &gt;</li><li>&lt;Product ID=”O365HomePremRetail”&gt;</li><li>&lt;Language ID=”en-us” /&gt;</li><li>&lt;/Product&gt;</li><li>&lt;/Add&gt;</li><li>&lt;Display Level=”Full” AcceptEULA=”TRUE” /&gt;</li><li>&lt;/Configuration&gt;</li></ol>

</p><p>Big thanks to that website.</p>

<p>When you contact Support, let them know you are upgrading your Office 2013 subscription to 2016 and are getting a message that Visio or Project needs to be removed. The support agents are being reminded of this situation and how to resolve it.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>People who have home/personal can also work through support on getting this resolved, and they have a process to get you back on 2013.&nbsp; If the support person is not providing you with a method to re-install 2013, feel free to give them my name as I am on
 the product engineering team, and own the compatibility matrix and the process for what to do for customers that currently connect to Exchange 2007</p>
<p>Let me know if you are unable to get this resolved.</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Everyone I talked to at Microsoft support said that there was&nbsp;no turning back from 2016 if you subscribe to office 365.&nbsp; Although it took four different attempts to get someone from support to listen to me -<span>&nbsp;
</span>… spoke with her supervisor,&nbsp;took control of my PC and&nbsp;my laptop, uninstalled 2016 and reinstalled 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One caution - make sure to set office 365 to not perform any updates or you will get 2016 back on your device automatically.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Here’s my Ticket number if it will help you: #<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">13057424482</span>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Finally, Viviana said there is a fix coming and to call back in about a month to see if you can configure exchange the way one you in 2013.&nbsp; Thx.</p>

            <p>Thanks all for your kind answers.</p>
<p>However, I am in particular interested in graphing (plotting) the equations. That's something you can (could) do with the Mathematics add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing the equations on World/OneNote is ok, but it is also important being able to visualise the functions as well. Mathematics help you with that.</p>

            Microsoft Mathematics-add in is a full CAS (Computer Algebra System) that allows you to solve most equations, factor and expand polynomials, integrate and differentiate functions, plot 2 and 3D relationships. . . .it is a powerful add-in that makes full
 use of the built in ability to type mathematics but extends this by allowing OneNote and Word to perform common mathematical tasks.

            <p>Hi everyone. I tried several times to install Microsoft Mathematics on my computer (runing windows 10).</p>
<p>Always the same result : install .NET 3.5, but it can't be installed with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed this program :&nbsp;http://photoservice.fujicolor.eu/downloads/PHOX/PHOX.exe</p>
<p>It installed .NET 3.5 and then I could install Microsoft Math.</p>
<p>And it works fine !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it.</p>

<h2>            Can anyone tell me how to make Outlook reliable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the past 6 months, Outlook has become increasingly unreliable and my clients are screaming.&nbsp; Things like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) lockups</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) whited out screens for 10+ seconds</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) shared contacts problems</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4) share a spreadsheet via email from within Excel and wait ... and wait ... and wait ...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5) etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started deploying Mailbird for clients as a temporary solution and I am starting to use it in MY business.&nbsp; It's great software and promising for the future, but it's not yet a solution for complex offices (e.g., those who need to share contacts with
 Outlook users).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>QUESTIONS</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a switch that might turn off the problematic features and make Outlook more usable?&nbsp; (I have not found safe mode to be a solution.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Should we roll back clients to Office 2010?&nbsp; (Office 2013 also seems problematic.)</li></ol>

            Which version and build of Outlook are you using? See File, Office Account for the information.
<br />
<br />What addins do you have installed? 
<br />
<br />There is no switch - and safe mode turns off many features.

<p>Thanks for any help you can give, Diane!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>3 COMPUTERS COVERED BY THIS EMAIL</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On my personal work desktop (32-gb RAM, Quad-core i5, 1TB Samsung SSDs, Win 10-64), Outlook v1803 (Build 9126.2559 Click-to-Run) - contains 3 email accounts connecting to:
<ol>
<li>My in-house Exchange server</li><li>Microsoft's Office365 server for my Action Pack subscription</li><li>Gmail account<br />
</li></ol>
</li><li>On a legal client's computer (quad core i7, 16GB RAM, SSD, Win 10-64), Office 365 Business -en-us(16.0.10325.20118) - connects to an Office365 server.
<ol>
<li>the attorneys all share their calendars, which seems to have become problematic recently</li><li>see more symptoms, below<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
</li><li>On a small retailer's computer (older hardware, probably old quad i3 with 4 GB RAM and conventional hard drive, Win 7-32)
<ol>
<li>she hosts her domain at some Exchange provider</li><li>starting yesterday, couldn't connect to her 3 email accounts, keeps asking for passwords ... she puts them in and gets:
<ol>
<li>"An unknown error occurred, error code: 0x80040605"</li><li>(I had a spate of this happen a few weeks ago on my machine, too.&nbsp; I had to create another new profile and ultimately got past this.)</li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>Believe me, we have had phone calls with other computers that have Outlook problems recently ... and the web is filled with similar complaints.&nbsp; I know we are not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other note - our in-house Exchange server is waiting for an update reboot.&nbsp; We have avoided doing this for several weeks based upon having to rebuild several computers lately due to failed updates.&nbsp; (BTW, some of the recent Win10 updates seem to have
 blown away the Windows restore files, so we really do have to start from scratch.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my problems occur with accounts on other servers, too, I don't think this is a contributor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>ADD-INS</strong></span></p>
<p>I only have a list of add-ins for my personal desktop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM addin</li><li>Adobe Send &amp; Track for Microsoft Outlook - Acrobat</li><li>Microsoft Exchange Add-in</li><li>Microsoft SharePoint Server Colleague Import Add-in</li><li>Microsoft VBA for Outlook Add-in</li><li>OneNote Notes about Outlook items</li><li>Outlook Social Connector 2016</li><li>Skype Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office 2016</li><li>TeamViewer Meeting Add-In</li></ol>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, I have not recently added any Outlook Add-ins.&nbsp; (Being an MSP, we resell the Ninja MSP software that includes TeamViewer remote access and management software.)&nbsp; All our clients have the Ninja software installed, including TeamViewer.&nbsp;
 But, that has been trouble-free for a long-time.&nbsp; (That said, lots of dependable stuff seems to be failing with recent Microsoft updates.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong></span></p>
<p>On both #1 and #2 above, we get the symptoms I described in my earlier post:</p>
<p>1) lockups</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) whited out screens for 10+ seconds</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) shared contacts problems</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4) share a spreadsheet via email from within Excel and wait ... and wait ... and wait ...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5) etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>I have not had these systems reported from #3, above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final issue I saw on a Workstation running Outlook 2010 yesterday - when the user writes an email and presses SEND, it goes to the outbox for about 2 minutes before it actually sends.&nbsp; She has been having similar problems for a few months, but I had
 changed her over to Mailbird, which seems to run fine with the same email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">32-bit and 64-bit Office</span></strong></p>
<p>I have personally reinstalled Office several times and the problems recur.&nbsp; (I believe these 3 machines are a mix of 32-bit and 64-bit Office.&nbsp; I know that Microsoft doesn't like to install 64-bit versions because of some code/add-in problems, but I have
 several large XLS files that lock up under 32-bit when I do sorts, etc.)&nbsp; I have also created far too many new profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>******************&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I hope this helps.&nbsp; Please let me know if there is anything else you need.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot - Outlook sometimes stops polling the server to check for new email.&nbsp; It can sit for an hour (I think I usually set 1 minute for an update time) with no new mail.&nbsp; If I reboot Outlook, I find 20-30 new messages.&nbsp; On my personal machine
 I have seen this behavior even after reinstalling Office.</p>

<br />1. Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM addin
<br />2. Adobe Send &amp; Track for Microsoft Outlook - Acrobat
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Acrobat addins are known to cause problems, depending on the version. Send &amp; Track causes some goofiness. I would disable any addin your aren't using.  The only one you really need is the exchange addin - the others are only needed if you use them. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; (I think I usually set 1 minute for an update time
<br />Exchange accounts should use the default when the account is created - it syncs as messages arrive. Some people enable it for a timed sync, but it can affect calendar &amp; contact changes. 
<br />
<br />IMAP &amp; POP accounts should be set to sync at 5 min or more - too frequent syncs can cause it to stall. (IMAP accounts will sync anytime you switch to a folder - the check every nn time checks the entire mailbox..)

 installed on my laptop and I use bigger monitor and not the laptop screen, which is connected by VGA.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Maira,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can connect Class Notebook to your LMS or SIS and then create an assignment in LMS and your Class Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating an assignment in a Class Notebook will distribute it to all the students in that class. The assignment and its due date will also sync automatically with your Learning Management System (LMS) or Student Information System (SIS) after you've connected
 your Class Notebook to the LMS or SIS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it's created, you'll be able to see the assignment in your LMS/SIS, and post grades directly from Class Notebook to your LMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 and syncing to NAS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> becky_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 and syncing to NAS</h2>
                    <p>I am using OneNote 2016 on my Win10 computer to store genealogy information - lots of links to sections, notebooks, websites, etc and lots of images. They are large files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to sync my notebooks to a NAS and use it's cloud services to access my notebooks from anywhere/any device.&nbsp; I'm not sure of the best way to do this or even if&nbsp;it works well? Do I have to try to store my notebooks on OneDrive and then sync my NAS
 folder to that because the OneNote app on mobile devices just wont sync with anything other than OneDrive and SharePoint?&nbsp; can I access my NAS notebooks thru its cloud site and open them in a browser using OneNote online instead of the&nbsp;app on a mobile device?&nbsp;
 If any of this is do-able, please explain how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to get&nbsp;a NAS, but getting it to work with OneNote seems tricky, and that's what I really would like to use it for (in addition to file storage and access).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love any ideas, suggestions or NAS recommendations!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            There are not too many options to make this work. I would suggest finding a NAS that is running windows storage server so that way you could install OneDrive on an internal hard drive of the NAS and use it native on the system. I personally use a QNAP NAS and it uses a modified LINUX operating system so there is not a native way to install OneDrive and make it work on the NAS itself. You would have to use a third party cloud system to be able to access the OneDrive contents on the NAS, like for instance OwnCloud. For example if I wanted this to work on my QNAP, I would have to map a drive to a windows machine, install OneDrive on that mapped drive and then use a cloud access app to access the OneDrive folder. The whole problem is the operating system on the NAS. 
<br />
<br />I hope that at least that gives you more information to go on. ;)

</p><p>Sounds complicated and clunky, but sorta workable.&nbsp; My main problem is OneDrive - with huge notebooks (500 mb and over) i'm going to run into size limitations and its just gonna be&nbsp;a big pain. I thought that there wasn't going to be&nbsp;a way to do this without
 it, but I was hoping....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish MS would program OneNote to sync anywhere, but I sincerely doubt they will do that.</p>

<p>Using OneNote you can forget all NASes based on Linux. They all lack a full implementation of the SMB protocoll, especially partial file locking (intensively used by OneNote). This results in corrupted section files.</p>

<p>There are reasons why OneNote is free on all systems. One of them (at least at some point in the process of finding a business model for OneNote) must have been not only to create OneDrive users but to make them hit the limits and buy more capacity.</p>
<p>So why in the world should Microsoft open a way to avoid OneDrive completely?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, in the "old days" OneNote has been able to store and share notebooks via local storage or network shares (also on a server or NAS). OneNote 2016 for Windows (the version that comes with MS Office, not the free version) still has this ability; of course
 only devices using exactly that version can access the notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BerndP may be right that there could be problems with Linux based server systems and NASes because MS is using an own sync protocol based on SMB for notebooks that are not stored in the cloud (the protocol used there is Cobalt); I did not experience any
 problems yet on an old Synology DS 112 with DSM 5 software but I do not use it very excessively as almost all my notebooks are stored on several MS accounts (another way to expand your storage capacity) and a Office 365 account (1 TB storage, should last for
 a while).</p>

<p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that OneNote and OneDrive are meant to go together and MS prob will never change that, but it would be nice if I could store my files on a NAS and then use&nbsp;the NAS's cloud services to access them.&nbsp; I was hoping for some clever work around to achieve
 this, but I guess there isn't one.&nbsp; oh well, that's how technology goes sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know about the problem between Linux's protocols on a NAS and OneNote, and I need a little clarification, please.&nbsp; Is the problem with opening notebooks directly on the NAS (putting them there and then opening them from there with desktop app) or
 with trying to install OneNote on a windows storage server on the NAS? Does the corrupted section issue happen to notebooks stored on OneDrive that is synced to the NAS?&nbsp; Any recommendations for a NAS that isn't Linux based (if there are any that work decently)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;like the suggestions of having a few different personal OneDrive accounts and spreading my notebooks around or springing for a personal off365 account (I have one thru work, but I can't use OneDrive for Business for personal stuff).&nbsp; If there isn't an
 issue with syncing OneDrive to a NAS or opening notebooks stored on the NAS, I will probably take one of those routes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for the replies.&nbsp; I appreciate all the feedback on my question.</p>
<p>

<p>As I mentioned I personally did not come across problems with OneNote and my Linux based NAS by Synology but I can well imagine that BerndP might be right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be no problems (apart from being limited to the Office version of OneNote 2016 and not being able to use OneNote for Mac, iOS, Android or the Win 10 App) to store and access the notes on the NAS. All you need is a network share (preferrably
 linked to a drive letter) and set OneNotes default storage location to that share in the options (Options - Save and Backup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Existing notebooks in the cloud can be moved by either creating a new empty notebook on your NAS, opening the one from OneDrive and copying or moving section by section using OneNote or by exporting the existing notebook to a ONEPKG file and loading that
 one into a new notebook (just double click the ONEPKG in Explorer) and when asked create a new notebook on the NAS to import the ONEPKG content into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where the problems that Bernd mentioned (corrupted or misplaced sections) COULD occur is when there are concurrent edits to a notebook/section from different devices and those edits have to be synced and merged from the local caches to the section files
 on the NAS. But again, I already did this and had no problems by now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to use a NAS because you want to access the notebooks from different devices or is it merely about storage space? For notebooks I do not want to be on OneDrive I just store them locally on my work PC and include the storage paths in my backup
 system (to the NAS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding using additional MS accounts: Best practice (that will work well with OneNote on non Windows devices too) is to still use just one account for OneNote on all devices but to share all notebooks from the other accounts with edit rights to this "main"
 account. So you do not have to fumble around with different accounts and logins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some additional information why this all is not as easy as it should be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are not talking about a simple file synchronisation like Dropbox or Google Drive do. OneNote is capable of having multiple users/devices edit the same "file" (files are actually OneNote sections) at the same time which is not allowed by common file systems
 (if someone opens a file for edit it is locked for other accesses). In addition OneNote is auto saving whenever a change has been made, may it even be very small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in mind imagine this: You have a large notebook (or section) with lots of pictures, PDFs or attached files. You make a little change to a page within that section (e.g. add a word). The WHOLE section file would have to be uploaded to Dropbox, GDrive
 or whatever cloud system you are using to update it. Not once, after every small edit! What a waste of bandwith and time (btw. this is exactly what is happening when people force OneNote to use Dropbox by saving the notebook files to the local Dropbox folder).
 In addition concurrent edits on different devices would lead to sync conflicts on the cloud server as different versions of the files arrive. Usually duplicated (or sometimes corrupt) sections would be the result as the server does not know how to merge different
 changes to the same file.</p>
<p>In conjunction with OneDrive OneNote is not using a file based sync mechanism but another one called Cobalt. This is also used on Sharepoint and based on splitting the files (in the local cache and on the server) in small chunks which can be individually
 synced. </p>
<p>Dropbox, GDrive, Owncloud and all other cloud services do not support this protocol, that's why you are limited to OneDrive / OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When OneNote files are stored locally (or on a NAS) Cobalt can not be used but Microsoft created a "similar" sync system when OneNote was released 14 years ago that works with the Windows file system. And this protocol is the one BerndP knows to create problems
 on a Linux based NAS, which -- again -- I&nbsp; personally can't confirm but I very much tend to believe him :)</p>

<p>Yes, my warning referred to concurrent updates on a a Linux based NAS (using SAMBA). Based on several discussions in this forum some years ago, before the cloud hype. And based on looking into OneNotes protocol with the well known PROCMON from Sysinternals.</p>
<p>Maybe one can take the risk as the one and only user 😉</p>

            It may be detecting it, but not removing it completely. Download Malwarebytes (free version) and run that. It is very good at removing the malware/adware. Also, I recommend running it at least every couple weeks to help keep the system clean. Running Defender
 and Malwarebytes together is a great combination, and works for many people.

<h2>            I can&#39;t find where to change logo and color of default theme</h2>
                    
<p>Our IT person put our logo on our theme, and also changed the color of the bar on top, but since she's not an artist, and I am our company's graphic designer, I had some suggestions on changing it to make it look better.</p>
<p>She told me to go ahead and make the changes myself and she thought she gave me the admin privileges I need to do it.</p>
<p>I Googled on how to change it, and what I found said to first go to "Company Profile" under "users" but I couldn't see it.</p>
<p>Our IT person went back and added in more admin privileges for me (although what she checked off for me were some things we don't use anyway, so we couldn't see why I needed admin privileges for tasks that are completely unrelated to changing our theme).</p>
<p>But after she did that, I could see "Company Profile". So I go back to my instructions on how to do it and it said to next select "Custom Theming", but there is no such selection I can see.</p>
<p>Do I need expanded admin privileges for every step in this process? Our IT person had said the last time she went in there to add my admin privileges, she had found a whole other page that she hadn't noticed before because she hadn't scrolled all the way
 down. Is it possible there are more pages she is missing? Or is there something that I'm missing.</p>

<p>O365 is a poorly designed product and even someone experienced ends up resorting to a "hunt and peck" approach. In the absence of a SP professional, you might want to engage a certified partner (it won't cost you anything) to help your organization navigate
 the labyrinth of options and features that Msft obscures from plain sight.</p>

<p>Yes, I finally got the logo to work, but changing the color bar has been problematic. I changed the color, then visited one of the Office365 groups to try to change its user photo icon (which I couldn't do even though I now have the highest admin privileges
 possible); it seems I have to also be specially appointed as a group leader before I can change it. But anyway, I guess the group's theme had an assigned color of pink and just visiting the group seems to have changed the color bar to pink permanently. It
 only goes back to the blue I changed it to when I go back to look at it as an admin. But when I go back to Outlook, it's back to pink. Our IT person tried to change the default colors of several groups, but she couldn't find how to do that either.</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm pretty much sick of it. I don't have time to be searching for every little thing, so I'm on the verge of giving up and just living with the ugly colors that seem to be stuck.</p>

    <title>Is 20 hour battery life on Lumia 650 normal&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew kwashnak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is 20 hour battery life on Lumia 650 normal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just got a Lumia 650 new from the Microsoft Store online on Monday (today is Thursday). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been charging my phone overnight because it is almost out by the time I get home. &nbsp;The first full day (Tuesday) that was expected because I was fooling around with it during the day (so nice and shiny!). &nbsp;Last night (Wednesday) it was a little better
 and I plugged it in and installed all of the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I looked at the Battery Overview and it read having an "Estimated time remaining" of 20 hours! &nbsp;That was right after unplugging the phone (100% charged) and before opening
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">any</span> of the apps. &nbsp;That would have lasted me until 3 AM tomorrow (Friday) morning.<br />
</p>
<p>So with nothing running, it doesn't last 1 day? &nbsp;Is this normal?<br />
</p>

<h2>            Words with Friends game won&#39;t download onto Windows Phone 7</h2>
                    Can't get "Words with Friends" to download. &nbsp;I didn't see the free version as an option. &nbsp;Am trying to download the one for $2.99 from the Marketplace. &nbsp;It starts to download, getting to about 50%, then error code c101a7d1 comes up. &nbsp;I have access to WiFi.
 &nbsp;I checked with my service provider, and I don't have a "purchase blocker" activated. &nbsp;Internet works fine. &nbsp;Outlook works fine. &nbsp;Cookies are "selected." &nbsp;Browser history has been cleared. &nbsp;One thing I did notice in the "about" for the game is that "push notification
 services" are needed. &nbsp;No clue what that is, but maybe I don't have that?? If that is the issue, can I get that? &nbsp;Or is there something else preventing me from downloading this game? &nbsp;Thanks.

                    Since the recent change in Skype I seem to have two accounts, one under my name and one under my email address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of my contacts are shown in one account but most in the earlier one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The invite bit, via an email, might work but not where the contact
 isn't even showing.&nbsp; How can I get to the earlier lot and transfer or add them to the newer account?

            Since Skype is now part of Microsoft product, deleting Skype account will be the same with deleting a Microsoft account. If you haven't updated or migrated the Skype account you want to delete to a Microsoft account, then you will need to go through it before deleting the account. You may use a different Microsoft account (Dummy email address) if you don:tm:t want your Microsoft account to be deleted. However, if it's already updated to a Microsoft then there:tm:s no option to unmerge it and it will delete the Microsoft account as well.

            The prt extension, while not an especially good idea, should not affect the outcome, as Word can recognize its own file types from their internal structure (though FileBlocking may be an issue with old DOC file formats). This is a security issue. Try making
 the document folder containing the file a trusted folder.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Vista machine that is a couple months old, and I am now trying to sync a new windows pc phone (Samsung i760 - windows mobile 6).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using outlook and have a lot of entries into the calendar, and contacts.&nbsp; My sync is set up to transfer calendar, contacts, and favorites.&nbsp; It says it is done syncing, but afterwards, my phone still have no contacts, and no calendar entries
 (the computer outlook still has everything)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem as described by the previous writer.&nbsp; That is, eventhough both my Smartphone and my computer both say they are syncing, nothing gets transferred.&nbsp; I know both the phone and the computer are communicating because from either location
 I can try to sync and both machines indicate they are doing so. I tried to follow your answer, but I'm not sure which "start" tab&nbsp;you are referring to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Vista 64 and have a T-Mobile Dash phone.&nbsp; I use Outlook extensively and there are many entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as I'm mentioning problems, I have a add-on software program called Splash ID, which coordinates encripted data between my computer and the Smartphone.&nbsp; I don't see anywhere in the Mobile Device Center that will allow me to sync this
 informaton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;it didn't sync the calendar or outlooks.&nbsp; it did sync my favorites though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - I am using outlook 03, not 07 - but it seems like there are multiple people having issues.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Try entering one test entry on your device and then see if it syncs over to your PC.&nbsp; Then do the same on your PC using a different name and see if it syncs.</p>

I look on my samsung phone and don't have a setting to disable "enable advanced network functionality".....at least not that I can find.&nbsp; I think that I'll uninstall the windows mobile device center, reinstall and try it again.&nbsp; This is very frustrating.

            Thanks for filling in the blanks.&nbsp; You are right, you disable it on the phone under the "Start" menu, then "Settings," then "Connections," then "USB to PC."&nbsp; Unfortunately it was already disabled.&nbsp; I tried reenabling it and then disableing it again and
 nothing&nbsp;changed.&nbsp; Seems to me that the phone and the computer are communicating, but&nbsp;Windows Mobile isn't looking in the right area for the correct files.&nbsp; There's nothing in Windows Mobile that can allows me to change where it's getting its information from.&nbsp;
 Any more&nbsp;suggestions?&nbsp;

<p>On your device,&nbsp;go to Start - Settings - Connections and locate USB to PC.</p>
<p>Clear the check box for "Enable Advanced Networking Functionality".

            I did get windows mobile to work.&nbsp; First, I uninstalled and reinstalled the application.&nbsp; Second, I ended the partnership and created a new partnership.&nbsp; Four hours later it finished syncing.&nbsp; I will install the sybase application today and see if it works
 better.&nbsp; Four hours to sync is a little insane. ....but really appreciate everyone's help here.
