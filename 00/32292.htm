<h2>            Surface is so slow it&#39;s practically unusable</h2>
                    <p>Over the last two days (I believe after the last update) my Surface RT (1st gen) has been so slow that it's basically unusable. I am amazed that I am actually able to type this post because I spent 3 minutes on the title alone. When I check the Task Manager,
 the Disk stays at 99% MOST of the time. Very rarely it dips below that, so that my apps get a chance to do something. I have no idea what's using the disk, because it's not listed. I have maybe 30 processes running with 5 of them doing 0.1 MB/s and the rest
 0.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am basically at wits' end, sometimes it takes 1-2 minutes just to get past the password screen, after entering the password. Launching apps is like playing the lottery, even the f*cking volume button doesn't work. Why would disk load affect a hardware
 audio volume button????? While the disk is at 99% utilization (which is most of the time) I can't switch between apps, I can't go to the start menu, like I said, basically the Surface is an expensive, but stylish, paperweight. It took almost the entire afternoon
 to sync my Windows Phone (a hundred something photos).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. I have the 32 GB model and still got about 2 GB of free disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Florin</p>

            <p>I think the problem is the buffer the machine creates to optimize the flow of work you do with it. &nbsp;With 2GB of free space, it might start to get crowded down now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a hard disk, it would not be an issue but SSD drives get slower when you fill them up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best advice is to get a 32GB or 64GB micro-SD card and move all of your files onto it (documents, pictures, music, and videos). &nbsp;When you are finished moving the files, the tablet should be about 48% free and you should see a massive speed boost. &nbsp;The only
 thing that would be using space would be Onedrive and it can be relocated to the micro-SD card also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Music app will look in the micro-SD card for your music but the Video app; you click on the title menu "Xbox Live" and select the micro-SD card for locating your videos. &nbsp;When you buy and download videos, those will store on the tablet and after they
 download, you can move them from the Videos/Movies folder onto the micro-SD card to keep the space free on the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still running slow after doing all of that, run a REFRESH and re-install all of your updates.</p>

<h2>            Suddenly can&#39;t drag or drop files anymore in windows 7 &#40;64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
I have a new Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit) laptop. I've not installed any new programs (auto-updates either) or what I know changed any settings, but suddenly today I can no longer drag and drop files on my laptop... this is everywhere, but most noticeably
 on the desktop, where I usually put files and group then where I want. If I want to move files from the desktop to My Documents I have to now cut and paste them!!!
<br />
<br />
What is going on? <br />
<br />
Have I inadvertently changed a setting? How do I get this function back as it is vital!!<br />
<br />
Sincerely, and with thanks,<br />
<br />
Judd<br />

            <p>This sounds too simple to work, but it worked for me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Find an affected icon.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Click and HOLD the icon with the Left mouse button.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Press Esc while holding the Left mouse button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it!&nbsp; This was driving me crazy.&nbsp; It had nothing to do with registry entries or anything else.&nbsp; Simply a failed Drag &amp; Drop operation that hadn't exited.&nbsp; Even restarting had only worked temporarily, so I suspect my Esc key may have been stuck down
 or at least the system thought it was!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My&nbsp;particular variant of this problem seems to stem from either a Virtual Machine taking mouse focus, or a browser window (I was running a VM inside a browser window) then being interrupted during mouse action.</p>

<h2>            After reinstalling Windows 10 cannot use device drivers unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm new here and have searched the internet for 2 days and cannot find what I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue.</p>
<p>I purchased a Nextbook Flexx 11 on ebay, when I received it, it was reset to Administrator, I was not able to to create accounts, all I got was the spinning wheel, I also could not do a recovery, got a message "could not find recovery envirement". So I downloaded
 windows iso and did a fresh install&nbsp;of windows 10 using flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my issue is that most of the features don't work due to no drivers being available online anywhere that I can find. and Nextbook support will not resond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some items not worki</p>
<p>Touch Screen,</p>
<p>No Audio</p>
<p>Will not read microsd.</p>
<p>Home button not working</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a recovery for this NXW116QC264? Or know of any other way to get this back to original</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need Windows 10 or Recovery iso for Nextbook Flexx 11- Original Title</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have provided us, I would suggest that you contact ebay and check if they can provide a recovery drive for your device. You can also approach the manufacturer of the device and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to the drivers, I would suggest that you visit the website of the drivers manufacturer and check if you can find the drivers for Windows 10. If not download the latest drivers and try to install it in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Right click/tap twice&nbsp;the <strong>driver setup file
</strong>and select <strong>Properties</strong> then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility
</strong>tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Place a check in the<strong> Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>: box.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click
<strong>OK.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Try installing the driver/software and check.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p>There are no drivers for this model on Next books &nbsp;website, they have a recovery download section but there's nothing to download, I contacted them but didn't get a response yet, I'm hoping someone that's has this device could create a recovery disk is and
 share it with me.</p>

<h2>            repair XP OS running in XP mode under Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have W7 and XP Mode, but my XP instance is now corrupted with&nbsp;an overwriten ole32.dll after I ran an old &nbsp;VB6 setup.exe filein XP (so lesson learned there as well....) . Anyways, I can't get XP to load properly just a blank screen, so no file navigation
 via Explorer, also the integration features&nbsp; are not enabled, but after accepting a load of repeated DLL errors (error text is can't find entry point ABC in ol32.dll) I can&nbsp;finally get a cmd prompt window from new task in TaskMngr and can see the XPMUser c:
 drive (but not the floppy a: drive on the parent machine). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas about how to restore the ole32.dll file ?&nbsp;Where for example does the XP set up programme get the files from and can you extract specifc files from this source. If it's on the parent machine c: drive I suspect I won't be able &nbsp;to see that drive
 through the DOS cmd promt anyway but that would still be useful for future reference.
</p>
<p>Next time I will use the restore point features I see are available in the&nbsp; virtual machine configuration options. thanks David</p>

 to login to a Microsoft account and the troubleshooting option is not working either.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have error code 0x803fa067 in the activation menu and my&nbsp;<span>slmgr.vbs /dlv is this&nbsp;</span>.&nbsp; Thank you for your help!

<h2>            Want Penguins on Windows 10 Welcome Screen.</h2>
                    <p>There is a new picture every day, with some repeats. Normally one picture repeats all day. One day I had penguins twice, and then it moved on to another photo. &nbsp;Penguins have never showed up again. &nbsp;I WANT PENGUINS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some place these images are stored? &nbsp;Can I mark images to show more frequently? &nbsp;Can I download them to use?</p>

<div>While you can't resize the icons - you can change the desktop scaling, which</div>
<div>changes everything - but instead of that, you might want to look at</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t see all photos on SD card &#38; photos lost in Onedrive upload</h2>
                    &nbsp;I bought the Surface 3 days ago. Since then I have experienced problems uploading photos from my SD card, using an Inca USB 2.0 Compact card reader, onto the Surface. The surface does not show all the photos I have taken.&nbsp; After I upload the photos I
 see available, the rest of them cannot be seen. I put the SD card back into my camera and they're still there. When I insert the card reader into the surface, a notification from Onedrive says " No new photos or videos to upload", when they are! The first
 time I uploaded photos to Onedrive, they disappeared and I still can't find them. What is left on my SD card is blank file with the name: USB Çf³&nbsp; PLEASE HELP ME :'(

    <title>which is better - Local Account or Microsoft Account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            which is better - Local Account or Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There have been lots of thread on this. many unanswered and many with conflicting advice. In an earlier thread I'd asked about a Microsoft Account and that's the route I chose. I think the PIN number sign-in is far better than a Local Account (although with
 the latter I can save my password in Norton's Vault). Someone in one of those threads&nbsp;gave some excellent advice about selecting a PIN number and it's worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until a week ago - when my Microsoft Account on this, my new PC, was changed to a Local Account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've no idea why it changed but should I now take the Settings &gt; Accounts route to change it back again or do I need to start the bother of investigating why it changed? As far as I'm aware, this issue hasn't been linked to the "Windows Updates causing damage"
 problem.</p>

            <p>It's not a question of which is better. They are two different types of account. Choose the one that you prefer. Windows 10 works exactly the same no matter which account you choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real difference between a local account and an online account - whether it's a Microsoft account, a Google account, a Yahoo account, etc. is that an online account lets you store files and system settings in the cloud. With a local account, all
 your files and system settings are stored on the local machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online service providers like Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, Google, etc. <em>want</em> you to store your data in the cloud, because it benefits them, so they each have their own tricks and gotchas to entice you. For example, you can only get apps from the Windows
 Store if you have a Microsoft account. But that only means you have to sign up for a Microsoft account, which you can do online. You don't actually have to use your Microsoft account on Windows 10 if you don't want to.</p>

<p>Windows Explorer (WE)&nbsp;doesn't seem to be able&nbsp;to open MP4&nbsp;files in Windows 10. You first have to copy them into a library that Media Player can read. As a school teacher that relies&nbsp;on video as a teaching media, this is an annoying extra step.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;WE seems
 to have issues reading some image files. Please don't think about phasing out WE.</p>

<p>I recently installed Windows 7 HP. I wanted to turn on presentation mode so that my computer wouldn't go to sleep, but when I opened Windows Mobility Center, that option was missing. I tried navigating to the folder where the actual file for managing those
 options is located, but it was missing as well (C:\windows\system32\presentationsettings.exe). I searched the entire hard drive for it, and I found another copy in an obscure location. When I tried to open it nothing happened. What can I do to get that feature
 back?</p>

<p>I had this issue resolved by emailing a Microsoft executive. Of course, I wasn't able to speak with him directly, but the people responsible for answering his emails handled the problem beautifully. Of course they went through all the steps to make sure
 that I had a real problem, and then the correspondent decided to just give me a serial number for Windows 7 professional, which I was able to upgrade to using Windows Anytime Upgrade, which took less than 10 minutes. Now I am a happy camper.</p>
<p>NOTE: I was given this serial number for free ONLY BECAUSE I pointed out that the website I mentioned previously said that Home Premium had the feature when it didn't. I don't recommend trying what I did because as someone mentioned, the website has been
 edited and Home Premium is no longer listed.</p>

<p>For anyone who is stuck with Home Premium for whatever reason, there is a great piece of software that I tried out before I got this issue resolved, and it's called Caffeine (self-explanatory name). It's a very lightweight program (15 KB in size), and it
 works just as well as presentation mode. It will serve as a great replacement for the hole that Microsoft so arrogantly decided to leave in Home Premium.</p>

</p><p>If Windows 8.1 came preinstalled on your Asus&nbsp;machine when you bought it, there should be a Recovery Partition on it to reinstall the Operating System back to Factory Settings (new condition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You access that by pressing F9 at Boot &gt;troubleshoot &gt; etc.</p>

            <p>To summarise&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Asus laptop in the office</strong></p>
<p>Upgraded to AU. &nbsp;USB3 HDD plugged into any of its 3 ports is not recognised, and Disk Manager lists the file system as RAW. &nbsp;Disk works perfectly on non-updated machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Home</strong></p>
<p>USB3 HDD connected to USB3 port of Netgear router on 4 machine network</p>
<p>2 of the machines have updated to AU. &nbsp;Disk (READYSHARE) is reported as being not accessible, but is accessed perfectly on non-updated machines.</p>
<p>Disk works when plugged into local USB2 port on updated desktop, and on the USB (2 and 3) ports of updated Lenovo Yoga 700 11.6"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This cannot be a driver problem, since I am not aware that the client machines need drivers to access a USB port on the router - please correct me if I am wrong</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the clean boot on the Lenovo and the network disk is still not recognised. &nbsp;This has only occurred after the anniversary update, so there is quite simply a Microsoft bug, which they really must address quickly. &nbsp;Judging from the number of similar
 posts, there must be thousands of people experiencing this problem</p>

<h2>            2 devices with problems in device manager &#40;marked yellow triangle with exclamation point and Properties says Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. &#40;Code 39&#41;&#41; Modem &#38; USB__</h2>
                    1. Modem &gt; Toshiba Software Modem<br />
2. Universal Serial Bus Controllers &gt; Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader and whenever i insert flashdisks on either one of my USB ports, it also gets an error.<br />
<br />
<br />
can you please provide me as many solutions as you have in my mind... like if this [solution] doesn't work, do this [other one]...<br />
<br />
and btw, this happened after i tried to use a webcam.&nbsp;my laptop automatically&nbsp;recognized it&nbsp;but then when i tried to install it, there was an error then the deadly BLUE SCREEN appeared&nbsp;saying there was an error blah blah blah.. and&nbsp;when i restarted my laptop,
 my&nbsp;touchpad won't work, and so i went to&nbsp;control panel&gt;mouse&gt;and i tried to uninstall the Synaptics PS/2 Port Touchpad hoping that it would work then after restarting, it worked! but i'm using now the default [i think] hardware PS/2 Compatible Mouse &amp;&nbsp;i can't
 install Synaptics PS/2 Port Touchpad anymore 'cause whenever i do that, it goes back to not functiong again!<br />
<br />
and then after, i also realized that my USB ports are not functioning. It cannot recognize any flashdisk or memory card that i insert.&nbsp; I try to uninstall them at the Device Manager, together with the Modem, but after restarting, the exclamation point always
 comes back! what can i do? pls...<br />
<br />
i have Toshiba L305-S5919

            Reinstall the drivers for your computer. Get them from Toshiba's tech support website for your specific model laptop. I would reinstall at least the drivers for the motherboard and the touchpad but check to see if there are other drivers or patches that
 might be involved.

<h2>            XBOX ONE MEDIA PLAYER</h2>
                    Hey, I have an external hard drive which I connect to my Xbox one via USB and stream videos....While I'm happy that Microsoft finally added this feature to the system (ABOUT TIME!) I have noticed when i play videos they are kind of choppy, almost like
 skipping as if the frame rate was really bad....NEVER had an issue like this on my 360, any ideas of what could possibly be going on, or ways to fix it? OR is this an issue Microsoft will have to fix?!?!?!? I have been disappointed in this system so far....Thanks
 for any help in advance. Greg

<p>I have the same problem, even using USB 3.0 thumbdrives. It seems mostly to happen with video encoded with XVID, or videos that have a "high" bit rate. I have never seen this issue on any type of device when connected directly with usb. I would understand
 over wireless if the connection is bad, but come on plugged in direct usb should never be an issue with bitrates.</p>

 pressed cancel. Now the drive doesn't show up in the media player or in the storage area in the settings. The drive is a WD my passport. Has anyone had a similar problem? I contacted support and they told me that it must be a problem with the drive, but I
 would like to figure out what's going on. Thanks a lot.</p>

                    I have a dell laptop. the screen broke so I took the hard drive an installed it into another dell lap top. Now it wants me to activate windows. This original had Windows 7 Pro and I upgraded for free to windows 10 Pro. It says I don't have a valid digital
 license or key. Error Code: 0xC004C003... even though it shows the product keys last five digits. Supposedly I can skip the key with the free upgrade but i will not let me. How do I resolve this?

<br />

            Did you upgrade from a Windows 7 Professional retail store bought license or a preinstalled license?
<br />
<br />It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.

    <title>Minesweeper Adventure - Limited Playing Field - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minesweeper Adventure - Limited Playing Field</h2>
                    <p>Have played Minesweeper Adventure on Windows 8 with no issues. Just upgraded to Windows 10. Now when Minesweeper Adventure is launched the entire playing field is not displayed. Field is cut off on the right side of display. As one progresses through the
 playing field the field will scroll to the left. However this scrolling will only proceed to a certain point. The very end of the playing field will not be displayed until one plays with zooming in and using the mouse to drag the playing field to the left.
 Have played with the display settings with no success. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

            <p>I have developed this same problem, with the Minesweeper Adventure and its "twin," the Microsoft Treasure Hunt app. I have not had any problems until the most recent Windows 10 update. I haven't changed any settings, so it's clearly a Windows 10 issue, and
 these are Microsoft apps. Very frustrating to say the least.</p>

            I have been playing Minesweeper and Treasure Hunt for years.&nbsp; In fact, Treasure Hunt was my favorite game.&nbsp; I am very disappointed that I will not be able to play anymore, since I cannot see/find the "magic tunnel" at the end of the level.

            I also have the exact same issue on not one but both of my windows 10 laptops. We have tried changing resolution and everything (same as John all round). It is only in Minesweeper Adventure mode that this issue occurs. I would say that there is some sort
 of incompatibility between Minesweeper Adventure and Windows 10.

<h2>            Mahjong Themes - can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get back to original</h2>
                    
<p>I like the original Mahjong theme. I occasionally will click another theme just to have the tiles look different, but my preference is the default original.</p>

<p>However, as of about two months ago, I cannot find the original theme. I only get the options for Under Water, Cosmos, Tranquility, and Autumn Glade. What happened to the one the game started with?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello rhodesmk,</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that there is currently no way to revert to the original theme. &nbsp;Of the four current themes, Tranquility is the closest to the original at least as far as the tiles are concerned. &nbsp;We will also pass your information along to the dev team just so that they are aware of what you requested. &nbsp;</p>
