<h2>            Query to find where a certain number of characters match between fields in two tables</h2>
                    <table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>Table 1</span><span>
</span></td>
<td><span>Table 2</span><span>
</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>R 01<strong>EB0219</strong>08-2</span><span>
</span></td>
<td><span>1-RA<strong>1EB021</strong>908</span><span>
</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As we see above a field in Table 1 and Table 2 share six characters. 1EB021</span></p>

<p><span>I need to know how to query to look for six characters in a row between two tables that match and report on the ones that match.</span></p>

<p><span>These actually are the same number, but between two systems that were entered differently.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>There appears to be an error in your post: EB0219 is NOT equal to 1EB021! Does the string start with the E or with the 1?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any consistency within each table? Guessing that the string starts with E, you could use expressions like</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mid([Table 1].[Fieldname], 5, 6)</p>
<p>Mid([Table2].[Fieldname], 6, 6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>to extract the string for comparison. If the string can occur anywhere, or variably, within the field then this becomes very tough and subject to false matches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a great example of why the basic rules of relational design are important: one rule is that fields should be "atomic", each field containing just one chunk of information. Your difficulty arises because whoever entered this data did not follow this
 basic rule!</p>

<p>Hello John: You hit the nail on the head. Someone did&nbsp; not follow basic rules on data entry on one database. I just need to query one side against the other to show where a certain number of characters match. They don't all start with E. They are all for
 the most part inconsistent with the only place where they match being in the middle. Is there a query I can write where I can see if a certain number of characters match between similar fields in two tables?</p>

<p>Ouch (he says, quoting the unfortunate nail).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can think of will be horribly inefficient: run a query with a criterion like</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Table2].[field] LIKE "*" &amp; Mid([Table1].[field], 1, 6) &amp; "*"</p>
<p>OR&nbsp;[Table2].[field] LIKE "*" &amp; Mid([Table1].[field], 2, 6) &amp; "*"</p>
<p>OR&nbsp;[Table2].[field] LIKE "*" &amp; Mid([Table1].[field], 3, 6) &amp; "*"</p>
<p>OR&nbsp;[Table2].[field] LIKE "*" &amp; Mid([Table1].[field], 4, 6) &amp; "*"</p>
<p>
</p><p>etc. until you've stepped through all the possible positions. If other substrings just happen to match, you'll get false hits - but that's already there in the nature of the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, print out both datasets and give them to the twit that designed this mess!</p>

            hi mate, have you checked that you are fully up to date with the latest firmware and also the latest Nokia system app updates from the Store? also try performing a soft reset. failing that, a hard reset may be in order, predating a visit to your local
 Nokia Care outlet for inspection of your device.

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We are talking through DDE with Word 2010.</p>
<p>This system worked well with versions before Word 2010.</p>
<p>With Word 2010 we are having some trouble&nbsp; with our system.</p>
<p>We are opening Word documents from our application through a macro, the macro security is set to low.</p>
<p>We connect to Word, add the macro with AddAddIn and run the macro to open to Word document.</p>
<p>At first we got an error that there was a dialog open en we had to close it (there was no dialog visible).</p>
<p>When i looked at our code I saw that there were multiple DDeConnect/DDeDisconnect in a small amount of time, so I thought it might be a timing issue (very fast test server).</p>
<p>I changed that to having one DDE connection open instead of opening and closing several DDE connection , this seemed to be the solution (the dialog error didnt appear) but after working for a while i got the error that there were too many DDE channels open.
 I logged the the DDEConnect/DisConnect and there is always only one which is freed when ready)</p>
<p>Is there anyone who knows why this might happen?</p>

<p>Some more information on the problem.</p>
<p>In the macro we use to open a Word document we open a channel to talk with our application.</p>
<p>We can make more than one Word document at a time so the channels are Terminated with the TerminateAll command.</p>

<h2>            Access 2010 drops connection to 2008 Server</h2>
                    
<p>Frist off I'm not a access or SQL guy I just try to keep a small network running along with my real job (desginer/toolmaker). Ok here is the issue were having we just upgraded&nbsp;our server and workstations, server 2008 and win 7. We have access&nbsp;2000&nbsp;databases
 that are on the server and shared and&nbsp;we are looking to upgrade to&nbsp;Access 2010. We are aware of the new file format starting with 2007&nbsp;the problem we have&nbsp;is the databases use a user level security, the database designer would like to keep this security setup
 so&nbsp;he has been testing access 2010, we can get&nbsp;access 2010&nbsp;to join the workgroup security and logon, &nbsp;everything works for a while&nbsp;but at some point access will no longer&nbsp;work and he has to restart access to contiune working.&nbsp; It seems like a connection problem.&nbsp;
 Everyone else is still running access 2000 and&nbsp;have no problem staying&nbsp;connecting to the same databsses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any thoughts? If we need to upgrade to the new file format we are worried that it won't have the same level of security as the current one has or even be able to get close to it, if this not true could you point me to some information showing us how to
 set it up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p><span><span>I can not necessarily state that using 2010 would necessarily be some kind of issue in terms of the connection being dropped. The fact that you're having new
 machines, new servers, new software etc. means that you've have a pretty long list of things that have been changed here.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However what not clear is if you're running the access application and installing a copy of the actual application on EACH desktop or not?</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Also keep in mind of course that you don't want different versions of Access opening that ONE front end sitting on the file share. You want to adopt the time
 honored advice of placing a copy of the production application on EACH computer. This will avoid problems of two different versions of access messing up the particular application and perhaps making different changes that causes conflict with each other.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So to limit problems to perhaps one WorkStation that's doing something wrong or has some different version of some patch level or something else installed, by
 installing the copy the application on each WorkStation you eliminate and simply isolate problems to that one particular user, not everybody else.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span>As for using the built in security? Your data is being placed on SQL server, so the security inside of access is rather completely irrelevant in this case. Any
 security settings and restrictions of data should and can and will be occurring on the server side.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In fact as a general rule the whole idea of moving the data from Access to SQL server (and keeping access as the front end) was and is often done for reasons
 of security. So you sitting quite good in this regards. I would say it a bit of an illusion to suggest that there really is any kind of significant security built into Access anyway. It was a restriction and design changes to the application, that's what security
 in access was never for anyway, and the simple distribution of a mde, or now accDE would eliminate the ability of end users to modify can see the code of the application anyway.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It is not quite clear here exactly what goal and for what reasons access security was being used, but now the security is for the most part is going to be managed
 by the SQL server side if things. The client side can be Access, Excel, VB6, vb.net, Foxpro or even a web site that pulls data from SQL server. The security settings of that information and restrictions of use will occur server side on SQL server. The client
 side really doesn't come into the picture much at all.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply,</p>
<p>The current setup has the access&nbsp;2000 users opening the one front end&nbsp;application on the server (not perfered I understand but working without problems), the 2010 user has moved the app local&nbsp;so there are no version&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;And you are right there are
 lots of things that have been changed.&nbsp; The change was brought on&nbsp;by a new ERP software that the company is moving to.&nbsp; My hope is that most of our current database functions will be taken over by that new software and the ones that are not will then be migrated
 to sql at a later date (after Jan 2011).</p>
<p>Right now I'm looking for reasons that the 2010 can not stay connect to the mdb files. If this can be&nbsp;delt with&nbsp;we can bring all the other users up to Office&nbsp;2010. If not we'll wait till we convert to sql.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help.</p>

<p><span><span>OK, unfortunately I misread your question here, I thought that you had suggested you're already using SQL server (In fact you are suggesting you not in SQL server
 person!).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>My apologies for this misunderstanding as I had read your post just all wrong here and I&nbsp;assumed you were already using SQL server.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This thus&nbsp;explains why I was suggesting the security has nothing to do with access when using SQL server. I am certainly in no way suggesting that you adopt
 or&nbsp;use SQL server here, I just assumed you already were. Again, just my miss-reading here and again my sorry.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However you might check into&nbsp;what the access security is being used for in terms of restricting things. If security beingh used&nbsp;for restricting data, then you'll
 likely have to continue using it.&nbsp;However if you're using access security to restrict changes to forms or reports, then that also be accomplihsed&nbsp;by distribute an mde, or accDE To each user's WorkStation. These mde/accDE do not allow&nbsp;design changes&nbsp;regardless
 of security.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As for the disconnection problem? That is not quite clear what is going on here. I would certainly consider doing a debug compile on the 2010 workstation to
 ensure that the VBA code compiles ok. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Just off the top of my head, is quite hard to ascertain that this is an access 2010 issue, or something to do with the network or other issues. It should work
 ok, and by placing the front end part on the work station, then you advoid versions tripping over each other.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Slow Public Folders</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,.<br />
<br />
Question is about Office 365 and Public folders<br />
<br />
I have an issue with Public folders taking ages to load,</p>
<p>We have a huge amount of jobs in these folders. Over 10GB of data. We use these folders to share with all our staff. And file emails for every job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would assume the issue is each time a folder is clicked its downloading the data rather than opening a cached copy.</p>
<p>Is there a way to force a cache or speed up opening these folders? We did not have this issue with onsite exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Any solutions would be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi scott,</p>
<p>about your scenario, if you can operate under outlook client, i would suggest you download public folders in cached exchange mode.</p>
<p>please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1.click the <strong>file</strong> tab.<br />
2.in the right pane, click <strong>account settings</strong>, and then click <strong>
account settings</strong>.</p>

<p>3.on the<strong> email</strong> tab, select the exchange server email account, and then click
<strong>change</strong>.<br />
4.click <strong>more settings</strong>, and then click the <strong>advanced</strong> tab.<br />
5.under<strong> cached exchange mode settings</strong>, check the <strong>download public folder favorites</strong> box.</p>
<p>notes:</p>
<p>1.only your public folder items in the<strong> favorites&nbsp;</strong>folder will be downloaded.</p>
<p>2.if the <b>download publish folder favorites</b> box is greyed out, check the
<b>use cached exchange mode </b>box.</p>
<p>please let me know if you have anything unclear.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

    <title>How can I deal with part payments of invoices&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stonwardr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I deal with part payments of invoices&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have what is essentially an accounting database under construction. Most customers naturally pay the amounts outstanding on their invoices, but some (damn them!) just 'drop in' an odd amount that is not correlated to any specific invoice. How can I deal
 with this?! Specifically I'm not sure how to relate the tables (do I have a 'part-payments' table &amp; a 'paid-off' table? and if so how to relate them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Roy, WSM</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If you have a single Payments table with columns such as CustomerID, PaymentDate and AmountPaid you can subtract the sum of payments per customer from the sum of all invoices per customer to give the balance due on each customer's account.&nbsp; Here's an example
 of a query to do this, using the sample Northwind database:<br />
<br />
SELECT Company, <br />
SUM([Quantity]*[Unit Price]*(1-[Discount])) AS [Total Due],<br />
SUM(NZ([AmountPaid],0)) AS [Amount Paid],<br />
SUM([Quantity]*[Unit Price]*(1-[Discount]))-SUM(NZ([AmountPaid],0)) AS [Balance Due]<br />
FROM ((Customers RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.ID = Orders.[Customer ID]) <br />
LEFT JOIN [Order Details] ON Orders.[Order ID] = [Order Details].[Order ID]) <br />
LEFT JOIN Payments ON Customers.ID = Payments.[Customer ID]<br />
GROUP BY Customers.Company;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whether Northwind already includes the Payments table or whether it's one I've added myself sometime in the past when dealing with a similar question.&nbsp; I suspect I may have done so as it only includes payments for a couple of customers.<br />
<br />
The other option is to have a table with credit and debit columns and compute the running balances per customer in a query like so:<br />
<br />
SELECT T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionDate, T1.Credit, T1.Debit, <br />
SUM(T2.Credit-T2.Debit) AS Balance<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1 INNER JOIN Transactions AS T2 <br />
ON (T2.CustomerID = T1.CustomerID)<br />
AND (T2.TransactionDate&lt;=T1.TransactionDate) <br />
AND (T2.TransactionID&lt;=T1.TransactionID Or T2.TransactionDate&lt;&gt;T1.TransactionDate)<br />
GROUP BY&nbsp; T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionID, T1.Credit, T1.Debit;<br />
<br />

            Like Ken I would use a Payments table. The main problem occurs if the customer has multiple invoices outstanding at a time and they just make payments without identifying the invoice they are paying on. In that case, you have to use a Foreign key for the
 account rather than relate a payment to an invoice. This also presents a problem in identifying when an invoice is paid. In that case I would use a FIFO method. payments are applied to the earliest invoice until paid in full. This would mean having a Paid
 in full Yes/No or date field in the Invoice record.

<h2>            Gestures for Windows Phone&#47;Tablet</h2>
                    I don't know if this was already included in the recent build, but I want to suggest the
<strong>use of gestures</strong> when it is in Phone/Tablet mode. I think it is easier to use when it has gestures such as
<strong>Swiping Up for Switching Task</strong>, <strong>Swiping Left for Basic Tasks
</strong>(File Explorer, Power, Settings, etc.).&nbsp;

    <title>scripted responses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zenmasta  say:</h3>
<h2>            scripted responses</h2>
                    Using Outlook 10, I would like to know how I can reply or send emails using a scripted response. ie, auto fill subject and or body of email.<br />
<br />
In customer service we have a lot of FAQ and it would be nice if I didn't have to copy and past responses but could just click a menu and choose the appropriate response. Been using a different client that lets me do this but despite this feature it doesn't
 make up for the other short comings. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to do this with outlook or with 3rd party add-in etc.<br />

<p>WHY WAS THIS REMOVED ???</p>
<p>And why wasn't this mentioned ANYWHERE in the Version 15.21.1 (160411) "update" notes so I could have decided to upgrade OR NOT.</p>
<p>Like user Luis above, we've used this feature FREQUENTLY for over TEN YEARS through Entourage and now Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>VERY unhappy with Microsoft's decision to remove this feature with NO request for Outlook user comments BEFORE it was removed... and even more important NO notification that it was removed in this update which wasted an HOUR of my time restarting Outlook,
 checking my Outlook settings, and then searching this database. &nbsp;UNACCEPTABLE !!!</p>

<h3> alan b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 in Office 365 problem with Microsoft emails using Exchange ActiveSync &#40;EAS&#41;.</h2>
                    I am using the latest version of Outlook in Office 365 (Outlook 2016) to download and order emails from several Microsoft UK email addresses (.hotmail.co.uk , .live.co.uk). &nbsp;In the past I used Windows Live Mail (from Windows Essentials 2012) and I was
 able to create new folders as subfolders of Sent Items. &nbsp;Now when I try to do this in Outlook 2016 I get the message "<strong><span>Cannot create the folder.&nbsp; We can’t create subfolders in this module for Exchange ActiveSync accounts</span></strong><span>"</span>&nbsp;.
 &nbsp;I can create new folders elsewhere, in the Inbox folder for example and, paradoxically, I can create new folders inside the previously created subfolders in Sent Items. &nbsp;If I log on to Outlook.com I can create subfolders in Sent Items; that's a clumsy workaround.
 &nbsp;But I can't do it with Outlook! &nbsp;I've tried this with multiple computers running Windows 7 or 8.1 and two different email accounts and I always get the error message as above. &nbsp;Is Outlook 2016 somewhat incompatible with Outlook.com? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            I used the automatic set-up feature in Outlook and it chose EAS.&nbsp; I did this about 5 weeks ago (in response to the message from Microsoft that I could not continue using Windows Live Mail).&nbsp; So in using IMAP/SMTP successfully you are really just demonstrating
 another workaround for the problem.&nbsp; Perhaps Outlook 2016 and/or Outlook.com don't quite work properly with EAS?&nbsp; But thanks for trying Palcouk. &nbsp;

            <p>WLM still functions under win10</p>
<p>What MS means is that when the MS Accounts below are migrated they will no longer function under WLM</p>
<p>Well Hotmail/Outlook.com/Live/MSN are all in the process of being migrated to full exchange, the migration commenced in 2015 and is still ongoing<br />

            <p>I think what Microsoft really means, but does not say, is that when the MS Email accounts are migrated they will not function under WLM
<em><strong>without changing the settings</strong></em>.&nbsp; WLM supports IMAP/SMTP and, as you said in your earlier reply, you can use IMAP/SMTP with Microsoft email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But that's not the issue</strong>.&nbsp; Unless somebody can tell me differently it seems that some or all Microsoft Email accounts currently don't quite work properly with Outlook under EAS.&nbsp; If you want to confirm this, Palcouk, try temporarily setting
 up an EAS account on your Outlook and see if you can replicate my problem.</p>

            <p>EAS mail account types have number of limitations when compared to pop or Exchange, and you are correct an EAS account doesn't allow you to create a new sub-folder of the sent.</p>
<p>But if you are able to do so in web access, that's not too much hardship is it? - and in any case once migrated the option will be available.</p>
<p>PS My primary systems use MS Outlook with a number of accounts, Hotmail being set as IMAP/SMTP</p>
<p>A secondary system uses WLM and another Hotmail a/c All under win10</p>

            What on earth is the point of having Outlook if it doesn't allow you to do all of the things that you can do with web access? &nbsp;And of all the email systems that Outlook should work perfectly with, surely Microsoft's own should be the best and easiest?<br />
<br />
Are you sure this is a temporary problem that will vanish once "migration" is completed?&nbsp;

<h3> jckapplegate  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make a from in access the only interactive item&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I am making an employee timesheet in access. So far the program is basically complete, It has tables for employees, work items, work hours, and weeks. It also has a form for entering an employee into the system, and an interactive timesheet form to allow
 employees to pick themselves, the work week, project, and amount of hours they have worked. So far I have split the database. At first it wasn't working but now it updates correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem now is securing the front end with some sort of "log in" or security measure. I also need to make the timesheet form the only item available for employees to alter on the front end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems simple enough if I was an access guru, but I have basic level of knowledge. I want to the program to work like a normal payroll system. The user logs in (to the front end), and then enters their hours and projects for the week, submits it, then
 is finshed. The employees should not be allowed to view anything else, but im not sure how to alter the front end to make this possible. Attatched is a picture. the Hours list from is what i want accessable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Items to Be Indexed Continually Increasing by Thousands a day&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>We'd been having email issues at my workplace&nbsp;with Outlook 2007,&nbsp;so several weeks&nbsp;ago our Outlook was re-worked, but required our indexing to be rebuilt for instant search. This task was FINALLY
 completed after 2 full weeks, even though my computer was idle every night &amp; every weekend.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In any case, I eventually noticed that my search results&nbsp;were still not complete, particularly for locating emails up to&nbsp;a couple of weeks prior, so I started checking the indexing status. It
 had about 800 items left to index when I first checked last week...and now, there are over 22,000 items left to index!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now of course my search results are even less complete. I'm afraid to just&nbsp;rebuild the index&nbsp;again as it took 2 weeks the first time to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What could be causing the # of items left to index to increase so rapidly like this? I only receive &amp; send about 60 emails a day, and I’m only asking it to index my inbox &amp; sent box…no archive
 or any other folders.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Any suggestions??</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm using Outlook 2007, on Windows XP Professional Version 2002, Service Pack 3.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>THANKS!!</span></p>

    <title>Outlook PST file size not decreasing when items deleted and compacted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xena torres  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook PST file size not decreasing when items deleted and compacted</h2>
                    
<p>I have an outlook pst file that is 4.1GB. I need to get the file under 4GBs, as I can't burn this file to disc.</p>
<p>The problem is, I can't get this file to reduce in size, no matter what I do. Outlook is showing the correct file size, but Windows is reading it as 4.1GB, regardless of how much email I delete. And when I delete, I also clear the deleted items AND do a
 "Compact Now" on the archive folder.</p>
<p>I even tried leaving the computer on overnight with the file open in outlook and outlook open and running to see if it would compact on its own. It did not. :(</p>
<p>I REALLY need these emails, attachments and all, and I would like to back them up to a DVD (especially since I'm having computer issues, and I'd hate to take the computer to be checked without backing up every file as I'm having hard drive issues).</p>
<p>Any thoughts??</p>

            Well, I discovered I can create a new personal folder and just move everything from the old folder into the new one, and the size magically shrinks. I can fit all the emails in one file now, with room to spare. Go figure.

    <title>In Powerpoint 2010, how do I change embedded videos to linked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed3032  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Powerpoint 2010, how do I change embedded videos to linked videos&#63;</h2>
                    Yep. &nbsp;Embedded to linked.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Embedded videos create a pptx file that is simply too large for some of my corporate clients. &nbsp;I need a way to convert embedded videos to linked videos and reduce the size of the pptx file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm writing presentations that include 40 to 50 video and audio clips for corporate clients. &nbsp;Reasonable or not, these clients have limitations on the size of files that they can email and that they can store on their networks. &nbsp;I find it easy to screw
 up when I'm adding videos and to embed them rather than link them. &nbsp;Some of my coworkers that I&nbsp;collaborate with find it even easier to make the same mistake. &nbsp;Whatever. &nbsp;I'm looking at a PPTX file&nbsp;&nbsp;for my current project that's 96 MB with embedded videos
 - vs. a more reasonable 6 MB when I save it as ppt 2003.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A few things to consider:</div>
<div>* Yes. I know how to use "Package Presentation for CD" so that everything works when I sent the report to my client.</div>
<div>* Yes. I realize that the total size of the presentation AND the videos is enormous wither way. &nbsp;That's OK. &nbsp;My problem is having a single, enormous pptx file.</div>
<div>* Saving as a PPT 2003 file removes the embedded videos and leaves a file I can email around. &nbsp;But, the formerly embedded videos no longer work. &nbsp;Great for some purposes, not so great as a final deliverable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And ...</div>
<div>* Yes, I realize I can open the fully functional presentation in PPT 2010, use the selection pane to find file names, delete the embedded movie object, and then reinsert the videos, one by one, while paying careful attention to how I insert them but really,
 that get's tedious after the 12th or 13th video. &nbsp;Plus, I'm not aware of an easy way to tell if a video is linked or embedded.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd be perfectly happy to disable embedding forever and always, but I haven't found that option.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm about to dive into VBA to see if I can do something there, but I thought I'd ask here, too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thoughts? &nbsp;Suggestions? &nbsp;And believe me, "Be more careful inserting videos." has already crossed my mind.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            &gt;&gt; And believe me, "Be more careful inserting videos." has already crossed my mind.
<div><br />
<div>;-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here's the fundamental problem: &nbsp;without knowing where the original embedded video came from, there's no way to link to the source file. &nbsp;We can't know what to link TO.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&gt;&gt; Plus, I'm not aware of an easy way to tell if a video is linked or embedded.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The free demo version of my FixLinks add-in includes a link reporting tool that'll give you this info. &nbsp;It gives you the path to linked videos/sounds etc. and reports (granted, somewhat incorrectly) embedded vids as bad links.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BUT ... if you can move all the embedded movies into the same folder as the PPT itself, this VBA should get you most, if not all the way there. &nbsp;Be sure to edit the path as directed in the comments, else it won't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>PLEASE: run it only on a copy of your original file. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And you might want to run a few quick experiments on putting the movies in the same folder as a test presentation and setting the path to "". &nbsp;That might just give you pathless links, which'll work pretty much anywhere, so long as the movies and PPT/PPTX
 files stay in the same folder together.</div>

            symbian belle update will be available only for phones currently runing on symbian anna (like n8,e7,c7,c6,x7 and e6) and not s60v5 devices, so no it will not be available for the 5800xm.

<h2>            Managing documents of Deleted users in OneDrive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Team,</p>
<p><br />
I am the OneDrive admin of my organization.I want a user to stop sharing a set of files with my boss as the user has left the organization.I logged in to the users account to change the permission level.But I see that there are no document in her folder but
 I see a list of files shared by her in my boss's "Shared with me" folder.Where do I find these documents so that I can change the permission level to "Stop Sharing"?

<p>Hi Soumya,</p>
<p>It seems you refer to OneDrive for Business library. For personal OneDrive, you can browse to the dedicated
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=share+with+me&amp;IsSuggestedTerm=false&amp;tab=&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=OneDrive&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;ContentTypeScope=#/OneDrive///1">
OneDrive forum</a>.</p>
<p>The Shared&nbsp;with me is a view which allows&nbsp;you&nbsp;to see a list of the documents that other user has specifically shared with you. In your boss's Shared with me, you should be able to find the original location for this file. (choose the file-&gt; "..." -&gt; click
 View library in&nbsp;classic&nbsp;UI&nbsp;or click Details in new UI). Can you find these files in this way? Maybe the files are located in another library and&nbsp;also&nbsp;shared by the user.</p>
<p>You may also clear the user's recycle bin to see if there's any differences.</p>
<p>Let us know the updates so that we can provide further help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

<div>Does Windows 7 wait for you to choose Force Restart or Cancel, or does it just pause there for a few seconds? If you look at the list of processes in Task Manager before you restart, you will see a process named "OUTLOOK.EXE
 *32" (or at least I have ever since I installed Office 2003). This process continues to run even after you close Outlook (don't ask me why), but I think that if you end this process you should be ok.<br />

            The OP wants to figure out why Outllok is not closing properly, and remaining as a running process. Most likely its caused by an outlook add-in, integrated anti virus and sync tools being the usual suspects
