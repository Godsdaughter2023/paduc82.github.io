            Hi, and many apologises for the delay in answering your post. Having made my problem public the gremlin has gone into hiding from the internet. However the problem still exists in the email section. I am using the Win10 mail app and Microsoft Edge, I'm
 not a great fan of the Google browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Win10 mail app is doing the popup as you described from a few lines to nearly half a page, from what I can see the popup starts with the http address and goes on to describe the page information with click or tap being
 the end line. I have&nbsp;2 jpeg's but I'm not sure how to get them online for you tosee.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, thanks for your input re popup boxes. I did as suggested and now waiting to see what happens.</p>
<p>While waiting and getting cheesed off I tried my 'email' account on win10, same popups 'click or tap' links over everything but before I use my 2.5 lb hammer I opened Win live essentials 2012' that copied over from Win 7. Every email I opened worked perfect,
 no popups if sight. Gave it an hour or so and tried again with same results.</p>
<p>The errors must be in the Win10 email program, I think if I can get all my emails on Win 2012 I will (if I can) remove the win10 component and save the bit of hair I have left.</p>

    <title>Uninstalling McAfee - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothyhodgson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalling McAfee</h2>
                    <p>I need to update Windows and in order to do that I need to uninstall McAfee. I tried using the default uninstall provided by Windows but it said I could not uninstall as other programs were using McAfee Agent. I then tried using the MCPR which seems to have
 worked for most other people but for me it said that the uninstall couldn't happen as there was Enterprise software detected. I then tried to use Registry Editor to uninstall it via cmd but the instructions provided by McAfee for this are vague and it still
 didn't remove the McAfee software. I have tried to contact McAfee but waited for half an hour with no response for their 24hr support, and receive only generic no reply emails from them when I try to contact them by email. I really don't know where else to
 look for a solution and I'm sure I can't be the only one with this problem as I constantly hear about how problematic McAfee is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long query and thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            Hi TImothy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try using the McAfee uninstaller tool that can usually get the mess out:
<br /><a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=T...</a>
<br />
<br />If not try killing all of the McAfee processes running in Task Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, then Show More Details, then Details tab, then highlight each McAfee process to End Process. 
<br />
<br />If that's not enough we can take further steps.  
<br />
<br />Once it's out Defender should kick in which you can check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Security &gt; Open Security Center &gt; Virus and Threat Protection &gt; Real Time Protection.
<br />
<br />If not see the additional steps here:
<br /> <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/unable-to-turn-on-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/unable-to-turn-on...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also check if any McAfee remains lodged in all Startup locations following Step 4 in this checklist, and also follow Step 10 to check and repair if System Files are damaged as they often are by McAfee and other bloated antiviruses. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />If you’ve setup the remote computer properly to share files, go back to your PC you are trying to connect with. 
<br />
<br />Click start, and just type \\NameOfPC and hit enter. See if it connects and you can see the folder you’ve shared. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

    <title>A company purporting to be under contract with Microsoft for internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smartypanz  say:</h3>
<h2>            A company purporting to be under contract with Microsoft for internet security etc. was able to infect my computer such that it no longer work, and then asked for &#36;549.98 to fix the problem.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I signed up for their "service" and later found out , about 4 weeks later, that the 24/7/365 x 3 service I paid for was insufficient, and I needed to pay an additional $499 for an "AMD Processor" to be installed on my computer.&nbsp; Since nobody can install
 any physical hardware (AMD Processor) on remote computers any more than I can install 4 new tires on your automobile over the phone, I knew this company was a fake/fraud/phony, this is when I called the sheriffs office and made an official report. During this
 time I spoke with a Deputy Sheriff who said the same thing with the same company happened to him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may disparage me for waiting so long to see through the illusion of security, but it did finally occur to me that I'd been had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question to the audience at large: is there legal recourse against a company purportedly under contract with Microsoft to provide computer/internet security but instead infects&nbsp; clients computer with malware and then demands REPEATED payments for their services?
 The office of the Nevada state Attorney General directed me to make a police report, which having been done seems a waste of time as the sheriff said there is no physical entity for this company in the USA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>The answer is no as most of these scammers are overseas and have nothing to do with Microsoft, seeing that it has been 4 weeks good chance that you will not get your money back, but give it a try. As for your computer you can do a clean install using the
<strong>media creation tool</strong>&nbsp; </p>

<p>I did the same thing.&nbsp; I called my credit card company and told them I was scammed.&nbsp; They reversed the charge and I changed my credit card number since these scammers had taken that info. to charge me for their "service." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't know right away that is was a scam.&nbsp; A few days after they "fixed" my frozen computer it happened again and I called the number they gave me.&nbsp; As soon as I asked for my representative they wanted me to give them access to my computer.&nbsp; I realized
 at that point they were scamming me and would likely want more money to fix a new (fake) problem.&nbsp; I called my credit card immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            These unlabeled partitions are normal, and shouldn't be interfering with your other drives. For more info, see

Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>

As you have mentioned Windows vista as the operating system it not possible that you are using Internet Explorer 10 as your browser.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Still I want you disable add –ons and see if it helps.<br />
Follow these steps and check.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows+R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the Run window type ‘iexplore –extoff’ and click ‘OK’.<br />
c) Now try to open the websites to check if you’re able to load the websites.</div>
<div><br />
How do browser add-ons affect my computer?<br />

            <p>Yes, the issue is starting to appear after I updated to Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now my laptop's touchpad is served by Microsoft's driver not the Asus one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the solution for my problem in post I've mentioned. It relates to Asus atkdriver and latest touchpad driver (which I haven't found directly when searched).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, right now I solve problem, but I has the issue after installing Creators Update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Storage Space doesn&#39;t show up on new install</h2>
                    <p>I have a working Windows 10 install on a SATA SSD, with a Storage Space set up with several drives. Today, I installed Windows 10 on a new NVMe drive, and the Storage Space doesn't show up. The drives that make up the Storage Space<span>&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span>&nbsp;</span>show
 up in UEFI, Device Manager, and Intel RST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug the old SSD back in and boot to the old install, the Storage Space shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched online and everything suggests that Windows should automatically detect the Storage Space. Looking for any guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have a support case open with Microsoft. Level 1 techs couldn't figure it out, so I have a Level 2 tech call set up.</p>

<p>For posterity: This resolved itself after I received "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1803", which seems to have taken a while to apply after I installed Windows. The Storage Space was automatically detected as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This suggests some kind of incompatibility between update versions of Windows 10 from a Storage Spaces perspective (I created this Storage Space well over a year ago), which is awful because nowhere on the Storage Spaces interface does it suggest that this
 might happen. I will follow up with Microsoft support so they can either fix this or at least improve messaging/documentation.</p>

                    <p>I don't know what the **** I did but I was cleaning my keyboard which resulted in numerous keys being presses and when I opened task manager the processes were no longer listed in alphabetical order they are shown from Z to A. How do I correct this? I've

In most lists like this in Windows, clicking on a column heading will sort the list by that column. Clicking again will reverse the sort order.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have a problem connecting to my internet. Whenever i troubleshoot to see what's wrong it says my Ethernet cable is not connected. But it is. I accidentally uninstalled my&nbsp;Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol and that's why it won't let me connect.
 Now i have a download link for it, but i can't download it without internet connection on my other computer. Someone please help me, i need to know how to connect to the internet. If the Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol is not the problem, i
 don't know what is. Would appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>

 the ENTER key. Type chkdsk and press the ENTER key and a report, detailing amongst other things a summary of how the disk space is utilised, is provided. If you want a report on a partition or drive other than C you need to go to that partition. To access
 F, where F is the required partition you type F: and press the ENTER key.</span></p>
<p><span>Copying reports from a command prompt can be tricky. Right click and select Mark. This enables you to highlight selected
 text and click to copy. You then go to an open Word, Notepad or similar file, right click and paste. The selected text transfers from your clipboard to the open file. You can paste directly into a reply message to most forums.</span></p>

    <title>CD and DVD won&#39;t recognize media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldfilippelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD and DVD won&#39;t recognize media</h2>
                    <p>Hi- I have read a lot of the post on this subject but have not seen a real fix so i will pose the question again with as much info as i can.</p>
<p>I am running Windows XP SP3. on an HP Tower. I have one DVD recorder/plyare and a CD recorder player. Both of my&nbsp; experience the same issue. Device manager recognizes them, they open and when you put a CD in they show now files . They spin up for a few seconds
 then stop. No auto play.</p>
<p>I have tried reming and reinstalling the drives, updating the drivers I pulled them out and tested them on another PC and they both read and work on the second PC. Ihave tried to run the CD fixit program from MS but when I down load it and try to run it
 I get an error that that the program is not Win 32 compatible or somethingt to that nature. I try and find the direction sheet that the text file says to go to at Microsoft(they give two web addresses) but it shows that it is not found so the program they
 supply seem useless. I have checked all my cables multiple times. It seems odd that the drives work on PC #2 and not on #1. So any ideas as to what i can try next.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Update KB2552343 causing sleep issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> babylonx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update KB2552343 causing sleep issues</h2>
                    I just wanted to report that KB2552343 update is causing sleep issues to my computer. More specificaly, after installed, my computer cannot recover from sleep. When I try to wake it up there is just blank screen and no reaction. It just freezes and I can
 understand it freezes (and not just the monitor staying off) because the HDD led stays on and it doesn\t even respond to the power button or any shutdown shortcuts from my keyboard. Even the Caps lock led keeps its state and does not toggle when the Caps lock
 key is pressed.<br />
<br />
I found out it is this update causing it all the hard way... It happened about 10 days ago. My computer suddenly started doing that (not recovering from sleep). The first time I thought it just was random and rebooted. But then it happened again and again.
 I realized it was not even random and it happened even if I manually put my computer to sleep. If I did it never recovered. After a few days I decided to deal with it. I checked my Event log in Windows Management and found when was my last successful wake
 up and the first non successful. I checked the Windows Update logs for updates installed between these two events. There were a bunch of updates causing this installed the day my problems started. I didn't try to uninstall them at first. I thought it would
 be better if I used System Restore to restore the system at a point before they were installed. It was too late.. The restore points needed were overwritten by newer ones and could not restore to a point before my last windows update. I then tried to uninstall
 all the updates that were installed that day but unfortunately this didn't help. Then I thought it was not the updates and decided to
<span style="font-weight: bold">reinstall</span> the whole OS from scratch. I formatted my disk and reinstalled Windows 7.<br />
<br />
My installation is 5 days old but today it happened again after some windows updates installed. I executed System Restore immediately and restored at the point just before the update. The problem was solved after that but then I checked the 3 pending updates
 and searched for issues related with them but didn't find any. Then I searched for their descriptions. The 2 of them are Internet Explorer style related so I installed them and rebooted. The third one is KB2552343 and the issue that fixes is "Time-out error
 occurs when you install a Windows Update package that contains drivers on a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2". I guess this is it. It's the only one left uninstalled and hidden and my computer sleeps and wakes up smoothly.<br />
<br />
I didn't find other reports about this issue so I thought it would be a good thing to report it. I also didn't find any info on how to report bugs directly to Microsoft so I am reporting thin here, on the forums.<br />
<br />
My hardware composition is the following (if it helps):<br />
<br />
-PSU: Corsair 450W (Can't remember exact model)<br />

            <p>I have had quite a few problems with this update.&nbsp; I have a Dell XPS M1530 (Windows 7 Pro SP1 32-bit)&nbsp;laptop and have had the following problems after installing the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I have no sound&nbsp;and my sound card disappears from the device manager list (with no unknown devices showing)</p>
<p>* My Fingerprint reader is no longer recognised</p>
<p>* My laptop does not recognise any memory pens I attach to the USB ports</p>
<p>* My display settings are changed (text set to smaller option and aero is disabled with no way of switching it back on)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All my drivers are up to date (more up to date than the ones Dell supply).&nbsp; I tried to install the drivers Dell supply too but this made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the update and all is back to normal and it won't be going back on again!!</p>

<h2>            Black Bars &#47; Square Blocks instead of Characters in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After running Windows 10 for a while, all the windows menus and drop down text starts turning into Black Bars, or perhaps better stated, Black Square&nbsp;Boxes.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>While applications run wonderfully, this is terrible.&nbsp; I end up having to restart the computer to get it back to normal functionality.&nbsp; I would prefer to just kill/restart the affected program and keep using the PC, or get a true fix in place. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Same problem with windows 7, but only&nbsp;when you open Skype.</p>
<p>Other programs&nbsp;do not cause that issue</p>
<p>Closing Skype will not help, only solution reboot.</p>
<p>Apparently it is Skype that bugs with video.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft took my money and didn&#8217;t give me my game</h2>
                    I preordered black ops 4 on september 14th. They tried to pull out $63.59 on 10/4/2018 4 times, 3 were denied and 1 was accepted, they then tried to pull it out if my bank account multiple times on the 5th,7th,8th,9th and 10th, all denied. Microsoft apperently
 has no record of them taking my money and asked to send a picture if my bank statment, so i did. That was 10/12/2018 when the game was released and when i realized that it wouldnt let me play it cause it said i didnt buy the game. Ive been on the phone with
 microsoft support for 12 days straight and they still wont give me my game after i sent them the picture of my bank statement proving that i bought it. They say their level 3 team is “working on it” and stated that theyd have a solution in 48-72 hour and they
 would give me a call. They never called. So i called the fourth day after they said they would call me. They said that thier worker messed up and sent me the wrong email to attach the picture of my bank statement . So

<p>Hello Madking,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for your frustration with the game. When level 3 looks at a case it can take 5-7 business days. Being that you had to resend the picture in to a different email they might of resubmitted which would be 5-7 days from that day. Keep following up with
 the case you made with support. Make sure to email them often asking about status. There is nothing we can do here on the forums in that regard, you went the correct route. I had similar situation where my case got sent to level 3 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi David, this ism most likely just caused by a corrupt device driver, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

    <title>Two reproducible bugs that can be triggered by just deleting files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two reproducible bugs that can be triggered by just deleting files</h2>
                    <div><br />
Users have never been able to avoid doing many misoperations, always might inevitably delete some files or folders that should not be deleted.<br />
So a stable operating system should not be leading to serious failures which are only caused by what as files are mistakenly deleted.<br />
Up to now, Windows 10 still is clearly not such a stable operating system.<br />
Let's take a look at the two reproducible bugs.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Bug A</strong>: <br />
<strong>Deleting files causes that an error will be reporting after tapping or clicking on Windows PowerShell items of Windows 10 super menu.</strong></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps to view the bug occurring.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Step 1</strong>:<br />
Make the batch files for PowerShell shortcuts files' backing up, restoring, deleting.</div>
<div><br />
Open Notepad and use it to make a batch file with the following contents:<br />
<strong>robocopy "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Windows PowerShell" "%UserProfile%\Documents\Windows PowerShell"</strong><br />
Save it as "%UserProfile%\Documents\BakPSShtcts.bat"</div>
<div><br />
Use Notepad to make a batch file with the following contents:<br />
<strong>robocopy "%UserProfile%\Documents\Windows PowerShell" "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Windows PowerShell" /b</strong><br />
Save it as "%UserProfile%\Documents\RstPSShtcts.bat"</div>
<div><br />
Use Notepad to make a batch file with the following contents:<br />
<strong>del /a /f /q "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Windows PowerShell\*.*"</strong><br />
Save it as "%UserProfile%\Documents\DelPSShtcts.bat"</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:<br />
Run BakPSShtcts.bat to back up PowerShell shortcuts files.</div>
<div><br />
Open File Explorer, paste %UserProfile%\Documents in its address bar and then press Enter key to navigate to the Documents folder, then right-click on BakPSShtcts.bat, then click on "Run as administrator", then click on "Yes" button.<br />
Then can be seen that the "Windows PowerShell" subfolder has been copied into the "Documents" folder.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:<br />
Run DelPSShtcts.bat to delete PowerShell shortcuts files.</div>
<div><br />
In File Explorer, navigate to the %UserProfile%\Documents folder, then right-click on DelPSShtcts.bat, then click on "Run as administrator", then click on "Yes" button.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>:<br />
View the bug occurring.</div>
<div><br />
Right-click on Start button, then click on "Windows PowerShell (Admin)", do you see an error message popping up?</div>
<div><br />
Right-click on Start button, then click on "Windows PowerShell", do you see an error message popping up?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>:<br />
Run RstPSShtcts.bat to restore PowerShell shortcuts files.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>In File Explorer, navigate to the %UserProfile%\Documents folder, then right-click on RstPSShtcts.bat, then click on "Run as administrator", then click on "Yes" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Bug B</strong>: <br />
<strong>Deleting files causes that after the first reboot some tiles of the Start menu will be partially lost and then after the second reboot the previous missing tiles will be automatically returned back.</strong></div>
<div><br />
Please follow the below steps to view the bug occurring.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>:<br />
Make the batch file for deleting all the files in the Windows Caches folder.</div>
<div><br />
Open Notepad and use it to make a batch file, its contents are as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>for /f "delims=" %%f in ("%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\*.*") do (</strong><br />
<strong>takeown /F "%%f" /A</strong><br />
<strong>icacls "%%f" /grant Administrators:F</strong><br />
<strong>del /a /f /q "%%f"</strong><br />
<strong>)</strong></div>
<div><br />
Save it as "%UserProfile%\Documents\DelWinCaches.bat".</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:<br />
Run DelWinCaches.bat to delete all the files in the Caches folder.</div>
<div><br />
Open File Explorer, paste %UserProfile%\Documents in its address bar and then press Enter key to navigate to the Documents folder, then right-click on DelWinCaches.bat, then click on "Run as administrator", then click on "Yes" button.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:<br />
Remember the tiles layouts of Start menu.</div>
<div><br />
Click on Start menu, then please firmly keep in mind the tiles layouts of Start menu.<br />
If necessary, take the screenshots about them to save into the computer, please also save the screenshots into mind.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>:<br />
reboot and view the bug occurring.</div>
<div><br />
Reboot the computer, click on Start menu,<br />
please see the the tiles layouts of Start menu,<br />
do the tiles before eyes become less?<br />
squawk "Oh, my"?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>:<br />
reboot again to fix well the tiles.</div>
<div><br />
Reboot the system again, will find that all the tiles work properly.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Perhaps this bug is suitable for Fool's Day or Halloween jokes... <br />
When your friend surprisedly see the tiles of start memu on the computer screen become less after reboot,
<br />
and think that the trouble may be caused by hacker(s) or ghost(s) or... <br />
you can tell him or her: try to restart...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 network connectivity issues &#91;ongoing&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while, since I updated Windows 10 to the newest build 10586 I have constant internet issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet connection drops suddenly for no reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried checking the services - all network related services are started.</p>
<p>Network Troubleshooter fixes the problems, but only temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I banged my head against the keyboard trying to find a solution, I have found out that
</p>
<p>there may be some WinSock problems in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my third party task manager, The Winsock IFS driver <strong>ws2ifsl.sys</strong> is stopped and disabled.</p>
<p>I have read the fact that WinSock is important to network stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why was this driver disabled from running? </p>
<p>
</p><p>[I have checked and fixed the issue, but now I don't know,</p>
<p>I need to wait and see if the problem has been permanently fixed. So far so good]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... can someone tell me about the WinSock error? What's the default setting and</p>
<p>the recommended start option for this driver (if it's crucial)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 102 critical updates to run but no matter what I do, the installer won't download anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I've tried:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure I have an internet connection</li><li>Download just one update</li><li>Downloading and running Windows Update Trouble Shooter</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've run Windows Update Trouble Shooter several times and each time it's fixed problems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service registration is missing or corrupt</li><li>Windows Update error 0x80070057(2016-04-30-T-08_20_08P)</li><li>Problems installing recent updates</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>But still, nothing downloads and nothing installs.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error messages which state that a given update isn't applicable to your computer can be caused by system time and date being incorrectly synchronized with the Windows time server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check system time and date do the following.</p>
<ol>
<p>
</p><li>Click the clock on the right hand side of the Taskbar and then click the link to "<strong>Change date and time settings</strong>".</li><li>In the menu which appears, click the "<strong>Internet time</strong>" tab and then click the "<strong>Change settings</strong>" button.</li><li>In the following menu, checkmark the box, "<strong>Synchronize with an Internet time server</strong>" and then change the Server to "<strong>time.windows.com</strong>".
</li><li>Finally, click "<strong>Update now</strong>" and then click OK. </li></ol>
<p>If you get an error when you click the "Update now" button, please post that here without paraphasing.

    <title>Windows 10&#58; mouse cursor disappears sometimes and just stops other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobgroh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; mouse cursor disappears sometimes and just stops other times - very, very aggravating&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS 8700 desk top which is about 1-1/2 years old.&nbsp; Originally had W8.1 which I upgraded to W10 about 6 months ago.&nbsp; I have two basic problems with the mouse cursor - sometimes (when the computer 'wakes up' after sleeping) the cursor is just
 not visible at all. It is moving around as I move the mouse (I can see the screen respond) but it is not visible until I tap the right mouse button and then it is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd problem is that the cursor lags and is jerky with normal movements.&nbsp; Sometimes it just disappears for a second and then, pop, it is back.&nbsp; Very frustrating. Sometimes not very noticeable and sometimes is right in your face.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have roamed the web and tried some of the tricks mentioned. No joy yet. I have tried several different brands of mice with no difference. Now using a Microsoft optical mouse (USB and LED).&nbsp; The mouse driver is V9.5.172.0 and dated 12/12/2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the 'Settings' menu and then to the 'Mouse' area and noticed one odd thing. Under the 'Events' tab, in the Information box it says "Device HID\VID__045E&amp;PIC_0040\6&amp;33ea601&amp;0&amp;0000 requires further installation"&nbsp; That is a bit strange and maybe a
 clue to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help would be enormously appreciated.</p>

            I had read Mr. Aldwinckle's reply before and have not had any satisfaction with anything I have tried.&nbsp; This has been a problem right from the getgo with multiple versions of mice.&nbsp; The problem really seems to be some sort of conflict between the mouse
 driver software and other programs - i.e. every once and a while the mouse software 'loses it'.&nbsp; For example, I just took a second and moved the mouse cursor around the screen - after about 1 second, it just disappeared for a brief bit and then, bing, it appeared
 back on the screen. Repeated again and it didn't happen. Moved it around again for several seconds until I put the cursor over a 'action tag' (i.e. an area of the screen that will result in some action by the mouse - e.g. putting the cursor over the 'Mark
 as Answer' field on this form - and, bing, it disappears for a brief instant and then, bing, it is back.&nbsp; If the audio is on, I get the aggravating multi-tone signal.&nbsp; Also note that the LED on the mouse, flickers off. So the mystery deepens.<br />

            <p>I may have (fingers crossed) found a solution to my problem with the mouse and cursor.&nbsp; My answer: I changed the mouse (again) to another mouse of a different brand.&nbsp; Originally I had the Dell mouse that came with the XPS 8700. It was always a bit flaky
 and went the computer went a bit bonkers (long story), I bought a new keyboard (a Logitech K120 - quite inexpensive) and changed the mouse from the Dell to my old Microsoft.&nbsp; And got things working again but the mouse problems persisted - sometimes worse,
 sometimes better - but always aggravating.&nbsp; As I reported before, the Device page indicated the driver and mouse were ok but the 'Events' tab did have the cryptic note about "Device HID/VID..... requires further installation".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I turned off the computer, detached the Microsoft Mouse from the back USB port and then turned on the computer. After it booted and I logged in (mouse not required for that, thank goodness), I then plugged in the new mouse (a Logitech optical mouse I
 had around from another computer).&nbsp; The new mouse worked fine - no lag, no blinking out, etc.&nbsp; And the mouse driver 'Events' tab indicated the new mouse was there and loaded and with no weird notes regarding installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far the change seems to have stuck.&nbsp; I have gone into 'sleep' mode several times - no problem.&nbsp; I have turned the PC on and off several times - no problem.&nbsp; So - - with fingers crossed -- I am saying the problem is fixed.&nbsp; I think the Dell mouse had bad
 driver software and I think that, for some reason, the Microsoft mouse driver did not load correctly.

            I have a slightly different cursor&nbsp;problem, which is intermittent. When it disappears, it's actually&nbsp;still present on the screen but it's hidden from view. When I move the attached mouse around the screen, it highlights the icons or files that are on the
 desktop. For example, if I want to open&nbsp;Outlook, I merely move the hidden cursor around until it hits the task bar and then I move it onto the Outlook icon, which is highlighted, and then click the mouse. The Outlook program (or whatever file was highlighted)
 opens.&nbsp;When&nbsp;that file or program opens, the hidden cursor is gone (it disappears) and is replaced by the standard cursor.&nbsp;So, what's causing the cursor to go dark and then reappear after opening a so called highlighted file or program?

            Actually your problem is EXACTLY the same as mine.&nbsp; And, unfortunately, my solution was not permanent!&nbsp;&nbsp; It's back!&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it is a funky bit of software - probably in the mouse driver.&nbsp; When I forced an install with a new, non-Microsoft mouse,
 the problem was fixed.&nbsp; Then I had a power outage which caused a 'blip' which, apparently, brought back the original Microsoft mouse driver.&nbsp; And now my 'disappearing' mouse cursor is back.&nbsp; Exactly the way you describe it.&nbsp; Annoying, to say the least.&nbsp; For
 now, I just grin and bear it.&nbsp; About a 1in 3 chance that, when waking up from 'sleep' that my cursor will be 'invisible'.<br />

            <p>I've also got the same problem (also see&nbsp;rljohnson32's post). I had it with W8 (maybe even XP before) and still have it with W10.</p>
<p>Using a MS USB Intellimouse Optical</p>
<p>Driver : Microsoft</p>
<p>Date : 18/05/2011</p>
<p>Dr Ver : 8.20.409.0</p>
<p>All mouse&nbsp;drivers 'up to date' etc. and I also have the intermittent problem of the mouse cursor "disappearing" after logon from sleep mode. All I can do to get out of it, is to use the keyboard to get to the power off option and shutdown/restart. All is
 ok then. But I know sometime later the same will happen again. It could be days, weeks&nbsp;or months.</p>

            Well, Murphy's Law is alive and well. My 'mouse' problem has disappeared and I haven't seen it for a long time. No idea was happened - lots of Windows updates since then plus I am using a Logitech mouse. &nbsp;I think the Logitech mouse which may have forced
 a change in the mouse driver might have been the key. &nbsp;But who knows..I don't want to jinx it at this point. So my suggestion would be to change your mouse to a different brand (they certainly are not expensive - I don't like the off brands so suggest you
 stick with bigger names like Logitech) and then just grin and bear it. Some things (when it comes to computers) just don't seem to be solvable by mere mortals (like me).&nbsp;

            <p>Since my last post, I've found that when the mouse disappears, if i press the power button on the keyboard to turn off, then again to turn on, the mouse is back and working fine.</p>
<p>Just seen your previous post BobGroh, and have found an 'old' HP optical USB mouse, so will try that for a while. If that still has the problems, I'll try the Logitech route...</p>
