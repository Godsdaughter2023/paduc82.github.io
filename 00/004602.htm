            <p>you're not the only one with this seeming- uneven placement of the separator. It's actually aligned like that.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 loses cellular connection...but doesn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>I'm on AT&amp;T and just got a new 950 for myself and my wife. The problem is that it sometimes sorta kinda loses the cell connection. I can't
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">receive</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> calls</span>, send/receive texts, browse the web. The status bar shows no cell connection. However, when I go to make a call it magically goes through and everything
 is back. This has happened to me twice and my wife once. The time it happened to my wife it also happened to me about the same time and we were in completely different parts of the city. The first time it happened to me I was stuck at my desk so I wasn't moving
 around when it started working again when I made a call. The second time it wasn't working during the start of my commute back home and still wasn't working at my house until I made a call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as we make a call all pending texts start coming in and the cell connection shows connected again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening to 2 different devices so I assume it's a software issue unless we got phones from a bad batch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can submit this as a bug? It seems, at this time, to happen randomly so not sure I could provide repro instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You can try doing a soft reset (Turning the phone off and on again),&nbsp;turning off cellular data and turning it back on again, or turning on airplane mode and turning it off, and see if that solves the problem.

            <p>It happened again during Thanksgiving day and sure enough I got my connection back by making a phone call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried toggling cellular data as well as airplane mode the first time it happened with no success and I'm fairly certain I've restarted the phone since I've had it, but I restarted again to be sure.<br />
</p>
<p>I really like the Windows mobile interface and would like to keep this phone, but it makes it difficult to use as a cell phone if my wife and I randomly lose our connection and can't get contacted until we notice the connections gone and make a call to re-enable
 the connection.</p>

<p>yes brad, that is the latest firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would call ATT and tell them that you tried reseting the phone, soft and hard, and that you seem to be having connection issues and am not sure whether or not your sim cards are bad or if you need to be reconeected to the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ask that you be disconnected and reconnected to the ATT network on both devices (refresh the connection) (THIS IS NOT CANCELING YOUR ACCOUNT AND REACTIVATING...IT IS SIMPLY JUST REFRESHING YOUR CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SIM IMEI AND THE ATT NETWORK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once they understand what you are asking and start, you will need to power cycle the devices for them to do so and when the devices turn back on, should be reconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this will help to reconnect the phone and ensure that the k-sub-I security for the network to your device is in tact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>if that doesn't work, I would have ATT give you new sim cards (if they didn't already for both of your devices, and you didn't specify this, so just a suggestion)</p>
<p>
</p><p>being that it is both of your devices, I am guessing this should help you.</p>

    <title>Sharepoint Will Not Not Load in Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharepoint Will Not Not Load in Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>When we started with Office 365 and Sharepoint we were all able to login through Internet Explorer and "Open with Explorer" so that we could work easily from our computer and not have to work through the Sharepoint website. Slowly, many of the computers
 in our office are disallowing us to connect to Sharepoint through Internet Explorer. &nbsp; We can login to Office 365 but when you click on Sharepoint it opens a separate tab but never loads the page just says "Working". The same thing happens with OneDrive but
 all other applications work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exhausted google searches and feel like I have tried every setting possible to try to get this to work again. &nbsp;I called support for our 365 account but they were unable to figure it out. Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution? &nbsp;We have
 Windows 7 and are using IE 11 by the way. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi EHarris_891,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested with IE on my end, it’s working fine for me. From IE, I can open SharePoint document library in windows explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are facing the issue, we need the following information to investigate this issue,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Please provide the exact version of Internet Explorer (go to Settings&gt;About Internet Explorer).</li><li>Since when are you facing this issue?</li><li>A screenshot of the message when you click SharePoint and OneDrive.</li><li>How many users are affected?</li><li>Please check if you can open SharePoint site successfully in other browser such as Firefox or Chrome.</li></ol>
<p>Additionally, please resetting the browser and also try using the InPrivate mode, see if this works.</p>

            Escalation engineers have told me the open with explorer function is being removed and is unreliable. They admit the issue is the flawed authentication process which they are unable to fix. You can try creating network locations which are a far better
 option but you will likely run into the same auth problems again for which Msft offers no remedy. Since O365 is so hit or miss and so poorly supported, you may want to look into other providers such as Google, who offer products that actually work as promised.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the only document that have the scrolling issue? If it's convenient for you, could you create a new document and check the outcome?</p>
<p>Also, if you are using a Macbook, please check if issue persist while scrolling with the trackpad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a temporary work around, please use scroll bar on the Word for Mac instead of scrolling with the gesture. If you can't find the scroll bar, please refer to this article:

<p>
</p><p>my apologies, I should have listed my system specs as well:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm running MS Word 16.20</p>

</p><p>yes, unfortunately the problem has persisted, consistently with this document (and included copying the contents of the document into a fresh page), the problem is even occurring when I use the scroll bar on the side of the document, as per your suggestion.</p>

<p>I've found that reverting the scroll direction on my mouse has fixed the problem (by setting the scroll direction to natural); it's a "tail wagging the dog" kind of solution, but it works. &nbsp;Will you be updateing your software so that it works correctly,
 without cumbersome workarounds?</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>Since even scroll bar didn't work on your side, on my opinion, this issue is not related with your personal settings on the Mac.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, have you tried the safe mode and new user profile which I mentioned in my last reply? These two methods could be a great help for us to investigating the root cause of this issue.
</p>
<p>Please tell us the result after you tried these two methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am wondering if this issue only occurs on a document which have multiply pages, please check how scrolling behave in a document which has 6-10 pages.</p>
<p>Thanks for your cooperation in advance.</p>

<h2>            Nokia N8 Image Settings</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me understand why there are multiple camera options provided under Image Settings in Nokia N8? When you go to Image Settings, you will see an option "<strong>Capture Tone</strong>" with "<strong>Camera 1</strong>" as default. There are 4
 options available here to choose from. So if anyone has any details about it, can you please help me understand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Cannot Drag and drop file INTO a new email outlook 2007 as attachment</h2>

                    <span>I have recently bought a new PC with Win7 and I use MS Office Pro<br />
2007. I have my Outlook configured and have been using it for a few days now<br />
but since I installed it I have difficulty managing file attachments when trying<br />
to send email.<br />
<br />
I send files often to coworkers by dragging a document into the body of an<br />
email. This no longer works and I get the symbol of the red circle and line<br />
through it. HOWEVER, it works manually if I go through the steps using the<br />
paperclip button to attach files.<br />
<br />
It does work between emails though. I can create a new email and drag<br />
attachments from an existing email and drop into a the new email.<br />
<br />
I have no problems dragging an attachment OUT of email to my desktop or<br />
folder but I just can't drag anything into a new email.<br />
<br />
I only send Word, Excel, and PPT files so there shouldn't be any issue.<br />
<br />
Ran Diagnostics and no issues- I also have all the latest drivers and updates.<br />

I gave up trying to fix this, is has taken way to much of my time, I just reloaded Windows and all programs,&nbsp;everything&nbsp;works fine. Being this was a brand new computer I suspect it had some corrupted files from the factory install of Windows, but whatever it
 was I thank you all for your effort and time

<p>I currently cannot send any mail.</p>
<p>I've gotten several emails from "Outlook.com Team" stating:</p>
<p>We noticed some unusual activity in your Outlook.com account. To help protect you, we've temporarily blocked your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is followed by "Why are you seeing this" and "How can you unblock your account?" both with links.</p>
<p>This feels like a phishing but I mean I can't send mail, but I can receive them.</p>

<p>I've just spotted that with WLAN tethering the performance of my Nokia X drops rapidly. When I use it as WLAN hotspot, games and heavier applications start to run slow and choppy. As soon as I disconnect the WLAN hotspot, the performance recovers. Also the
 tethering does not run very smooth. Other devices lose the connection frequently.</p>

    <title>Cannot edit any cells in Cube Formula Report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> svenjav94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot edit any cells in Cube Formula Report</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working a lot with formula reports, which requires sheets including excel cube formulas connecting to our internal business intelligence database as well as pivot filters as reference cells for the cube formulas (both combined in one sheet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, while I never had problems to write notes and other formulas into cells outside of the pivot filters, I am not able to do so anymore as I get the message "cannot change this cells as it is affecting part of the pivot table". This does affect any
 (!) cell of the worksheet - even if I go to columns far away from the rest of the sheet content and try to enter something I get the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried to delete the pivot filters, but this is not possible as I get the same message (cannot edit the cell). Also, when I mark the whole worksheet and press delete, I get the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have similar issues or experiences on how to cope with this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Svenja&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Svenia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, could you provide the information below?</p>
<p>1.Regarding the cube formula you mentioned, could you provide an example?</p>
<p>2.For the error message "cannot change this cells as it is affecting part of the pivot table", please provide a related screenshot.</p>
<p>And the error massage "cannot edit the cell", please also capture a related screenshot.</p>
<p>3.Create a new workbook, paste content in it and check if you can edit in cells.</p>
<p>4.Detailed Office version. You can check it via Excel&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information. It looks like Version xxxx (Build xxxx.xxxx).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Hi Tina,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your quick response. I will try to provide all necessary answers and hope that you can help me solving this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Here is one example for the cube formulas I am using:&nbsp;</p>
<p>=CUBEVALUE(connection, member expression 1, member expression 2)<br />
The member expressions are defined before by myself by using =CUBEMEMBER(connection;member expression; [caption]) or by linking directly to a pivot table filter (the pivot table is based on a connection to the database which is also the base for the cube formulas).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Let's assume that I would like to type the shown x into the cell marked in red in below screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a24adf-acd7-4cad-8c61-64ca9e89932a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7a24adf-acd7-4cad-8c61-64ca9e89932a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press enter, I get the message below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2a32060-257a-4e31-90c6-63f68f725975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2a32060-257a-4e31-90c6-63f68f725975" /></a></p>
<p>I then need to press escape, otherwise I cannot even close the file. &nbsp;This message appears when I try to enter a value in any cell of the worksheet, even though the pivot filters and cube formulas do only take up very limited space in the file. I have also
 tried the same in sheets with only pivot tables where no cube formulas are included in the file, and I can edit any cell out of the pivot table without problems, so I guess this is an issue related to the cube formulas. I am also not able to delete the pivot
 filters or cube formulas from the worksheet and reenter them as I get the same message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Unfortunately, this does not work - I still cannot edit any cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The version I am using is Version 1706 (Build 8229.2086 Click-to-Run)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information provided does help in resolving the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and have a great weekend,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Svenja&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Asish,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid I cannot share the workbook as the connections link to our corporate database which is confidential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said, I did not encounter the problem before, I could edit the workbooks for months without problems until this issue appeared. This affects all workbooks I have with the same set up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just discovered that the whole worksheet where I used excel cube formulas seems to be converted to a pivot table automatically - actually, this is exactly what I wanted to avoid when using cube formulas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done any changes myself but figured out that the office update from 13th of July caused the error. I have tried to roll back to an earlier office version and the issue was solved, but unfortunately, my company has a set up that enforces office
 updates. So after the latest update was enforced again, the problem returned as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does actually affect a couple of other persons in my organization who are using the same set up of formula reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Problems sending e mails for Hotmail&#47;outlook account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> idfif  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems sending e mails for Hotmail&#47;outlook account.</h2>
                    This is not the first time I have experienced this since my hotmail account was changed over to outlook. I never had this problem ever with hotmail, however I am experiencing this problem on a regular basis now that my account is outlook.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I go to send an e mail that I have composed &nbsp;and click on the send icon all I get is little dots going round in a circular motion and they stay like that for a continued length of time. After waiting for a period of time I will try and cancel from
 sending the mail to try again as I think it is not going to work. I click on the cancel icon, but that does not work either. I click on on arrow next to Outlook which brings up a screen and I click on mail. This takes me back to my inbox and I click on sent
 and can see that the mail has been sent, although I am not sure if it as actually sent from the problems I experienced when sending the mail initially.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As i have already stated I never had this timing out problem when it was hotmail, although i get this now with outlook. I do not know why the screen is timing out when sending mail and it not giving my confirmation that my mail is sent and or that the
 cancel does not work when it is timing out and that I have to click on the tab by outlook and then back to mail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Furthermore, I do not only get the timing out little dots going in a circular motion when I am trying to send mail, however I also sometimes get little dots going across the top of screen in the blue bar in my inbox when I am trying to click on a mail
 to read in my inbox, again it times out and freezes and I have to try and refresh the screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please can something be done with these issues as this is happening on a regular basis and I am not happy with the experience that I am receiving. This is nothing to do with my laptop or the browser I am using as I have experienced this fault/problem numerous
 times on other desktops/laptops using other browsers! This is a system fault with outlook, which I never experienced once with hotmail!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have written previously on the forum site and reported this before, but nothing is done about it. I am still seriously considering going to either another email provider as I am not happy with what has happened since the change over from hotmail to outlook!!!</div>

            <div>Why is the emphasis being put back to the users and not Microsoft sorting the systemic problems that there are with Outlook!
<div><br />
<div>To reiterate, I never had any of these problems with Hotmail, and I can see from this forum that other users did not have problems with Hotmail too.This clearly shows that it is Outlook that has the problems and not the users!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Therefore, it is Microsoft that should resolves all the problems and not the users!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can not say to me that all the people on here that are complaining about Outlook and all it’s problems have something wrong with their browsers or systems that they are using, no they are not it’s Outlook itself that is at fault!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft are the ones who made the decision to change over from a perfectly fine and working Hotmail to inferior, fault ridden Outlook! Therefore, it is Microsoft who should be resolving the issues and not the users by having to spend time and effort!
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>NO MICROSOFT YOU SORT IT AND NOT ME! I WAS HAPPY WITH HOTMAIL THAT WORKED, YOU MADE THE CHANGE THEN YOU FIX IT FOR THE USERS!!!</div>

            <p>Hi IDFIF,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank for getting back to us. We apologize for the ordeals that you are encountering on your Microsoft account. Please be reminded that there are several reasons why an end user is experiencing these kind of issues. It may have been that our system is doing
 a maintenance, there is a server outage and/or a possible glitch in the system. Additionally, we cannot just&nbsp;ignore the possibility that the issue is with the end user. In such occasion, a browser related issue and system compatibility. Having that said, the
 best way to isolate the issue is to first optimize the browser and/or use other system/browsers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We perfectly understand that it seems to be redundant asking every users to do these things. However, those steps are needed for us to pin point the root cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us to continue to resolve your concern, it is best that you try to sign in to your account using another computer/browser for us to verify if the issue will still persist.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be awaiting for your reply as to what the outcome of our suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I've been having the exact same issue for the past two days. When sending an e-mail/replying to an e-mail using hotmail via Outlook, I am getting the continual spinning dots. The only way to exit is to exit out of Outlook completely. When I go back in
 and look at my Sent e-mails, the e-mails I was sending appear, but I'm not sure if they actually went through or not. It's crucial that my e-mail works properly. Please check what is happening.

            I had the exact same problem happen twice also. &nbsp;When I close out of the program and log back into Hotmail/Outlook, I can see that my message has been sent. &nbsp;(look in the sent folder.) &nbsp; I also notice that the "time stamp" for the email is off a few hours.

            I have done that numerous times and checked all of my browser and system, like so many others users! However, the problems persist and Microsoft do nothing about it, what a surprise there then!
<div><br />
<div>Nothing but spinning dots when sending a mail and no confirmation that the mail has been sent...this is a outlook issue that Microsoft need to resolve and not a user issue!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ma not the only one who is experiencing this problem, along with other problems, are we all having something wrong with our browsers/systems.....errrr no it isOutlook that has got the problem as I never had any of these issues when it was Hotmail, get
 it!!!&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            When will video streaming apps make it to Windows 10 Mobile&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this may be a difficult question to answer but i'm very confused and a tad bit frustrated.&nbsp; I understand that XBox is now running it's own version of Windows 10.&nbsp; XBox has Starz, Showtime, HBO, Amazon Video and so on, so I'd like to know if
 anyone may know if there are any plans to bring those apps into the Windows 10 Phone appstore.&nbsp; Those are pretty big players and i feel that having Hulu and Netflix just doesn't really cut it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for reading!</p>

<h3> mcb47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live won&#39;t import Outlook Contacts csv file</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday I purchased a Samsung Focus Windows 7 phone. I was trying desperately to avoid going with an iPhone. I have spent all morning trying to do one simple thing - import my contacts from Outlook into the phone. Per instructions I have exported a csv
 file of my Outlook contacts (I click on Properties and it tells me that it is a csv file). When I try to import it into Hotmail or Live for downloading to the phone an error message comes up indicating that it is not a csv file!</p>
<p>The iPhone of course will sync to Outlook seamlessly.</p>
<p>I simply do not understand what goes through their minds at Microsoft. How could they have created a product that is vitally important to any future that they might have in the phone market, without the ability to simply and seamlessly sync to Outlook?</p>
<p>Sadly&nbsp;my Windows 7 phone will no doubt be returned.</p>

<p>I just imported a csv file that I created last night into a windows live account.&nbsp; It was fairly straightforward and easy, so I'm not sure why you're having such troubles.</p>
<p>If you exported your contacts from Outlook into a CSV file, could you try opening it up in Excl and see if you can see anything in the file that might be causing problems?</p>
<p>Then save the file in Excel as a new CSV file.&nbsp; Maybe that will clear out any strange control characters that could be impeding your ability to import the file into Windows Live.</p>
<p>When you attempt to import the file into your Windows Live Contacts, are you choosing the Outlook option?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I generally do whenever I import an address list into Windows Live, is I'll view the file in Excel and make sure the column headings are named exactly the same as the Windows Live Contacts fields.</p>
<p>Also, out of curiosity, if you are already accustomed to using Outlook to manage your Contacts and Appointments, why don't you just install the Outlook Hotmail Connector to your computer and get it set up to sync that data from Outlook on your computer to
 your Windows Live account?</p>

    <title>Nokia maps what a rip-off. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sy700  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia maps what a rip-off.</h2>
                    I bought a 3-year licence in 2007 it cost £49.00, good value. I have since changed my phone and have struggled to get the remaining year of my licence transferred despite several calls and emails to Nokia Care going back and fore from several disinterested
 individuals. Another story which is not the reason for my message.<br />
<br />
I am staggered to learn that it now costs £52.00 for a one-year licence and another £18.00 for camera alerts. Do Nokia really think I am going to pay £70.00 a year when I can buy a Sat Nav or Smartphone software for £45.00. Yes you have to pay periodically
 for map updates but its not going to be anywhere near the original cost - and that £45.00 includes camera alerts.<br />

<p>Hi Sy700,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to point out that the £70 that you would spend&nbsp;on the <strong>Drive</strong> and
<strong>Traffic &amp; Safetly</strong> for Nokia Maps licenses&nbsp;are for the entire Europe region, while the service from Navmii.co.uk is for UK &amp; Ireland only. (Once European maps are available from this site then it would be an interesting comparison.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(so as not to mislead, the Traffic &amp; Safety license for Maps is for only certain countries - check the
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/maps</a> for the listings).</p>

<p>How many of us, of an age to have been driving for a few years, have old, but perfectly usable, RAC, AA etc road atlases kicking around? How often do roads in the UK, once mapped, actually change to any great extent? I mean change to the extent that you
 honestly will not now get to where you want to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everybody else sells their "Navigation" sytem for a one off payment, and offers users the opportunity to purchase the occasional map update. Just like buying the "New for 2010" RAC Road Atlas that some of us will buy from the bargain bin for £1.99 when queing
 for the cash desk in the petrol station. An impulse buy. Because we've used the old one for years perfectly well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old Nokia digital maps will be perfectly usable for years. But of course, Nokia realise that. And they realise that people won't renew them every year. So Nokia won't get regular money from their users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How then can Nokia screw as much money out of their users? Hmm..., let's see. Is there another part of the "Satellite Navigation" system which users cannot do without, even for 5 minutes, let alone 5 years? Oh wait... there is (luckily) one part - the actual
 "Navigation" system itself&nbsp; - yay!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Nokia gives away the maps free, because people wouldn't renew them very often anyway. And they make you pay regularly for the very "Navigation" system itself. How very considerate of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that, by giving away the digital maps, and the Maps software itself, they are only doing what Google, and now Navteq themselves, are doing. So not that generous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I bought my N97 I kept my old N95. The license automatically transferred itself to the N97, as I kept my old simcard. So My N95 had a geat GPS and no "Navigation" license. I thought about buying another Nokia Maps "Navigation" license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After only a little investigation of the alternatives, I purchased a copy of Garmin Mobile XT&nbsp; for £50, as a one-off payment. The maps aren't going to change much over time, and so far I've upgraded it free from V4 to V5, and updated the maps too. In these
 days, when you can buy whole dedicated SatNav systems for under £100, why would anybody pay to continue to use something they've already paid for? Especially when the Nokia N97 does it so badly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anybody at Nokia&nbsp; watching their share price?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All companies should be very caereful about giving their customers the slightest incentive to look elsewhere. If they do, they'll be so ticked off they won't come back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a postal strike in the UK today. Yet another opportunity for the opposition to the Post Office to bite off another big chunk of the postal market.</p>

<font>&nbsp; </font>
<p><font>I would have probably bought another Navigation licence after 3 years if the pricing structure were similar, i.e. close to the original price of £50 ish quid.</font></p>
<font>&nbsp; </font>
<p><font><font>But as 2bad pointed out, maps don’t really change to the degree of not really knowing where you’re going.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And as for Europe I’ll check what Navmii charge but again I’d buy the European maps once and that would be it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They’d change sure, but for the odd journey into Europe now and again its not going to matter much.<span>&nbsp;
</span></font></font></p>
<font>&nbsp; </font>
<p><font>For some people this will be irrelevant if they have no intention of going into Europe and only stay in the UK.</font></p>
<font>&nbsp; </font>
<p><font>The fact that Nokia have thought lets rip everyone off and charge ridiculously has pushed me to look elsewhere, and with the hassle of licence transfer I will.</font></p>
<font>&nbsp; </font>
<p><span><font>A point: My driving licence applies to me not my car.</font></span></p>

<p>I tend to agree with cbidlake. It's not actually true that everybody else's packages are for one-off payments, many charge for updates to their applications and map data - I drive extensively in around northern Europe, several countries have major roadworks
 to re-route traffic to meet demands of increasing users and many towns are being redeveloped with one way systems, limited access, etc., so it's important to have current data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The £1.99 atlas is useful to plan a route, but cannto be safely used whilst driving - safety is one of the most important benefits of sat-nav software, the voice guidance means that you rarely have to divert your eyes from the road, and when you need to
 look at the screen it cna be done as quickly as checking the rear-view mirrors.</p>

<p>I doubt that Nokia Maps is impacting on the share price, there are other factors at work - some Nokia's fault, others not, but Maps is actually getting cheaper. Updgrade to Maps 3 and you pay less for a year licence than in Maps 2 and that licecne covers
 much more. I'll bet that £50 Garmin doesn't cover all of Europe...</p>

<p>2bad -&nbsp;i certainly wasn't intending to confuse the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sy700 commented on the fact that&nbsp;Navmii.co.uk costs 45GBP for Navi and T&amp;S&nbsp;while for&nbsp;Nokia Maps it was 70GBP for navi and T&amp;S licenses.
</p>
<p>I was only pointing out that the Navmii.co.uk service is for UK&amp;IRE, while Maps is for Europe so there are differences in the coverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes - Maps uses a different billing structure to other Sat Nav's, but there are positives to this method&nbsp;:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Because both the application and map data are free, you can use it to plan routes or find your location/destination without cost - only if you then decide that you wish to have turn by turn directions need you purchase a license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Licenses of varying lengths mean that if you do choose to make use of the turn by turn navigation, you can purchase a license that is suited to your needs - 1 day, 30 day, 30 day subscription, 1 year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I actually like Nokia charging system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We currently run 3 sat nav systems, a BMW, a Garmin and a Nokia Maps.&nbsp; The BMW map updates cost about €300 twice a year for the whole of Europe, the Garmin updates cost €79 per update or €99 forever for just UK and Ireland whicle I got my nokia updates for
 €79 for the whole of Europe for 3 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when I go abroad for a 2 week holiday, Garmin maps will cost me approximately €100 per region/country when Nokia Maps will only cost €7.99 per month. If I do happen to return to the same country in a few years time, the Garmin map would be out of date
 while with the Nokia, another €7.99 gets me another months licence to navigate with the latest maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do actually update all the map data regularly regardless of cost. I think having to second guess your sat nav all the time because it's got old maps defeats the whole purpose of having one.There is nothing worse then to be directed the wrong way down a
 one way street or down a dead end. I will give 2 recent examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Trip to Glasgow last year using Garmin with 1 year old maps. Somewhere around the back of Buchanan Galleries, the Garmin directs to turn left where the traffic direction was recently changed and now you can only turn right. Turning right then brings you
 into a loop back to where you started from. I started to get a sense of deja vu after the 3rd loop and decide to use my Nokia, which got me out of there in double time.</p>
<p>2. Trip to Barcelona with 2 year old maps. On the way back to the airport the Garmin brought me on the old airport road which has been replaced by a motorway. Unfortunatele this old road now goes no where and is a dead end. Mad scramble to turn on the Nokia
 which gets me to the correct place in the nick of time.&nbsp;</p>

Ok, for “everybody” substitute “ others’ ”.<br />
<br />
Ok, so do you think your driving “extensively in around northern Europe” is representative of N97 users? Don’t “proper” drivers like you have top of the range SatNavs rather than cheapskate multifunction jobs?<br />
<br />
At no time did I ever compare an RAC Atlas with a SatNav – jeez. However, not so long ago we ALL used them to navigate with – there was no other option. Have you never heard of the word “analogy”? We don’t need a lecture on the safety benefits on using a SatNav
 – we all bought one for goodness sake.<br />
<br />
Quote:- I'll bet that £50 Garmin doesn't cover all of Europe...<br />
<br />
No, you’re right - it doesn’t. Garmin allowed me to buy what I needed – a license for the UK. What happened to my choice of buying a UK licence from Nokia? They took the choice away. I’ve never driven outside of Europe in my life. Thanks for the choice Nokia.<br />
<br />
Quote:- Being able to transfer your licence is not news, it's a built-in feature of the service.<br />
<br />
So? You’re right, it’s not news, so why waste space pointing it out? I only mentioned it to explain the Garmin purchase.<br />
<br />
Quote:- Navteq has been owned by Nokia for many months now, so it is Nokia's generousity that gives you the free Navteq!<br />
<br />
Exactly – they are exactly as generous as they are in giving away the “free” Nokia Maps application for the phone. (i.e. NOT). This is becoming a “circular” argument.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
@cbidlake<br />
<br />
For the lack of choice between UK and Europe (now)&nbsp; see comment above.<br />
Your other comments about planning journeys without “Navigation” are covered by Google, and have been for some time.<br />
<br />
So, if Nokia didn’t provide “Navigation” it wouldn’t have a product to sell at all.<br />
<br />
Journey planners have been freely available for years. It’s the “Turn by turn Navigation” which, as mccbleue so rightly points out keeps us all safe, which people are buying, again, and again, and again… (from Nokia, anyway).<br />
<br />
@cjjlim<br />
<br />
Nokia Maps directed me onto a footpath recently. Don’t you people ever read road signs? Do you really hand your entire brains over to your SatNav when driving?<br />
<br />
I’m sure you feel secure paying regularly for occasional updates (only 3 monthly at best, as Nokia just pointed out) in case you ever need them.<br />
<br />
Others among us use SatNavs to assist with our own powers of navigation, not to replace our brains. For the money you guys seem happy to pay, I could probably buy myself a new Tom Tom, or similar, annually. The whole hardware unit that is, not just the software.<br />
<br />
As I tried to point out. Nokia have taken away choice of region, and are (perfectly naturally, of course) attempting to extract as much money as possible from us.<br />
If all I want to do on my expensive N97 is “journey planning” I can also do that for free using Google Maps, complete with photos (not cartoons) and street level view (where available, of course).<br />
<br />
Thanks Garmin for giving me the choice of a UK lcence, and a one-off purchase.<br />

<p>Personally I like Nokia's pricing scheme better.&nbsp; If I go visit another country, I just grab their maps for free, and buy a 1 week or 1 month navi license.&nbsp; With a standalone GPS unit, I'd have to pay full price for another country's maps, which I guarantee
 you will be more expensive than Nokia's 1 month navi license for any given region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, in my city and in general in most big cities in America, there is a considerable amount of road construction going on.&nbsp; So yes, there are new highways or other major roads added on a yearly basis, and for me having free map updates is definitely more
 important than having free navigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that others may prefer the pay-for-maps licensing scheme, but Nokia is by no means foolish to choose their method.&nbsp; It's just different ... if you really hate it so much, don't use it.&nbsp; They're not offending anyone by choosing that method, it's
 just a business model. :)</p>

<p>I too don’t mind Nokia’s pricing scheme. I’ve looked at some of the other gps units referred to, like the Garmin Mobile XT: these are not necessarily dream solutions; they have many limitations. POI data bases are many times out of date
 and traffic updates can be useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Living in the U.S., there are always building of new housing subdivisions: one month a collection of roads was not there; the next month it is. By no means is this an unqualified endorsement of Nokia. But for a reasonable annual fee,
 one gets fairly good voice navigation for driving over the entire 48 contiguous states (and Alaska). That, I think, is hard to beat.</p>

    <title>OneDrive Sync Issues- Credentials Required. Did Not Install KB3085566. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneDrive Sync Issues- Credentials Required. Did Not Install KB3085566.</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot see where&nbsp;KB3085566 was installed after it was released on 10/15, so I am unable to install it. I am running Office&nbsp;15.0.4763.1002. It has been over a week now that I have not been able to get my OneDrive to sync 100% of the time. I have tried the
 following:</p>
<p>1. Stopped syncing all libraries<br />
2. Unsintalled OneDrive for Business<br />
3. Reinstalled<br />
4. Cleared my cache<br />
5. Repaired the libraries<br />
6. Synced the library back</p>
<p>After I stopped syncing the folders and then set it up to sync a new libary, I was getting the credentialing error at first. It did resolved for a while today. However, now this evening when I try to save some new files out to my One Drive the credentialing
 error is back. I am unsure if my problem is the&nbsp;SP31654 issue since I cannot find any information on the 10/15 KB being installed on my machine.</p>
<p>How can I correct my onedrive sync problem?</p>

<p>Hi Carla,</p>
<p>Do you install Office 2013 from <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the Office 365 portal</a>? If so, I’d like to explain that the installed Office 2013 is updated automatically because it is installed by click-to-run. The KB3085566 is applied to the Office 2013 installed by MSI which is not updated automatically. So the SI
 SP31654 may still affect &nbsp;your OneDrive for Business which is automatically updated to 15.0.4763.1002.</p>
<p>I suggest you monitor the view current information and updates on SHD via the link here.</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#@/ServiceStatus/ServiceStatusHistory.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#@/ServiceStatus/ServiceStatusHistory.aspx</a>&gt;</p>
<p>We will update &nbsp;in the primary thread&nbsp;below&nbsp;once the issue is resolved. And you can obtain the most recent information from SHD.</p>
<p>&lt;&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/413709&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

            Try following
<br />
<br />1. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />2. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />4. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator.

<p><span>Hi Tyler,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that the invitation email doesn’t include a link to go to the shared site after you share it with users in your environment.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the issue in your environment, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. About “</span><span>when I attempt to invite users to a specific site collection the invitation that is sent out to them does not
 include a link to the site itself. Instead, if there's no extra text entered, it will show 'Go to' and then have a blank field ahead of it.<span>”, could you list the detailed reproducing steps? Does the issue happen in both the SharePoint classic interface
 and the SharePoint modern interface? Meanwhile, upload some related screenshots of the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Check if the issue happens in the specific site.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Check if the issue happens in all users in your company when sharing the site with them.</span></span></p>

<p>Hey Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The detailed reproducing step is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Login to the site</p>
<p>2. Go to Site Settings and click on 'People and Groups'</p>
<p>3. Click on 'Member's and then 'New'</p>
<p>4. Enter the invitee's email in the appropriate field and either fill out the optional message or don't (occurs either way)</p>
<p>5. Click 'Send'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user, after receiving the email, will see the following:</p>
<p>https://i.imgur.com/mjTVvo7.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Only occurs with this site. We have around 15-20 others that have not experienced this issue.</p>
<p>3. We tested with 10 internal accounts and around 8 external accounts. This occured for all the users when attempting to share the site with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Project headcount over calendar time exercise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daesthai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project headcount over calendar time exercise</h2>
                    <p><strong>Need:</strong></p>
<p>I want to use excel to measure personnel headcount against upcoming potential project headcount requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Desire: </strong></p>
<p>To enter information for a potential project that includes headcount by discipline, start date, and duration in weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Given (see screenshot):</strong></p>
<p>- discipline availability in terms of headcount per week.</p>
<p>- project requirements in terms of headcount, starting date, and duration in weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>How do I reference the starting date of a given project and have excel subtract the given headcount for the related discipline starting on the proper week in in the availability area and for the proper number of weeks moving forward?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance: for incoming project number one, deduct 5 from the developers headcount in the availability section starting the week of 1/15 and through the week of 3/19 (10 weeks).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I need an end date rather than a duration in weeks to make the solution work, I'm open to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide!</p>

<h2>            Outlook AppleScript Help Needed&#58; How to delete an email address from a contact record</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I have written an AppleScript to delete any email address records in Microsoft Outlook that have a facebook.com domain. This is my script:</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; repeat with eachEmail in emailList<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if address of eachEmail contains "facebook.com" then<br />

</p><p class="contentStandard">When run, the script does not throw an error, and it returns a result of "" in the Script Editor.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Can anyone help me with the proper syntax? The email address property is not listed as a read only in the AppleScript dictionary, so I assume it can be changed.<br />

I understand that you wanted to delete the email address from a contact card via Apple script. Given the situation, I would suggest you contact Apple support for the script questions and issue. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
