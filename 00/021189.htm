<h2>            Slow McAfee and no Internet</h2>
                    <p>I installed McAfee Total Protection on my Lenovo Flex with Windows 10 about six months ago. Everything was running smoothly, untill two weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't access the Internet from any browser, and McAfee performs quite slow, and even gets frozen. I only can access the Internet once McAfee has finished working, which can take several hours. Other programs (eg. Office) run perfectly as long as I
 don't try to open McAfee.</p>
<p>It's the only antivirus installed on my laptop, as Windows Defender is disabled. I totally ignore what McAfee is doing, as it doesn't seem to be performing anything in particular, and there're not too many files stored in the HDD, as I barely use the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these issues because of McAfee, Windows, or a virus?</p>

<p>
</p><p>After <strong>COUNTLESS </strong>hours trying to update from 16199 to ANY later build it appears that Microsoft may well have discontinued to support my PCs hardware!</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK my platform is a tad older than many, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>but not ALL</em></span>, (P5N32-E SLI Plus motherboard with Nvidia chipset, Intel Core 2 Duo E8600 CPU, 8Gb DDR2 RAM, Nvidia GT710 GPU, 1 x 125Gb IDE + 2 x 200Gb SATA HDDs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER it did qualify for the "free" update from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and, having signed up on the Insider program,
<strong>it updated to build 16199 BUT NO FURTHER!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now OK, I understand and accept that Microsoft cannot continue to support legacy hardware for an eternity BUT is it unreasonable to expect that some indication would be provided, prior to or during the update, informing me that my hardware was no longer
 supported.....??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've wasted countless hours attempting to install builds released after 16199 and,
<strong>NOT ONCE</strong>, was there any suggestion that my hardware was unsupported!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IF MICROSOFT EXPECT "INSIDERS" TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF WINDOWS THEN IT MUST TREAT THEM WITH FAIRNESS AND RESPECT!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SIMPLY&nbsp;OUTRAGIOUS!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>P.S. </strong>This also begs the question, what will <strong>Microsoft's policy be on future security updates.</strong>.. will my configuration, hardware and software continue to receive these fixes?? Will Windows Defender continue to function, will
 3rd party security applications still function? ....... and many more questions regarding Windows SAS!!!!</p>

            &nbsp;All I can say is that I upgraded 30 systems from 7 to 10, some laptops, some desktops, and as far as I'm aware none of these have had the first problem.&nbsp; Also I have an 8 year old desktop with an E7500 CPU, that's successfully run every insider build
 since 10/1/17.&nbsp; My other 8 year old desktop has an AMD Athlon-II X3 CPU and it's run every insider build since 10/1/17, so from what I've seen it seems that your situation is in a very small minority.

<p>Hi Lacrumb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my PC was on the "Fast" ring it got all the way through to 16199 but no further. Since 16215 was released I've spent most of my days trying
<em><strong>every </strong></em>combination from the standard Windows update, downloaded ISOs from Microsoft, others created using UUPtoISO, burned on DVDs, mounted, RUFUS USBs, finally re-starting with a clean install of 143936<strong>*</strong> on a bare
 drive, updating to 15063.483 then re-joining the Insider program to get the latest build - invariably this is found, downloaded and, inevitably, fails to complete successfully. Latest update to 16241 and, no doubt, 16245 will likely be the same - but I'll
 give it a shot anyway. Latterly I've run SFC, DISM, Update Troubleshooter prior to attempting an update but nothing helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost without exception, the update process appears to complete successfully, all the way to 100%, even with an interim auto restart at c. 30% will see the process to completion. Then, on the final restart, I see the Windows logo for a few seconds then
 it restarts and it's back at 15063.483. A simple message in the action centre saying the update failed, the history says a restart is required and off it goes again to download the update....... not much by way of a clue in the log files - at least searching
 the errors reported doesn't point towards the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*</strong>The only ISO that will clean install on a bare drive from a DVD is 14393 - even 15063 fails with an old school request to load drivers before it get to the stage where I can select the drive on which to install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly the drivers for the storage devices were missing from build 15063 and that leads me to believe that they may well have been migrated during subsequent successful updates to 16199..... but not beyond. Perhaps driver migration is now only a feature
 of an RTM update but that means no more clean installs from an ISO. Speculation I know but I'm now at a loss to understand what's happened to the Insider builds on the Fast ring (the Slow ring hasn't proved any exception).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the comments here about <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3208076/windows/windows-10-is-no-longer-supported-on-this-pc-error-clover-trail-atom.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ending Windows 10 support</a> it indicates that there may well be other unnamed casualties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a disc image of 15063.483 ready for the Fall update but I'm not holding out much hope unless Microsoft include the Nvidia chipset drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Colin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main difference is that your motherboard has an Intel chipset while mine is Nvidia so it rather looks like Intel continues to update its drivers for Windows 10 while Nvidia have not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That still begs the question as to why my PC got all the way up to 16199 and no further... if the drivers were OK then, and the Insider builds since don't imply any major underlying changes, then why are they no longer provided?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I should dump Asus/Nvidia or Microsoft/Windows 10 - maybe both!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless Microsoft fix this the Fall update will be a Fall upset for quite a few people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>I've got ISOs of 14393, 15063, 16193, 16226, 16232 and now 16241 and, as I said, only 14393 will allow me to perform a clean install on a bare drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only conclude that the Nvidia chipset drivers were dropped from 15063 onwards but how did it update to 16199 and no further? Only Microsoft can answer that I suspect.</p>

<p>Hi tyamar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the information that you provided, it seems that you are looking at the event logs of the
<strong>Outlook</strong> application via the <strong>Event Viewer</strong>. We would like to ask though; can you elaborate on what you are trying to accomplish by interpreting the said logs? Are you having issues saving draft emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The codes that are indicated on P1, P2, and P3 can be better interpreted by engineers and developers. On the other hand, you may also need to use a different debugging application to decode the said logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the above information said, we highly suggest that you post your query via our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN </a>website. We have engineers and developers that we may be better equipped in answering your concern.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac - constantly writing to the disk</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Recently, I have noticed that my Outlook 2016 on Mac is constantly writing to the disk. Throughout the day this can amount to over 100GB (based on Activity Monitor information). &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The outlook version is 15.37 (170815)</p>
<p>MacBook Pro (Late 2013) &nbsp;macOS Sierra 10.12.4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody experienced a similar issue? &nbsp;I spoke to the Microsoft support already but they were unable to provide a solution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>I'm guessing that you have used the licence already in another phone? This would lock the licence to your SIM card and allow it to be used on several phones. You'll find that if you put the old SIM back in, it will work normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not something you can solve yourself - you need to call Nokia customer services, they have to release the licence so that you can manually re-enter the licence code and the server then accepts it again.</p>

<p>Hi Mitchell,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You failed to mention what kinds of search criteria you tried. &nbsp;Are you searching by date? &nbsp;In the Advanced Search control pane did you try using Date set to 04/01/2013 with Range set for "+/- 1 month". &nbsp;Are you searching all folders? &nbsp;Do you have any emails
 older than April 2013? &nbsp;Did your search return any messages? &nbsp;Did your search return more than one page of messages (check the "go to" bar at the bottom of the message list to see if there is more than one page in the message set).</p>

<h2>            Trying to close account&#59; Says there is billing information when there is none</h2>
                    <p>To Whomever this may Concern,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a months-old issue that I thought would be fixed once I spoke to an Outlook team member via Messenger early last month. I have been trying to close an account, but cannot because I am told that there is billing information that first must be
 cancelled. There is no such thing. The team member I spoke to even said there were no billing accounts attached to my Outlook account. I was then told that this matter would be taken up by a higher level of Outlook management, and that I would receive a call
 within the next 48 hours. I never received this call, and I am still not able to delete this account. This situation is getting a little old now, and I wish to close this account as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate someone's quick and helpful response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello Premarathne,</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>From your reply, we can see the cause of this issue is the account used for login to the Skype for Business isn't an Office 365 for Business account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your concern, based on my experience, the Office 365 Personal plan can't be switched to Business Plans directly. If you need upgrade to a Business subscription, please follow the steps in the
 article as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Upgrade-Office-365-for-home-to-a-business-subscription-9322ffb8-a35d-4407-8ebe-ed6ea0859b9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Upgrade-Office-365-for-home-to-a-business-subscription-9322ffb8-a35d-4407-8ebe-ed6ea0859b9f</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please feel free to let us know at your convenience.</p>

            <p>It is normal behavior for Access to create empty cells. They are usually shown in a stacked or tabular view. They don’t seem to hurt anything.</p>
<p>They’re helpful if, when you design a form in stacked or tabular arrangement, you decide to move the contents of a cell to another location. Keeps everything neat and aligned.</p>

            As Peter indicates, those come from the automated creation process, where Access creates a "tabular" style form. You can remove the layout and your form will look exactly the same. To remove it, open the form in Design view, click Form Design Tools &gt;&gt;
 Arrange, and click the Remove Layout button on the Table ribbon section.

<h2>            How to delete OneDrive file that is shared with me&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all! I am facing a BIG issue in OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have opened a OneNote notebook that was shared with me via a link. But the OneNote file is not needed anymore for me. Still, the OneNote file is showing in
<em>OneNote O</em><em>nline.</em> I cannot remove it from the list in OneNote Online. When I click the unintended notebook, then I get this OneDrive location. But I cannot remove it from the&nbsp;<em>Shared</em> list too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot of <em>OneDrive Online</em> (there is no option for removing the notebook file from the&nbsp;shared list):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad1c132c-bc79-468f-bb39-e7e8346c7f01?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad1c132c-bc79-468f-bb39-e7e8346c7f01?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot of <em>OneNote Online</em> (the blue-colored notebook is unintended, to be removed; the other two red-colored notebooks are mine, important.):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75efddb9-e36f-4ff8-86c9-cf340fc13e42?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75efddb9-e36f-4ff8-86c9-cf340fc13e42?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I cannot find any option to remove the OneNote notebook file. How to remove it from MY list? My OneNote Online is cluttered by this unintended notebook. Note that I do not have any
<em>Office 365</em> subscription. I wish I do not need to buy&nbsp;<em>OneDrive for Business</em> or other premium product just to remove it from my list! Please help me to fix the issue. Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p>Hi Penny Cornish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question here in the forum. We are happy to assist you with your inquiry of how to import a photo to your new Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how you feel about this. To import a photo to your profile, just log on to profile.live.com and sign in using your Outlook.com account. After logging in it will direct you to the home page and you will see a blob squared picture, under that
 you'll see "change picture", click that and upload your preferred picture. That will be the profile picture of your Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have other questions or concerns, please don't to ask us, answers are just waiting for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>MS Access 2016 program on some PCs has errors with Out Of Stack Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenthartland  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2016 program on some PCs has errors with Out Of Stack Space and Security Warnings.</h2>
                    The program runs fine on my machine. When I try to run it on my friends' machines (either the .ACCDE or .ACCDB version) it won't load and pops Out Of Stack Space errors and the Security Notice instead.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, here's the set up:<br />
-----<br />
The program was written in Access 2016. It is a Front End/Back End design. It's not a very big program 16 tables, 41 forms and 51 code modules.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I use the FMS Access Analyzer to help make sure my code is clean so the quality of the program is good to very good.<br />
<br />
PRIOR versions of the program ran fine on all machines. I made several changes, improvements and moved it to the \Documents folder. Now we are having problems.<br />
----<br />
<br />
Machine 'A' (Development PC): New Win 10, 8GB RAM, Full MS Access (not runtime).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Machine 'B': Newish laptop 2GB RAM, lots of disk, Access 2016 Runtime. It ran prior versions of the program fine but now is blowing errors.<br />
<br />
Machine 'C': Newish desktop 8GB RAM lots of free disk, full Access (not runtime). It also ran prior versions of the program fine but now is blowing errors.<br />
----<br />
<br />
Initally, the opening form would pop an error that the On Load event caused an Out Of Stack Space event. User says,&nbsp;<br />
"Still happens after a fresh reboot.&nbsp; It does NOT happen with other .accde files." Both A and B machines are showing the same errors.<br />
<br />
I made many changes but could not cure the Out Of Stack Space error. Finally, I went to an Autoexec Macro instead of a startup form. The autoexec macro that caused Error 3709 and aborted the macro. Machine B had CPU 49%, Mem 60%. The micro sd drive had 5.79GB
 used and 113GB free.<br />
<br />
I deleted the macro. Went back to startup Form, still no luck.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I asked if he got a MS Security error, he said, "Yes, Microsoft Access Security Notice.&nbsp; Figuring just a general warning since it let's me go ahead and open the file. The directory where we have the program (C:Documents\Condor) was already a Trusted Location
 on my work machine."<br />
----<br />
So, does this sound like a Security error?&nbsp;<br />
Is it a problem to have the program in the \Documents folder?

<p>Okay, the problem is solved. Thank you for your time and advice!<br />
<br />
The tables were no longer linked and some code in the startup form literally blew its Stack looking for a data column.<br />
<br />
Feel free to test this yourself and post it wherever it might do some good. And, remember, an Out Of Stack space error can be caused by unlinked tables.<br />
<br />
So this is what I put in the Startup form's On Open event:<br />

<h2>            HAS THE FEB 2017  MALICIOUS SOFTWARE  REMOVAL TOOL BEEN ISSUED&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30px">I have the Jan 2017 release of the Malicious Software Removal Tool and have run it twice. &nbsp;Each time, I kept a check on it to see how many items it found. &nbsp;Each time it showed one item, but when it finished, the report showed none.
 WHY? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think I have a bug because my google mail won't let me in and I have done everything to fix it. I have run scans with Micro. Security Essent., AVG, Windows Defender, and Microsoft Support Tool.
 &nbsp; I thought that maybe the updated version of the malicious removal tool might find the bug.</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for any help.

<p>
</p><p>Don't worry about the item found during the scan. The result is what counts. When the scan terminates with nothing found then MSRT decided that whatever it looked at during scanning was not malware/malicious.</p>

<h2>            Bug in Excel 2016 while Checking in to Sharepoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody else noticed this bug in Excel 2016 (Office 365 version 16.0.6001.1034)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Excel workbook from Sharepoint 2013 workspace</p>
<p>2. Check out</p>
<p>3. Make some changes</p>
<p>4. Check in</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point you will always get an error telling that "UPLOAD FAILED We're sorry this didn't work. Try saving later and if that still doesn't work, click Save a Copy."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click Save button before Checking in everything will work smoothly just like it worked with older Excel versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Sami</p>

            <p>I am pretty sure that this is more related to Excel than Sharepoint, because it worked perfectly with older Excel versions (f.ex 2010 or 2013) and doesn't work with Excel 2016 and how it works or fails is similar with Sharepoint 2010 and 2013.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might help for OneDrive issues, but not for the original issue with checking in to Sharepoint from Office 2016 products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated my O365 version of Office 2016 with yesterdays patches to version 16.0.6001.1038 and it doesn't change anything related to this bug. Checking in still fails if document already exists in Sharepoint and if there are unsaved changes in that
 document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good work around for this bug is to click save button before clicking check in -button, but I am telling you that this is a bug because with earlier Office version it worked without clicking to save button and it doesn't make any sense to change the behavior
 like this.</p>
<p>

<p>Sami</p>

            <p>I have this same issue on my personal installation, and so does a client of ours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't seem to impact all users, but it certainly is impacting me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After playing with it quite a bit, it appears that the initial upload/save essentially gets interrupted by the attempt to check in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just like you said, doing the Save then Check In works. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Nice to hear that this doesn't just affect us, but also other users around the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to get Microsoft acknowledge this as a bug and fix it. I already tried chat with their support and show this thread, but instructions they send back as email showed that they didn't understand this at all. I tried to reply to that email they
 sent, but they have ignored that ticket totally. Maybe I have to open new chat with them.</p>

            Actually, the company I work for has MS Premier Support - we have submitted this to them, and they've been able to recreate it on their side - so hopefully there will be a KB in the not so distant future that will resolve the issue.

            Did you manage to reach a resolution with this? I've been running into the same issue and although it can be worked around, it's not a fun experience.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the print out when using the Excel mobile application for iOS devices is enlarged, this could be due to the "Scaling" settings currently set in the applications.
 Kindly check the screenshots below to check the "Scaling" setting currently set in the application.</span></p>

<h2>            Links don&#39;t work correctly when the files are in the onedrive folder</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to do a powerpoint presentation with various charts from an excel sheet in a way that they auto-update every time I open the presentation. For that purpose, I am copying the charts from excel and pasting them in&nbsp;powerpoint using:
<strong>paste special, Paste link.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do that on two files that are only on my hard disk ( for example on my desktop) the links work fine and they update the charts upon opening the file. In the:
<strong>edit links to file.&nbsp;</strong>they appear as <strong>type: worksheet.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do the same exact procedure on to files that are on my hard disk but in the Onedrive file the links won't&nbsp;update when I open the powerpoint file a second time.&nbsp;In the:&nbsp;<strong>edit links to file.&nbsp;</strong>they appear as&nbsp;<strong>type: HTML.&nbsp;</strong>and
 the <strong>source: https://d.docs.live.....</strong><strong>/??? </strong>( the link is finished with three question marks)&nbsp;</p>
<p>why is the link breaking? knowing that the files are on my PC too. The Onedrive, the office, and the PC are all using the same email address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Roy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, it will be best to transfer files directly from your Hard Drive. OneDrive files will show source: https://d.docs.live since these files are from the Cloud Storage.<br />
<br />
You may also update the external reference in Excel to reflect the change. Let us try changing it on your Excel Files link and see if it works. Kindly check
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-or-change-source-workbooks-of-external-references-links-ae3e687c-97ae-4d9b-b684-8756a5301253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open or change source workbooks of external references (links)</a></strong>.

<p>Hello Rey</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files that I am trying to refer to are on my hard disk ( in the Onedrive&nbsp;folder) as long as the source file is open (excel sheet) I can close and open the destination file (powerpoint) without losing the link. if the source file is closed the destination
 file will have broken links and wont&nbsp;be able to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth noting that the files (source and destination) are available offline from my hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>transferring&nbsp;the files from my Onedrive file to just my hard disk ( without any syncing with my Onedrive) defeats the purpose of having a Onedrive storage of 1TB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can change the links manually as you suggested, but since my file will contain in excess of 20 links it will be easier for me to redo the presentation from the start, defeating the purpose of having links in my presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>please advise.</p>
<p>thank you for your help.</p>
<p>Roy</p>

<h2>            Project Standard 2013 Consistently Won&#39;t Install on WIndows 8 Pro - &#34;Something Went Wrong&#34; Error</h2>
                    <p>On a brand new laptop with no versions of any Office programs installed (not even trial versions), running a fresh activated install of Windows 8 Pro 64-bit, I am consistently getting the "Something went wrong.&nbsp; Sorry, we ran into a problem.&nbsp; Try going online
 for additional help." when attempting to install Project Standard 2013.&nbsp; Here are the details...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased three full retail boxed product keys: Office Professional 2013, Visio Professional 2013, and Project Standard 2013.&nbsp; I installed Office Professional 2013 without any problem.&nbsp; I waited for the full installation to complete before proceeding.&nbsp;
 I then installed Visio Professional 2013, also without any problem.&nbsp; I waited for the full installation to complete before proceeding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then attempted to install Project Standard 2013.&nbsp; I entered the product key at office.com/setup, and it was accepted.&nbsp; I verified that I was installing the 32-bit version and then clicked the green Install button.&nbsp; Almost immediately after running the
 installer program, I got the "Something went wrong.&nbsp; Sorry, we ran into a problem.&nbsp; Try going online for additional help." message.&nbsp; I closed it, closed out everything, and tried again.&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp; I rebooted and tried again.&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on what I have read about this type of issue in the forums, here is what I have tried/checked&nbsp;already:</p>
<ul>
<li>I ensured that the system had no versions of any Office application installed - this is a brand new system with a fresh install of Windows 8, then upgraded to Windows 8 Pro Pack.&nbsp; No OEM-supplied Office trials.</li><li>I ensured that all three product installations (Office, Visio, and Project) I attempted to install were all 32-bit versions.</li><li>I temporarily disabled antivirus scanning before the attempt to install Project Standard 2013 - this made no difference, same error.</li><li>I ensured that there are no files lying around in my Downloads folder.</li><li>I attempted to run the Project installation directly from the web page on office.com, and also tried downloading it and then running it locally - this made no difference, same error.</li><li>I rebooted the system after the first couple of errors, thinking something might be still running in background&nbsp;- this made no difference, same error.</li><li>I tried waiting a couple of hours, in case some background task from the other installat

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/office-2013-known-issues-HA102919019.aspx</a>&nbsp;, but since my products are retail versions, I didn't think this would apply in this case, so I did not attempt to do the online repair to get one product or the other, as
 outlined on that page.</li><li>I tried downloading the Project 2013 disc image and attempted to run setup on the disc - this made no difference, same error occurred immediately.</li><li>I tried to contact Microsoft support&nbsp;for help, but when I entered the product key under the Project 2013 support area, it said the key could not be found.&nbsp; I triple-checked that the key was entered correctly.&nbsp; The only support option provided was fee-based,
 and that didn't seem reasonable, since I can't even get the product installed.</li></ul>
<p>Any assistance in getting Project Standard 2013 installed and coexisting with Visio Pro 2013 and Office Pro 2013 would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>I would go to the source of where I purchased the license key and see if&nbsp;vendor can be resolved.&nbsp; If&nbsp;that fails, I would ask for refund and get credit card company involved if refund is denied.&nbsp; When you purchase software, it is suppose to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that fails, then I would open ticket with Microsoft.&nbsp; I understand that&nbsp;Microsoft has a fee, but if it is something wrong because of Microsoft actions, they will not charge the fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't like this approach I outlined above, but based on everything being new and out of box, it should just work.&nbsp; The key thing that seems weird is that Microsoft didn't recognize the license key, so this is the source of problem.</p>

            <p>You appear to have tried most things, and I'm somewhat at a loss to help, but I've got&nbsp;4 suggestions for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you logged on as the local administrator.&nbsp; I've had an issue before installing Office software, even though I was an member of the local administrator's group, I wasn't logged on with the administrator account.</p>
<p>2. When I was last in the MS store, certain products (Project included and maybe the rest of office) were only available for sale in North America - not sure if this is a purely licencing or technical restriction.&nbsp; If you are in N America, I'm sure you can
 rule this one out.</p>
<p>3. Can you install Project on a different machine, to make sure your media is correct.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Install a trial version of Project Pro (alas standard isn't available as a trial).&nbsp; If this works, they we know your other installations of Win8 and Office are not the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH, Ben.</p>

            <p>Michael - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased the keys directly from Microsoft (via Microsoft Company Store).&nbsp; All were shrink-wrapped retail products, and all the product license keys were accepted just fine by office.com/setup at the time I tried to install them.&nbsp; The only place that didn't
 recognize the key (Project key, in this case) was the support site, where I would have qualified for free support if the key had been recognized there.&nbsp; All the&nbsp;product keys (including Project) still show up as correct/valid in my office.com account area.&nbsp;
 So, it's just the support site that wouldn't take the Project key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good suggestion that the support fee might be waived at the end of the day.&nbsp; I may go down the path of opening a ticket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I am logged on as a local administrator, but am not using the "administrator" account.&nbsp; I will try that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I am in North America, and purchased all the product keys in retail boxes directly from the Microsoft Company Store.&nbsp; So, I agree that this is not the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) No media came with these products&nbsp; They 're just&nbsp;product keys that allow installation through office.com/setup.&nbsp; In a later attempt, I downloaded the disc image from the site, and tried installing from that downloaded image - but got the exact same result.&nbsp;
 I will try installing on a different machine, but ultimately, I need Office, Visio, and Project to all coexist on the same laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) I will add the Project Pro trial version install to my list of things to try.</p>

            <p>Success, finally!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is&nbsp;what I ended up doing.&nbsp; I know some of this might seem like overkill, and unfortunately, because I altered multiple things at once, I don't know which specific change led to the successful outcome.&nbsp; Nevertheless, perhaps this will be of some help&nbsp;to
 those who find themselves in the same "something went wrong"&nbsp;boat:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempted an Online Repair of Office, which cranked for a very long time and did cause Project 2013 to suddenly appear in Control Panel | Programs and Features list.&nbsp; However, after watching it continue to run for several hours in stage 3 of 4 with no way
 to judge progress, and&nbsp;because there was no cancel button, I made an executive decision&nbsp;to reboot.</li><li>Given my abandonment of the repair process, it's probably no surprise that none of the Office apps (including Visio) would launch anymore.&nbsp; So, via Control Panel, I uninstalled Office, Visio, and Project, and then ran the Office cleanup "Fix It" described
 at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; At this point,&nbsp;I believe that all Office traces were gone.</li><li>Manually created a restore point.</li><li>Enabled the local Administrator account on Windows 8, gave it a password, and logged into it.&nbsp; (Ran&nbsp;cmd.exe as administrator, and used the "net user administrator /active:yes" command.)</li><li>Downloaded disc images for all three products from&nbsp;my account at office.com.</li><li>Physically burned them all to discs, rather than relying on mounting the images (just in case there is some issue with the&nbsp;image mounting feature).</li><li>While logged onto the Administrator account, installed Office Pro 2013 from the disc created in step 6.</li><li>Verified that all Office-included programs launch.</li><li>Manually created a restore point.</li><li>Still as Administrator, installed Visio Pro 2013 from the disc created in step 6.</li><li
 account.&nbsp; But subsequent runs didn't ask for this.</li></ol>
<p>One other difference between this sequence and the original attempts is that, during these last installs from&nbsp;burned discs, I opted not to sign in to my Microsoft account during any of the installations.&nbsp; So, these installations were as "local" as&nbsp;I could
 make them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to all for your ideas/recommendations.</p>

            <p>Glad you got this resolved in the end Ken and sorry you had such a battle.&nbsp; Typically this error indicates that 'something' is still installing - or at least thinks it hasn't completed.&nbsp; If you would be willing to share the installation logs from your various
 attempts this might enable us to get to the underlying cause of the issues - and sorry it is too late for you but might help someone else.&nbsp; They will be in two places as the installation happens part in the user context and part in system - so %temp% - which
 is usually c:\users\&lt;username&gt;\appdata\local\temp (and for it would be useful to have both the bad ones as you and the successful&nbsp; ones as administrator), and c:\windows\temp.&nbsp; If you can't track down the right files based on the time of install then files
 starting with firefly or integratedoffice will probably be the ones.</p>
<p>The online repair solution will usually get things working - but as you found it can be very slow - and many customers may well give up or reboot when it would actually have comnpleted and fixed things eventually.&nbsp; The fixit is good too - but you are back
 to square one -&nbsp;so it would be good to find the real cause and a more specific fix if we could.&nbsp; Feel free to e-mail the logs to me at

            <p>Unfortunately, the logs were removed during a system cleaning operation I performed after getting everything installed and running properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the Office/Visio/Project applications have been working just fine since I successfully installed them from disc images on June 9th.&nbsp; The only odd behavior has been&nbsp;that the 5th time I started Visio, it took nearly 6 minutes to come up (on a 4-core 3GHz
 machine).&nbsp; It was the only thing running (there was no scan or backup going on in the background), there was a lot of disc activity, and eventually Visio finished whatever it was doing and become usable.&nbsp; It's as if Visio was rebuilding something.&nbsp; But it
 has worked fine and has started quickly before and after this one incident.</p>

    <title>rebranding of different Windows 10 versions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            rebranding of different Windows 10 versions</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 across all devices? I disagree!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course Windows wants to be universal on PCs, tablets, smartphones and Xbox consoles. But different Windows 10 versions need different names too, while still sharing that same Windows NT kernel, currently at version number 10.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCs (desktops and laptops), touchscreen or no,&nbsp;can still run the OS under the Windows name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, tablets and smartphones would have a version of Windows 10 rebranded as "Zune", after your failed media player line and marketplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Windows 10 on Xbox One? Rebrand it&nbsp;as simply "Xbox".</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this should be done by the next Windows 10 event in March. Come this fall, I want to see it happen.</p>

            Well I know Microsoft has yet to Disclose much about 2 things,<br />
<br />
<br />
UI Look and Feel(such as those who want to stick to Windows 2000, XP, and 7),<br />
<br />
<br />
And also Theme Styles which again is more pointed to Touch Screen only and encouraging people to use Touch Screen,<br />
<br />
<br />
The Second one is my concern since they still have not ALLOWED the "Windows Classic Theme" which means no skins,&nbsp;uses Much Resources, and is styled from Windows 95 to Windows 2000 Based, also included in XP, Vista and Windows 7 before Steve Ballmer on Microsoft's
 Previous CEO Eliminated it in Windows 8 and 8.1 due to factors that were linked to Exploits in GDI32 and Win32k.sys, thus making the "Windows Classic Theme" a "Security Risk, plus the push on the Metro Theme was to make sure that anything of Old Microsoft
 would not return,<br />
<br />
<br />
I know there are others here who may not understand my response, but the factor is that the "Windows Classic Theme" and "XP Theme" have been the key to what keeps customers on Microsoft, but in recent months, they do not want to see it return, and that&nbsp;has
 discouraged people in the past about Windows 8.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out this article if you are interested in getting the classic theme for Windows 8/8.1/10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.howtogeek.com/133405/how-to-get-classic-style-themes-back-on-windows-8/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this might not be a performance boost as you are tricking your OS to display this made up classic theme. This one is for those who miss the good old days! ;)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I disagree.&nbsp; What would be the point of naming them differently if they were all the same OS?&nbsp; And what about convertibles and 2 in 1s?&nbsp; Are they tablets or laptops?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you watched the Windows 10 event on the 21st you'll remember the continuum feature Microsoft announced.&nbsp; Would this mean that you're switching from "Windows" to "Zune" as you've named them?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I would love to see one OS running on all platforms, which was the project started by Windows 8 and is now coming to be realized in 10.
