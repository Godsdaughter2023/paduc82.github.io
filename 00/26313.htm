                    I just installed windows 8.1 as an upgrade from windows 8.&nbsp; IE 11 Was installed as an installalong.&nbsp; The mouse scroll wheel works fine in other programs, this issue is only in IE 11,&nbsp; I have tried just about everything to no avail.&nbsp; If I restart windows
 it will work just fine for a while, then it just stops working.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Despite disabling all startup programs aside from Microsoft, there was a recalcitrant Apple service (I use iTunes to load my iPod) that was still running. After stopping this service, sorry I didn't catch the name, scrolling started working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This service must have stayed active after the numerous re-boots and when the PC was started in safe mode as that is now working correctly as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not sure if it had something to do with the fact that iTunes was re-loaded, but not started after re-freshing 8.1, but now I can enable all Apple startup programs that come with iTunes and cannot reproduce the fault.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I find it ironic that the company that I considered changing over to was at the root of this issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft should spend some time on better diagnostics to find these types of problems, lack of doing so nearly lost them another customer, as it has done with many others in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Jase</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S. Along with the PC and 5 laptops I would have been replacing 4 Windows phones.

    <title>Outlook 2003 getting rid of default personal folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 getting rid of default personal folder</h2>
                    I have set up Outlook 2003 with an IMAP account and an Exchange account. These both use their own 'mailbox'. I do not need the default personal folders and I can't figure out how to get rid of it. I've deleted the profile and set it up again, but it shows
 up again. It causes too much confusion for my users, and the mail can get stuck in that outbox, which has no account associated with it.<br />

            <p>The IMAP account is associated with it - its used for the IMAP calendar and contacts. Did you try setting the Exchange data file as the default data file then removing the personal folder? That is the only way you can remove it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools, Email Accounts, View or Change accounts. Select the Exchange mailbox as the default delivery location at the bottom of the dialog and close the dialog. Go to File, Data File management and remove the personal folders file.

If you have re-installed outlook I suspect you are referring to Microsoft office Outlook and that needs to be posted in the "office" section.&nbsp; I would move it there if I knew the version you are running.<br />

<br />
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in response. Let me help you to download emails on Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, I need more details:</p>
<p>How is the email account setup on Outlook 2013(POP3/IMAP/EAS or Exchange Server)?</p>
<p>Do you get any error message when you send/receive emails from Outlook 2013?</p>
<p>Provide more details to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let us open Outlook in its application safe following the steps mentioned below and check if the future emails that you receive shows correctly:</p>
<p>Click
<font><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Programs,</span> go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">outlook /safe </span>(note there is a space between<span style="font-weight: bold"> outlook
</span>and<span style="font-weight: bold"> /</span></font>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add-ins.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Clear all the options.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>If the issue persists, then you may create new Outlook profile following the steps from the article below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</font></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> The steps in this article is applicable to Outlook 2013 and also ensure to turn off the email scanner from
 your security application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add an email account in new profile in Outlook 2013, refer the link below:</p>

<p>Hi Khemraj,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, you want to set up recurring OOF for every Monday afternoon for your colleague.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, it’s not feasible to set up a recurring OOF, you just can set up the OOF for a period of time at present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is suggested that you can vote on the feedback via <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general/suggestions/17503765-have-a-recurring-out-of-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Drop-down list of styles in Word 2010 ... how&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> folbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop-down list of styles in Word 2010 ... how&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used to be able to see a clear drop-down list of the styles in a word document. This list would change according to the location of the insertion point so that the currently applied style was selected.</p>
<p>How do I do this in 2010? I cannot see a similar tool in the ribbon customization. When I move the insertion point, the styles preview does not move to show the style! If I expand the list (every time I move the insertion point!) then the style (TOC) is
 not even on the list!</p>
<p>I want rid of that huge tool that shows styles that I do not want, and would like a small tool that allows me to quickly see the style that I have used! Simple!</p>
<p>I do not want a view that loists the styles down the LHS (if that has not been taken away as well!) ... my screen real estate is limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW. VBA Code is not the solution. There must be a way of returning this basic functionality.</p>

    <title>Home tab greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindy045  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home tab greyed out</h2>
                    Every time I open a new document in word the entire home tab is greyed out and I can't click on anything except for the styles pane button. To fix it I have to click on a different tab, e.g the insert tab, and go back to the home tab and everything will
 work fine, but this is really annoying every time. How can I fix it?

<h3> jonsykes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change the email address I use to login to my Skype Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the same Skype address for a number of years and before it was ever linked to my current work email address but I'm now leaving this job and want to change the login email from my current work email address to my previous one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why all of a sudden a year or 2 ago it became linked to my work Office365 and the same login as my work Skype for Business<span>, though no doubt linked to MS buying it,</span> but is there a way of getting it linked back to my old account
 without losing all my contacts, messages and ££ in my account and being able to keep my original Skype name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate there's a way of transferring contacts to a new account but doesn't seem to be a way to transfer messages etc and I really want to keep my original Skype name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help anyone can give me a seems pretty impossible to actually get to message anyone at Skype directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jon</p>

    <title>sync randomly causing all contacts on outlook 2013 to duplicate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa&#123;d&#125;  say:</h3>
<h2>            sync randomly causing all contacts on outlook 2013 to duplicate &#40;but not on Outlook.com&#41;, but if one is deleted it deletes all copies. &#40;emails did this a few months ago&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 and sync with outlook.com on Windows 7. Randomly a couple months ago, all my emails duplicated on outlook when there was a sync (but not on outlook.com). (After they duplicated, it worked normally for any emails sent or received after
 that date - it took me weeks to fix) If I deleted one of the duplicates, it would delete both of them after the next sync and also delete it on outlook.com. I eventually removed my account on outlook and then added it again. This was a very long process of
 having all my information reload ( I have a LOT of emails and calendar items), but it worked and I didn't have duplicates, but was a big mess to reload.&nbsp; I also lost a ton of detail in the calendar (I use categories and they all disappeared, so do NOT want
 to re-do that again.)</p>
<p>It's been working fine, but then today my contacts duplicated when I made a change on one in outlook. Again - no duplicates on outlook.com, but if I delete either of the duplicates, it removes the contact completely after the next sync on both outlook.com
 and outlook. If I change anything about it on outlook.com, it only changes one of the duplicates on outlook. As this has happened twice - is there a fix to remedy this. I do not want to go through the whole process again. It takes me hours and hours to complete
 the reload, as it goes very slowly and seems to need to be prodded continually. I am getting very frustrated with this. I never had any issues when I was using Outlook 2007. What is causing this? I have read that perhaps it's syncing issues with my phone and
 pc, but how would I know? I only have the one account on outlook and sync to one android phone.</p>
<p>I've read about merging, but am afraid it might act like the deleting and I would lose my contacts. (Yes, I have done an export, so I have a back-up .csv file.)</p>
<p>I considered doing an export from outlook.com and then deleting all contacts, then importing from the .csv file again, but I use a lot of categories and I would have to go through and re-categorize every contact! I also considered deleting them all and then
 using the "restore deleted contacts" but realized when playing with it, that it does not restore the notes (which I cannot afford to lose) (very strange glitch that it wouldn't restore those I think). Also, even if I end up needing to do one of these fixes
 - I don't want this to happen again. Ideas, fixes, solutions - anyone?!?!</p>

            <p>Hello Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern about the contacts are duplicated in Outlook and not on the webmail. I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reason for the issue could be any of the partnership of the outlook.com on the server is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once all the partnership is deleted by doing a ‘<strong>Delta</strong> <strong>
Sync’</strong> on server, this will delete the all the partnership on server which removes corruption data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But by doing ‘Delta sync’, it removes all the data from Outlook and you will have to re-add the Outlook.com account again on the Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re comfortable doing a ‘Delta Sync’ for the Outlook.com account, then please post your query in the Outlook.com forum link mentioned below who would assist you on how to proceed with the ‘Delta sync’ process.</p>

<p>
</p><p>All my contacts doubled. &nbsp;I could see them on the Outlook.Com server and on Outlook 2013. &nbsp;I have thousands and it pissed me off. &nbsp;I had a backup of my contacts (fortunately) so I had a clean copy without the double.</p>

</p><p>It occurred to me that maybe the problem was that I was asking the server (Outlook.Com) to do to much at once. &nbsp;So, &nbsp;I deleted everything.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In Outlook 2013 I deleted the entire Outlook.Com account to ensure it blew away the OST file.</li><li>On the server (Outlook.Com) I selected all the contacts and did a delete.</li><li>On Android (Lollipop), I did several things:
<ul>
<li>I deleted the exchange account</li><li>I deleted all the data associated with the exchange account
<ul>
<li>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Contact Storage &gt; Clear Data</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Contacts &gt; Clear Data</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Exchange Services &gt; Clear Data</li></ul>
</li><li>Then I deleted the Cache on the phone (http://allaboutmotog.com/how-to-clear-cache-partition-on-moto-g-and-moto-x-after-android-lollipop-update/)</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Now I was pretty sure I had no influence from anything strange so I started rebuilding the data.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I created the account for Outlook.Com in Outlook 2013.</li><li>I made sure the Outlook.Com data set was set as my default
<ul>
<li>Outlook 2013 &gt; File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Data Files (Tab at top)</li></ul>
</li><li>I opened the backup PST with the contacts and copied them to the Outlook.Com contacts in groups of 100.</li><li>I waited until I saw each group fully on the Outlook.Com server.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Amazingly, &nbsp;the contacts started to duplicate on Outlook 2013 about 30 minutes later. &nbsp;Then I noticed they were not duplicating on Outlook.com. &nbsp;I downloaded the contacts on Outlook.Com to a CSV file to verify and it had the right count. &nbsp;So .....</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I deleted the account on Outlook 2013.</li><li>I let the server sit for several hours to make sure it had done all it's indexing.</li><li>I downloaded the contacts again to verify no duplication (very easy to do, &nbsp;just check the total record count).</li><li>I then recreated the account in Outlook 2013 and let Outlook.Com populate Outlook 2013.</li></ul>
<p>No Duplicates 24 hours later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final step was to recreate the account on my phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Add Account &gt; Exchange</li></ul>
<p>The&nbsp;phone populated perfectly and still no duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a complete PITA but I got it working again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Playlists Nokia x2-00.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a nokia X2-00. I usually fill the playlist files (PLA files) just opening its properties in windows and dragging and dropping songs from windows explorer. It usually works but sometimes some playlists appear empty when I open them from the phone,
 and, sometimes, after one or two hours filling them. It's very annoying, is there any better way to create playlist? I tried with ovi suite but it didn't work for me, I don't want to have my music ordered automatically by nobody. Can I create playlist for
 X2-00 from winamp or from some similar software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Triston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the literal description of the error message, it seems the value is invalid. And in some cases, if the value entered is not in the correct data type, we can receive the error message. Please check if you are in this scenario.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please try opening an item you submitted successfully previously, copy the exact same value into a new item to see if you can submit it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we need to confirm the information below for further investigation:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The detailed steps about how you create the form so that we can try to reproduce the behavior on our side.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The detailed steps about how you create the list.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Check the drive to make sure the door is closed and it contains the correct disk or CD&#34; when working from an encrypted file on my computer</h2>
                    <p>I have seen messages similar to this with people stating they are working from a flashdrive or from drop box. The work around seems to be saving directly to your computer. However, I am working directly from my computer and saving to it. I am wondering why
 this happened and How I can avoid it in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased Microsoft Office for Mac 2016 and downloaded it last week, through the Microsoft site. I also purchased my Macbook Pro and received it last week. So everything is new. I work with confidential material so I encrypted a file&nbsp; and was working
 with password protected word documents. I had been working and saving the same documents for the last week. And all day yesterday. However, at the end of the night as I tried to shut everything down, saving as I went, I got this message "Check the drive to
 make sure the door is closed and it contains the correct disk or CD" I don't even have a CD drive or even usb port on my computer. I have the 2 thunderbolt ports.&nbsp; I had, however, earlier in the day plugged in a flash drive through the extension connecter
 I had to get. Thinking that perhaps that was the issue I safely removed the flash drive and the adaptor. And tried to save again and I continued to receive the same message and was unable to save to my encrypted disc. Not wanting to lose the work I had done,
 I encrypted a new disc and 'save as' all the documents into that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I didn't receive this message until the end of the night, it would seem that at some point during the day it had stopped saving my work. Despite my continually saving as I went. I know this because after saving to the new encrypted folder, I opened
 the documents from both files to compare&nbsp; them and I noticed the changes I had made were not saved on the original documents opened from the original encrypted files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me figure out what went wrong. If I need to go back to Apple because its the computer, or if I should call microsoft if it is their issue. I can't risk losing work and I can't continue to create encrypted files every time I work on
 reports. As I said the information I work with is confidential so I am hesitant to save to the desktop and then have to move the files into an encrypted file, seems like it defeats the purpose of ecnrypting the file to begin with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, I hope this wasn't too long winded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Macbook Pro iCore5&nbsp; 16GB Ram&nbsp; 500GB storage&nbsp; &nbsp;MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.6</p>

<p>Hi Sabrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that you mentioned "encrypted folder, disk and document". Do you mean besides set up
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/password-protect-a-document-in-word-for-mac-5dc20870-62ea-43b1-ab0b-39426a57cff1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
password protection</a> for the document, you also set up encryption for the folder and disk referring to Apple support article?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, do you get the error message when you want to save the file to the "encrypted folder and disk" with Word for Mac? Check if other Office apps will get the same error message when saving files to the same path. Moreover, check with a disk which
 isn't encrypted, just set up password protection with test document. See if all things work well in this situation (can save file, changes are saved, can reopen file and make new changes).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my understanding, if Office for Mac works well with other disks, the issue is just related to one specific encrypted disk, it means Office apps themselves work well. I suggest you contact Apple support to check further with the encrypted disk. Thanks
 for your understanding. </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions yes, I used Disk Utility to encrypt a folder. And when a word document or pdf that I am using has confidential information on it, I also password protect the document. All password protected documents are stored in the encrypted
 folder I created.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gotten the message when saving edits to the file that is in the encrypted folder. However, I had previously been able to make edits on several documents for the last week and this hadn't been a problem. It only first came up last night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I looked at the old encrypted file that was giving me problems and the message persisted. I opened the new file I created last night, then each individual document and I was able to save, and edit without any problem, the message did not appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a safeguard I was worried that the issue would persist.&nbsp;I did a first aid check on both encrypted files and they both came back that they were fine.&nbsp; So I ensured that the documents I saved last night in the new file were working, could be edited and
 saved and they could. So I deleted the previous files that were in the old file, unable to save.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I began thinking that perhaps the drive itself had been corrupted, from the files.&nbsp; Some of the documents I have been working with were created on this new computer and with the new version of office, but some were from my older version of Mac and older
 office. Those files were working from a compatible version within my new office.&nbsp; Thinking that perhaps that might be the problem, I opened each document individually, then created a new document and cut/pasted the info into the new document.&nbsp; I did this for
 every word document I had. I then saved all of the new documents so that they would all be new and up to date with the most current version of office that I am using. And put them in back into the first encrypted file, since it had been cleaned out.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I checked double and triple checked that each document to make sure that I could open and save it without any problems. I could. I then began working on editing a new document. I was able to save it, and the message was not coming up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All documents&nbsp; were working fine in both encrypted files. Until...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting ready to delete the folder, I noticed that there were&nbsp; two documents which had been edited by my supervisor and sent back to me for corrections. I had not transferred these to the other folder with the new documents because I had not tested them
 yet. While I had opened them to look at them briefly I did not make any changes to them and so there was no need to try and save them. I closed and ejected the encrypted folder&nbsp; with the new documents and with the work I had been saving all day. I tested all
 the documents (except for the two edited documents) and they opened and saved fine. Then I opened the edited documents, tried to save them and immediately I got the message again. This happened for both of them. I closed them, and then tried to open the other
 documents which worked moments before, and now none of them will save.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to me to be a Microsoft word problem, not a Mac problem.&nbsp; I am afraid now to open the edited documents (which I need to work from) because it will corrupt the rest of my files. Is this something that is in that file, is it because it is an edited
 document? I don't understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this makes sense, I know it is a lot of information. I just wanted to be forthcoming with everything I have tried to be able to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sabrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please first check if my short summary is correct:</p>
<p>1. You re-created all existing documents after you encountering this issue, moved them to another encrypted folder, then all of them worked well.
</p>
<p>2. When you want to delete the former encrypted folder, you find there are two documents edited by your supervisor and sent back to you. You add these two documents to the other folder without creating new documents for them.
</p>
<p>3. Open these two documents, when you want to save them, get the error message mentioned above.
</p>
<p>4. Now other re-created documents also runs into this issue again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try the following options to see if there are some improvements: </p>
<p>Option 1. Copy these two "edited" documents and another two re-created documents to an unencrypted disk. Check if they could be opened, saved properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Access Mac safe mode</a> to see if they could be opened and saved. </p>
<p>Option 3. <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a new Mac account</a>. Log into Mac with this new account. Check if documents can be opened and saved.

<p>Hi Tim,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your reply and continued help. There are some parts of your summary that are not correct. I think that speaking to each other would make it easier to explain.&nbsp; I wonder if we could speak on the phone?</p>
<p>I will begin to type a reply in case speaking is not possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tim,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give the encrypted folders names to make this easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased my computer and then office 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That same day I created&nbsp; <strong>DrDannels encrypted folder</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I began working on confidential documents, password protected them. Everyday for the last week I have opened said files, made edits, saved them and all was well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friday I sent a copy of the file to my supervisor. Sunday morning he sent edited1.&nbsp; I opened it looked at it, then put it aside. Continued working and saving my files (so I thought) Sunday evening he sends edited version2.</p>
<p>That evening I try to save and none of the many documents I have open will save. I repeatedly get that message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I create a <strong>new encrypted folder called Today's work</strong>.&nbsp; I save as every document open so that I can save the work I did. After ensuring this has been done. I also move edited1. Afraid that edited2 was what had corrupted things I deleted it
 and did not download again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I closed&nbsp;<strong>Today's work. </strong>I also closed&nbsp;<strong>DrDannels</strong></p>
<p>I then reopened both folders and all the documents. <strong>Today's work </strong>
all the content works as it should. <strong>DrDannels </strong>contents continued to give me the message. I closed both folders. then wrote here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning. I opened <strong>DrDannels</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Todays work</strong>. I ran a safety check on both files and they were both good. I verified that
<strong>Today's work </strong>could open, save and edit. I deleted all contents of
<strong>DrDannels</strong>&nbsp;although not the file itself.</p>
<p>I then opened all documents in <strong>Today's work</strong>&nbsp;as well as a new blank document in word, so that I could cut/past each document as new. I did this to stop working from old, compatible versions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I password protected each one and saved back to <strong>DrDannels.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I did not transfer edited1 or edited2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked and rechecked <strong>DrDannels</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Today's work</strong>. All documents in both were working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I worked on documents from <strong>DrDannels</strong>, some newly created today. saved them closed them opened edited more saved and closed. Everything working as it should.</p>
<p>I then needed to make the edits which had been sent to me. I closed <strong>DrDannels</strong>&nbsp;and ejected it, just in case, to protect its contents.</p>
<p>I opened <strong>Today's work</strong>&nbsp;checked all the document (except edited1 and edited2). Everything working fine.
</p>
<p>I opened edited1 only, tried to save and got the message. Closed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to open other documents in <strong>Today's work</strong>&nbsp;and nothing will save. All the documents give me the same message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted <strong>Today's work</strong>&nbsp;and all its contents. </p>
<p>I opened&nbsp;<strong>DrDannels&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;and those contents work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to get edited versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not something wrong with the encrypted folders. they have worked fine. When I created new documents to work with in the encrypted folder, they too work fine. It is when I open either of the edited documents that causes none of the other office documents
 in the folder to work correctly. I don't know why creating an entirely new user account to open two documents would be helpful. I don't know what apple safe mode is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message itself is confusing since there is no door to speak of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sabrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the error message may confuse users especially in your scenario which is even no CD drive in Mac. The current situation seems to be only related to those two "edited" documents. Please first re-create them to see if all documents (existing
 ones and new ones) can works well on your side. We could first make sure if only you edit documents on your Mac, everything works well. Later we can check if the problem will re-occur if you sent a test document to your supervisor and he sends edited one back
 to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac safe mode and creating new user profile are two troubleshooting steps on Mac device. Mac safe mode can solve some unexpected problems, new user account can let us know if the issue is related to an corrupted user profile. So, I suggest these two methods
 in my last post. You could click the link in that post to get more info about them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About "figure out how to get edited versions", do you mean you want to restore changes in
<strong>Today's work</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h2>            After the Amber Update for Win8 on Lumia my phone&#39;s Ring&#43;Vibrate feature behaves weird. It vibes once and stops&#33; Pls solve.</h2>
                    <p>
I got my Amber update promptly for my Lumia920. I hope Nokia reads all these comments. I've now noticed that the update has done something weird with my Ring+Vibrate setting. So it now doesn't vibrate continuously, only intermittently. With some downloaded
 ringtones it just vibrates once and then stops! I find this ridiculous. If it's a battery-saving measure it should be upto me to activate it.</p>
<p>
Also, the soft key lights seem to act up and decide when to come on and when not to. Surely an update is supposed to fix things. I do realise that battery performance may get slightly better, but it shouldn't be at the cost of what we're regularly used to from
 our phone's performance.</p>

                    <p>Noticed this issue in Access 2007 before upgrading to Office 2010 but&nbsp;it continues in Access 2010.</p>
<p>Creating a query from Query Design, adding a table and selecting specific fields to display does not limit the query to just&nbsp;these fields&nbsp;when running, because Access automatically adds , * at the end of the sentence.

<p>SELECT User_DataTbl.User_eMail, User_DataTbl.User_LastN, *<br />

<h2>            NOKIA MODERATORS ONLY</h2>
                    
<p>Dear concerned people,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a very loyal nokia user for a very long time. Loved all your products and they were brilliant to an extent. I started using the E series phones because the were straight forward and focused towards practicality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything changed when I bought the E7.</p>
<p>The symbian 3 had issues the most shining one was the battery life.</p>
<p>The Anna was comparatively better, had practical widgets and adequate applications.</p>
<p>The belle. You guys messed it up. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU DO THAT TO YOUR BUSINESS PHONES LINE&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all honesty, fine belle is very shinny, glowy and pretty. But who wants a pretty business phone. Who in their right mind would want widgets that &nbsp;cover the entire screen. I am amazed with the depth of my heart that who clears the final release of your
 firmware's. You forgot email notification . ARE PEOPLE INSANE&gt;???? Everything runs on emails now and you just gave a bell that too rings only in certain conditions. For your information most serious smartphone users keep it on vibration and there goes your
 email alert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You guys really have messed up big time. BIG TIME. Belle is good for kids and teens phones. But not for people who use phones to get things done. I am seriously amaaaaazed at your software department guys. No counter checks no checklists ???? I mean seriously
 who misses out all the basic stuff?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blackberry is boring as hell all black and white and text. You know why it sells, because it gets the job done. No matter how boring still it gets things done. Its not meant for kids its meant for serious users. Yet still they own the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You guys should seriously look into this shortfall in the company. The software department is terrrrrible.Its really sad to see such a terrible thing happen to a Flagship holder in the industry of cell phones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is read by someone who is concerened with software department or some senior official so some change happens. Other wise you will just be losing customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry that you are less than pleased with the latest update to your Nokia E7, but perhaps could be more specific about how the widgets and mail are "messed up"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only widgets that I've noticed to be significantly larger than before are the music player and e-mail widgets, and many customers have been asking for the e-mail widget to be larger, clearer and more informative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, any item in the menu can be made into a small homescreen short-cut which you can arrange on the screen however you please, greatly increasing the homescreen flexibility - something else that responds to feedback received from Nokia's customers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi43.tinypic.com%2f10e39kl.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this, simply press and hold the icon in the menu, then select "Add to homescreen" from the pop-up menu. To arrange widgets and icons in your home screen, press and hold the desired item until the homescreen wallpaper darkens, then drag to your preferred
 location in the homescreen. You can also move icons between homescreens simply by dragging them to the left or right edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also have up to six homescreens, double the number under Anna.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the N8 device that I am using as a test device, I find that the mail notifications are working as before using my Mail for Exchange account, could you also give more information about where you are having problems?</p>

            Michaels-: Thanks for posting a reply on Belle. I too face no problems from the email client and it works as in Anna.<br />
<br />
The problem I face though is with calendars showing only one item. I store a lot of to-do's and meetings on my calendar; and need to see as much as possible at a glance.<br />
<br />
That functionality has been taken away from Belle; with only 1 item being shown and I always have to go into the calendar to check them out.<br />
<br />
I agree; its not a deal breaker; but it certainly is in-convienient and a de-grade from the Anna Calendar. I also dont see a Calendar in the widgets; so in case I wanted to add a calendar again to another homescreem; its not possible.<br />
<br />
I would have like the drop-down to also note the calendar items; since it'll be ver handy. Something that the iphone has done; but I find it nice.<br />
<br />
The drop-down can actually be used for a lot more; and I hope those will come in future upgrades; if any.

<p>Hello Michaels,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankful for your concern and reply. Really happy that you moved my post back in here. I will go step by step on things that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Nokia started the E series phones for people who had professional needs from phones. The people who used phones to get things done in the most practical and professional way. They were builtin&nbsp;with&nbsp;software's and elements that other nokia phones didn't
 have. They had a simplistic approach to the interface and a slick and faster response to the basic needs of a professional and business user. &nbsp;They are not meant for people who want to listen to music and watch videos all day long with fancy widgets and all
 that. The N series came into existence for that user lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. FIrst of all giving belle to E series was a mistake. I am sure most will not agree with me but it is. Reason being that the novelty of E series is gone with it. If your software development guys couldn't make a new or separate oS for the E series then
 they should just have tweaked up Anna a little more and should have made it more responsive and faster. Instead of giving this GLOSSSY AND FUNKY new belle update. This update is really cute and sweet but for teenagers and kids. Not for professionals. Two big
 lumps are your digital clock on the main homescreen I mean comeon. ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS. E 7 is a professional communicator phone not a 17 year olds play toy. This is just the start of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Talking about the email widgets. I have 5 email accounts that I have to manage. Now you expect me to put on three homescreens just dedicated to that. I would ask you the same question ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS??? &nbsp;Plus what's with the all the widgets being
 so round and so white, no option to make them dark or small. I seriously am amazed who is running your software department. The guy is a champ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Have you ever wondered why iphones and blackberries have still a strong hold in the market. I am not asking you guys to copy them or anything but have you ever thought about it???? Because they don't ruin their OS by bringing funny non professional mod's
 into the OS. IOS on the iphone has been exactly the same since I phone came out. Everytime with every upgrade they just make it faster and more responsive and reliable. They don't mess up the system and same goes for the BB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Seriously guys you all should sit down and think your strategies. You people are now just pushing people away from nokia. I bought e7 with symbian 3. Which was simple and basic and that's what I paid for sure it had its glitches which I thought would get
 better with upgrades. But now I don't know what I paid for. Not belle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put some serious thinking into this matter Michaels. I have been using nokia for more than a decade. Its sad to see such an amazing company going down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Funny thing that I would like to share &nbsp;a few days back I bought a nokia asha 200 ... Even such a basic configuration phone which is not even 1/4 the the price of e7 has basic notifications and BRAVO belle forgot them. Sad day for nokia when belle came
 out. And yeah before i&nbsp;forget, there is a massive glitch in the unlock screen too. When you press the home button the screen lights up. The screen should only unlock when you hit the unlock button, but as the belle is so well made, you just hit any area around
 the unlock button and whola the screen is unlocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And one more thing, my humble request to your nokia forum admin and to you too sir. If your moderating the E series section then use an e series phone to check out the belle. Because e series problems aren't solved with the N series user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks once again for your concern.</p>

<p>BlackBerry marketshare/use is declining (less rapidly than Symbian's, but still clearly declining), so its stronghold is getting to be rather much weaker of late:</p>

<p>iPhone remains strong, and Android. The biggest difference is that Android is more fragmented (several manufacturers and a couple of hundred models vs. Apple as a single manufacturer with a couple of models which do not vary much).</p>

            Dear Mr. Michael S,<br />
I am personally very happy to finally see an official response to the complaints about Belle.<br />
I honestly appreciate the time you took to reply and hope that you will continue the discussions with us.<br />
Getting to the main subject, I must mention that in my opinion, Belle is more of a downgrade from Anna.<br />
I like the improved performance and some aspects of it, but a lot of productivity has been lost.<br />
- RSS widgets are gone<br />
- maximum 2 e-mail widgets can be used on the same screen. In Anna you could have 6. Now you need 3 screens for 6 e-mails (all the extra ones compared to Anna). I understand some might like the big widget, but why not offer them both?<br />
- cannot create a folder inside a folder. I understand you are trying to make things simpler but what harm was there in allowing more folders? It is a lot harder to organize your phone like this.<br />
- Calendar widget shows only 1 entry. This widget was very useful in Anna by being compact and showing more entries. Why not offer both?<br />
- Clock widget is immense and useless. As opposed, the one in Anna was great by being compact and allowing quick access to the calendar and profile selection. Why not offer both?<br />
- No more "widgets to offline mode" option for home screens. This was a very useful option in Anna for controlling the widgets.<br />
- No more "remote drive" option. No need to comment here. Why would you remove that?<br />
<br />
In other words, it is upsetting for users when they trust an update to be better and they realize they are stuck with more problems than before.<br />
The key here is providing options and keeping things compact and functional. If some users want bigger and flashier things, they should just have the option to switch to that. But, please do not change things completely and promote it as a new standard.<br />
<br />
Eagerly looking forward to your reply.<br />
At least let us know if these issues are taken into consideration.

            And one more thing...<br />
The Notifications widget is gone. I understand the pull down status bar is the new approach, but why not leave the option of having the widget?<br />
Pop-up messages are a lot worse and definitely a step back from the notifications widget.

<p>Where do we start with e-mail? In a nutshell Symbian^1's worked, Symbian^3's is broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two problems, notification and polling. Starting with notification...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The only e-mail notification is a sound or a vibration. If you have a silent or beep profile then you can miss it. If you have another profile it could be drowned out by background noise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Screen savers don't notify e-mails. No @ icon as with Symbian^1 and no flashing breathing light (which incidently is covered if you've got the official silicon cover).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Belle's notification bar doesn't notify e-mails. No @ icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have to unlock the phone to see if I've got e-mails if I've been away from the phone, been carrying it in my coat pocket, or left it in my coat pocket which I've left hung up somewhere, or if I'm in an office if I hear an e-mail sound I'm not sure if
 it was mine or someone else's or I'm at home and I've left it in one room I can't come back in and glance at the phone to see if I've got an e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got four accounts however each mail widget takes up half a screen. Whereas at least with Anna I could squeeze four mail widgets in one screen, with Belle I have to unlock the phone, swipe to get to the first homescreen with the first mail widget, then
 swipe to the rest of the home screens with the rest of the widgets before finally being able to lock the phone again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now onto polling. The only kind of e-mail account I've known to reliably work is Exchange Activesync with constant connection which hammers the battery. If I use e.g. POP3/IMAP with polling every 15 minutes it doesn't poll if there's no wifi/mobile data
 connection already set up (i.e. I'm not using Opera at the same time or I've not got my Exchange account on a constant conenction).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watching Belle's notification bar when there's no connection already set up I can see that data connection symbol under the antenna/3G icon appears then disappears, it's as if the poller times out after such a short time that there's not even enough time
 to establish a mobile data connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This still happens after the nth reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, I don't accept Ovi's terms and conditions when setting up the account, it's not a proper fix for a buggy e-mail poller on the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waited until Belle came out convinced that the e-mail problems would be fixed but they're just the same as in Anna only with bigger widgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm now using ProfiMail which doesn't notify properly either as it's limited by Belle when it comes to notifications but at least it polls.It's amazing that what worked perfectly well on Symbian^1 was just thrown out. If e-mail polling and notification isn't
 fixed in Carla then I can only assume that Nokia's completely lost its way in what's important to its customers.</p>

<h2>            Sending attachments on my oneDrive to people who are NOT on our Office 365</h2>
                    We are in the process of migrating people to Office 365. I store all of my documents in OneDrive. I love how this gives me the flexibility to access my documents no matter where I am. However. when I attach a document that is in my OneDrive to someone
 who is NOT in our Office 365 instance, they cannot open the attachment. Is there a different way I need to attach documents when sending them to prople outside our organization. The only solution I have found that works is for me to take the cocument, copy
 it to my C: drive or Desktop and attach that file. Kind of defeats the&nbsp; purpose of saving everything in OneDriive.

            <p>That just doesn't make sense! I have all of my documents in One Drive so they can all be in one place. Creating a separate One Drive that's public will make me have my documents in one place. It also isn't any different than me copying the document to my
 hard drive before I send it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe Microsoft should give you a choice when you attach a document. Keep it as a OneDrive link or actually send the document.</p>

            <p>I didn't say a separate OneDrive. I said a separate folder in your OneDrive store. You should see a "Shared Documents" folder. Create another folder under that and open up permissions to it. You can then put anything you want to share with anyone in that
 folder. Or, you could make another folder called, say, "Public" as a sibling of the other folders and make that one readable to all.</p>
<p>

                    The Ribbon Tabs bar (File / Home, etc.) have turned light gray to match the ribbon color instead of being the original blue? How can I change this back? My Office theme is set to colorful.

<h2>            Mail Merge does not include pictures</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Word 2016 and trying to use Mail Merge to send e-mails with pictures stored on the web (not locally), but the e-mails sent don't contain any visible image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I want to embed the image in the link below into my e-mail</p>
<p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg/263px-The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I embedded the following field into my e-mail in Word:</p>
<p>{<span>INCLUDEPICTURE<span>&nbsp; </span>"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg/263px-The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg.png" \d<span>&nbsp;
</span>\* MERGEFORMAT}</span></p>
<p><span>but it won't work..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried different ways of writing this address (With /, // etc..), but none worked. What I noticed is that when I see the preview of all emails in "Edit Individual Documents...", CTRL+A and F9, the server receives a request to downlaod the image, but
 once e-mails are send out the images are not visible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any idea?</span></p>

<p>While Doug's suggestion is probably the most logical, mail merging graphics is certainly possible, but you need to get the syntax right</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ INCLUDEPICTURE&nbsp; { IF TRUE "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg/263px-The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg.png" } \d&nbsp; \* MERGEFORMAT }<br />
</p>
<p>This certainly works using <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm</a>&nbsp; to merge to e-mail, though the \* MERGEFORMAT part is superfluous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way you could do it i to add a field (GRAPHIC) to your data source containing
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg/263px-The_PyeongChang_2018_Paralympic_Winter_Games_Emblem.svg.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>for each record and then use</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ INCLUDEPICTURE { IF TRUE "{ Mergefield GRAPHIC }" } \d }</p>
<p>
</p><p>That too will work and if you are confused about the syntax, you could use<span>

    <title>Problem importing contacts in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem importing contacts in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>As Outlook is not able to import a vcf file containing more vCards, I imported these vcf file successfully into the folder c:\users\username\contacts as single contacts. Then i exported those contacts in a csv file to import them in Outlook and here the
 problem began:</p>
<p>- When exporting the contacts in the csv file, values are separated by semicolon, but when trying to import in Outlook it doesnt recognize this kind of separator and import fails. Workaround is to replace the semicolon with comma, but not a good idea, if
 a field also contains a comma</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 Pro 64bit and Office 365 all German language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution?</p>
