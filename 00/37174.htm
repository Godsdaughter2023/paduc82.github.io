<h2>            How to change the interface</h2>
                    <p>I just can't get past how much I really don't like the look or feel of windows 10 interface. I need borders, textures, buttons that look and feel like buttons, colors... Windows XP, Vista or 7 look... not this flat dull, boring... makes you only want to
 spend 2 minutes on your computer look. It has a feel and function of a MAC and I hate anything Apple. Is there a way to change the interface? Or I'll have to skip this OS like I skipped Win8.

<h2>            Network location name keeps changing from given name to &#34;Network&#34;.</h2>
                    On 2 laptops running windows 7, I have a work network set up using wireless network connection with a Gigaset SX763 router. My problem is that I have given the network (network location) a specific name XYZ. However upon rebooting one of the laptops instead
 of connecting to XYZ, connects to "Network" or at times "Network2" instead. I have to disconnect the connection and reconnect and then it connects to XYZ. I have deleted the locations "Network" as well as any other locations but it doesn't help. Most of the
 time everything works fine except that the computers are not on the same network and hence cannot communicate over the network.

            I did not try the method above as I decided to re-install the operating system since I was experiencing various other issues as well with windows live and internet explorer going blank.
<div>Now the problem with the network location re-naming itself to "Network" has started to occur on the other system on the network which never had this issue before and also has a recent clean windows 7 install. So it appears that the problem lies with windows
 7!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I should add one point; the network name is entered in the router configuration and then the 2 laptops are connected to this network via the wireless network connection. The laptops connect to the router fine but on the laptop instead of showing as connected
 to the network "xyz" it shows as connected to "Network". There is internet access and at times the 2 laptops can access one another over the network despite the incorrect network location name but at other times they cannot communicate. If the connection showing
 as connected to "Network" is disconnected and reconnected then it connects to the correct one!</div>

    <title>Driver Signature Enforcement error screen can&#39;t be cleared, even - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjstewart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver Signature Enforcement error screen can&#39;t be cleared, even after signing.</h2>
                    After the boot splash screen, I get a message saying that as the result of recent hardware or software changes, I have a problem with Driver Signature Enforcement.&nbsp;
<br />
"File:&nbsp; \Windows\system32\winload.exe<br />
Status:&nbsp; 0x0000428<br />
Info:&nbsp; Windows cannot verify the original signature for this file."<br />
<br />
The fixes included running Repair Your Computer from the install disk, which said it found a couple of problems in the startup and that it would fix them--but it didn't work and when I tried to run it again, those problems no longer showed.&nbsp; There were no other
 reasonable fixes shown.&nbsp; It didn't say how to boot to Windows 7, but I did a F8 to see the available boot devices because I saw that there was supposed to be a temporary disabling of this problem--but that screen (the one after the splash screen) said nothing
 of the kind.&nbsp; I did, however, try to start with the C: drive and it worked and I got into Windows (and thus into Microsoft Answers).&nbsp; I found the fix using dseo13b.exe overrider, tried it twice and it didn't fix it.&nbsp; It actually signs the file (it said it
 did).&nbsp; Also, I found the suggestion to use bcdedit.exe -set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS<br />
bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON&nbsp; but it planted a sign on my desktop "Test Mode Windows 7 Build 7600" but didn't fix the problem and I don't know how to take it off.&nbsp; I also ran System Restore and went back several days--still does it.<br />
<br />
I found copies of winload.exe (the problem file) in both system32\ and system32\boot\ and ran a fc (file compare) which reported no differences, though I understand NTFS has underlying capabilities that may handle the signing.<br />
<br />
So, is there a fix that works (these I mentioned didn't)?&nbsp; Can I download the file and replace it?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
System info:&nbsp; AMD Athlon X2 64, Asus M4N72-E MB, 4GB memory, Windows 7, drivers all up to date.&nbsp; I just put the system back together after doing a minimal configuration test on another MB.&nbsp; That's when the problem began.&nbsp;
<br />
Two other problems still unsolved with the system:&nbsp; Slow Firewire (it also drops out occasionally), and an error box when Win7 starts:&nbsp; "Error in NVCPL.dll&nbsp; Missing entry: NoStartupFirstRunAfterInstUserAccount"&nbsp; I just got at update from nVidia for Geforece
 8800 GTS today.&nbsp; Still have the error.

            Finally--I've got the problem fixed...I think.<br />
<br />
See site &nbsp; &nbsp; http://uhlik.sk/?page=swreadydriver<br />
<br />
I will try my best to document how it worked so maybe someone else can benefit from my experience.&nbsp; I found this doing a Bing search on Driver Signature Enforcement after working my way down through things I already tried.&nbsp; Frankly, I don't know how it worked.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you follow the site's instructions, I'll try to make sense of it.&nbsp; I chose to create a USB flash disk, so I downloaded isoboot.zip, which extracts to isoboot.iso, which you burn to a CD.&nbsp; You have to provide your own burning software, so I found AShampoo
 Burning Studio, which I very much like, especially after suffering under Nero for the past years.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Uhlik.sk emphasizes that you have to set USB drive emulation to Removable in the BIOS.&nbsp; Separately, it says to change the BIOS to boot from the CD, "otherwise your flash drive will be detected as C: drive and can't be updated by my utility."<br />
<br />
Since I have never set a USB drive as Removable in the BIOS before, I couldn't find how to do it.&nbsp; But I did change the boot to the CD.&nbsp; I booted to the CD, which opened as a DOS environment.&nbsp; I poked around there a little bit and found the BOOT_A.COM and BOOT_B.COM
 files.&nbsp; I ran the BOOT_B.COM.&nbsp; It came back that it had succeeded.&nbsp; I don't know what it did.&nbsp; Anyway, I rebooted, changed the BIOS back and it came up since then without the DSE error stuff.<br />
<br />
I still have to get rid of the "Test Mode" inscription on my desktop, which is probably some obscure command in BCDEdit.&nbsp; It may be that that may cause the problem to return.&nbsp; I'll let you know.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand that if it truly disabled Driver Signature Enforcement, I may have a potential for a security problem.&nbsp; Any comments on this?<br />
<br />
Also, see my last post, above:&nbsp; Should I still do a Full Install (assuming you think I can license it with my Update license) so as to be sure DSE is working properly again and to clean up all the system changes I have been making?<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Enable Intel HD Graphics and NVIDIA GPU automatically on Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sahaj panchal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable Intel HD Graphics and NVIDIA GPU automatically on Desktop</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I just upgraded my desktop with the following config:<br />
Intel i5 7400 CPU,&nbsp;<br />
NVIDIA GeForce 1050,&nbsp;<br />
Win 10x64,&nbsp;<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
So obviously I have two display ports - one coming from inbuilt Intel HD 630 graphics, and one from my NVIDIA GPU. And for me, only one at a time seems to be working. This seems to be reasonable, however, I read somewhere that application warranting more graphics
 power will automatically trigger the GPU.<br />
My query is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;1. If I use the motherboard port (built-in Intel HD 630), will it trigger the NVIDIA GPU automatically? - Doing so does not allow me to access NVIDIA control panel, actually. (Warning appears: You are not currently using a display attached to an NVIDIA GPU)<br />
&nbsp;2. If I plug in my monitor in the GPU port, will Intel HD 630 remain ideal forever? This seems to be the case because when I do this, there are no Intel Graphics Setting options available.<br />
&nbsp;3. Of course as running a desktop no need to worry about power, but if I only want to browse the internet and watch movies, can I switch back-and-forth between these GPUs?<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />
Sahaj.

            Hi Sahaj.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In an Intel/Nvidia switchable graphics configuration the Nvidia software normally governs the switching.  So make sure it's always updated with the full Nvidia driver software which is allowed to Start wtih Windows - something I don't normally advise with driver software except when it has exactly these kinds of special settings that may need it running to invoke.
<br />
<br />If you have problems with the switching then this is best addressed by your PC maker since there is customization involved - the reason I'd always check first there for drivers and software before the Nvidia or Intel sites.  They may want the stock manufacturer drivers/software used but this varies with the make and model so is best addressed by their Support or Forums.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>First of all sorry for late response and thanks for your response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not that tech-savvy, but I got your point. You are saying that the Motherboard manufacturer might have some specific drivers for graphics. I checked and turns out my MB manufacturer (ASUS) has the same drivers for both graphics processors. And also
 I do have latest versions for both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I could do from my side. If you could help me further, my MB is ASUS&nbsp;ROG STRIX B250F. And at the moment I have attached my display to the in-built port. How do I make sure that the NVIDIA will kick in when needed? The reason I am asking is in
 my laptop too I have both graphics processors available and I am able to open control panel of both of them. BUT in my desktop, ONLY ONE AT A&nbsp;TIME is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much,</p>
<p>~Sahaj.</p>

<p>As Greg mentioned, laptops all have a software (Nvidia = Optimus) that allows the integrated graphics to run as default when there</p>
<p>is no 3D application running. This is necessary to preserve battery charge/life.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop PC's don't have a software, but you can run both integrated and dedicated graphics cards independently, or together.</p>
<p>However, this does not save much power as the dedicated gpu clocks drop way down when in 2D mode, and only ramps up the clock speeds when loading a 3D program/game . The small amount of power saved by using the Intel HD vs Nvidia is not very significant</p>
<p>when battery charge is not a concern.</p>
<p>btw - The Intel HD graphics is part of your cpu. The motherboard just makes the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I gather you have found the Intel HD graphics settings in your motherboard BIOS, but if not...</p>
Your ASUS mobo may be setup different, or use different terms, but looking in my user manual I am reminded this option is in the
<p><em>System Agent Configuration &gt; Graphics Configuration</em>. </p>
<p>Here you will find several Intel HD related settings. Among them is -<em> Cpu graphics multi-monitor.</em></p>
<p>This is disabled by default on my mobo, so if you have not done so, you may want to enable this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">[ EDIT:&nbsp;</span> I did a little experiment... It used to be that you had to disable/enable one or the other in Device Manager, when connecting</p>
<p>both Integrated and dedicated grapics to the same monitor, but it looks like the
<em>Cpu graphics multi-monitor</em> option in my BIOS makes</p>
<p>it possible to switch between them on a single monitor simply by selecting Display 1 or 2 in the Display Settings.</p>
<p>(I still connect my dedicated gpu to the main monitor and the Intel HD graphics to my second monitor, and I hadn't tried
</p>
<p>a single monitor configuration for a few years.)&nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes, the Intel HD options do 'disappear' when monitor 2 is not active, but Nvidia Control Panel remains on the Desktop Context Menu</p>
<p>regardless of if it is in use.</p>
<p>And yes the IntelHD graphics will remain idle when not in use. Still can come in very handy if you have problems with your</p>
<p>Nvidia card, or use a second monitor though.</p>

<h2>            DVD Drive does not read DVDs but only reads CDs</h2>
                    <p>Hey MS Community,</p>
<p>I haven't had this problem until 2 hours from now, when my DVD drive awkwardly stopped reading&nbsp;DVD drives on my Windows 10 Pro laptop. The weird thing is that earlier in the same session it read DVDs. Have I possibly scratched the lens although it can still
 read CDs?<br />
P.S.: All my drivers are up to date, and&nbsp;I have already cleaned my lens using "Memorex CD Laser Lens Cleaner". I have also tried to uninstall the driver and then restart the operating system.</p>

            <p>Hello Arul_D,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the results of the methods you told me to follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a4559e8-1173-4d56-bfce-baf08a3da246" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Yet the issue wasn't resolved</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30981382-8b5c-434a-affd-51260084ba9e" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Yet again the issue wasn't resolved.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>This driver&nbsp;(<strong>TSSTcorp CDDVDW SU-208CB</strong>) is provided by Microsoft, yet I found nothing on their website about it. thus I will not risk downloading the driver software from third party websites (unless you are willing to provide links to safe
 sites).</li><li>All&nbsp;of the sites I visited stated that the most recent driver software version for
<strong>TSSTcorp CDDVDW SU-208CB&nbsp;</strong>was released on <strong>June 21, 2006</strong>, the same date the version on my laptop is installed.
</li></ul>
<p>Hence my problem still remains. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>I've tried to load a bootable Windows Vista&nbsp;Setup DVD from BIOS, and it also failed.&nbsp;I'm starting to suspect that the DVD drive is broken, can it be? If not, can it be affected by some kind of malware?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE 2: </strong>I noticed it can read 8.5 GB DVD-R DL but not the standard 4.7 GB DVD-R. I haven't tried yet DVD-RWs, but the problem is it could read the 4.7 GB DVD-Rs in the past.</p>

<h2>            Screen Mirroring not working after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Since then I had not been able to screen mirror to my Samsung Smart TV. I never had any issue screen mirroring to that TV with Windows 8.1. When I try to screen mirror it shows as connected but nothing
 appear in my TV and after few seconds it disconnects again.

<p>I uninstalled, deleted and reinstalled the latest&nbsp;drivers released for Windows 10 as well&nbsp;as&nbsp;(in a second try) installed those that I had on Windows 8.1 (Version 17.16.0.4) but none of them fixed this issue.

<p>
</p><p>However, I noticed that this seems to be a known problem to Computer manufacturers, e.g. see:</p>

<p>http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/SLN298100/EN</p>
<p>or here</p>
<span>
<p>http://www.samsung.com/us/windows10/upgrade_windows10.pdf&nbsp; (search for Miracast in chapter "Known Issues")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like&nbsp;what samsung recommends to resolve this problem: "You should not upgrade to Windows 10 until Miracast is stable."</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe we have to wait, until Microsoft's developers have finished celebrating the new release and return back to their workplaces :-D&nbsp; However, since I miss this feature very much, I consider going back to Windows 8.1 for a while...</p>

            <p>As it seems that this issue is due to some further development of Microsoft's Miracast application or libraries I wonder if replacing the respective files&nbsp;(.dll etc) with the ones from Windows 8 could solve the problem (provided that the set of files is
 still the same) . However I neither had any time nor motivation yet to do any "investigation" on this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hardly expect any updates for my Samsung TV to be released (in respect to a maybe more standardized and robust Miracast/Screen Mirroring/whatsoever protocol) but on the other hand I'm not sure either if this is really a bug or just a lack of backward compatability?
 Anyways, it would be interesting if Microsoft developers are aware of this and how it is treated..</p>

<h3> garrykukura  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App&#58; Choosing an email address</h2>
                    <p>When sending an email from Windows 8.1 you could choose the email address that it would be sent from, provided you had attached the different email accounts to your live.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 I cant see where you are given this option, as the "From" address in every email composed is greyed out and not changeable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my settings at live.com.au and all the email addresses I had been using in conjunction with my live.com.au address are still there and operational.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is being able to select&nbsp;the "From"&nbsp;email address no longer&nbsp;available in Windows 10?</p>

            If you would have read his post at all, you would see that this is regarding the Windows 10 mail app.&nbsp; Unlike the Windows 8 app, the Windows 10 app doesn't seem to let you choose a different "from" address which certainly has nothing to do with the "make
 and model"&nbsp;of his computer.

<p>Which version of Windows are you running?</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 7 why not download the free Windows Virtual PC for Windows 7 and use that to install Windows 7 64 bit ? Please note, you cannot install a 64 bit operating in a virtual machine on a 32 bit operating system. Host OS must also be
 64 bit.</p>
<p>Windows Virtual PC can be downloaded from http://www.windows.com/business/downloads.</p>

<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7-inside-vista-virtual-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How To:
<em>Install Windows 7</em> On <em>Virtual PC 2007</em></a>
<p><strong>Using Windows Virtual PC to Create a virtual machine and install a guest operating system</strong></p>
<p><br />
A guest operating system runs in a virtual machine. If you do not want to use Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 (SP3) as the guest operating system, you can create a virtual machine. You will use a wizard to create the virtual machine and customize
 it by specifying details such as the name and the amount of memory to assign to it. Before you create the virtual machine, consider the following questions:
</p>
<p>How much memory will you allocate to the virtual machine? Be sure to allocate enough to run the guest operating system and all applications that you want to run on the virtual machine at the same time.</p>
<p>Where do you want to store the virtual machine and what do you want to name it? For example, you might want to use a name that identifies the guest operating system, or describes how you want to use it. You can use as many as 80 characters for
 the name.</p>
<p>What type of virtual hard disk do you want to use and where do you want to store it? For more information, see About virtual hard disks.</p>
<p>After you create the virtual machine, you can modify it as needed. For more information, see Configuring a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Note <br />
For information about an easy way to set up a virtual instance of Windows XP SP3, see Configuring and using Windows XP Mode. For information about the operating systems supported for use as guest operating systems, see the Windows Virtual PC system requirements
 (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155832</a>).
</p>
<p>To create a virtual machine<br />
Open the Virtual Machines folder. From the Start menu, click Windows Virtual PC. If the menu item is not visible, click All Programs, click the Windows Virtual PC folder, and then click Windows Virtual PC.</p>
<p>The Virtual Machines folder opens in Windows Explorer. From the menu bar, click Create virtual machine.</p>
<p>Note <br />
The Virtual Machines folder provides details about all the virtual machines created by the current user, as well as access to the tools for creating and modifying virtual machines and virtual hard disks.</p>
<p>The Create a Virtual Machine Wizard opens. Proceed through the pages of the wizard, choosing the options that are appropriate for the guest operating system.</p>
<p>After the wizard finishes, the virtual machine appears in the file list in the Virtual Machine folder.
</p>
<p>After you create the virtual machine, you can install the guest operating system. The procedure varies slightly depending on the type of installation media you plan to use, such as physical CDs and DVDs, .iso files, and network-based installation
 servers. The following procedures describe how to use each type.</p>
<p>To use a CD, DVD, or .iso file to install a guest operating system<br />
To use a CD or DVD, insert it into the drive and then skip to the next step. To use an .iso file, do the following:</p>
<p>Right-click the virtual machine in the file list, and then click Settings.
</p>
<p>In the left pane, click DVD Drive. In the right pane, choose Open an ISO image. Click OK.</p>
<p>Start the virtual machine. In the file list, select the virtual machine and click Open. Windows Virtual PC opens and displays the video output of the virtual machine.
</p>
<p>The virtual machine searches for bootable media. Setup begins after bootable media is found.</p>
<p>After the installation is complete, install the Integration Components package. From the Tools menu of the virtual machine window, click Install Integration Components.</p>
<p>To use a network-based installation server to install a guest operating system<br />
Start the virtual machine. In the file list, select the virtual machine and click Open. Windows Virtual PC opens and displays the video output of the virtual machine.</p>
<p>The virtual machine automatically starts the PXE boot agent and attempts to contact the remote installation server. Watch the screen for instructions. When prompted, press F12.
</p>
<p>Note <br />
If the remote installation server does not respond, you will receive the message “Reboot and Select proper Boot device.” Check the virtual machine settings to make sure the network adapter is connected to an external (physical) network. If it is, check with
 the administrator of your network for instructions about using a network-based installation server.</p>
<p>Select an operating system from the choices offered by the remote installation server.</p>
<p>Use the setup utility for the operating system to complete the installation. If you need to restart to complete the process, press CTRL+ALT+END, or click Ctrl+Alt+Del from the virtual machine window.<br />

That was the first thing I did. Turn "OFF" live tiles. They use too many resources, even on a computer that has lots of RAM. I'm truly wanting to do a clean reload of windows 10 but don't have a "Product Key". This was installed on top of windows 8.1 and I
 now have three partitions on my hard drive and can't get rid of them without a clean reload. I just can't get a product key for windows 10 unless I buy a copy and I should not have too.<br /></p>

            I didn't create them. Windows 10 did. And if I erase the hard drive and remove all those partitions there will be nothing left of windows 10. That link definitely states I will NEED a product key since technically I would be installing on a cleaned hard
 drive that has nothing on it, not upgrading.<br />

            <p>Yes, I know. But that applies only to the FIRST installation of 10. You CAN do a Clean Install once you installed it since it is tied to your Microsoft Account. When it asks for a Product Key you just skip that, You do not enter ANYTHING. NO KEY. Once you
 sign in after the installation it will activate based on your Account Info.</p>

</p><p>What you CANNOT do is wipe your hard drive BEFORE you install Windows 10 THE FIRST TIME because that IS tied to your previous activated Windows Edition.</p>

            <p>My first attempt at upgrading to Windows 10 &amp; performing a clean install the first time went very poorly.&nbsp; Fortunately for me I chose one of my least important netbooks to experiment with Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Most of my experience &amp; habits were developed over lots of clean installs of XP &amp; fewer factory resets of Windows 7.&nbsp; These always fixed any problems that had developed over time.&nbsp; After getting tired of all the extra work that I constantly had to move,
 backup transfer etc. I developed the philosophy of creating another partition on my hard drive where I store all of my Documents - I used EaseUS Partition Master, Free.&nbsp; I personally made this documents partition about 75% of the total capacity of the hard
 drive while leaving the first 25% for the OS - 80GB max.&nbsp; Then I move all my documents to the Documents partition.&nbsp; All XP clean installs &amp; my Factory Resets of Windows 7 only affect the partition that holds the OS thus keeping the documents on the other partition
 always kept them safe from deletion &amp; saved tons of time once the new install / reset was complete.&nbsp; The final step I'd developed on previous windows versions is after the Clean install / factory reset is complete is to locate the Documents folder in the default
 OS folder on the OS partition &amp; through the Properties of the folder Location tab move the folders to the Documents partition.&nbsp; Since before wiping out the OS partition I had already moved all the documents to the Documents partition I can simply tell the
 Windows to use my old folder for all the Documents.&nbsp; In XP I only had to do this with one folder.&nbsp; In Windows 7 they started using multiple folders, thus it is a bit more laborious, but the same results could always be achieved if I did the same process to
 each of the Download, Contacts, Music, Video, etc. folders immediately after the fresh install / reset was complete.&nbsp; If I moved the documents immediately this redirection on the new OS was nearly instant since the fresh install document folders were empty.&nbsp;
 If I waited and created a bunch of new files before moving to my documents to the Documents partition I'd have to wait for all the new files to be physically moved.&nbsp; Once I'd told window to use the existing documents folder on the Documents partition I had
 access to all my pre Clean Install / Factory Reset documents.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said all the above to say as my personal background and for a basis for some of my comments later regarding my attempt at a clean install of Windows 10 the first time.&nbsp; What happened when I chose not to keep all the old applications &amp; folders etc. on my
 first attempt to install Windows 10 was that the Install process not only wiped my OS partition, but it wiped my Factory Reset &amp; boot partition of my original Windows 7 making it impossible for me to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; The other thing I found is Windows
 10 would not accept my Windows 7 drivers from the netbook manufacturer on their website.&nbsp; The manufacturer only offered Windows 7 drivers so I could not install Drivers to be able to turn on WiFi radio etc. from buttons, etc.&nbsp; This was unacceptable.&nbsp; It was
 at that point I thought there was no need to panic, I could do a factory reset.&nbsp; That was when I learned the boot partition had been altered &amp; no longer gave me the F2, F8, F10, etc. option to go into Boot Recovery &amp; Install Windows 7 via the Factory Recovery.&nbsp;
 So whether it wiped the Recovery partition or not was irrelevant since I no longer had access to to it in while the computer was booting up.&nbsp; I was fortunate that I had 3 identical netbooks &amp; through trial &amp; error was able to copy my Factory Recovery &amp; Boot
 partitions from one of my other identical netbooks over to the Windows 10 / messed up netbook &amp; then Factory Reset it to Windows 7 so that all the hardware would have drivers.&nbsp; After that I was able to successfully Upgrade to Windows 10 by choosing to keep
 all my applications &amp; folders the 2nd time around.&nbsp; If I personally did not have access to an identical windows 7 netbook, the Clean Install to my netbook would have made my netbook nearly useless, since things like WiFi are necessary for daily use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is shared as, for whatever it is worth information about my experiences on some of the topics being discussed on this thread lately.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until Windows 10 I have always highly recommend my method of moving Documents to a 2nd partition for the fastest access to all the info after a clean install or Factory Reset.&nbsp; However I can't say from experience whether Windows 10 will allow you to keep
 them safe on a 2nd partition safely or not.&nbsp; I never dreamed the Clean Install would touch my Factory Recovery &amp; Boot partition, but it did on my machine so I can't say yet from personal experience that it worked for me even once.&nbsp; In my experience which shared
 above, I never got that the machine hardware working properly after the Windows 10 Clean Install so I never event checked the Documents Partition since, like I said, I had no critical Data to even be concerned to look for them.&nbsp; Until I buy a new machine I
 won't be brave enough to even attempt another Clean Install again.&nbsp; I will wait until I have a machine with a Windows 10 Factory Recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me the Clean Install was not a good option &amp; I was fortunate I had the option to experiment with the new OS on a machine that contained no critical Document data as well as an identical machine that save my butt.&nbsp; After over 24+ hrs. of my personal labor
 I saved it.&nbsp; Who knows if I could have even paid a computer shop to solve this for me without the identical netbook to the original Windows 7 Factory Recovery &amp; boot files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all others debating these topics.&nbsp; The Cloud backup method mentioned by someone on this thread maybe the safest, but it is likely the very slowest method to be able to replace valuable files should they ever be lost in a Clean Install if a 2nd
 partition can't keep them safe from the newer Windows 10 Clean Install procedures.</p>

            <p>Yes. Well, I can tell you where you screwed up if you'd like to know.</p>
<p>The First Installation of Windows 10 cannot be a Clean Install. It has to be installed via your current Operating System and it has to be able to verify that you have an authorized copy of that Operating System. Only then will it permanently &nbsp;authenticate
 your Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care how many times you have installed new operating systems over old ones. The instructions on Windows 10 were clear and you paid no attention and just went ahead and did it YOUR way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time maybe you'll follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFTER your download and activation of Windows 10 was registered you could have done a clean installation without problems. NOT BEFORE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post, though, you'll serve as a cautionary tale to those who come after you on the dangers of thinking you "know it all".</p>

Clean Install Windows 10</a>&nbsp; for how drivers are best handled in a driver-complete OS since XP?&nbsp; I've never seen a driver not be found following those steps. In the rarest case we can help you find one that works - if necessary in

Compatibility Mode</a> .</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The data partition loss you bring up seems to pertain more to Factory Recovery, Upgrade or Reset Saving Nothing since it's not possible to delete a data partition doing a Clean Install unless you do it yourself. Whichever of these you used,
<strong>data should always be backed up externally because the hard drive could die at any time.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do a Custom <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-clean-reinstall-windows-10/11ccc09e-eefa-4bcc-80d9-d3d0d249587d?tm=1444962888069">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> correctly from the booted installation media, you'll always have the choice which partitions to save or delete at the "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>For example in the above screenshot which pictures a typical modern UEFI install, to get it cleanest I would delete all partitions one-by-one until its all Unallocated Space, then click Next to let the installer auto-format partitions needed and begin install.&nbsp;
 This avoids confusion when the installer manually creates necessary System partitions in addition to a New C.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However if there is a Data partition, label it that way first in its Properties so that it's clear by name and size which it is so it can be preserved.&nbsp; In that case you can delete all other partitions
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, my suggestion to always get it cleanest is to delete all partitions, however if you know you have a data partition or know for sure Factory Recovery will still run after reinstall (as on HP's which can offer a Minimal Recovery nearly as good as a
 Clean Install) or that OEM tools will still boot diagnostics (as on Dell) then you can leave those partitions if you think you might ever want the Factory Install or the more valuable onboard diagnostics.&nbsp; You can also manually

<p>You can't do it with Media Center. A video <strong>input</strong> is required on the display device. There are a few all-in-one PCs that have video input functionality as well as a select few laptops, of which Alienware is the best known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything that does streaming (Slingbox, HD PVR, Vulkano)&nbsp;won't work. Streaming buffers seconds worth of video. It's unsuitable for gaming.</p>

<p>The mini HDMI works better. It cost like $20.</p>
<p>Figure it out. I did it before and worked fine.</p>
<p>I am not good when its about explaining you how exactly to do it.</p>
<p>Just buy your self a cheap pc screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>one more thing you can make a much better PC then alien can if you know how.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get the same issue. I bought the game (and my new xbox360s) 2 days ago and it was fine then. But after I signed up with xbox live, the game wanted to connect online to download updates. This process actually froze my game and now I don't know what to do..

<p>Yes, Carnival is the only game affected (although I only own 3 games at this stage) lolz</p>
<p>and yes it occurs at the start of the game when its loading. Once I insert the disc and &nbsp;the game loads with the manufactor's logos etc, I sign in with my regular live account, it then says "checking for downloadable content" at that point it freezes completely.</p>
<p>(completely freezes- meaning no sounds, no moving images and unable to access the dashboard)</p>
<p>(Signing in under a different account name still yields the same frozen result)</p>

<p>Okay, and to be sure, you tried the steps listed in that guide I linked to in my initial post, correct? If this is occurring on all profiles, then it sounds like it's an issue with either your console memory or the game itself. Have you tried the game on
 a different console as of yet, such as a friend's? If not, can you give that a try?

<p>Yes I have tried all steps of the guide. When it comes to removing &nbsp;hard drive and trying to reproduce the freeze - I start the game without the hard drive and the game fails to even start as kinect needs updates and I don't have another account, etc etc
 etc. point is that without the hard drive the </p>
<p>But I really don't think its a hard drive problem as I bought this brand new xbox360s kinect bundle about 5days ago. So I highly doubt thats the issue. Before I signed up with xbox live the game worked perfectly fine, after contecting to xbox live the freezing
 issue appeared.</p>
<p>I can't really try the CD on a friend's xbox as none of them have xboxes (lolz). But I will try rent the Carnival game from the video shop and test it like that. I'll let you know after the weekend. &nbsp;Thank you sir.</p>

<p>@Mister Gwyther</p>
<p>I rented Carnival game from the video shop and tested it as I said before, again, same problem occurs. People on the thread above stated that perhaps its the game manufactor's problem as their patch is incompatible. Any idea when they can correct it?</p>

<p>Hi Brenda, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The amount of time your battery lasts will vary depending on the kinds of things you do with your Surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20443/windows-10-battery-saving-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how you can extend the battery life of your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are other steps you can perform that may help improve the battery life of your Surface device:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates for your device<span>.
</span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn how to run the toolkit.
 After running the toolkit, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force shutdown and restart your device</a></strong> to ensure all updates are
 applied.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check the Power mode slider</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Surface devices have a configurable Power mode that lets you choose between Best battery life and Best performance.</span><span> The setting is configured separately for when the device is plugged and when it is on battery. This allows a customer to
 have this set to Best performance while on PSU and for it to automatically change to a different setting, like Recommended, while on battery.
</span>The Power mode slider is found by clicking the battery icon on the Windows taskbar. For best battery life, the slider should be set to Recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run Power troubleshooter</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Power </strong>and then select <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Check Battery saver settings</strong><br />
<br />
Battery saver extends battery life by limiting background activity and push notifications. Open
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Battery</strong>. Check if
<strong>Turn battery saver on automatically</strong> is enabled and that it is set to at least 20%. Also, check if
<strong>Lower screen brightness while in battery saver</strong> is also enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check app usage</strong><br />
<br />
Unnecessarily running programs can cause slow system behavior and affect overall stability of your device.<br />
<br />
Open <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Battery </strong>
and then select <strong>See which apps are affecting your battery life</strong>.<br />
<br />
From <strong>Time period</strong>, select <strong>6 hours</strong>, <strong>24 hours</strong>, or
<strong>1 week</strong> depending on which period is closest. From <strong>Show</strong>, select
<strong>Apps with usage</strong>.<br />
<br />
Look for apps that have high battery consumption. If there are apps with high usage that you're not using, you should close them.<br />
<br />
If the apps start automatically, open <strong>Task Manager</strong> and then select the
<strong>Startup </strong>tab. You can disable any apps that you don’t need to start automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the steps worked, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023533/surface-restore-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset your Surface</a></strong>. This will help you determine if the issue is software or hardware
 related. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 mail not syncing Gmail Draft folder</h2>
                    <p>I've just set up new PC running windows 10. I've added my Gmail account to the Mail and Calendar app. The calendar, inbox and sent items have synced but my Gmail drafts folder and the other extra folders I have created in gmail are not syncing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleted my account and re-adding it. I've also tried resetting the app and re-entering my details but the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had no problem downloading and syncing these files with the Thunderbird email app, and they are all syncing on my old PC running Windows Live Mail, so it's not a gmail problem.&nbsp;</p>
