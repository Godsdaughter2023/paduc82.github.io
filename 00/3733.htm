    <title>Column width shown in characters and pixels but setting column width - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Column width shown in characters and pixels but setting column width requires inches</h2>
                    <p>If I click the border of a column to see it's width, I'm shown the width in characters and pixels -- e.g., "Width: 26.00 (161 pixels)". However, if I choose Format &gt; Column Width, the width input
<em>has</em> to be in inches (or whatever ruler units you've selected in Preferences).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find out what the column width is in inches? Or, conversely, is there a way to set the column width using character of pixel units?</p>

            <p>Doesn't seem to be very logical, does it? Unfortunately, neither of the options you suggest are available. The only way is to do the math based on the generally accepted conversion of 72 pixels = 1 inch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft claims to be on a crusade to make the Windows version &amp; the Mac version "identical" -- a noble ambition, but IMHO the execution is open to question. The only rationale I can envision is "That's the way it is in PC Excel" so that became the standard
 rather than changing the PC version to something sensible... Earlier versions of Mac Excel
<em>did</em> display inches (or default measurement system) in the tip box. Go figure :-\</p>

<h2>            Unable to Load Power Query table to existing sheet - Excel 1710 build 8613.1000</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to load a new Power Query (Get &amp; Transform) to an existing Excel sheet. "Existing Worksheet" is grayed out when "Table" is select at the top. It will only let me load to a new sheet, which is not what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on PivotTable report or Pivot Chart, it will allow me to put it on an existing sheet. I am not sure when this changed as I rarely load to a sheet, but it is extremely inconvenient to force it to a new sheet. I can CUT and PASTE the entire table
 where I want it, but that is an extra step, including deleting the extra sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like a bug. See image below to see the dialog box has the option grayed out.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will very likely need to wait until the final, release version, of Windows 10 before this is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that since the Media Center was made a separate, add-on component, that requires a new Product Key this add-on significantly changes the License for Windows.</p>

    <title>Live Tiles Worse than Useless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jac70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Tiles Worse than Useless</h2>
                    <p>I quite liked the Start menu concept of the early builds. Kind of a mix and match of the old and new. Links to programs and information like before but also an area for Live Tiles that present information and add some movement and visual interest to the
 Start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after nearly a year now these things are still not working. Which leads me to believe that the challenge of having these small tiles present updated &amp; accurate information is an insurmountable one. The clock hardly ever shows the right time or indeed
 any time - it even at times presents the wrong time which is why these things are not just worthless they are actually a hindrance. The weather tile never shows current information. The photo tile works sometimes and not others. The mail tile no longer shows
 if you have a message or not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as of last night I have deleted all the things from my Start. I did notice that once you do you can collapse the Start menu to a thin strip - which I like. I also noticed that when you delete a link from the Live tiles box it will then be added to the
 Frequently Used Programs list - this is also good. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what we need is something like widgets or gadgets that can be pinned to the desktop to present information like Weather, Time, Mail etc. These things should be proper Windows application that work and can be relied upon - not this 'Modern App' rubbish,

            <p>Microsoft is trying to eliminate as much traditional Win32 as possible, translating as much as it can into the WinRT/Metro/Universal/Modern style code, which makes everything less reliable, slower, less functional, so that it runs on phones as well as it
 does on the desktop. &nbsp;There is no way that they're going back to doing stuff that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if something is absolutely 100% functional in Win32, they will convert it into WinRT/Metro/Modern even if it breaks it. &nbsp;It's that important to them. &nbsp;Their new mantra is Mobile First. &nbsp;They see that as their future, and the desktop as history, or,
 "legacy" as they call it. &nbsp;It's being abandoned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a desktop user, I'm not abandoning Microsoft, but Microsoft is abandoning me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I like some of the 'Modern' apps. For simple things like a Calculator or Calender they seem to work well. The Calculator app for example loads pretty much instantly on my system and looks clean and elegant. The UI design of a lot of these small applications
 has come a long way over the last 8 months or so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no experience in developing a Modern app or Live Tile so I am baffled as to why something that I would expect to be simple - updating the Live Tile in real-time, clearly isn't simple at all. The Live Tile area seems to me to be akin to the home screens
 of a smartphone. When I look at my smartphone screen I don't have to worry about whether the information it is giving me is correct. All the information I require is reliable and accurate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gadget platform that we had in Windows 7 was as good as I needed. The Clock gave the time accurately right there on the dekstop. Same with the Weather gadget.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are possible solutions I think - make the taskbar clock larger so it is easier to see on an HD screen. Perhaps have a system clock that can be overlayed on the dektop like the clock that overlays the Lock screen. Maybe other information could be relayed
 in the same way like current local temp and weather conditions, email notifications etc, make these part of the OS, not running on some add-on platform.

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a question about Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Often I&nbsp;open the same web pages and the information I need are very often at the bottom of those pages. This means that I have to scroll down many times. Is it possible to tell IE to save the last position of the web pages (like in Word we have the function

<p>Is it possible to tell IE to save the<strong> last position </strong>on the web pages (like in Word we have the function 'pick up where you left')? - or something similar?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No......the best you can do is reopening the last page, etc but that's not what you are looking for.&nbsp; There is no way to have a page open, say, half way down as it was when you closed it.......the page will always open at the top.&nbsp; (You can use the page
 down key (pg dn)&nbsp;to get there faster than scrolling, but that's about it.)</p>

<h2>            Trying to fix an error sending email, can receive emails fine.  This is after major upgrade to pc - Outlook Error code when sending is 0x80042109</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have a really bizarre issue with my email after upgrading to Windows 7 and Symantec Internet security 2010.&nbsp; I have multiple pop3 email accounts and they were working fine on Vista Business, Outlook 2007, Sophos AV and Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 7 and changed my antivirus and firewall to Norton Internet Security 2010.&nbsp; Now one of the pop3 accounts (my domain name.com.au) is not working correctly - I can receive but not send email.&nbsp; The other two pop email accounts work fine
 for both sending and receiving.&nbsp; The error that I get with my registered domain email address when sending is: 0x80042109</p>
<p>I have logged onto my domain and confirmed the settings and the port number that is specified (<strong>port 25</strong>) and that the outgoing mail server requires verification.&nbsp; I thought maybe it might be an issue with my antivirus or firewall so I disabled
 Nortons and started outlook in safe mode and this still failed.</p>
<p>Could it be a problem with the domain? So I tried sending an email from my smartphone that has this pop3 account configured and that worked - so it's not the domain.&nbsp; As it was working on this laptop with my existing router and ISP before the upgrade it
 doesn't sound like it's caused by that but rather the changes on my pc.</p>
<p>Still thinking it could be a port issue I noticed from my web control panel that I had an option to use SSL for this connection and the outgoing port would then be
<strong>port 465 </strong>so I changed this and still I can only receive email and I get the same error sending.</p>
<p>In searching this error on the net I have found a lot of generic suggestions but nothing very helpful so far.&nbsp; I even tried creating a new outlook profile with a blank pst and trying to connect and this has had the same result - just to rule out the pst
 file being corrupt.</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think to try is sending from another location (just in case my ISP changed something at the same time as my upgrade) which hopefully I will manage to do in the next day or so.&nbsp; And the other thing I am thinking is a full uninstall
 of Nortons and then trying again to try and definitely rule that out - although I have had the same error trying it with Nortons disabled.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions on things to try to fix the above would be great as I haven't had an email issue this bizarre in a long, long time.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Finally got this working.</p>
<p>I plugged my old hard drive in which was working and it now no longer was working.&nbsp; So that would seem to eliminate Windows 7 from the equation - which made more sense as previously I was thinking that seemed to be the only change.</p>
<p>So I phoned my domain host who recommended that I use my ISP's email server as an outgoing server - I have done this and it has worked.</p>
<p>Weird thing is on my domain when I login the settings that are published for me to use are:</p>
<p>incoming server: mail.&lt;my domain name&gt;.com.au</p>
<p>outgoing server: mail.&lt;my domain name&gt;.com.au&nbsp; + needs authentication port 25</p>
<p>It even had an SSL option with another port that I was unable to get to work.</p>
<p>But now I have my email set to send using server: mail.&lt;my isp provider domain&gt;.com.au</p>
<p>My ISP must have chosen to lock down SMTP mail sending at the same time that I upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; This was specific to my registered domain email address though as in all this my other pop3 and smtp settings with my gmail and yahoo email have continued
 working.</p>
<p>Anyway all is now working - Thanks heaps for the helpful suggestions :)</p>

<h2>            Rename File and attach Help</h2>
                    <p>Hello - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;needing some assistance with sending a file as an attachment using VB. I am definitely no pro here; but&nbsp;know enough to be dangerous :) &nbsp;I have everything I need the code to do, except renaming the file. I would like to rename the file prior to attaching
 the file to the email. I would like to rename the file using info from within the excel file itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to file to contain the following text and pull a couple of dates in from the file ( dates in order to prevent duplicate file names). Something like this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Proposed Filename:&nbsp; <strong>PropertyName_CAR_6/1/2015_6/30/2015</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cell B3 = Property Name</p>
<p>CAR (text only - no cell reference)</p>
<p>Cell G3 = 6/1/2015</p>
<p>Cell I3 = 6/30/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Below is the code I have thus far</strong>. &nbsp;Any suggestion on how to accomplish this will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for you assistance :-)</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t buy apps from Marketplace. Continuous error message, no code.</h2>
                    I've been trying to buy apps from marketplace for about a week now and I keep getting the message: "We're having trouble charging this purchase to your phone bill, most likely because youve lost your cellular data connection. Wait until your connection
 is restored and try again or try a different payment method." I've called AT&amp;T three time in the past week the last of whom directed me to LG who THEN directed me to Microsoft (Though he gave me a number that was out of service) and NO ONE has been able to
 solve this issue. Is there ANYTHING I can do, because the POINT of having a smartphone is to download apps. If you have ANY numbers I can call, any people I should talk to, any methods I should employ PLEASE tell me because this inability to purchase apps
 is starting to REALLY irritate me. My phone is an LG Quantum, the Zune software is up to date and I have the Mango update as well. I also use Windows 7 on my computer. This really should not be a problem.

            <p>Hello cleopad1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You were mentioning you are having this problem since last week. What has change from before? Have you recently updated the phone software or firmware (can you please specify the version you are running)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you are experiencing this problem with 3g connection. Have you tried to connect using wi-fi (either at home/work, or in a wi-fi hotspot) to see if you are still unable to purchase?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried purchasing free apps on your phone? Does it work? Are you able to buy applications from the Zune software on your PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you are using phone billing, a method that would be directly supported by your carrier, this problem could be easily related to AT&amp;T. Have you tried to add another payment method (e.g. credit card) to exclude a problem with the phone itself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know&nbsp;if I can be of further assistance. Have a nice day!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Patrizia R.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams notifications for a different org</h2>
                    I am currently a part of two different orgs on Microsoft Teams. Currently, I have to flip back and forth between them to check activity, is there a way to have pop up notifications for an org that you're not currently logged in to? If I am in Org A, and
 I get a message from someone in Org B, can I get a notification for that? Or will I need to continue swapping between orgs to stay up to date?

<p>Hello Austin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my experience, it is not feasible to meet your requirement. It is recommended to submit your idea in
<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Teams UserVoice</a> for feedback. Microsoft pays high values on customer’s feedback.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, it is recommended to sign in one account via Teams desktop application and sign in another one via Teams web app. Or you can sign in via 2 different browsers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>Hi basha_usop,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're sorry to hear about your problem. If you suspect that you are experiencing a hardware problem it does not really matter where the problem lies as self-repair discussions are not allowed on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case, we would advise you to take your phone to the local <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Care Point</a> and let them have a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on,</p>

            First, try re-installing the software. If that doesn't fix the problem then its certainly a hardware problem. Only solution then would be to give it to a nokia care centre. But be prepared to be away from the phone for a long time.

 have. &nbsp;Where is that and how do I create them within my custom group? &nbsp;Also, is there any way I can add the little down arrow in the lower right corner which pops up the Font dialog box? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

</p><p>The Font Dialog button can be found in the "All Commands" list.&nbsp; It is shown as one of the "Font" entries (there are 3). You will have to find one. It does not appear as the small icon on the group name bar, instead it is just another button in the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, it is dumb that they do not allow us to customize the default groups. It is annoying that even if you copy a complete default group into a custom tab, it is rearranged into 3 row display instead of default 2 row display. Ahhh!</p>

                    <span>Skype 8 removes a lot of previously available tweaks and settings and the newest appearance is not very nice - reminds me
 of an android app, rather than something built for the computer. If the old interface becomes an option in the new Skype, I'd love to use it again.<br />
I'm still using Windows 7, because trying Windows 8, and Windows 10 - I did not like it one bit. Windows 7 to me is the best, most comfortable Windows version. Once the support is over, I will probably make it an offline PC, and switch to either Linux or iOS.&nbsp;<br />
Skype 8 seems to be build the same way - to look akin Windows 10. It's very uncomfortable to use. I tried to find an option on Skype 8 to switch to "old view" but failed. If it's available, where can I find it? If it's not available, why not build it in? (I
 am not sure about Windows 10, but in Windows 7, for the OS itself I can choose Aero, Classic, etc. view. Why not in Skype then? Since it's now a MS product too.)</span>

<h2>            If Response is Yes, copy to another sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to automate collecting responses in cell B3 that are marked 'Yes' in cell C3. This data is in the Spreadsheet 1 (Midscale) sheet and I would like to transfer content in cell B3 to another sheet (Follow up Email) in the same Excel file. I want
 this to continue to happen for any cell that is marked Yes in Column C (currently have data in c2 - c52. I want this data to show up in the other sheet (Follow up email) into cell c26 and keep loading in the same column (c27, c28, etc) for anything marked
 'yes' in Midscale.</p>
<p>Can someone please assist with what the formula should look like? My skills with formula is basic and I am struggling to make this work.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

<p>Hello Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. I am using a .xls Workbook to copy data from one sheet to another. When I use this function, it does not give an option to select a .xls file. Is there a way to write a formula to make this work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not dealing with massive data so dont really have the need to maintain a seperate database file.</p>
<p>

The feature you need is data validation;&nbsp; look it up in Excel help.

<h2>            handouts - &#34;powerpoint can&#39;t write to word&#34;.</h2>
                    Hi, I am having an ongoing issue with creating handouts from Powerpoint 2010 (it happened in 2003 as well). Most of the time the process crashes before it finishes. The error message is "powerpoint can't write to word". This happens regardless of the powerpoint
 file that I am starting with. Usually if I relaunch Powerpoint it fixes the problem, but not always. This is extremely frustrating. Any help would be appreciated. Tom

<p>A couple of things to try:</p>
<p>Break the presentation up into a couple of smaller ones; see if you can send each of them to Word, then recombine the Word files.</p>

                    I cannot delete, nor rename a folder by right-clicking on the folder in the new outlook.com. When I right-click, nothing happens, there is no action of any kind. It just does not work at all. Just so that we are clear, Firefox is my browser.&nbsp; I don't think
 that the browser is the problem. So why can't I delete a folder by right-clicking.<br />

            <p>Hello Patricia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've reached Microsoft Community Answers forum. Sorry for not replying in a timely manner. I recognized that you can't delete/rename folder by right clicking on the Outlook.com interface. Allow me to help you on how you can manage your folder in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've simulated the above steps you've provided and I was able to manage (delete/rename) my folders on Outlook.com.&nbsp;Please make sure that the folders you want to delete/rename is not the default folder (Inbox, Junk, Drafts, Sent and Deleted) of your account.
 As initial troubleshooting step, please <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
I had already tried what you have recommended, more than once. My Firefox browser (FireFox v 19.0.2) has been optimized and that did not work. I have also already tried the following:<br />
<br />
- Running FireFox in safe mode (that did not work)<br />
- Made sure the "disable or replace context menu" was checked (that did not work)<br />
- Cleared cache and history (that did not work)<br />
- Created a new profile as a test to check if my profile was causing the problem (that did work)<br />
- Completely removed all FireFox applications and folders, etc.&nbsp; in my hard drive and started all over again by installing Firefox anew (that did not work)<br />
<br />
Do you have any other recommendations?<br />
<br />
Patricia<br />

            <p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>I <em>may</em> have something that could help.</p>
<p>There has been some discussion over at the Firefox forums about Firefox not displaying websites (not just Outlook.com) correctly. You can go and check for yourself if you like. Or have a look at the link below. The most common fix seems to be to Reset the
 minimum font size in Firefox. The link below contains details of how to apply this fix, plus some others to check.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-look-wrong-or-appear-differently" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-look-wrong-or-appear-differently</a></p>
<p>Now the minimum font size setting seems to fix issues around commands nor showing on the command bar, but maybe it, or some other suggestion on the above link, could help you. It certainly can't hurt to try them. Sorry I can't be more certain about the fixes
 but I simply don't use Firefox.</p>

            Thanks for trying to help. I tried all the things mentioned in the link and again, nothing work.<br />
HOWEVER......<br />
I did contact a FireFox support person. That person tried his Outlook.com account using FireFox and he had no problem getting the drop down box to show up when he click on a folder to delete or rename. So, he thought that the problem maybe within my own individual
 Web access email account.&nbsp; How do I get a Microsoft staff person to look at my email account internally to see if indeed there is a bug within my email account.<br />

            Ron,<br />
<br />
I have one computer in my home that I use. It is an Apple iMAC OS Lion. This is the only computer I have in my home. As you may or may not know, you cannot install the Internet Explorer browser on the the Apple IMAC.&nbsp; Microsoft no longer supports the Internet
 Explorer browser on Apple computers. AND, I cannot find any Internet Explorer browser that will work on my Apple computer.<br />
<br />
In order for me to check my email using the Internet Explorer browser, I had to drive to my city library to check my email . Yes, of course, web access Outlook.com email functions all work fine in Internet Explorer..as expected...because they are both MircoSoft
 products. And yes, you can right-click on an email folder in Internet Explorer to get the drop down box to delete and rename a folder.<br />
<br />
I believe I stated previously, that because I have an Apple computer (the IMAC is a desktop computer), I use Firefox and Safari as my browsers.&nbsp; When you right-click on an Outlook.com (web access) email folder using FireFox and Safari, there is not a drop-down
 box...in fact, when you right-click nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to drive to my city library every time I want to check my email just to use Internet Explorer...that just isn't right nor fair.
<br />
<br />
I have tried varies solutions offered in FireFox and Safari community forums. However, for the all solutions everyone has offer, nothing has worked to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
I hope that I have sufficiently explained my situation.&nbsp; Can you offer any other help?<br />
<br />

            <p>I don't think anyone was suggesting you drive to your library all the time just to check your email. What we are trying to to is isolate your problem so it can be fixed. Personally, I don't have a Mac, nor do I use Firefox or Safari, so I can only offer
 suggestions, not solutions. And right now I am all out of suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a final thought, I really doubt there is a problem with your specific email account - that's just not how web apps work. It's more like a browser issue, but I guess anything is possible. I know you said that you tried everything in the link I previously
 provided, however I suggest you double check the suggestion about Resetting the minimum font size. I only suggest this again as it has fixed many issues with Outlook.com on Firefox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck in finding a solution.</p>

            <p>Again, I don't know or use Firefox, but I think the issues is that by setting a font size in Firefox you over-ride the fonts that Outlook.com wants to use. I copied the details below from the Firefox support forums. Hopefully they make sense to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have increased the minimum font size then try the default setting "none" in case the current setting is causing problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox &gt; Preferences &gt; Content : Fonts &amp; Colors &gt; Advanced &gt; Minimum Font Size (none)</li></ul>
<p>Make sure that you allow websites to choose their fonts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefox &gt; Preferences &gt; Content : Fonts &amp; Colors &gt; Advanced &gt; [X] "Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of my selections above"</li></ul>

            <p>We are using web browser only - outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens with emails from one sender, our employer. </p>
<p>There is a 24 hour pattern to the problem:</p>
<p>We will get all their emails, without issue throughout the morning.</p>
<p>Then at some random time in the afternoon (can be 2pm-7pm pt), SOME of their emails will stop coming in while others continue to come in (same sender address).
</p>
<p>Then at 1AM PT, the ones that didn't come in will all be dumped into our Inbox.</p>
<p>Then from 1AM on, all the emails will come in normally again (until that random time in the afternoon when the problem starts all over again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been using outlook.com website service for over one year. It has worked flawlessly until 9/6/14. On 9/6/14 something changed and this problem has been happening ever since. All of our employees that use outlook.com website service are having this
 exact same problem. Our employer's IT managers claim that this is your problem. They say that you are holding the emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I temporarily switch to another provider like gmail or yahoo or others, then I do not see this problem happen at all.</p>
<p>

<p>How can we completely DISABLE any filtering that occurs on Outlook.com Inbox?</p>

</p><p>Many incoming emails from employer are being delayed by hours then delivered in a chunk at 1AM PT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This type of delivery issue isn't typically due to filtering.&nbsp; It happens at a level you, as a mailbox user, cannot affect.&nbsp; It sounds like the people who run your employer's mail system have examined the mail transport logs to see where the delay is occurring.&nbsp;
 What do they see in the SMTP interaction between your server and the Outlook.com server?</p>

<p>I am not in direct contact with those people, I have to go through a "manager". This is some of what the managers have said which was over a month ago:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>they blocked us (that was confirmed by them), and they did a partial unblock until they've completed whatever it is they need to do on their end.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>They are saying it will take longer to unblock completely.&nbsp; In the meantime, if you have one of their
</em><span><em>email</em></span><em>s, you can contact them yourself and tell them to stop blocking
</em><span><em>email</em></span><em>s from the site.&nbsp; They might be more responsive if they're getting user requests too, and not just a request from the sender.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>The batched </em><span><em>email</em></span><em>s is due to the fact that they have not completely unblocked us. If you want to contact your
</em><span><em>email</em></span><em> provider, let them know that we're not spam, that would help a lot.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the above quotes "<em>They</em>" refers YOU (MSN / Hotmail).</p>

<span>Your junk email filter is set to exclusive</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile these messages go to my Inbox without any problem:</p>
<p><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** on behalf of Website_Info (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span> this sender is in your contact list</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are they sending some to JUNK and not others. They are clearly from the SAME sender and that sender is in my SAFE list and CONTACTS. It cannot be because of the "on behalf of" thin because those addresses are also in my SAFE list and CONTACTS. Why don't
 those messages also say "this sender is in your contact list"? I have clicked "Wait this is safe" link over and over, still being sent to JUNK</p>

    <title>Hotmail Account blocked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slater101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail Account blocked</h2>
                    <p>My Hotmail account has been blocked by Microsoft and I'm unable to regain access to it as the information that I've provided numerous times on the account verification form is considered insufficient. I'm unable to use my recovery email address because I
 no longer own the domain name that it belonged to. I've provided accurate information concerning my name, birth date, country, etc, my security question as well as subjects and email addresses of contacts that I've recently sent emails to. I've answered my
 security question correctly, I've provided as many previous passwords as I can remember and the custom folder section doesn't apply as I've never created any. I physically cannot provide any more answers. I've held this account for 13 years, it contains emails
 and photos that I would be distraught to lose and the only advice Microsoft have offered is to open a new account and provide more comprehensive recovery information next time. I seem to be unable to get in contact with anyone at Microsoft who has any other
 advice than "try filling out an account recovery questionnaire" which I've now done 5 or 6 times. I'm receive replies from "unmonitored" email addresses meaning that I cannot engage in any kind of meaningful dialogue with someone who might be able to help
 me. I get the impression that they really don't want to have to deal with this problem. Surely Microsoft cannot believe that this is the most effective way to deal with a customer of theirs.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I have no interest in creating a new account, I have several but none of them contain the last 13 years of my life like the hotmail account does. Has anyone out there actually managed to recover their account from a similar situation? I can see that there
 has been several posts similar to this one previously but none of them seem to end with anyone saying that they've been able to recover their account. I understand that I've partially asked for something like this to happen by not updating my recovery email
 address after letting the domain go but I'm in disbelief that there is no alternative way to prove to Microsoft that I am who I say I am.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please someone out there tell me that there is a solution to this problem!</p>
