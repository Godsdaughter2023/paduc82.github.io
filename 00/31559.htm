<h2>            Windows 8.1 Temp Directory and Compressed files</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same issue that I an running into. I just checked my Temp Directory (Local Disk C:/users/username/appdata/local/temp) and found that every time I open&nbsp;a compressed file either *.ZIP or *.RAR a mirror image
 of that folder/file named (Temp#_filename.zip) is created in the Temp directory and as a result&nbsp;I have found some folders with numbers as high as 59 (Temp59_filename.zip).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to transfer the files to en external drive but when I selected all the folders and checked the properties I discovered that it was over 82GB of data. I have run Malwarebytes, AVG 2014 Full, and Windows Defender. During each scan no malware, or
 viruses were identified. I use WINRAR to access and create both&nbsp;ZIP and RAR files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Mike</p>

            Please Disregard. I found that the WINRAR settings&nbsp;were setup to create temp files for all external devices and the default security setting was set to never delete temporary files. The issue appears to be resolved by selecting always for the delete temporary
 files.

<h2>            Disabling Mouse pad scroll bar, Windows 7, Gateway</h2>
                    Hello, I am currently using Windows 7 professional edition 32 bit. My laptop is a Gateway T-series 1424u. On the right side of my touch pad is a scroll bar. I want to disable this part of my touch pad. I went into device properties and there is no option
 to disable virtual scroll. Is it even possible to disable this?&nbsp;

            I would guess you will find this device on the device list in Device Manager (control panel). The Properties of any listed device will allow using a checkbox to 'disable this device' You may have to use the menu item to 'show hidden devices' to see it.

<h2>            Why do i get banned when i report hackers and trollers </h2>
                    
<p>Why is my other account ban ? You guys are horrible at doing your job i reported a hacker on xbox one with a game clip for proof i message him to stop and he curses at me and this was a week ago and he dident get ban. I had four people message me this month
 curseing at me for killing them in the game and i reported them and nothing happen by the way it was some pretty harsh things one kid was calling me a *** even spammed me with it and said i was poor because i was a *** even though im white so he was obvi upset
 and he dident get ban so out of all those people i get ban the worse i said was *** you and that was AFTER the guy message me telling me im a scrub which is a insult but not to the joke of a enforcement team and he t bagged me so i had more then enough of
 a reason to tell him to *** himself and BAMMMM i get a 12 day ban from coms. Whats really funny is this happen to me on another account someone cursed at me i said *** you and got baned for a day but somehow this account got a 14 day ban even tho he message
 me first and said worse things and dont tell me you read all your complaints because if you did i wouldent get ban for saying *** you to someone who said worse to me and none of those people got ban not even a *** hacker i was told i could of block and reported
 them which i did report them but thats *** because they sent the first message and hacked first so they could of blocked me but no i did nothing wrong and they dident even get a ban im sick of you guys i got a pc so i dont always gotta deal with you little
 kids thinking the enforcement is a job. By the way funny thing is i may of got a coms ban but no one ever really talks in game chat and i can play a game on my main account and still talk in a party with my second account without any sign in changes in the
 game so im still talking if your gunna play me ill just play you later&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no point filing complaints for cheating unless the game is new. </p>
<p>The enforcement team only see what they want to see. They do not investigate cheating but they are very eager to ban you for any aggro the cheating causes.
</p>
<p>There are definitely double standards in the way bans are handed out.</p>

    <title>Help removing parental control on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pustol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help removing parental control on my account&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This was such an idiotic mistake I made when creating my first live account about 10 months ago. I set my account to child instead of adult. I had to leave setting my account up to my brother
 basically, because I had to do something. So my account is a 'child' and I have been prompted to enter my mother's email address and password when the new terms and conditions comes up. Why x box? Why would you make a new terms and conditions if no one reads
 them and everyone gets the basic idea of it. No hacking CoD lobbies so people jump 200ft into the air or you'll get the ban stain. BACK TO THE POINT. My mother doesn't remember what her password was a year ago, and now its 11:30PM so I can't talk to her or
 call her to ask her anything else. So the question I've been wanting to ask is. How can I remove the parental control on my x box live account, or how can I make my account an adult without signing into x box live? I can't sign into live because it prompts
 me to accept the terms before i can sign in. This is really going to irritate me, because Microsoft has to make things just a little bit more difficult! HOW CAN I REMOVE THE PARENTAL CONTROL ON MY ACCOUNT OR HOW CAN I MAKE MY ACCOUNT AN ADULT WITHOUT SIGNING
 IN TO X BOX LIVE?</p>

<p>I had the same Issue - just fixed it. </p>
<p>I went to the xbox live site and signed in there. It prompted me to accept the new terms of service, but didnt ask for my parent's account details.
</p>
<p>It then let me sign in on my xbox without needing my parents details. First thing I did after that was promote my account to an adult account :)</p>

<h3> sambo219  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Power Brick</h2>
                    <p>My son's Xbox One power supply is temperamental. We have narrowed the issue down to the 'brick' as his brother's works without the issues on the same device. All I want is a replacement, but there doesn't seem to be an option on MS website to get one - just lots of controllers. Surely I don't have to buy a new console or risk an imitation replacement 'brick'?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>This didn't work for me. I sent my old console in for repair and received a replacement after paying the out of warranty fee. I plugged the new console in and it still wouldn't turn on. It now appears as if my kid didn't do the original trouble shooting
 properly and it is the power brick that is the problem. I have tried to follow your link, but for both registered consoles I get a message saying there are no accessories registered and I need to go the store. I can't find any power bricks in the store....and
 so far have dropped $200....</p>

<p>Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. I just tried to sign up my Day One Xbox One from 2013 for a repair, and when I choose the accessory selection I get this:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            iTunes opens as a transparent window&#63;</h2>
                    I have looked high and low and I cannot seem to find a solution anywhere on the web.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when I open iTunes in Windows 8 Pro, it opens as&nbsp; transparent window &gt; unusable.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
1. I have tried uninstalling &gt; reinstalling etc.&nbsp; <br />
2. Updating Windows 8 and iTunes software (even the repair option), firmware on SSD, and drivers, etc.<br />
<br />
Nothing seems to be working.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />

<p>I presume they changed it due to a combination of the cost of having to maintain two different case lines and the complaints about scratching/dust on the glossy case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The glossy case was made of very soft plastic that mared/scratched easily. You're better off with the matte finish.</p>

<p>How do you guys know that going forward all consoles are matte finish? When did they do away with the glossy finish or stop making it? Also what is the line that runs throught the console it's almost like an indent? I looked at the back of my Xbox 250 slim
 and it said 9/3/2011 which it was obviously manufactured recently which is a good thing</p>

<h2>            Movie maker audio&#47;video out of sync with long video</h2>
                    <p>Brand new windows 8 laptop (with Windows 8.1)</p>
<p>All drivers pre-installed or updated with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Windows update is current (no new patches available)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recorded a 45 minute interview using the "Camera" app in windows 8.&nbsp; It saved the file as an Mp4 (so content was generated natively with installed codex).&nbsp; The movie plays fine as is, but I need to upload it to youtube.&nbsp; As is the file is 2GB, so it will
 take too long to upload, so I tried editing with Windows Live Movie Maker.&nbsp; The file loads fine and I can do edits, but no matter what I choose as save format results in the audio being off by 30+ seconds by the end of the video.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This seems like the exact scenario in all the windows advertisements (Capture, Edit, Publish), but just does not work.&nbsp; Doing research, it seems like audio/sync issue are typically a result of variable bit rates for audio, but I can find no way to set constant
 bit rate for these videos.&nbsp; Is there any way to address these audio/video sync issues for long videos?</p>

====================================<br />
I would suggest that the MP4 be converted to the <br />
WMV format before importing into Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail, some better than others...<br />
the following freeware&nbsp; is just one example that <br />
works well for me.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8)<br />
(***Choose the Custom installation and carefully<br />
read *all* the install screens...there may be some<br />
items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
If a green Install button appears when you launch<br />
Freemake...you can ignore it and it should disappear<br />
when you import files.<br />
<br />
To download the full version instead of using the <br />
web installer...see the following:<br />
<br />
Freemake Apps - Offline version<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/</a><br />
(If you want to install Freemake freeware <br />
to your PC without the Internet connection, <br />
download these files)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
Also...Freemake can split/cut the video and you may <br />
not need to use Movie Maker.<br />
<br />

<br />
That should do it...<br />

<h2>            Games not starting</h2>
                    So I want to load up NBA 2K19 and I keep getting "Check again in a while. Service outages happen once in a while. Sit tight! We're aware of the outage, and we're working to restore service" I have never seen this message before and some games get it whilst
 others don't. I also have a friend playing 2K19 but I can't and when I check the Xbox Live Service Status it says everything is up and running.

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you cannot reinstall Steam is that it is still running in the background.</p>
<p>Restart your computer first so that the system will terminate the process and that's the time you can reinstall Steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h3> lesgodinez  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIN 7 BSOD stop&#58; 00000124</h2>
                    I am using INTEL DH61BEB3 motherboard, INTEL I5-3570, 4GB memory, WD 500GB AZEX hard drive. I cannot install WIN 7. During the installation, this is a brand new hard drive, I get the BSOD 124. Need help ASAP. I replaced the motherboard and still the same
 error. At one time when WIN 7 was starting to install, I got a black screen Windows Boot Manager error. One by one I was replacing each device, hard drive, memory and even the dvd drive. Nothing else is connected only the CPU, motherboard Hard drive, DVD drive,
 P/S2 MS keyboard and USB mouse. If I was successful in the installation, one or two things happen, when idled I can get a BSOD. Another senario, during updating WIN 7, it will just restart and get a BSOD, the BSOD so fast I cannot see the error code, then
 restarts again and again. Cannot do any repair because WIN 7 has not finish installing. It will not let me re-install WIN 7 unless I do a low level on the hard drive. After low level format, back to the same issue.<br />

124 is a hardware issue.&nbsp; Without the DMP files we cant tell you which hardware bit.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<div><em><em><font color="#FF0000"><b>If you are overclocking try resetting
 your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.</b></font></em></em></div>
<span>If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.</span><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows must already have recognized&nbsp;the Camera&nbsp;automatically installed same the first time&nbsp;for you to be able to use it with the Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you want Windows to ask for a Driver?</p>
<p>If the Camera is installed and&nbsp;working correctly, what is the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Dear,<br />
<br />
This camera is related to my product and i don't want someone to copy it unless he/she gets a driver from me.<br />
<br />
I have got one USB camera&nbsp; from china which when connected windows searches for the driver and says could not find driver, install it manually.<br />
<br />
I want the same thing with my camera.<br />
<br />
is it possible?<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            stop Windows from configuring adobe acrobat 8</h2>
                    <p>New PC w/Win 10.&nbsp; Tried to install registered Photoshop CS3 - no luck.&nbsp; Finally called Adobe to remove it (it wouldn't 'uninstall').&nbsp; After they ripped it out I was left with Acrobat Pro 8 in PC which I can't remove be any method.&nbsp; When Windows boots Adobe
 keeps trying to configure the program.&nbsp; I've deleted every file I can but still can't find THE one that stops Win from trying to configure/install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help.&nbsp; I've got Adobe Reader 10 nd it works OK.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi Kim, if it is running on Windows Startup, Autoruns will find it, 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Find any reference to Acrobat and delete it
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . . 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/d...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Also to be sure, if you want, you should delete everything  form these folders:
<br />
<br />Program Files\Adobe
<br />Program Files\Common Files\Adobe
<br />Program Files(x86)\Adobe
<br />Program Files(x86)\Common Files\Adobe
<br />Program Data\Adobe

</p><p>Thank you very much for you help!&nbsp; Autoruns just became my new favorite program.&nbsp; It ran great and pointed out several (more than several actually) Acrobat files hiding in the weeds.&nbsp; All were deleted and the PC restarted without any issues at all.</p>

</p><p>I don't know how my response rates you............if there are stars then you get them all.&nbsp; If not then you'll have to settle for a virtual "hardy handshake and a pat on the back".</p>

    <title>Windows Fax and Scan, Windows 10, scan profile error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saevus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Fax and Scan, Windows 10, scan profile error</h2>
                    <p>Trying to scan a document from a Canon MG7120 to a Windows 10 computer with Windows Fax and Scan.&nbsp; The software won't allow me to change the profile of the scan from "photo" to "document" and pops up an error message of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows can't load your scan profile.&nbsp; Your profile settings might not be compatible with this scanner.&nbsp; Windows will scan using the default settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure out how to alter this "scan profile".&nbsp; The only help I have found is on older OS versions.&nbsp; The computer and printer/scanner do communicate with each other.&nbsp; I can, for example, scan anything I want successfully but I can't change any options
 for said scan, such as making it a PDF scan or making it black and white vs. color.&nbsp; I very much need to scan into both black and white and PDF.&nbsp; I've updated the printer/scanner's firmware and drivers and I'm not seeing an option to update Windows Fax and
 Scan.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

 fix this issue. I would greatly appreciate if somebody could let me know how to fix my installation so I can play the great game! A quick response would be preferable if possible, I would love to start playing wizard101 again. Yes, I did try admin rights on
 the installation, and still froze up after it was 3 bars left to be done. Yes, I tried re-downloading the file. Can anybody please help us all in solving this issue?

<p>Becausee you can't nor is it recommended</p>
<p>You can create any account region you have want as long as you follow international laws</p>
<p>Now the issue you are going to have is you purchases the wrong content out of region</p>
<p>Meaning unless you live in whatever country you picked it will never download</p>
<p>Rdr is region locked</p>
<p>Along with most triple a titles</p>
<p>For the best experience with Xbox live your account region has to match your actual region unless you don't live in an xbox live region then it will be a lot of hit and miss for you</p>
<p>Its not recommended you make an out of regional account and is clearly stated in the rules</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This is not something we can give you any sort of "official" confirmation as no one on this forum works for Activision.
<strong><a href="http://support.activision.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You'd want to point this question over to them</a></strong> or wait until the actual content for the season pass actually comes out so you can actually see from others if content is region locked.<br />
<br />
Microsoft would be unable to tell you what content would or wouldn't be region locked.<br />
<br />
Considering Estonia is not an officially supported Xbox LIVE region you take the risk of purchasing any sort of content and not being able to download it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for answer. I've sent request to Treyarch 2 days ago. Still no answer from their end. The funny thing is that I've checked some other posts regarding some other (older) games and it looks like Activision is telling that Microsoft is putting region
 locks and Microsoft is telling that game publishers do. So, who to believe? )))</p>

<p>well first activision has region locks for a reason</p>
<p>international laws</p>
<p>google blackops and world at war bans blackops and world at war are among the first on every list of baned games</p>
<p>remeber not every country allows the same stuff as the US what is acceptable in one country isn't nessarily acceptable in another</p>
<p>&nbsp;specially in germany region locks makes sure content only is downloadable and the correct localization including language is applied</p>
<p>you wouldn't want russian content in US or japanese content in US do you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>that tells you much of why there are region locks'</p>
<p>even activision has region locks on their season of dlc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Black Ops game is being sold in official game shops in Estonia, so it seems to be very logical that the game itself is not banned here</p>

<p>MW2 did not have any issues too! It was done with another account that time, but it had all the same region information, on the same console, etc. Also I find it really pointless and abusive not to provide Estonia with xbox live support for years. The funniest
 thing is that one of the best xbox call centers is placed here as I know (this is not a secret). So, locking some content in non-supported countries by default with no reason is a way not to get money for it. What a kind of business is that? Please, stop trolling
 Estonia. There was a time when it was a part of USSR and now Russia has full support and we are only supporting, being a part of European Union... Do something, please!</p>

<p>You wrote "That would be mw3 elite season of dlc not older games", now it is "Mw contents except for Mw3 never had region restriction"... Are you arguing with yourself? Also this is not full answer for my last reply and I know that Treyarch is not Infinity
 Ward. Just stop spamming me with useless information instead of escalating the issue to the higher level. I am a loyal customer here, paying not less than some other customers and getting less because of these restrictions. And again: both, consoles and games
 are being sold in Estonia for long time that means that all the requests to you, guys, were just ignored all the time and not forwarded!</p>
