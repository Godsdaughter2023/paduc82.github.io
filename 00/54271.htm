<h2>            Windows Update Failure on Lenovo Thinkcenter &#40;No error codes&#41;</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo Thinkcenter M83 series (brand new, OOBE) Windows update runs and says it is successful but when I restart it says "Failure configuring Windows Update, Reverting Changes" and leaves me with 32 Updates failed. I have run the MS Fix-it, says
 it found the problem and fixed it with Windows update, yet I am still failing the updates at boot. No error codes or anything, just says Failed for 32 updates.

            <p>I have a 5.1 speaker setup.&nbsp; When I play audio from my collection, it plays in stereo (the left and right channels).&nbsp; Only when I stream music from sites such as reverbnation.com does the music come through the center speaker instead of the left and right
 channels.&nbsp; It's not a balance issue and my speakers are set up properly.&nbsp; I don't know if sites such as these stream their audio in mono, or if the computer doesn't recognize it as music that should be split into left and right channels.</p>

            <p>I believe he is having the same problem I am. Note: This is safemode with networking, I'm currently using it to type this response online. I press to update, and the loading dots just zoom across the screen endlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the last update, I have had no success with updates. Also possibly related, since the update I am having trouble accessing files. It takes a very long time for windows explorer to load my files, no matter which drive I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to attempt a "Reset my PC" but keep my files, hopefully the issue resolves itself.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0555e564-e52b-426a-b82e-f5f5083e75a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0555e564-e52b-426a-b82e-f5f5083e75a9" /></a></p>

 screen would normally appear so make changes to the automatic update feature. I hope this helps.&nbsp; Thank you so much for lending a hand.&nbsp; FXPY&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the methods below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update services and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow the below mentioned steps:&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" (without quotes) in start run box and&nbsp;press
<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b. Locate <strong>Windows Update</strong> service.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c. <strong>Right click </strong>on the Windows Update service and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d. In <strong>Start-up type</strong>, select <strong>
Enable</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>e. Click <strong>Start</strong> under <strong>
Service status</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>f. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>g. <strong>Repeat the steps c</strong> to f for the following
<strong>services</strong> also: </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service &amp; Cryptographic Service.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If these steps do not help to resolve the issue, then you may proceed with the step mentioned below and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method&nbsp;2:</strong> </span><span>I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly.
 Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>1. Right click on the search menu, and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)”</strong> from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2. Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic</strong>,
<strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the <strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3. Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and
<strong>catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>5. Type<strong> Exit</strong> in the <strong>
Command Prompt</strong> to close it and then restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<span><br />

            <p>Hello NC, thank you so much for joining the conversation to correct my issue of "windows 10 continually searching for updates".&nbsp; In trying to resolve another issue with TurboTax i accomplished what you just described by running msconfig.&nbsp; Once finished and
 the computer restarted in normal mode my tax issue was solved as was the issue with windows update.&nbsp; I now have the current windows 10 update on my system ready to upload.&nbsp; But have some reservations, considering all the contributions suggesting additional
 problems after the installation.&nbsp; So, i ask you, should i install it or wait? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who came to the rescue...You are all special, caring, people.&nbsp; FXPY</p>

<h2>            Using Skype for Business 2015 and I cannot be Heard or Seen During a Call</h2>
                    
<p><span>Greetings! &nbsp;one of my Skype for Business (SFB) users began experiencing difficulties starting in November where he could not be heard buy others or initiate his video during a Skype call. &nbsp;Prior
 to November he had full functionality of his SFB application and was able to conduct calls with audio and video. We have tried the following to resolve this issue:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Uninstall/reinstall MS&nbsp;Office 365 Pro Plus ver. 15.0.4771.1004 numerous times.</span>
</li><li><span>Installed windows updates (the updates included a Skype update).</span>
</li><li><span>Updated the user's MS Life Cam Studio web cam (with built-in microphone) firmware.</span>
</li><li><span>Verified that the Life Cam Studio web cam is working correctly by using the SFB internal audio/video tests, which it passed.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>After completing all of these actions, we still cannot receive audio or video from this user, and he still cannot join Skype meetings by clicking on a meeting invite hyperlink.</span></p>
<p>We have&nbsp;Office 365 Enterprise E3 licenses, and our users have Office 365 Pro Plus installed with the Office 2013 apps installed locally (includes SFB). &nbsp;The user in&nbsp;question&nbsp;is running Skype for Business 2015.</p>
<p><span>His computer exceeds all the SFB &nbsp;hardware requirements and he's running&nbsp;</span>Microsoft Windows 7 Professional -&nbsp;Version 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601.</p>
<p>Any assistance with this issue will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>hi vaughnjones,</p>
<p>based on your description, i understand one of your users cannot be heard or seen during a skype call. to look into the issue, i’d like to confirm a couple of details as below:<br />
1. please confirm if audio and video are both abled for the affected user in <a href="https://admin1a.online.lync.com/lscp/users.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
skype for business admin center</a>&gt; <strong>users</strong>&gt; double-click the affected user&gt;
<strong>general</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6a369734-52a7-4225-85b2-ad0068dd8867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6a369734-52a7-4225-85b2-ad0068dd8867" /></a><br />
<br />
2. as it used to work fine before november, did he install any updates or something similar before the issue occurred?<br />
3. i’d like to figure out if the user’s audio device is connected to a usb hub. if so, please plug it directly into his computer and check if this helps resolve the issue.<br />
4. i notice the skype for business client version 15.0.4771.1004 is not the latest up to date, please upgrade the program to the latest version and check if there is any improvement.<br />
5. by saying ‘we still cannot receive audio or video from this user, and he still cannot join skype meetings by clicking on a meeting invite hyperlink’, i’d like to collect the exact symptom. for instance: he couldn’t join the skype call or he was able to join
 and just could not be heard. also, are there any error messages? please take some related screenshots and upload them if any. to upload pictures, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> and<strong> insert/edit media</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2090d70c-9490-4843-be0d-2f8a4314a161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2090d70c-9490-4843-be0d-2f8a4314a161" /></a><br />
<br />
6. can he use his ms life cam studio web cam (with built-in microphone) in other programs on his computer successfully?<br />
7. when he sets up his account on another desktop that works fine with skype for business client installed, can he be seen or heard in a skype call?<br />
8. does the issue persist if another user sets up his office 365 account on the affected user’s computer?</p>
<p>with the information collected, we will do further research for you.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

<p>Greetings Sam,</p>
<p>Apologies for my tardy response. &nbsp;Since my last correspondence, the user replaced the web cam with another of the same make and model (MS Life Cam Studio), just a little order, and Skype began functioning well (the user was able to initiate Skype video/audio
 calls successfully). &nbsp;However, the following day the user was unable to initiate a Skype Video/Audio call successfully once again.</p>
<p>Here are the answerss to your questions:</p>
<p>1. The Skype for Business Admin Center was checked and Audio and Video is enabled for the user.</p>
<p>2. I checked windows updates, as well as 3rd party updates and amazingly there were none listed during the time period of November.</p>
<p>3. The user is using the microphone of the MS Life Cam Studio web cam, and the webcam is plugged into the USB port.</p>
<p>4. I re-installed the current MS Office 365 ProPlus install which installs the entire Office suite, downloaded from our Office Online subscription, and the version shows 15.0.4771.1004. The user was still unable to make any type of call successfully.</p>
<p>I also located the MS Skype for Business website and did a download and install. This solution appeared to work as the user was able to make Video/Audio calls successfully, but they could not end the call. &nbsp;When hanging up &nbsp;Skype will freeze and could not
 close unless ended in Task Manager. So, this is not a reliable option.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Exact symptom - On Audio calls, the user will audio call a person in their contact list and ringing will begin. &nbsp;The person receiving the call will answer and can be heard by the user, but they cannot hear the user. &nbsp;Making Video calls is the same. &nbsp;You
 can hear and see the person called, but the video and audio &nbsp;will not start on the user's side. &nbsp;The user is able to end the successfully, instead of freezing (see question #4,paragraph 2).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;The user has used his MS Life Cam Studio web cam on a different computer to make a Skype call successfully.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;He has not yet signed on to Skype from a different computer.</p>
<p>8. A different &nbsp;user has signed on to the computer in question and tried to initiate a Skype Video/Audio call and it failed with the same symptoms as the original user.
</p>
<p>Thanks again for your assistance.</p>

<p>Hi VaughnJones,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information.</p>
<p>Based on the information you provide, other users encountered the same issue in the problematic computer. It indicates that the issue may be related to the client side. To identify it, please try using the problematic user account in a different computer
 to see is the issue persists and share the result with us.</p>

<p>Greetings Aaron,</p>
<p>Per your instructions I moved the web cam and the user to another workstation to login to Skype for Business. &nbsp;He was able to initiate video/audio calls successfully. &nbsp;Therefore, it appears to be a hardware or software conflict. I'll set the his computer
 to factory default and install the applications one at a time. Thanks for you and Sam for your assistance.</p>

<p>Hi VaughnJones,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Since the user didn’t encounter any issue when using Skype for Business client in another computer, based on my experience, the most likely factor of the issue is related to the computer hardware and software. If the issue persists after setting the computer
 to factory default, feel free to let us know and we will further assist you.</p>

<p>Hello Mouran,</p>
<p>Before setting the user's computer to factory default I decided to make another attempt at uninstalling applications and updates that were installed recently and could contend for access of the web cam. &nbsp;While doing so, I found and uninstalled Skype version
 7. &nbsp;After doing this, the user was able to successfully complete audio/video calls. &nbsp;The user was also able to end the call without freezing.
</p>
<p>The next day I followed up with the user who reported that Skype for Business would fail 2-3 times through out the day and then recover and work normally. &nbsp;The user is satisfied with the performance, however I will continue to monitor the situation for possible
 conflict with something scheduled on the computer.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Vaughn</p>

<h2>            Game not showing up in ready to install list...</h2>
                    <p>I bought WWE 2K16 digitally a couple of years ago and I wanted to mop up leftover achievements in the game so I can continue playing WWE 2K19. However when I went to my games, only WWE 2K15 is showing up. I thought I might have hidden it from the list by
 mistake but when I've unhidden all the games, it still doesn't show up and with it being an old game, it no longer shows up in the Xbox Store for me to install it. Is there any possible work around without having to pay for a physical copy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: I've finally managed to get the game back. I went into my achievement list, which brought me to the official club and a lovely big button saying "Launch Game". I was getting pretty stressed out as I paid £79.99 for the game way back when but I'm pretty
 relieved now that I managed to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Hey XBL iGoldengirl</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums. There are a couple of ways for you to verify the status of the game from your end but I would recommend that you try this on our website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like you to verify that you own the title by trying this, go into your
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Profile?xr=mebarnav&amp;rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Profile</a> and go under My Games and search for the title there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally you can check your <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
order history</a>&nbsp;and search for the game there. You could have potentially purchased it on a different account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and try this and let us know what you find!</p>

<p>I bought this back in 2015. I paid for it on this account so it's not under a different account. I've got the order reference number as I spoke to an agent and made their job easier rather than searching through 4 years of purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game no longer shows up in My Games and Apps on the console, on the app, on this website and it no longer shows up in the Xbox Store. Funnily enough, the support agent has no idea what's going off either, they've clearly seen that I own the license to
 the game and that I no longer can access it. So in theory I've paid £79.99 for a game that seems to have been completely wiped from all existence. Seems a bit fraudulent to me...</p>

<p>Hi xGoldie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely can agree with you that this is an odd and frustrating issue. I think at this point you should also contact 2K support because the game was possibly removed due to licensing or contractual issues between the developers and Microsoft. You have
 proof that you purchased this game from the Microsoft Store and it would be up to&nbsp;2K to fix this license issue since Microsoft does not handle licenses issued&nbsp;by third party developers. 2K support&nbsp;should be able to give you a better answer as to why it was
 removed from the Microsoft Store and that you have proof of purchase for their title.</p>

            This I a stretch, but if you remember about when you got it you can go onto your Microsoft account and look at the transaction history and probably find it there. You maybe able to get the download onto your device if you can find it there.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>As you indicated, F2 will get you into the setup utility (also known as the BIOS). You need to find the setting for "OS Install Mode." It now needs to be set to OFF (this is the normal, default position).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, this person got you the correct memory! Post back if you still need help.</p>

            <p>On startup press the&nbsp;F2 key and turn off / disable the memory limitation. Then add the extra memory.</p>
<p>Next run memtest86+ to insure the additional memory is good.</p>
<p>Memtest86+ runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or confirm if your additional memory is good / compatable with your computers or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p>I use ArtiosCAD 14.0 as part of my work and it is essential that I am able to use this program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm whether or not I will be able to use ArtiosCAD 14.0 with Windows 10? I don't want to miss out on a morning's work having to re-install Windows 7 because 10 is incompatible.</p>

products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />

<p>====================================================&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            The Scansoft software updater is trying to get out to the Internet to update. Windows Defender is flagging it and blocking it. There is no reason for the Scansoft updater to be running automatically. Scansoft is software that came with your printer/scanner.
 Use the System Configuration Utility to remove the updater from Windows Startup as follows:<br />
<br />
<span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. Then see what is on the Startup tab.&nbsp;You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility.
 Usually this will be blocked by Windows Defender and you'll need to allow it so you can then tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Use Services instead and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.<br />
<br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Mouse and keyboard center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papayawing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse and keyboard center</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. On startup, a pop-up window says Mouse and Keyboard Center is not working. The next pop-up says it is restarting. Then these two pop-ups repeat themselves once more. Finally they disappear. My Microsoft mouse
 and laptop keyboard are working. How do I get rid of these pop-ups, which delay my start-up by at least a minute?

            hi, you could try uninstalling the software and then reinstalling it, sometimes this solves many issues with software.<br />

<p>Man if you didn't have that source i would say it was fake, because to me it seemed like it might have been photo shopped. I don't know though i think i like his new costume. The black and goldish-yellow are really cool and really goes with "Dark Knight"
 because that is what batman is a Knight who stays in the shadows and protects Gotham City the best he can.

<p>According to the arkhamcity.com forums, this is pretty old news. I didn't know about it until two days ago, though. I would have liked Nolan's version of Batman's costume but it would have been difficult to get the rights for it. Or maybe even the Batman:
 Beyond Terry McGinnis suit? I've seen a two-face like Batman suit that'd be pretty cool.</p>

<p>When you mention "Nolan's version", which one? &nbsp;I liked the Batsuit in 'Batman Begins" much better, 'The Dark Knight' suit (with the movable plates) didn't quite have the right look to me. &nbsp;The 'Batman Begins" suit looked awesome in its simplicity, it even
 had an "Adam West" look to it. &nbsp;The Batman Beyond suit would be a gem and even open the door for a Terry McGuiness entrance into the video game world (not to dismiss the N64 'Return Of The Joker' game). &nbsp;It most doubtedly would be a little tricky for RockSteady
 to pull off for the basic functions of the suit are different (No Cape, Jet Shoes, etc.). &nbsp;Remember, that that suit also cloaked with a mere touch of a belt buckle...:-)</p>

<p>Oh, I meant the 'Batman Begins' version, although I liked both versions. I agree, the suit was very simple and would therefore be easy to design in-game. I hope they release alternate suits via DLC in the future and that we're able to use them in the storyline.
 What do you guys think about co-op for Arkham City? I know it's not possible this late in development but I mean it could be released as DLC later on and I think they could really pull it off with Catwoman and Batman or Batman and Robin. Or even (and this
 is a longshot) Batman and ... dun dun DUN Nightwing. :)</p>

<p>Eh..No co-op, these types of games are better left alone and not adding co-op. I think the leaders boards for the challenges is as far as i want it to go with live stuff.
</p>
<p>However i would like to see a DLC for Nightwing to be used in challenge mode.</p>

    <title>Vista unable to boot even in safe mode, black screen with cursor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vista unable to boot even in safe mode, black screen with cursor</h2>
                    I had been having problems with my Vista Ultimate SP2. I leave it running 24/7 as my main workstation.&nbsp; After several recent updates, I would have to boot into safe mode then exit out before I was able to boot normally. Then I had to reset it once after
 it crashed after not logging off completely. I have tried a recovery several times and nothing works. If I try normal load I just get a black screen with no keyboard, mouse, nothing as it&nbsp;attemps to load windows. Safe mode will give me a cursor&nbsp;and a&nbsp;screen
 saver&nbsp;after awhile.&nbsp; I really don't want to reload everything over again.&nbsp; Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Also how do I do a backup if I can't boot into the system?<br />
<br />
Will an "InPlace Install" upgrade work" ?, or is&nbsp; this my only choice to risk all of my data?

<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />

Cheers.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above does not work, try making a Bootable Repair Disk to do a Startup Repair:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is the case with most computer/laptops these days, they do not come with the proper Vista Disk to do Repairs with; only Recovery Disks.<br />
<br />
As yours falls into the above category, download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk
 in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc with it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it.<br />
<br />
</span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a></span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Repair Vista disk.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>It is not a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
You can save your Data while in Safe Mode, ifit loads properly.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
You can only do a Repair Upgrade install if the Service Pack on the Vista DVD is not lower than the SP installed, in your case you have SP2 installed.<br />
DVD SP level.&nbsp;has to be the same or higher to be able to do a repair install.<br />
Your DVD needs to be SP2<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Unless&nbsp;you do regular backups, nothng is guaranteed re Data.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Datas recovery:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download/Save the above Knoppix Live CD ISO file.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.<span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
If none of the above works: Reinstall.<br />
<br />

            Mick,<br />
Thanks for this help.<br />
I have an Intel&nbsp;P4 with 250gb and 3gb ram, DVD running Vista Ultimate 32 bit.<br />
<br />
Any F8 doesn't work, no restore points or access. I have the install DVD but it is SP1 and I was on SP3... so I will slave and copy data.<br />
<br />
1) How do I get all of my Outlook data, or will part of it be lost if I do not have a back-up of the data?<br />
2) Does the Knoppix disk enable me to read the C: drive to copy data to a USB drive?<br />
3) If I am going to have to reinstall this will the Inplace Install (upgrade) work after I back-up all my data or will I have to do a clean install?<br />
4) If a clean install is necessary would you recommend the 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 RC install?<br />
<br />
Thanks loads for your help!!

            Sorry Mick,<br />
<br />
I have been copying data as a slave drive and buring the Knoppix disk for the past several hours. So I can't do the Inplace install.&nbsp; What about the Windows 7 RC upgrade?&nbsp; I think it might be worth it if I have to do a complete reintstall.&nbsp; Thanks again in
 advance.<br />

            I've been having difficulties too. I've done a system repair with the boot disc mentioned above, but it was unable to fix the problem. Right now I have been running in safe mode with networking, which seems to work, otherwise it will just crash to a blue
 screen memory dump. According to the system repair, a system start file is in need of repair.<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do without wiping my hard drive completely? I've been trying to make a system restore point, but I can't turn on system restore in safe mode.<br />
<br />
What can I do?

            <p>System restore requires all the services of normal mode. the only thing you can do is create a new user profile and then reboot and login to that profile (it must have admin rights). back up only the user directory then do a complete wipe and reinstall from
 ground Zero. That is your only solution but it sounds to me that there are sector errors on your HDD test it with seatools or wdutils to see if there are any hard sector errors if any show then the drive is defective and needs to be replaced or you will see
 more data corruption</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the above does not work, try making a Bootable Repair Disk to do a Startup Repair:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>As is the case with most computer/laptops these days, they do not come with the proper Vista Disk to do Repairs with; only Recovery Disks.<br />
<br />
As yours falls into the above category, download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc with it.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it.<br />
<br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Repair Vista disk.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>

<span>It is not a reinstall disk.</span></p>

You can save your Data while in Safe Mode, ifit loads properly.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
You can only do a Repair Upgrade install if the Service Pack on the Vista DVD is not lower than the SP installed, in your case you have SP2 installed.<br />
DVD SP level.&nbsp;has to be the same or higher to be able to do a repair install.<br />
Your DVD needs to be SP2<br />

Datas recovery:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</a></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.<span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
If none of the above works: Reinstall.<br />

</p><p>I have installed Paint.net some time ago. After that my default application change to that program. Whatever I had tried to change it back to the Photo Viewer, nothing is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I go to System -&gt; Default applications and change application for Photos, my desktop refresh and that's it.&nbsp;Anything&nbsp;else. Paint.net is still default. I even&nbsp;uninstalled Paint.net, but the&nbsp;situation is the same. The only difference is that&nbsp;Paint is
 not more listed, but "unknown application".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with right-click on&nbsp;photos and&nbsp;Open&nbsp;with... option, but&nbsp;the result was the same.&nbsp;Desktop refresh, and default app remain the same.</p>

<p>i travel alot and have the same issue where ever i go, plus the 3 other pc's, 2 cell phones etc work fine in my house so this is a surface issue not a router issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did contact microsoft, and the person had me uninstall the Marvel driver then reinstall. this got the wireless working again but in a few hours it became limited again. i uninstalled and reinstalled again to restore the wireless function. i now have to
 do this a few times aday. i have even went to Microsoft surface support site and downloaded the drive pack and reinstalled. still have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as this is my primary machine i am starting to run out of patients..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>all the updates are done and up to date. i see a number of questions re this issue and hope you have a fix.</p>

            <p>So far, seems that the only "cure" was to check with the router makers web site to see if there is a newer firmware for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Marvel Avastar adapter is choosy with routers and doesn't like a lot of models out there.&nbsp; The problem "IS" the Marvel''s driver and actually not the router itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other fix would be to get a USB WiFi adapter and use it in locations where you get limited or no connection.&nbsp; If you do that, you steer away from modifying the router and possibly making it non-functional.&nbsp; There is a warning issued by the router
 makers in regards to installing the firmware and heed that warning and follow the instructions to the letter (that is, if an update is available).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the newer routers do have issues even with other computers.&nbsp; I have a HP Stream 14 laptop with a Broadcom adapter that is pulling the same stunt as the Marvel adapter.&nbsp; Broadcom is working to catchup and getting the newer drivers up to speed in regards
 to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the router upgrade route or get a USB WiFi adapter and use it temporarily.&nbsp; Most models should work and RealTek and a few others make a real good one and they are cheap.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response but that's concerning. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have added the following. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In my house I have 2 new routers. Both new in the last 3 months and I have updated the firmware on both. Plus every device works fine as did the surface until recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just getting back from a 2 week biz trip which means every location I was at, my surface didn't like any of the routers??</p>
<p>was in 2 hotels where my cell and my android tablet worked fine but had to reinstall the driver on my surface 3 time a day to get it to work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was on a sales meeting at a engineering firm for 10 days with 40 people and I was the only one with a surface and the only one with an issue. It makes sense to me that it is a surface issue not a router issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the response but I would think it is either a update the corrupted or a hardware issue but I am not an expert. Any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>I would recommend a USB WiFi adapter.&nbsp; They may look stupid sticking out of the side but the connection would be 100%.&nbsp; Use it only when needed, especially during an important meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VPN should not be an issue since it has a different IP address.&nbsp; A router can support 255 connections and a WiFi/LAN adapter can handle quite a few connections of their own (limit is not known)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The routers that you are connecting to are not 'liked' by the Marvel adapter.&nbsp; That thing is picky and is all to do with the drivers.&nbsp; Your existing driver and any other driver you can find to install to replace it will end up being the same thing.&nbsp; You
 will be doing that forever.</p>

            <p>I have uninstalled and re-installed adapters and my drivers and all software updates are the latest. I still have this problem. It is very frustrating. At work, I have an ASUS router and a D-link router. That is where I have the problem. At home, we use
 a Linksys router and an Apple Airport Extreme router. (My wife and kids use Apples.) I have no problem losing service at home and a routine problem losing it at work. Should I just install a Linksys router at work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft's failure to remedy this problem has been very disappointing. The continuing references to updates as fixing the problem that clearly continues on a fairly broad scale means there is more of a problem than they are admitting.&nbsp;</p>

<div>There still are issues that seem to only impact SOME routers. And YES, the</div>

<div>in case I encounter wireless that gives me trouble. </div>

<div>Sure, if you can change the router at work, you might have better luck as well. </div>

            <p>Thanks. I appreciate your response. I know this is not in your control, Barb, but the issue is NOT with routers. It is with Microsoft and the adapter.&nbsp;We paid premium dollars for a machine that has a fundamental flaw. I love the thing, but this makes it
 really a less-than-advertised computer. </p>
<p>Given Microsoft's failure to remedy the problem with the multiple software and firmware updates, I am perplexed why a recall has not been initiated. Oh, yeah. It would cost a lot of money. Does anyone know which consumer agency we can report this? The FTC?</p>
<p>As to the workaround, given the fact that I seem to have no problem at home with the Linksys WRT1900AC, I will install one of those at my office. FYI, in my office, the D-Link router is the D-Link AC3200 Ultra Wireless AC. I am not at the office and don't
 know the firmware version, but the model was only recently released by D-Link and we just installed it last week, checking at the time to verify all of the latest firmware and other updates were installed. My ASUS router at the office is the ASUS RT-AC68R
 Dual Band Wireless-AC1900 Gigabit Router. As part of our work on the loss of signal, we insured that it had the latest firmware update available, although I am sitting at home at the moment and don't recall what that was. &nbsp;I have two SP3s. Each is an i7 500
 GB model.</p>

<h2>            PLZ HELP sfc &#47;scannow has been running now for over 6 hours and its only at 48&#37;</h2>
                    <p>So this all started this morning when my husbands laptop for no apparent reason became extremely unresponsive with serious issues opening anything. We use Norton so ran a "quick virus check" (showing nothing but some cookies) tried a full system scan &amp; it
 froze &amp; had to be shut down. We ran all the system cleanup tools in Norton (they took forever with how slow it is running ) this did not help. &nbsp;tried a disc cleanup &amp; that would not work. &nbsp;i wanted to try to do a system restore, but every time I open settings
 &amp; went to click start on the refresh, it would start to open &amp; close right down never even giving me an option to actually start it. I wanted to run some browser based virus/malware scans but chrome &amp; explorer would not open to allow me to get to the site.
 After trying most the other basics I could think of untill I eventually did the "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" to access task manager &amp; it is showing 100% disk usage similar to the picture below &amp; showing minimal usage on the disk from the listed processes. the CPU,
 Memory &amp; Network all looking fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34a6c6d0-6dfb-4b17-828a-00a8f3d6bd0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34a6c6d0-6dfb-4b17-828a-00a8f3d6bd0a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>after doing more research I tried some of the suggestions to resolve this issue, I disabled BITS, I tried to disable superfetch &amp; Wsearch but was unsuccessful, it was suggested I run &nbsp;sfc /scannow from the administrator command prompt. it took me a while
 to get the administrator command prompt to open &amp; I started sfc /scannow &amp; it has now been running over 6 hours &amp; is only at 48%. the task manager is still running in the background showing that 100% disk usage. &nbsp;we are unable to turn off the screen saver
 &amp; sleep mode because as long as the sfc /scannow is running nothing else will open or work (I'm assuming because of the 100% disk usage) I have never had &nbsp;a sfc /scannow run this long &amp; not sure how long it could take &amp; if it will still run in the background
 if the computer goes into sleep mode? we have been making sure not to let the computer time out but eventually sleep will be necessary. I have been at this since 10:30 this morning &amp; it is got me at my wits end. I don't know what I should do next. SOOOOOO</p>
<p>1 - should just let it run over night &amp; pray it is completed by morning?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 - should I try to stay up with it &amp; keep it from going into sleep mode like I have been all day?</p>
<p>3 - should I try to force stop the scan/repair &amp; if so, how would I do that safely. I cant imagine this would be the safest of things to do.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>4 - should I go down to the basement &amp; get the biggest hammer I can find &amp; hit it a few times really hard!!!! (lol As satisfying as that would be right now...seriously... any help or advice that anyone can provide would be extremely appreciated )</p>

            <p>This will be my final post here &amp; its only for the benefit of others who may have the same issues as I did &amp; are just as frustrated. I hope this helps&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>don't bother with this community/forum because nobody is going to even try to offer you any help! this is the WORST place to come for advice&nbsp;</strong></span> I came here for advice when
 I got to the <em>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</em>issue, &amp; as you can see... I got nothing.. not one response, not one bit of help, advice or guidance. a complete waste of time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue</p>
<p>laptop extremely unresponsive &amp; using 100% of disk space yet no processes where using an excessive amount of space in task manager</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>- Ran virus software &amp; malware software. I wanted to run a few browser based scans but the browsers just wont go to the sites for me to even be able to run them</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> - Used "disk cleanup" &amp; ran all cleanup tools, cleared my browsers, and every other Basic clean-up process i could think of.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> - Checked Task Manager to see running process <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>(Ctrl + Alt + Delete) </strong></span>&amp; disabled "<em><strong>Wsearch, BITS &amp; Superfetch</strong></em>" from the "Admin comand prompt" accessed through the task manager</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> - Ran <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> - took over 12 hours to complete. Yes...12 hours.. I have never had sfc /scannow take this long before. Sadly It found corruption but could not fix&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - Tried to uninstall both Norton &amp; chrome but neither would complete the uninstall process &amp; just froze the laptop.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> - Checked available memory (6gb installed w/ 5.88gb available) HMMMM</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> - Checked start-up for anything that might be running that shouldn't be &amp; there are only the necessary ones</p>
<p><span><strong>8</strong> - Checked Task Manager again to see running process&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>(Ctrl + Alt + Delete) &nbsp;</strong></span>Disk usage still @ 100% yet no processes are using any real amount of disk space</p>
<p>I did notice Multiple Instances Of <strong>Svchost</strong> Running (I honestly forget where it was i saw that... I have been at this for 2 days &amp; my brain is starting to melt out my ear...lol)</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> - I tried to do a System Refresh (and maintain my programs &amp; files) this was UNSUCCESSFUL with the message "there was a problem refreshing your PC, No changes where made"</p>
<p>At this point, I am literally 2 steps away from dropping it out of the second story window to watch it shatter into pieces when it hits the concrete of the sidewalk to the back yard! (yes, we did that with the laptop before had before this one once we decided
 it was beyond repair... I will admit it was very therapeutic)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> - Since nothing else worked...we went to the last resort &amp; I
<p><em><strong>WOOOO HOOOO SUCUCESS&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>At the moment this seems to have resolved the issue. I went back into task manager &nbsp;<strong>(Ctrl + Alt + Delete)
</strong>&nbsp;to check the stats &amp; thank the gods.... everything is running as it should<strong> Disk usage is now NORMAL ...</strong>I have my fingers crossed that this will be the end of this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope that this post helps out others that might be having the same issues I had because that is what the forums are really for... helping people. &nbsp;I also would recommend this forum instead. the people there are very kind, helpfull &amp; quick to respond</p>

<p>It has never happened before.</p>
<p>What password?</p>

            Hi Robert, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />What happens when you try to change the password? Does it work?
<br />
<br />Is your PC part of a domain, perhaps your work network? If so, your network administrator must have set a time limit before your password expires and must be changed. You can go ahead and change the password.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, if you're not part of a domain network, you might need to try booting into Safe Mode to see if it lets you log in, or log in as another user, then follow the steps in this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/the-users-password-must-be-changed-before-signing/cf09e154-e9ea-4da7-a219-6337eeae60f1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />- Press Windows key + R, then type lusrmgr.msc and press Enter.
<br />- Click on Users, right-click on your OEM administrator account and select Properties.
<br />- Uncheck the box for User must change password at next logon. Click on Apply and OK to save changes.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<h2>            Duplicate Network Adapter Name &#91;URGENT, please help ASAP&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, for the past 4 days or so, I've been faced with this issue. I've tried everything from the registry, to uninstalling the drivers but nothing seems to work. I don't know why they have numbers after the name but can somebody please help me
 fix this issue. I also tried removing the number 2 from "Wi-Fi 2" but then an error popped up and stated what's in the picture below. I just want the original names of the adapters back. It feels really weird seeing Wi-Fi 2 and above all else, it affects the
 performance of Google Chrome. I realized that when I'm watching YouTube now, I have to refresh the page like 3 to 4 times for the video to show and I NEVER had to do that before until this issue started occurring. I do hope somebody can help me with this issue
 because it's really frustrating me :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S: If nobody can solve this issue, would reinstalling Windows fix this? Thank you in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I add an outlook icon to my windows 8 task bar&#63;</h2>
                    Please would someone tell me how I can add the outlook icon to my windows 8 task bar. I cannot access the full outlook account via the mail app. It looks completely different to when you log in over the internet, so I would like to add the link to my task
 bar. I have managed a shortcut on my desk top though. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>I'll assume that you mean <em>Outlook.com</em> rather <em>Microsoft Office Outlook</em> here.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open IE10 Desktop.</p>
<p>2. Login &amp; go to your <em>Outlook.com</em> Inbox.</p>
<p>3. Left click on the <em>Outlook.com</em> tab and (while keeping the left mouse button pressed) drag the tab down onto your taskbar then release the mouse button.</p>
<p>(initially the icon will show as a standard Internet explorer "e", but after a few seconds should change to the
<em>Outlook.com</em> icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the usefull&nbsp;<em>Task</em> choices available when you right click on your new
<em>Outlook.com</em> taskbar icon too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also see the video here (it says Windows 7, but the methods the same):</p>

<p>The coolest people that dashboard are the 15th prestiges who have a 2.1 k/d and even if they win by a huge margin they will still dashboard if their k/d isn't up to par to them. I've always had an okay k/d but I care way more about winning than k/d.&nbsp;</p>
