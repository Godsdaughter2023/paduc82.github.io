<h2>            Receiving stop error&#58; atikmdag.sys, while trying install Windows 7.</h2>
                    I received a custom built machine and tried to install windows 7 and first has issues with the installation disk and after resolving that I get the BSOD with a reference to atikmdag.sys. I am not sure how to install/uninstall the drivers since windows
 does not even load. I also purchase a monitor and it has a disk with it and I am not sure why you need a disk for it. Could it be the&nbsp; monitor and if not how do I get pass this error?

<h2>            Loss of Keyboard and Mouse functions &#40;USB issues&#41; after recent updates which included KB4074588</h2>
                    <p>To whom it may&nbsp;concern and members of the community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent update which included KB4074588, I have lost my keyboard and mouse (USB) during the use of my computer after a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro and receiving the required updates.&nbsp; Not only is this issue on this computer it has also recently
 occurred on my new HP laptop.&nbsp; I have done some research into this matter and in my findings, there were many comments on various websites pertaining to this issue.&nbsp; I have found that installing the mentioned required March 5, 2018, KB4090913 did not completely
 fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my findings.&nbsp; After a manual install of KB4090913 via this link, https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4090913, I have not encountered the unrecoverable lockups of&nbsp;both my keyboard and mouse requiring a hard reset.&nbsp; I do now hear
 the occasional sound of an unplugged device and either the keyboard and or mouse still result in a lockup of roughly 2 seconds of either&nbsp;device.&nbsp; This temporary lockup also happens with&nbsp;or without the sound of a device disconnect and can be seen by the stuttering
 of the mouse when being moved across&nbsp;the screen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can we please get this issue completely resolved as soon as possible?&nbsp; Losing the keyboard or mouse even momentarily during the time I am on my computer causing loss of work or causing me to have to redo my work is not acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>GE</p>

<p>Here is an update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just encountered the sounds of the device disconnecting and connecting.&nbsp; At that point, I had to do a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone contact me or post a Proper Fix for this issue?&nbsp; I cannot tolerate losing my&nbsp;work again here.&nbsp; I now have to save my&nbsp;work every few seconds, not knowing when the loss of keyboard and mouse is going to come.&nbsp; I have gone to my Laptop and had to
 shut it down since it is now useless&nbsp;without&nbsp;keyboard or mousepad access.&nbsp; I will hopefully fix that via Safe mode when I have time.</p>
<p>Reinstalling the OS is not an option since it does not 100% keep the programs, files, and settings.&nbsp; I went through having to install the OS once, please do not put me through that ordeal again.</p>
<p>April 2018...&nbsp; &nbsp;I have found this issue on two more of my computers, and have received numerous phone calls asking if I can fix their&nbsp;computer since after purchasing a new keyboard and mouse that the devices are still intermittent or locking up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Here's something that may work, depending on how old and what hardware your systems have. &nbsp;This fix worked on an older Acer aspire desktop that has the cheap and troublesome Realtek HD audio chip. &nbsp;This legacy piece of hardware is built in to most PC97
 and later mobo's, and it's driver history goes back well before Windows XP. &nbsp;It was pre-HDMI, which means that it was designed to use a software solution (and lots of CPU cycles) to emulate a Soundblaster 64, which had it's own onboard audio processor. &nbsp;Today's
 video cards that do HDMI (my example is a lowly Nvidia gt 610) take over the audio processing as well, because the video processing chip is robust enough to do that as well as process video (and bitcoin mining, etc.). BY DEFAULT, the old legacy hardware driver
 is left in place and running, which is causing the mapping for the RF transceiver on a USB port to lose it's mapping because the old driver and the RF unit are fighting for port and CPU clocks. &nbsp;Windows tries

                    Will there be any fixes for the Canoscan 5000F at any time? It's older, but still works quite well for the slide scanning I do. I am in the middle of a project of scanning 30 years of slides to digitize them, so if there is any way to get it working I
 would much appreciate it. At this time I can't afford to buy another scanner.<br />

Thanks for the help with the HP printer! You guys are the best.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for showing interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you try logging in to webmail to delete the junk mails?</li><li>Are you using any security software on your PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable Antivirus</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus or firewall, I would suggest you disable them temporarily and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Important Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to uninstall and re-install Windows Live Mail and check if it helps.</p>
<p>To uninstall, you may try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows + R.</li><li>Type appwiz.cpl and hit enter.</li><li>Locate the program you want to uninstall and double click on it.</li></ol>

            It is not only the junk mail folder in live mail but also the deleted mail folder. I uninstalled Live mail then reinstalled but it also reinstalled all the email in all the folders that I was trying to delete. Before uninstalling live I saved the folders
 I wanted to keep and I could import them back in but that didn't happen because live mail reinstalled everything, It's like I never uninstalled live mail. So uninstalling mail doesn't uninstall the folders as well. If I knew the location where the folders
 are installed I could possibly delete them from there. But I don't know where win live mail stores it's folders.

            <p>Problem was finally fixed but doing a clean uninstall of Live Mail and deleting&nbsp;it's entries from the&nbsp;registry and reinstalling.
</p>
<p>Now why when a program is uninstalled it's information isn't automatically removed from the registry?</p>
<p>Any good uninstall program should do that and delete ALL information associated with the uninstalled program, including the registry and folders.
</p>
<p>No wonder Windows computers slow down and the drives get filled with clutter and junk.&nbsp; This isn't anything new this has been Windows way from the beginning.</p>
<p>How about Microsoft clean up the short comings in it's software, now that would be a real improvement and not just another version that carries on the same old junk with the same old problems.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Netflix app unusable due to constant buffering</h2>
                    
<p>I am having trouble watching netflix on my xbox one. Here are my issues:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When I start a video, it takes a long time to load. The load percentage will often go up to +/-90% then drop back to 50%. This happens multiple times before the video actually plays.
</li><li>Sometimes, the load percentage will stop at 99% and the video will never play. (I've let it sit at 99% for up to 15 minutes just to see if it would eventually start).&nbsp;
</li><li>When videos do play, they pause to buffer every 3-5 minutes. This buffering lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<div>Of course, my internet connection would be the most likely culprit. Here is how I know the issue is not related to my internet connection:&nbsp;</div>

<li>Xbox one registers internet connection as excellent. </li><li>Chromecast and Xbox 360 plugged into the same tv and using same internet connection play netflix flawlessly.&nbsp;
</li><li>Other apps including FXNow and Xbox Video play video falwlessly </li></ul>
<div>To troubleshoot console issues, I have tried all of the typical "fixes"</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall &amp; re-install app </li><li>Power cycle(s) </li><li>Different HDMI cables (i know.. but trying everything) </li></ul>
</div>
<div>In searching, I have seen others reporting similar problems watching netflix on the xbox one. In some cases, it has been suggested that the user contact netflix about the problem - so I did. I explained the problem to netflix just as above and was given
 a set of canned troubleshooting steps that did not help. I was then told to contact the console manufacturer.&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div>So what say ye Microsoft? &nbsp;The 8 year old console on the shelf can do it. The $35 google device can do it. Why can't my xbox one play netflix?&nbsp;</div>

<p>My Netflix runs perfectly... only the odd time (maybe 1/20 shows) that it stops only once in an episode in order to buffer. The problem may be your internet connection, unfortunately.

<p>Could be your internet service provider. I have Comcast, and no matter how "fast" my connection is, I can't stream Netflix in HD on my TV. &nbsp;I think it's because they want customers to use their streaming instead.

<p>No my xbox streams xbox video and netflix no different from the other. It has to be your connection. You may simply be too far from the hub. Even with a fast connection this can cause severe upload issues. You may try asking you ISP to create a work order
 for the local phone company to come out and test your line. When I got my new network I was able to get them to run a brand new line at no cost to me cause the line was 20 years old!!</p>
<p>Never hurts to ask.</p>
<p>P.s my technician said if I did not do that my network would only attain half of its capability.</p>

<p>I always had issues with it buffering or the quality degrading down below SD on my 360. It works perfectly fine on my PS3, PS4, and the HTPC I had hooked up for a bit so I don't know what the 360's deal was. I can stream videos from my PC to the 360, so
 I know it wasn't my network or anything like that. </p>

<p>Yes, I am having the same exact issue. Constant buffering every 3 to 5 minutes. Sometimes gets stuck at 99% and the only temporary fix is uninstalling the app and reinstalling. If it was the internet connection, why would reinstalling the app fix it??? Netflix
 on my other devices flawlessly. Microsoft and Netflix, you need to address this. Do a Google search, there are so many people reporting this, it is not an isolated incident.

<h2>            No More DVD Drive</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to Win 10. Was told by MS that everything would be fine, that we would not lose anything in the upgrade from 7pro. I liked 7pro. Only reason I upgraded was MS said it was soon going to be made mandatory in auto updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well - I no longer have a functioning DVD player nor am I able to play Unreal 99, a game I have played for 15 years with people from around the world.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 65 and cannot afford to purchase a new computer.&nbsp; MS. I am so so disappointed in MS. You would think they would have some sense of how to do things by now. Instead, lies and shoulder shrugs.

            <p>Thank you for the replies by way of assisting me auggy. I appreciate it but it is over my head. I do not know how to create a system restore point and I worry that if I continue with uninstalling what you wrote I may permanently put my computer out of commission.
 (As an aside I always thought I would need my D or E drive to create a restore point and i no longer have one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>From where I sit right now I believe my only option is to go to a local shop and have them take the computer back to Windows 7 premium and restore all that I had on the system. (Video on Win 10 is choppy and stutters also) If the cost approaches the price
 of a new computer then I see no option other than taking MS to small claims court, as what they promised was clearly untrue if one reads the many forums describing the Win 10 issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as if some large brain at MS thought Win8.1 should appear more tablet or phone-like. I do not know how he/she convinced others that appealing to phone users would bring MS a step into the future. An app by any other name is a program. Geeez. Win
 7 premium was a great system. Did everything. I have no DVD. I'm approaching 63 and no longer in contact with friends around the world. Video is choppy. MS lied. If you actually work for MS and can prove it I will let you take control of my computer and you
 can make the changes you suggest. But you could be anyone so I'd need confirmation and you probably won't do this. Anyway....
</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to assist,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            <p>Some computers, especially those with older chipsets, tend to need specific drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't get the onboard DVD working the least expensive option other than going back to Windows 7 or clean installing Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;would be to&nbsp;use a USB DVD drive&nbsp;as they are fairly inexpensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I might suggest to uninstall just the following two items under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATA Channel 0 </p>
<p>ATA Channel 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer afterward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should force a re-detection of the DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be no ill effect of doing that but if you want to create a System Restore Point beforehand follow the steps in the following link - only requires the C: drive:</p>

    <title>3 year old PC not supported by Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> very very very unhappy  say:</h3>
<h2>            3 year old PC not supported by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just spent an entire day, with the help of an IT buddy, finding out that my tower PC is no longer supported by Windows 10.&nbsp; For weeks I've been bombarded with updates and reminders about upgrading to Windows 10, ver 1609, but each time I upgrade I get
 a black screen around the 75% upgrade complete mark - and I'm forced to back-out to the previous version of Windows 10.&nbsp; Twice a day I'm forced to close an automatic upgrade cause I know its going to fail.&nbsp; Today I took the chance to use Windows 10 Assistant
 - assuming that because of all the issues I've been reading about, MS finally creates something we all can use.&nbsp; Turns out, it fails AGAIN!&nbsp; Only this time, I can't back-out to a previous version....my PC goes into a continues loop of rebooting.&nbsp; &nbsp;Literally
 10hrs later and I'm forced install Windows 8.1 and I'm still working no re-installing all my programs, configuring my system and loading backed-up data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never again Microsoft, this was the last straw - you've lost a customer forever....but I'm sure you don't give a crap about one customer - its clear in your product and support.</p>

<p>"...&nbsp;&nbsp;finding out that my tower PC is no longer supported by Windows 10."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything, it's the manufacturer of your computer who does not support it on Windows 10. That means the manufacturer has not tested your model on Windows 10, has not attempted to keep it current with the changes in Windows 10, and won't help you if your
 computer has a problem with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you want to complain ... complain to the manufacturer. Ask them why they won't support a 3-year old computer on the newest version of Windows. Tell them that you'll never buy that brand again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was up to Microsoft, every computer in the world would be supported on Windows 10. As far as Microsoft is concerned, the more computers that can run on Windows 10, the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's a tip for you: Just because the manufacturer isn't supporting your computer any more, that doesn't necessarily mean it won't run well on Windows 10. Dell doesn't support my (9-year old) computer on Windows 10, but it runs very well. Dell didn't
 support Windows 8.1 on my computer, and that ran well. They also didn't support Windows 8 and that ran well too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lack of support means <em>you</em> have to do the work that your manufacturer didn't do:
<em>You</em> have to do the research and the testing, <em>you</em> have to replace the components that won't work on Windows 10 with components that will work (if that's even possible,)&nbsp;<em>you</em> have to search for updated drivers (if they exist) and&nbsp;<em>you</em>
 have to find supported versions of your applications, or replace them with applications that are supported on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all that work and my reward is a dinosaur of a computer that runs very well on Windows 10, so far. I had to replace the OEM video card and my original WiFi adapter; I had to find Windows 10 drivers for all my hardware, and I had to toss a few of my
 cherished applications. My inkjet multi-function printer works <em>sort of</em> well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best place to do your research is the manufacturer's own community forum, where you can correspond with people who are using the same model of computer that you're using. Ask them if they got their computers to run on Windows 10 and how they managed
 to do it. That's what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this is a lot of work, but that's what you have to do because your manufacturer isn't supporting your computer on Windows 10. Of course it's much easier to blame everything on big, bad Microsoft, but not only will that not give you a working computer,
 you're showing everyone how much you know about computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've got nothing to lose, right? So why not give it a try.</p>

<p>Asus manufactured the PC, I've never had an issue with them.&nbsp; In fact I am quite loyal to the brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So BulldogXX, you're saying that Asus should have made a PC that was compliant with a Windows 10 version that wasn't release for 3 years after they built the PC?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that you are quite savvy with understanding what hardware is compliant with a Windows version, upgrading your hardware as time goes on.&nbsp; While that may work for you, I'm thinking that that is not the norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a PC, and MS changed the game 3 years after.&nbsp; Surely you must admit that MS has some responsibility to release updates that are compliant with hardware that isn't ancient, and at least compatible with hardware that that the original version was
 compatible with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed windows 8.1 and my PC is serving my needs...so why can't Windows 10 do the same?</p>

            I have a Dell Vostro 1000 purchased in 2010. W10 Pro installed on it. You said its an ASUS system but what model is it? My guess is that if W10 will install on a system 8 years old, W10 should work on a system 3 years old. As for the device drivers needed,
 you should get them from ASUS. Use the W8.1 drivers. For my Dell, I used the W7 drivers since Dell never released W8 device drivers for that system.

</blockquote>
<p>Wrong again. I am saying that Asus decides whether they will support their computers on new versions of Windows. That's Asus' decision to make. They weigh the cost of continued support - design, coding, testing, bug fixing, documentation, training support
 technicians - against the additional revenue they anticipate receiving for their efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought a PC, and MS changed the game 3 years after.&nbsp; Surely you must admit that MS has some responsibility to release updates that are compliant with hardware that isn't ancient, and at least compatible with hardware
 that that the original version was compatible with.</span></p>
<p>How can Microsoft possibly do that? Let's consider what's involved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- There must be hundreds of millions of hardware components in use today. How can Microsoft possibly keep Windows compatible with all of them? And for how many years should they do this - what should be the standard and who should decide?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Microsoft can't possibly know what's in the code of the drivers for those millions of devices - not only did Microsoft not write that code, much of it is proprietary to the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- Even if Microsoft were to get its hands on all that proprietary code, through industrial espionage or outright theft, one presumes, that's the intellectual property of the hardware manufacturer that Microsoft has no legal right to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technology is a lot more complicated than you think. It's not simply a matter of throwing in a few commands and everything will be wonderful. Moreover, technology changes very quickly. If you want to keep on using older technology with newer computers, go
 ahead. Nobody's stopping you - I told you my computer is 9-years old - just don't expect the technology industry to help you. They're too busy building the new technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think a three-year old computer is probably compatible with Windows 10 and you're just doing things wrong.</p>

<h2>            Why does every new release of Skype make the UI&#47;UX worse&#63;</h2>
                    The new (8.x) releases are especially bad - not just on Mac but on IOS and Android (and, presumable, on Windows) too. It keeps getting harder to use and with less useful functionality. I'd happily give up video "emojis" and animations to show someone is
 typing a response in order to get back things like having a favorites list of my most-contacted people and groups.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it's a communications tool, not a social-media tool.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t Activate Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello I recently got a new computer since my other one died and updated Windows. Now I have a watermark that says, "Activate Windows" and it won't go away and I can't activate it since I don't know what the product key is. I got to update my Windows 8 to
 Windows 10 with the free update. I was just wondering what my product key is so I can activate it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

            If Windows 8 was preinstalled, it cannot be transferred to another computer, usually.
<br />
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.

<br />
Option 1 (Recommended)<br />
<br />
Install the program(s) again in the same path, so that the uninstaller information is recreated. Then uninstall the program cleanly from "Programs and Features" (formerly "Add or Remove Programs")<br />
<br />
Option 2<br />
<br />
Remove the entries manually <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/addremove.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">via the registry</a>.<br />

<h3> limchongtee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing Issues with Onenote &#40;Surface Pro 3 Version&#41; &#43; &#40;some thoughts about SP3 OneNote&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if any of you have experienced such a problem but i certainly do. This is regarding printing on OneNote (SP3 version, not the 2013 version). I am an avid user of OneNote and I have been using it to take down notes in my University lectures. How
 i usually use it is that i will attach/insert the Powerpoint Or Adobe Lecture slides into my OneNote to jot down notes. So far the experience have been great. Below are the few reasons why I love SP3 Version's OneNote</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Compared to Onenote 2013 which has to be activated via WIN+N, the SP3 Version can be activated by just a single click of the top button of the pen.
</p>
<p>2. Also, the full screen layout is perfect for jotting down notes; </p>
<p>3. as well as the "double-click" function of the pen which allows for screen clipping - great function for me to add in pictures/notes on the web while working on the notes itself.</p>
<p>4. changing between pens and highlighter is made extremely convenient with the "pen-hovering" function. compared to OneNote 2013 where i have to go to the task bar to select the different pens, the "pen-hovering" function really make things convenient</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that i have touched on why i love SP3 OneNote, i have to raise up some irritating issues im facing right now.</p>
<p>1. When using SP3 OneNote, i have issues printing my edited lecture notes via ONENOTE properly. For example, when i print my adobe/ppt/word files, they can be printed properly in slide format/multipage format etc. However when i need to print out my OneNote
 on hardcopy, the notes always get blown out of proportion. For example, it will use up 2 to 3 pages to print "one page" etc. To avoid this "blown out of portion" printing issue, i have to go through the hassle and extra steps of opening my OneNote 2013 clicking
 files, checking the print preview before i print out my notes. This printing thing is very important to me though because for certain examinations and tests, its open book and i will need to print these notes out (with the inking of course). As such, this
 becomes a very troublesome issue for me.&nbsp;By default, Microsoft Office OneNote 2013 attempts to automatically fit the contents of your OneNote page onto a single printed page. As such i have no choice but to do a "re-route" back to the 2013 onenote just to
 print.</p>
<p>Also, i have no idea/cant find a way to access the print preview one SP3 Onenote (Unlike Onenote2013, there is no "file" header to select print preview). Plus the "blown out of portion" printing, I have no way to print properly using SP3 OneNote, without
 having all the ppt/word files printed across a few pieces of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I believed someone has raised this issue before but right now, by default, when the top button of the SP3 pen is clicked twice, the screen will be clipped into a new page of notes. This is pretty troublesome as i have to copy and paste the file into my
 original worksheet again on SP3 OneNote.</p>
<p>3. the adhesive of the pen holder doesnt last. Despite careful usage, it havent been a month and my holder drop off already :( i have requested from the support store and they are shipping one over to me soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, compared to OneNote 2013, SP3 Onenote is better in many ways. Also i stuck to SP3 Onenote because of the user experience. The full screen for writing, the hovering-pen options and all makes SP3's OneNote awesome. However, if there's anyway i
 can get around the printing issue please let me know! I have lots of imported lecture notes in SP3 Onenote but i cant print them out properly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ctee<br />
An Avid SP3 OneNote user</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I just mange to get the Tech support to fix my wifi....on 09/10/2014, my wifi slowed down drastically and on 10/10/2014 SP3 suddenly cant detect the driver. I took an hour to get it fix from the ppl via tech support but i hope the windows team can solve
 the problem soon&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have noticed when you select the printer in SP3 Onenote a thumbnail view is displayed which is a form of print preview that shows what the page will look like printed.
</p>
<p>It would be nice if you could display a page break preview like in Excel.</p>
<p>I wish I had a SP3 with OneNote back when I was in College. </p>

</p><p>I have an issue of printing my hand written notes in OneNote. Apparently it doesn't fit the margin of my papers. They all came out missing pieces and continue 1-2 words on the next page. I was wondering how can I print my hand written notes properly? Like
 it all fit in one page!</p>

<h2>            &#34;not enough memory&#34; error message when using Corel&#39;s Sidekick Calendar program</h2>
                    I have been using Corel's "Sidekick" calendar program on '98, XP, and now Windows 7.&nbsp; Up until two weeks ago, it worked just fine.&nbsp; It is part of the Word Perfect 7 program, originally written for Windows95.&nbsp; Just recently, I have been unable to open the
 program because it gives me the message "not enough memory".&nbsp; I have run the computer's memory checking program and it passed with flying colors.&nbsp; I have tried stopping memory using processes and still I get "not enough memory", even though the resource center
 indicates that I am only using 43% of a 4gb memory pool. Could a Windows 7 automatic update have caused this abberation?

            <p>I remember that program. It shipped with Corel WordPerfect 7 Office Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'not enough memory' doesn't apply to RAM installed. You get the message because the memory addresses used by the program are in conflict with what Windows is using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with many of the older programs is that they were written&nbsp;badly. In an attempt to make programs run better, there was a tendency to use memory addresses that shouldn't have been&nbsp;used.&nbsp;The premis was that the memory addresses would most probably
 not be&nbsp;used by the majority of users because&nbsp;the stuff normally using the addresses would be beyond the average user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such was computer life in the days of Windows 9x. As Microsoft tighten up&nbsp;on OS integrity, and they have been since the introduction of XP, the once 'virtually free' memory addresses have become inaccessible to whatever 3rd party software authors were unofficially
 using.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now you have a choice. Do you keep the program to which you have become attached over the years, or&nbsp;accept the Windows updates which at the end of the day keep your computer and OS more secure?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find out which update caused the issue, you will have to uninstall the latest updates one by one until the 'error' corrects itself, then re-install all of the other updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I would look for another program and keep Windows 7 integrity intact. I stopped using Sidekick at the same time as WordPerfect 7. It wouldn't integrate with anything, and WP7 was not compatible with XP. I archived the CD, reverted back to Lotus
 Organiser (another PIM which didn't integrate with anything either), until I started using MS Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Remote Procedure Call Failed when opening Photos after resetting windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone has some fresh news on this error and can help me out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a reset a week ago as my laptop was sluggish and I couldn't uninstall a "UniBlue PC mechnic" program that kept on popping up and annoying me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the reset my laptop has been performing better until I tried to open a photo. I haven't been able to open the photos app (or the app store and possibly other apps/files) because of a "Remote Procedure Call Failed" error. With the photos I i get a black
 screen that use to display the photos for a few seconds then the error message which I can only hit "OK"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending hours trying different solutions from different forums I have had no luck with the photo app. I did get my videos playing by defaulting back to windows media player and some have suggested re-installing windows photo viewer but I am concerned
 about loosing my photos?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I have same problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I tried to run troubleshooter. Get message: You need a microsoft account to sync your settings.&nbsp; I have an MS account. I am logged in to this web site. Do i need to be logged into Windows Store Apps?
</p>
<p>I ran powershell to remove the existing Photo app. The removal failed.</p>
<p>I set the Remote Procedure call locator to Automatic. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't understand why none of the suggestions work.</p>

            <p>Thanks for you reply.</p>
<p>I had tried all three of your suggestions. Results negative. I also tried someones suggestion to use Powershell to remove the program.&nbsp; Powershell could not remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, in trying to resolve a problem with Resetting Plan Defaults for Power Options a community helper suggested creating a new account to see if the problem went away. I created the new account with negative results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it was after that the I noticed Photo viewer did not work.&nbsp; I tried to run troubleshooter from Store App.&nbsp; That's when I noticed that store app icon did not work. Also, Groove music does not work.&nbsp; I think this happened as a result of creating an
 new account because i read on the community web site some else having same issue as a result of creating new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way I have not read, on this web site of anyone finding a solution to these issues.</p>
<p>So, I have loaded a third party photo app and it works.&nbsp; I think I have fixed the Sleep mode issue too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless/until you have a sure fix or MS comes out with an update that fixes issues, I will work around them.&nbsp; I do appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you will note in message from PD above post. He suggested that I try putting the call locator in automatic. It was in manual. That suggestion did not help. Please see my reply to PD.</p>
<p>I did return the call locator service to manual as you suggested.&nbsp; It does not resolve issue either.
</p>
<p>I do not log in to Windows when I start my PC and I do not use Windows cloud. This may be part of the reason the troubleshooter app does not work.</p>

<p>If you have a dell all in one computer, check out the answer from Joe Gruber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos-winpc/win-10-photos-app-remote-procedure-call-failed/2bab109d-4eef-4270-a7d1-1cc5874dd5e9</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem with many of the Microsoft store programs (video and photos). I tried all the solutions, but nothing worked. I got really fed up when Windows Defender would not stay open. Then I tried this solution from Joe Gruber (reinstall drivers for
 Nvidia graphics). They all work perfectly now.</p>
