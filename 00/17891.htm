<h2>            Changes to context menu Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>A recent update to Word 2016 caused changes to the right click menu for tables. A previously available menu option permitted distributing columns evenly and now it's gone. Is there any way to replace it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;There is no User Interface for customizing the Ribbon, the Quick Access Toolbar or contextual menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you use the ☺︎ @ the right end of the Ribbon to register your preference with the design team. Perhaps the Distribute commands will be added back if there is enough demand. In the meanwhile, those options are available in both the Table menu
 as well as the Table Design&gt; Layout contextual tab on the Ribbon.</p>

<h2>            So...mail merge now doesn&#39;t work in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a new PC running Windows 10. I purchased Office 2016 to go along with it. I went to use mail merge from a data source that I had successfully used with previous versions of Word. For some reason, Word 2016 won't read the data.&nbsp; 2013 had
 no problem with it and imported everything just fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It correctly reads the fields, but won't read the records. I am sort of scratching my head at this one now. I have confirmed (several times) that the data source has not been altered from the previous format. The letter format used has not been altered either.
 The only difference is the new version of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone experience anything similar? Anyone have any ideas? Is there something I am missing?</p>

            Go to File&gt;Options&gt;Advanced and scroll down to the General section of the dialog and then check the box for "Confirm file format conversion on open".&nbsp; Then when you attach the data source, you will receive a couple of prompts and in the second one, you
 will need to specify the delimiter character that is used in the data source.&nbsp; If you specify the correct character, the records will be read.

<p><span>Hi Turbo,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you said when your client first logs into windows, his outlook disconnect from Exchange Server, may I know if you mean that the outlook client is not showing “Connected to Microsoft Exchange at the bottom of the outlook like this ( my picture is
 showing connected to Exchange)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3113e7c-c858-4340-b4d4-371a9a78a24b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3113e7c-c858-4340-b4d4-371a9a78a24b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If his outlook client is showing disconnected at the bottom of outlook, please recommend your client to close and restart his outlook client then see if the issue disappears. Moreover, may I know, when he first logs into windows, the network of his
 computer is working fine? Maybe his network has been disconnected when he logs into windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On another hand, given his network maybe work when he logs into windows, if he is using office 365 account, please try to download and run

</p><p><span>If my suggestions above don’t work, I’d like to collect some other information for further investigation:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If other people have the same issue as your client now?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Please tell me the version of the outlook client which your client is using now, he can go to File &gt; Office Account then take a full screenshot about it and share with me.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What types account that your client is using in the outlook<span>&nbsp;
</span>and how does he configured his email account to outlook client? </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>May I know if your client is using Sign out of his windows not making his computer to sleep? If he just keep his computer sleeping, does it can make any difference?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hey Oliver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the original poster, but I'm having the same issue, hopefully I can provide a bit more information to help resolve this thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. We are have two of our users experiencing this issue, they are both running Windows 7 and Office 365, both have been pulled up to the latest updates regularly while trying to diagnose this issue.</p>
<p>2. Office 365 ProPlus v1811 b11029.20079 click-to-run, monthly channel.</p>
<p>3. The only accounts added to Outlook is our Office 365 account using Exchange Online. We do use ADFS for account synchronisation, we don't have any on-prem Exchange.</p>
<p>4. See below, this requires a bit longer explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We leave our computers on 24/7 so we can run various overnight processes, updates, scans, monitoring, etc. This issue occurs if the users leave their computer on overight, if they turn their computer off they don't have any issues. When they hop onto their
 computer in the morning Outlook might be opened or closed (depending on the night before) and it will show&nbsp;<em>This folder was last updated on x/xx/xxxx. Trying to connect...</em> and will prompt for a password, entering the correct password will just bring
 up the prompt again to enter the password again, see screenshot below. If we restart the computer, everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2a5614b-1363-4f5b-9924-7dd55d1b4622?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2a5614b-1363-4f5b-9924-7dd55d1b4622?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If we close and reopen Outlook it makes no difference. If we attempt to create a new Outlook profile, it won't create a new one because it can't connect to 365. The computer is fully online, we use a remote management tool to connect to the computers which
 uses the internet, and the computers in question don't get internet dropouts unless restarted/turned off. All DNS queries work without failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OWA works fine when Outlook is in this situation, so the computer can definitely contact at least part of O365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365, after going through the appropriate steps on the computer in question it just came up with&nbsp;<em>Contact your Office 365 administrator. We're sorry we couldn't fix your problem with Outlook.
 It's time to contact your Office 365 administrator for help. Give the detailed results to your administrator. This may save time and help to solve your problem more quickly.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be great!</p>

<p>Hi Damiankw,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you can <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">go to Control Panel &gt; Credential Manager, then locate the set of credentials that has Outlook in the name, clear those credentials. check if the issue persists. You can find more details in the
 following link:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2762344/outlook-continues-to-prompt-for-credentials-after-your-domain-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2762344/outlook-continues-to-prompt-for-credentials-after-your-domain-password</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the original poster has solved the issue by reinstall and creating a new profile, you can follow the link below and have an online repair to see if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, you mentioned that it won't create a new profile because it can't connect to 365, could you please provide more details about it? You can try to reboot your PC and check it again. If you still cannot create a new profile, may I know if there is
 any error message?&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>MalwareBytes is a great secondary virus software to use as an occasional scan for little things Defender does not find.</p>

<h2>            RSS Feeds.</h2>
                    <p>Have always used RSS Feeds but on clicking any RSS feed to subscribe I get the message "This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it". &nbsp;The document tree is shown with it. I am on Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure but I believe this started happening before Windows 10. Am no expert in any sense of the word, so is there a real simple and easy method to get around this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question. Why can't Favorites/Bookmarks be alphabetically sorted as the default? &nbsp;And how can I start at the last entry in Favorites instead of scrolling to end?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>To assist you better, I would like to ask if the issue with RSS Feeds occur for all websites or a particular website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that there is no option to sort the favorites in Microsoft Edge. But, we can arrange the favorites as per out priority. To do so, drag and drop the favorites in the ‘favorites bar’ to the desired position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any suggestions or feedback, please use the Feedback App. </p>

            <p>I've got the same problem. I can't open or save PDFs since my "upgrade". (I haven't had other attachments to try - just PDFs.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearing the cache, installing silverlight, going https only, Active view - nothing works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> work? Two things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Firefox. This works. But surely Microsoft Outlook should work with Microsoft Internet Explorer!!!</p>
<p>(2) Accessing my Hotmail on a different computer - ie, not the one I was on when I "upgraded" from Hotmail to Outlook.
<em>That </em>works. No idea why.</p>

    <title>MS Office cannot get KMS license - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ehjay111  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Office cannot get KMS license</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am preparing to upgrade our network to WIN 10. I am having issues getting MS Office 2013 to install the KMS license. The following is the error I get when I first try to run an Office application after the initial install of Office Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MS Office Professional Plus 2013 configuration did not complete successfully.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MS Office cannot find your license for this application. A repair attempt was unsuccessful or was cancelled. MS Office will now exit.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely a Computer GPO issue (not a user GPO issue), as I have removed all Computer GPO's and the license was installed without issue. I have tried changing numerous computer policies with no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this issue, and may be able to point me in the right direction?</p>

            Thanks Ed_22 for the quick reply,but the issue is with GPO's for MS Office. When I disable the computer GPO;s in GPO management the issue with KMS licensing goes away,but if I re-enable the GPO and reinstall MS Office the issue with KMS licensing comes
 back. Any ideas?

            Have you play with the GPO, there must be one that is triggering the issue. No sure since i have no seen this problem before, have you reach to Microsoft support.

<h3> commodore 64 user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contact Xbox Support not working</h2>
                    I have a load of issues and none of them are related to Xbox Music, but this is the only Xbox forum there is, so I'm trying here to, hopefully, get some sort of contact going.&nbsp; I am forced to do this as Xbox Chat support just ain't working and clicking
 on the 'contact xbox support', i.e. that which I should imagine would give an email address, ain't working either.<br />
<br />
Here's what's happening: I want to give you money and I can't.<br />
<br />
I have an Xbox associated account that has a region I can't change (three month rule) to match my billing address info.&nbsp; I just want to buy a Gold membership and can't do it.<br />
<br />
As this is sensitive stuff, I want to do it in as secure a fashion as possible, but I'm forced to post to a public forum to, hopefully, get some sort of private communication going to remedy this problem as, one, there are no topics that are related to this
 problem on Xbox.com and, two, the links listed above aren't working AT ALL.<br />
<br />
You're ruining my Sunday morning, so please get back to me with something that brightens my day and allows you to add my sixty bucks to your billions of dollars to enjoy some online magic with the ol' Xbox.<br />
<br />
Hugs and kisses,<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>To have them open in a readable view look in browser settings to disable "open in over view" . If already on a page double tap zooms in to a standard size, pitch to zoom can be used to fine tune if necessary.

    <title>Windows 5 Mobile PDA Smartphone will not use WiFi to Connect to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bennitojuarez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 5 Mobile PDA Smartphone will not use WiFi to Connect to Internet... it trys to use GSM &#40;phone&#41; connection</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've beed stumpped by this for weeks now. The Problem:</p>
<p>I'm Currently using a Cingular 8525 PDA Smartphone, and&nbsp;I am needing to use the internet connection at various hotspots and a wireless network here at work. I can log into our secure network fine and phone shows "connected to network". I have
 my Network card setting to connect to "work". I have even entered in the IP stack. I also show connections to open networks when I connect to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is whenever there's an available network, I am showing connected, but the phone tries to use the GSM connection (cellular phone data), reguardless whether the WLAN is on or not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked within the connection settings, and I have not been able to find anyhting to change this setting, "to use wifi whevenever available". I&nbsp;do not need to use a Data plan so I do not whan to use the GSM to connect at any time, and I
 have had previous&nbsp;PDA&nbsp;Smartphones, with earlier versions of Windows Mobile and never had any problems with using WiFi. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help with this would be greatly appreciatred</p>

            I am also looking for a program to override this function. However it seems that this is a WM5/WM6 default that can't be changed. The only way I have found to get around this is to turn on the flight mode to make the device only see the WiFi connection.
 Doesn't help much if you want to be able to recieve a call during that time.

<p>Bennito, when you go into Settings and click on Wi-Fi, where it says Networks to access, is it set to All Available?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the Network Adapters Tab, is that set to Work?&nbsp; and if you click on the IEEE 802.11b/g adapter, is that set to Use server assigned IP address?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And make sure&nbsp; on START/SETTINGS/Connections Tab and press the Connections icon then the Advanced tab that the Select Networks button is using Work on the drop down</p>

I'm also having this same problem with my Windows Mobile 6 Standard Smartphone (Non-Touchscreen). The Wifi connects, I get an IP address and everything looks good but when I try to access either local or internet resources it does so over GPRS and not WiFi.
 Does anyone have any suggestions for a workaround? Is there any way to force the phone to use Wifi, or change the priority so the device will use Wifi when it's available?

<p>have you changed the connection settings so where it says "connect to the internet via", it is using WORK rather than ISP</p>

<p>
</p><p>See if&nbsp;you have an update pending.&nbsp; Such obnoxious performance seems to be being imposed on us if we try to defer allowing them.&nbsp; E.g. it looks like they are giving us just enough performance to close everything down, not start anything up and not continue
 doing much of anything.&nbsp; However, I was able to get TM going at least.&nbsp; Have you tried Ctrl-Alt-Delete as a method of starting it?&nbsp; In spite of that you probably won't see what is causing the symptom.&nbsp; E.g. I already had ResMon open and it showed nothing really
 obvious that needed killing or modifying.&nbsp; I even went to the extent of Suspending all the iexplore.exe tasks and then Resuming only the so-called "chrome" ones but that only resulted in blank screens with a title bar to identify what would normally be running
 there.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

Merging the Duplicate Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items Folders
<p>The Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items folders cannot be moved from one PST to another. Instead, the items inside of each folder must be moved to the destination PST. Folders that exist in both PSTs can be moved to the other PST but the folders will be
 renamed. The following steps outline how to move the contents of these folders without creating new folders with different names. These steps are required when merging the Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items folders.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Steps:
<ol>
<li>Expand the subfolders in both sets of Personal Folders if they are not currently visible on the left view.</li><li>Open the Inbox of Mailbox1.pst so the messages are visible on the right. Mailbox1.pst should be the second set of personal folders listed in the view pane since it was added last.</li><li>Click on a single message in the Inbox of Mailbox1.pst.</li><li>Select all messages by pressing CTRL-A or choose Select All from the Edit menu. All messages should be highlighted.</li><li>Click on the list of messages and drag and drop the contents of Inbox on top of the destination Inbox (Mailbox.pst).</li><li>Verify that the messages were copied into the current PST by opening the Inbox on Mailbox.pst.</li><li>Repeat these steps for Sent Mail and Deleted Items and for any folder that exists in both PSTs.</li></ol>
<div>Merging Unique Folders</div>
<p>If a folder does not exist in both PST files, you can simply drag and drop a folder to move its contents. These steps may be useful when restoring from a backup if the new PST hasn't had the same folder names created yet. If the folder exists with the same
 name, see the steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand the subfolders in both sets of Personal Folders if they are not currently visible on the left view.</li><li>Choose a folder in Mailbox1.pst that you want moved to Mailbox.pst by single-clicking on the folder.</li><li>Drag the folder to the destination PST file and drop it on top of Personal Folders. Your set of folders may be named something else. The top level of the PST file is the destination for the drag and drop.</li><li>Repeat steps for each unique folder.</li></ol>
<p>Once you have completed these steps and have verified that the current PST is up to date with all of your messages, you can remove the second PST from your profile. The following steps outline this procedure. Note that the PST file is not deleted from the
 disk during this procedure. The reference for the file is only removed from the profile.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options, and then click the Services tab.</li><li>In The Following Information Services Are Set Up In This Profile box, click the second Personal Information Store, and then click the Delete button. If you need to confirm that this is the appropriate PST file, click Properties before Delete. In our example
 Mailbox1.pst should be the second PST.</li><li>Click the OK button until all open dialog boxes are closed. The PST is now removed from the active profile.</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>I added my outlook.com email address to yahoo, and it is syncing right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to outlook - mail - sync email - other email accounts and added the info for yahoo.&nbsp; After I hit ok, the yahoo email address isn't showing.&nbsp; I've done it several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other info it asks and the info I provided are:<br />

<p>Hi LA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; I followed your instructions exactly, including the Yahoo IMAP server settings.&nbsp; I hit ok at the end, but the account is still not listed.&nbsp; The steps I followed previously were the same as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to log out of outlook and tried many times, the yahoo account just doesn't show up under "manage your connected accounts."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged into my Yahoo account, and the outlook email address account is there, so Yahoo side is okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss :(</p>

            Dear Henry, 
<br />
<br />Try to add your Yahoo account using another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization and cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private (CTRL+SHIFT+P)
<br />
<br />Please also clarify if you have 2step verification enabled for Yahoo account ?

            Dear Henry, 
<br />
<br />In this case please try the following:
<br />1. If you have 3d party AV, please disable it and enable Defender (Windows 10)
<br />2. If you are using VPN or Proxy please disable them
<br />3. Reset your Network settings. To run these networking commands in a command prompt window:
<br />I. In the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.
<br />II. At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<br />Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.
<br />Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

<br />4. Open Microsoft Edge in Private and login here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/acco...</a> and try to add Yahoo account.
<br />
<br />If you have such option, please try to add account also when you will connect to another WiFi or to hotspot on your phone.

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have AV, and Windows Defender is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have VPN or Proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clearing all browser history each time, and tried multiple times in Edge and IE, both in private browsing mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried on different computers as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problem adding my Gmail accounts and they were super easy to do.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, Yahoo is not connecting.&nbsp; Perhaps Outlook does not allow it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also triple checked all typing, especially the password and IMAP server settings info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer not to reset my network settings, but I will give it one more try at another computer, perhaps at the library or other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely frustrating.&nbsp; I'm not sure why Gmail was super easy and Yahoo is not possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, thanks so much for your time and persistence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know you know the result.</p>

<br />I have checked with my Yahoo account and I was able to add it to my Hotmail account. 
<br />
<br />At this point I would suggest you contacting Outlook In-App support <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-get-outlook-com-support-f5482a98-616c-4d44-b7c5-8aaaadf5c11a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a> so they could look at this problem. They can investigate this further as they have the means and tools and are able to check your account and see why there may be an issue ( especially when you can connect your Gmail account )

                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I have Win 7, Excel 2007.</p>
<p>Trying to format column of numbers to retain leading zeroes.</p>
<p>I create and assign the custom format of 000000</p>
<p>but it won't stick - it shows Special again, not Custom.</p>
<p>The Special format shows a Type in (unreadable) with locale of Chinese (Simplified, PRC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is that a clue? </p>
<p>Are some settings elsewhere causing this format to stick?</p>

<p>That is a peculiarity of Excel. Since 000000 coincides with a special format for China, Excel displays it as such.</p>
<p>Similarly, the custom format 00000&nbsp;will be listed as US Zip Code, 0000 as Portuguese postal code, etc.</p>
<p>Although it looks weird, these custom formats will work as intended, so apart from the annoyance, it doesn't matter.</p>

    <title>E61i weird WLAN behaviour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mafitzpatrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            E61i weird WLAN behaviour</h2>
                    I recently updated the firmware on the E61i and have noticed a few quirks with the WLAN behaviour.<br />
<br />
I'm using the phone in a university where there are a lot of WiFi access points dotted around with the same names. The phone is setup to access email accounts via IMAP at regular intervals, using a Access Point Group setup.<br />
<br />
I always have WLAN Scanning on for that purpose.<br />
<br />
This all works fine (and it checks the email regularly), but when it does, it adds a dummy WLAN access point to the scan list. If I click on the 'Search for WLAN' option while it's connected to the email server the list will for example contain two access points
 one called 'University' which is defined (and has the blue circle next to it), but another also named 'University' without a blue symbol.<br />
<br />
It might sound like a cosmetic thing, but since this 'dummy' access point appears first in the list it causes problems using the WLAN at the same time. If I click on 'Continue Web Browsing' the phone gets confused and asks me to define an access point: despite
 being connected to one and asking to use it!<br />
<br />
Other applications seem to be a bit confused by it, but it's not as clear cut as the example above. I can reproduce it by using 'Search for WLAN' (no duplicate) then opening the mail app and forcing connection and again trying 'Search for WLAN' (instant broken
 duplicate).<br />
<br />
Very odd - and didn't happen on previous firmware.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen this or know a fix?

            Just a quick update: this behaviour happens on other WLAN networks even where this only one access point. Connecting to email creates duplicate dummy entries in the WLAN search list.<br />
<br />
Attempting to connect via the dummy entries gets an 'already connected' error. Unfortunately there is no way to tell the dummy from the real (although it always shows max connection strength).<br />
<br />
Very, very, odd.

<h2>            Userforms and VBA code to populate address in a Word document</h2>
                    Hi there, I work on a lot of precedent documents which are used by numerous employees in a nationwide firm.&nbsp; On the template from which these precedents have been created, there is an option on the front page to populate the user's office location - this
 works first off on the precedent, i.e. it captures my office location as I create the precedents, but when these precedents are then used to create personal documents for people in other locations, the bookmarks do not update, so I was thinking of removing
 the bookmarks and adding a Userform (with maybe a macro button?!) so the user can select their office location and it will then be placed in the correct place in the document.<br />
<br />
All sounds good, but I haven't got a clue how to do it ... I've seen and used macros a lot in the past, and I've come across a couple of documents that have these Macro buttons which were you click on it, you can fill in the details which are then put into
 the document, but that's as far as it goes - using VBA terrifies me - it looks so confusing, and as to the coding ...&nbsp; help!!!<br />
<br />
So could someone please give me, very easy to follow, step by step instructions on how to create a list of different addresses whereby one can be selected and added at the correct place in the document.
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

    <title>How to amend a crosstab query to get a bottom row containing column - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to amend a crosstab query to get a bottom row containing column totals</h2>
                    <p>Following some cryptic advice seen on the internet I have approached this problem as follows, but the SQL code will not save. I am using Access 2007.</p>
<p>I successfully created a Crosstab query to generate a normal crosstab table of results, in my case Spending, by category, for one year, giving the year total and the amounts in each month.</p>
<p>I also successfully created a SELECT query to generate the extra row that I want on the Crosstab table. This query produced one row labelled 'All Categories' and showing the grand total spend for the year and for each of the twelve months.</p>
<p>Then I tried to get my augmented Crosstab table by stitching these two queries together in one new query, using the UNION command.</p>
<p>The trouble is that the SQL code will not save - presumably that means it fails to compile. I get the error message "Syntax error in TRANSFORM command".</p>
<p>My SQL code is as follows:</p>
<p>PARAMETERS [spendyear?] Short, [Account?] Text ( 255 );<br />
TRANSFORM Sum(SpendPeriods.Spend) AS SumOfSpend<br />
SELECT SpendPeriods.Category, Sum(SpendPeriods.Spend) AS [Total Of Spend]<br />
FROM SpendPeriods INNER JOIN MonthIDs ON SpendPeriods.SpendMonth = MonthIDs.MonthNo<br />
WHERE (((SpendPeriods.SpendYear)=[SpendYear?]) AND ((SpendPeriods.Account)=[Account?]))<br />
GROUP BY SpendPeriods.Category, SpendPeriods.Account, SpendPeriods.SpendYear<br />
ORDER BY MonthIDs.MonthName<br />
PIVOT MonthIDs.MonthName In ("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oct", "Nov",
</p>
<p>"Dec")<br />
UNION<br />
SELECT "All Categories" AS Category, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods) AS YearTotal, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=1) AS Jan, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=2) AS Feb, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=3) AS Mar, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=4) AS Apr, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=5) AS May, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=6) AS Jun, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=7) AS Jul, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=8) AS Aug, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=9) AS Sep, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=10) AS Oct, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=11) AS Nov, <br />
(SELECT Sum(Spend) FROM SpendPeriods WHERE SpendPeriods.SpendMonth=12) AS Dec<br />
FROM SpendPeriods<br />
WHERE (((SpendPeriods.SpendYear)=[SpendYear?]) AND ((SpendPeriods.Account)=[Account?]))<br />
GROUP BY "All Categories";</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to recap, a query containing the code block above UNION runs OK. A query containing the code block below UNION, with the PARAMETERS statement added in, also runs OK.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me what the problem is. Is it a syntax problem, or something else?</p>

            I'd do the totals in a report based on the crosstab query myself, but you could try a couple of things to see if makes any difference with the query:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Use a UNION ALL operation.&nbsp; A UNION operation suppresses duplicate rows, which in this case can never arise due to the use of the constant 'All Categories' as the first column.&nbsp; A UNION ALL operation is far more efficient and should always be used unless
 duplicate rows need to be suppressed.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Rather than using subqueries conditionally aggregate the spend values.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT "All Categories",<br />
SUM(Spend*IIF(SpendMonth=1,1,0)),<br />
SUM(Spend*IIF(SpendMonth=2,1,0)),<br />
.....and so on<br />
FROM SpendPeriods<br />
WHERE SpendYear=[SpendYear?] AND Account=[Account?];<br />
<br />
Note that you do not have to give the columns names in the second part of a UNION or UNION ALL operation.&nbsp; Nor do you need to GROUP BY the constant "All Categories".<br />

    <title>Account temporarily suspended - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account temporarily suspended</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop with Windows 10 OS was stolen on 01/16/2018. On the same day, for my safety, I changed my password using my Android devide. On the next days, I continued using my device and the laptop of my mother in order to access my account.<br />
<br />
I had the backup of all my important files in my OneDrive account. In 20/01/2018 I shared all my files (approximately 65 gb) to another account of mine in order to duplicate these files since they were really important to me and I couldn't lost them, it would
 be such a loss in my life.<br />
<br />
On the day 01/22/2018 my Office 365 Personal subscription has ended. I had plans to renew my subscription on this day. However, when I tried to access it I received a warning saying that my account was temporarily suspended. When I have contacted MS, I received
 an email informing that I have violated the Terms of Use and they couldn't be more specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Hi,</p>
<br />
We evaluated your appeal and verified your account was properly closed for a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/default.aspx#3_codeOfConduct .<br />
<br />
Pursuant to our terms, we cannot reactivate your account, nor provide details as to why it was closed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This represents Microsoft’s final communication regarding this account."
<p>
</p><p>I beg you. I had the only copy of my thesis in my OneDrive account (at the folder Engenharia&gt;LABMETRO) and all my photos of my last 3 years, since when I had a Lumia 930 mobile.<br />
<br />
If you can't recover my account, please, just give me permission to access my files temporarily so I can download them. I had a big loss with my stolen laptop so please, is not fair preventing from access my files. Consider that possibly someone had access
 to my account, because my laptop was stolen. I have never received any warning about my files in OneDrive, it's not fair that you forbid me to access this account. If you really think some file has violated your terms, please just delete it. I'm pretty sure
 I did nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
Without these files my life is completely ruined.</p>
