    <title>Question about scaling enemies in Old World Blues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Question about scaling enemies in Old World Blues</h2>
                    
<p>I read online that although the recommended level for doing Old World Blues is 15, it is suggested that you get closer to 30 when you start.&nbsp; It also said that if you're over level 40, you can have an even MORE difficult time due to enemy scaling.&nbsp; Does
 this mean that doing the content somewhere around the low to mid 30's is ideal?<br />
<br />
I'm around level 17 of my third playthrough, specializing in Explosives and Melee.&nbsp; Lots of strength and endurance.&nbsp; Just wondering when would be a good time to dive in.&nbsp; It's the only one of the four I haven't done yet (although I plan on doing Lonesome Road
 again, since my first run was kind of rushed and incomplete).&nbsp; Which one of these should be done first?&nbsp; I like playing on Very Hard, but I'm not on Hardcore.</p>

    <title>Files open slowly over the VPN connection. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> plugsheffield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files open slowly over the VPN connection.</h2>
                    When I connect to the vpn and browse to the file (word, excel, images) and open it the windows application opens instantly but then hangs for 30 sec to sometimes a couple of minutes.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However if I copy the files to the desktop, copying takes a meer second or two and can be opened pretty much instantly, which suggests to me it's not a network speed issues, but something else which is causing the applications to hang.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem occurs on Windows XP Professional Using Office 20003 and Windows 7 using Office 2007.</div>

<h2>            Will Updates Destroy My Computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I never post to these things. I'm not an expert computer builder or anything. I just need some practical advice. I just got my laptop back from a computer repair store. I had to pay $160 for a new hard-drive because apparently some windows updates corrupted
 my old one. My laptop is an HP Intel that came with windows 8.1. I hated 8.1, but I&nbsp;used it for a couple months.&nbsp;I&nbsp; couldn't wait to get my free windows 10 update. So I updated and everything was great, until about a month&nbsp;later some automatic updates installed
 and destroyed my computer.&nbsp; Upon start-up it loaded a whole diagnosing and repairing message, then took me to a blue menu with options to try and reset it.&nbsp; I tried several times to reset it myself, each time I got an error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have literally just gotten&nbsp;my laptop back and it's windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the windows updates it says it has like 5 to install already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my question is basically: do I install these updates before I upgrade to windows 10 again? Should I even upgrade to windows 10 at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't even had this laptop for a year. I don't want to have to pay to get another new hard-drive every time I try to&nbsp;update my computer.</p>

            Whatever you were told, it is somewhere between very difficult&nbsp;and impossible for updates to corrupt your hard drive in any way that would require the hard drive to be replaced.&nbsp; Some hard drives last for years and some wear-out very quickly.&nbsp; Hard drives
 can be damaged by a sudden shock, if the laptop was dropped, for example and particularly if the hard drive was running when it happened.&nbsp; An update that caused your computer to crash completely (without even a blue screen error message) so that the hard drive
 suddenly lost power whilst running might just do it but it would be very hard to create software to do that even if you were trying.

            Yes, Microsoft updates will kill your computer. Yes, Microsoft updates will kill your files. Yes, Microsoft updates will stop you from accessing certain files. I can guarantee this. I have gone through all of it with Microsoft. Then they will deny they
 did it so they won't have to pay for it or fix it. Just like when you go through their help files how they always blame the consumers for their computer problems when it is their problems I have been using Windows since it was DOS.&nbsp; Microsoft will deny they
 did any of their malfunctions and depend on others on the internet to fix their problems. People have abandoned Microsoft and are tried of fixing their mistakes. So, right now you are on you own if something stops working. It is a attitude of screw you. We
 don't know your name. So, since Microsoft has decided you can't have control over your updates we really need a new system that lets us control our own computers. Linux or Chrome might be a good choice. Apple has the same problem. They

            I have already done those steps. I just did them again to make sure and they did not help. The link did not help because I do not have Bluetooth in my device manager, I even showed hidden devices. Do I need to reinstall the driver from somewhere? I have
 no Idea, but thank you for the reply and any more help you may give me.

You don't install or reinstall data files.&nbsp; You simply copy and paste the files from windows.old to the destination of your choice.

<h2>            Media Creation Tool doesnt work</h2>
                    After wasting several hours in ReserveWin10.cmd prompt, I tried today to download Media Creation Tool and make it Run in my Windows 8.1 Pro HP Desktop. It Asked whether I want to install it now or make a Installation disk, I selected
<em>Install Now</em>, the next. Then it says <em>Something Happened</em>. What does it mean? What should I do?

            <p>Hi Sunil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure that you have installed all the latest Windows&nbsp;updates before you&nbsp;start the upgrade process. if you have already installed all the latest updates and yet face this issue, then I would recommend you to choose the option to create an ISO file
 from the&nbsp;media creation tool and then perform an upgrade with the ISO.&nbsp;Choose the second option to create a media in the tool.&nbsp;You would be asked if you want to&nbsp;create a bootable USB media or create an ISO file. Choose the option to create an ISO file. Once
 the download completes,&nbsp;open the ISO file in the File Explorer, double click on the setup.exe file to launch the upgrade process.&nbsp;Try these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>

            Yep the same thing here I even cleaned all the un-necessary files out and tried it again and the tool just started and then quit&nbsp; , before I would get the&nbsp; "Something Happened"&nbsp;??!!&nbsp; The &nbsp;ISO setup is still asking me for a product key which I don't have
 and doesn't give me the option to skip it . Thing is I already installed Windows 10 on my laptop using this same method and no problems&nbsp; just desk top will not install . contacted Tech help but not resolved&nbsp; told to wait till they downloaded Win 10 to my computer
 and install it then .

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The three options essentially reset the entire Windows Store app to its 'factory' version. If you're still receiving the same error message, this could suggest an issue with the image of your Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have three more solutions we can try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, ensure you're on the latest version of Windows. Click <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4000825/windows-10-windows-server-2016-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> for a comprehensive list of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new account on Windows 10</a></strong>
 to test if the problem is specific to your user account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Last, since you already ran SFC, but the you're still experiencing the issue, we should run
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">DISM</a></strong>. You will find most, if not all, of the information you need in the
 links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still unable to make any positive progress, let us know and we'll continue helping.

            Thanks NJ,<br />
I read the article, and looked in my Administrative Tools for Local Security policy, but could not find it. Also, I have no idea what "Everyone group" means or refers to.<br />
<br />
I created passwords for the two available user accounts on this computer. The Guest account is turned off.<br />
Shortly after starting the computer tonight, there was another Anonymous Logon.<br />
<br />
Do Anonymous Logons mean this computer is being spied on?<br />

<h3> stevespinella  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;didn&#39;t detect a second display&#34; HDMI Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I see many other postings with this problem, with various answers that do not address it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the laptop does not detect the external display, there is no way to fix the problem. Sometimes the second display works, but when it doesn't, I seem to be helpless. There have been times when closing the laptop and reopening it has caused it to detect
 the second display. The second display goes into power saving mode when it doesn't get a signal from the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the latest driver, no help. I have browsed all the discussion boards that reference this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This laptop, like most, runs the Intel HD graphics driver and chipset. It is a 4 gen Intel chip set.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to&nbsp;provide the assistance you required to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Other than&nbsp;installing drivers, have to&nbsp;tried&nbsp;performing other troubleshooting steps?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried installing in Compatibility mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you are facing might be due to your graphic&nbsp;adapter. I suggest that you uninstall the driver completely from your computer and install drivers for Windows 7 or 8/8.1 and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not tried installing the drivers in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>, you can do the same by referring to the article by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> provided in the link below</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delayed and the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the above suggestion did not help, I suggest that you place your PC&nbsp;in Clean Boot as the issue may be due to a third party conflict.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To learn how to troubleshoot
 in Clean Boot click on the link below</p>

</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer:
</strong></span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also
 troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean
 boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps. </p>

<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>“ How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Problems that recur but don't always happen are always the hardest to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a microsoft forum so it is easy to blame problems which involve hardware and drivers on "incompatibilities" between the software and hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately of course, you are right, Vanessa, in assuming that the problem must involve drivers. We know this because a) the problem does not always occur on every machine, and</p>
<p>b) it is a "handshake" question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, there are times when the software is not recognizing the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically, once the software has decided the hardware is not present (second monitor), it is confident in this decision and there is no provision the user can activate to get the software to reconsider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is exactly where it becomes a Windows 10 (and prior) problem. The hardware knows it is connected. We know this because the monitor recognizes the hdmi connection, comes out of low energy mode, and tries to connect. The only place to communicate
 with this hardware is in Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now certainly Intel may be able to fix this by updating the driver. Maybe that's the right place to fix it, but as a user I need to know this message is getting through. Reading the forums, this is not at all clear. And Win 10 has been out a good while now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 however has decided that there is not an hdmi connection. This may have been true in the past. I took the laptop out of the office, ran it without a second monitor, and Win 10 got that change! The laptop became the primary screen, and we are thankful
 for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, however, I return to the office. The laptop seems to check for the second monitor when it is closed and I open it with the monitor connected, but it doesn't always. Once it has become confident there is no second monitor, it will not recheck. (Software
 has confidence, not hardware, by the way, since hardware only senses, it doesn't decide.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is true that I could uninstall the driver. When I reinstall it, Win 10 will forget what it previously concluded and it will check again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT REINSTALLING THE DRIVER EVERY TIME THIS INTERMITTENT PROBLEM RECURS IS NO SOLUTION. Win 10 needs a way to recognize consistently changes in hdmi connections no matter whether they happen once or daily or even hourly, say when a teacher moves from class
 to class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether this happens in the Intel graphics driver or in Win 10, there is no question they go together and it is an UNRESOLVED problem that appears on this and many other forums. If anyone is aware of a solution or workaround, OTHER THAN REINSTALLING THE
 LATEST DRIVER THAT IS THE MOST COMMON DRIVER USED WITH WIN 10, they can help me and every one who faces this failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, NOT USING THE INTEL DRIVER is no solution. Win 10 needs to run on its most common hardware configuration, and consistently supporting changes in the presence of a second screen is an excellent thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One workaround I have discovered this week: Buy a second monitor. As long as I ALWAYS have a second monitor connected, whether at home or the office, Win 10 seems not to be confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, rebooting does not consistently solve the problem when it occurs.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>My laptop is running Windows 10, it hasn't been updated recently. In the morning I was connected to my home wifi, at university it connects to the wifi/hotspot from my phone but I get an error saying "no internet, secured". On doing a diagnosis/troubleshoot

<h2>            making a xbox live account for first time</h2>
                    I'm not sure where this goes (sorry if I'm in the wrong place) but i was going put it in ambassador forum but it more in this direction of account managing..i had a question being asked to me and i feel i need to post the chat for people to understand
 the view better and give their thoughts to help me better.. <br />
(person)Just bought my kids a 360 and wanted to load netflix on it, but do I really have to pay for an xbox live account to do that? I can't find a free account option (without gaming)<br />
Congratulations, you have been connected! <br />
<br />
(me)hi, u dont need to pay for a gold live account to use netflix they made it free for sliver user, all u need is a netflix account and ur good
<br />
<br />
(person)but i have to sign up for an account to download right? It keeps asking me for a credit card....
<br />
<br />
(me)have u made a live account ? and it keep asking you for a credit card ? not for netflix
<br />
<br />
(person)I have a microsoft account, but haven't signed up for the live yet, because I didn't want to put my cc in there. (Not for netflix, for Xbox Live)
<br />
<br />
(me)ah, ok, if u sign up on xbox live the first time, it wants to give u a free month of gold, that why it wants ur card, but u can choose not to add it, which will make u a sliver account user
<br />
<br />
(person)Oh, I didn't see that option. I will try again thank you for your help. <br />
<br />
(me)u can skip it by making it on xbox.com it make u sliver user with out asking for ur card
<br />
<br />
(person)thank you, we will see if I can fight through this, or maybe I'll make the kids do it, they can probably figure it out :)
<br />
<br />
(me)well we here for u, do u want me give u more info on how to make a live account ? it free
<br />
<br />
(person)yeah, i am on the website now, and it offers me the free trial, but it doesn't show the option to skip the payment. It wants me to sign up for a free month with Gold. I don't see the option to skip i am on xbox.com
<br />
<br />
(me)it shouldnt ask, unless u see no thanks <br />
<br />
(person)So on the top of the site, there is a "xbox live gold" option. If I click that, it takes me to a page that says "join today" this page shows three options, Free, 1 Month , and 12 month. I pick free and it takes me to a payment page
<br />
<br />
(me)you are in the wrong place, u click on gold that why <br />
<br />
(person)I don't see any other option <br />
<br />
(me)yea i saw that, im getting u info for it <br />
<br />
(person)thank you <br />
<br />
(me)ok..is your xbox on ? <br />
<br />
(person)no, i am at work, i thought i could do it here and then just sign on when i got home
<br />
<br />
(me)oh ok.. <br />
<br />
(person)If i have to wait til i get home to make it easier i can do that <br />
<br />
(me)here what u do, u havent made the live account yet by using ur email <br />
<br />
(person)no <br />
<br />
(me)ok, instead of clicking gold live...click on sign in <br />
<br />
(person)I am already signed in <br />
<br />
(me)ok..so u have made a gamer tag ? <br />
<br />
(person)yes <br />
<br />
(me)do nothing else..sign out of it and back in, u should be sliver, it shouldnt ask you, but if it does, jus download the profile on xbox it will skip it
<br />
<br />
(person)oh, well that was easy then :) Is there anywhere that it will say "silver"?
<br />
<br />
(me)no but to tell if ur sliver, u can click on my account or when ur on the xbox, ur gamertag wouldnt be orange (gold user color)
<br />
<br />
(person)Well I will try that when I get home. I really appreciate your help! <br />
<br />

<br />
(person)Thanks again, have a great day <br />

    <title>Display reverting back from external display to Surface Pro&#39;s own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diesel_x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display reverting back from external display to Surface Pro&#39;s own display shortly after Type Cover is closed.</h2>
                    <p>It's great being able to dock the Surface Pro 2017 on to the Surface Dock and connecting in the process to a large external display when one's not mobile and back&nbsp;at the desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there's a problem. When setting to display 'only' on a second/external display from the 'Project' setting&nbsp;and then close the 'Type Cover' keyboard so that it looks neater and&nbsp;does not get in the way&nbsp;thus creating more&nbsp;desk space as well as further
 protection for the SP's own&nbsp;screen when not in use, after several or more seconds (or anything up to 2 minutes)&nbsp;the external display suddenly goes blank/off, despite setting to project on external/2nd display only and despite setting the "Choose what closing
 the lid does" action to "Do nothing". Strangely when pulling the Type Cover back down soon after this problem has taken place,&nbsp;you see that for some reason&nbsp;the display had reverted on it's own accord back to the tablet's own screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not found a way to prevent this glitch and it seems a little bizarre that the Surface Pro 2017 is switching the display back to a screen that it knows is currently being covered-up by the Type Cover. Leaving the Type Cover down stops the glitch, but
 that should not be the only workaround option for the problem. Naturally I'm using a separate desktop keyboard and mouse&nbsp;when connected to the external display on my desk, so the Type Cover is not needed and despite the Surface Pro being put to one side/corner
 of the large desk (out of the way), the Type Cover would still unnecessarily take up desk space if left down and would be redundant while using desktop keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pro 2017 is connecting to the&nbsp;external display via Microsoft Surface Dock and then linked via Mini Display to HDMI cable that is channelling both video and sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would find it really helpful to correct this problem.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This behavior is by design. When you close and then reopen the lid on a laptop or Type cover on your Surface, the Connecting and Configuring Displays (CCD) feature in Windows automatically reverts the display mode to the last active selection.</p>

<span>This is not exactly true; after closing the lid, at no point is the lid then reopened 'before' the problem/fault occurs. Rather the issue is that the fault occurs roughly a minute or less after the lid
 has been closed only. The lid has NOT at any point been reopened before or when the fault occurs.

<span>Indeed had the scenario been completely different and I was also opening the lid as well 'before' the external display was being shut off a minute later, then it would be acceptable because the Windows
 system would then be assuming that you where switching to using the tablet instead of external monitor by action of uncovering the tablet's screen. But this is not what was explained and therefore not the case.</span></p>

<p>Leaving the Type Cover down stops the glitch, but that should not be the only workaround option for the problem.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds related to the problem that others are having with attached HDMI monitors, including myself (on a Surface 2 Pro with W10 CU).&nbsp; I don't have a screen cover and I can tell you that the PC Screen stays black when the HDMI monitor is no longer detected.&nbsp;
 My workaround involves starting Narrator (e.g. press Win+Ctrl+Enter) and use it to do whatever seems necessary to get the HDMI monitor detected again.&nbsp; What we really need is a way of forcing the video system to try again once it has decided that there is
 no longer a secondary screen to write to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, instead of lifting the cover, please try starting Narrator and "hear" what you can do with it to try to get your second monitor working again.&nbsp; I have some suggestions for possible commands but I want to see if you can find anything reliable to do it
 because so far what I have is hit or miss.&nbsp; In any case, as with others' workarounds involving disconnecting and reconnecting the hardware in various ways (which I think your lifting the lid may be an example of), I am sure that we should be able to devise
 some kind of software only workaround.&nbsp; My best idea hasn't even been tried yet because this symptom happens so rarely and because I am interested in exploring it further this way first.</p>

<p>Ok, for the time being I've settled for a temporary work around. Admittedly it's not ideal, but is a quick fix and may be one of the better options for the time being (time's something I struggle with as work consumes most of my time and is very difficult
 to put time aside for testing and trying out different solutions though it can be interesting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I have done for now is to simply select 'Extended' within the 'Project' display setting and then select the external monitor (usually Display 2 but can be confirmed by clicking Identify) and finally clicking the 'Make this my main display).&nbsp; You
 can now close the Type Cover/keyboard and Windows desktop then happily remains on the large external display as your main display and after several seconds or more the screen will go blank for a second and then continue to display normal. Furthermore you are
 free to even power-on/boot-up your Surface Pro (while still attached to external display) by pressing it's power button even with Type Cover still closed and it will boot up without any problem. Naturally it will be looking for your face to sign-in, but simply
 click the sign-in options to call up the key pad option for passcode entry and then your good to go. Closing the Type Cover does give you a brief notification on the second&nbsp;display that informs you "Rotation On".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before this is not an ideal fix. This is firstly because the Surface Pro is using more power unnecessarily as it will still be displaying an 'Extended' Windows desktop display to the Surface Pro's own screen (which is totally unused and wasted
 while the user is only requiring the external display for use). Secondly, some graphics resources &amp; power are being set aside and used for the wasted extended display. Thirdly, it's a bit tacky and unprofessional on Microsoft's side that this workaround is
 having to be used in the first place. That all aside, it does appear to work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but by no means least, I will have to keep an eye on the temperature and CPU activity. As I type this, I've noticed the fan on my Surface Pro i7 1TB 16GB (2017 model) is quite audible where normally I don't hear it. I've run the Task Manager and clicked
 on Performance to see that the CPU is clocking quite high at 3.8 to 3.9 GHz and at 50%. I do not know if this is anyway related to the display workaround, though it shouldn't be. Unless there's some other hidden background processes going on, the one's active
 as of this are "Service Host: DCOM Server Process Launcher (4) (4 sub processes are Background Tasks Infrastructure Service, DCOM Server Process Launcher, Power, System Events Broker" at approx. 19% CPU usage - next is "Cortana Background Task Host" in and
 out at between 10 and 15% - "Microsoft Windows Search Indexer" between 5 and 9% with several others lower between 1 and 6% .... I'm sure the problem is unrelated to the Type Cover work around because I've now had the Type Cover in down position for approx.
 15 minutes since hearing the fan &amp; seeing the Task Manager CPU active and the fan is still audible with CPU boosting high between 3.5 to 3.8 GHz at around 40 to 50% activity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now using this setup later in the day and&nbsp;the Surface Pro's fan is quite and temperature of unit seems fine. Must have been some background processes getting stuck earlier and is probably completely unrelated to&nbsp;my temporary&nbsp;workaround until Microsoft
 sort it out.</p>

<p>To be honest, I gave up on this problem. I could't fix it properly then and now I have a more pressing issue with my Surface Dock where the new additional problem is worse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When updating my Surface Dock to the latest firmware (using Microsoft's Surface Dock Updater software), it kills the audio to the externally connected display via the Dock's mini display port and according to Microsoft there's no way of rolling-back the
 firmware update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand why issues and problems take so long for Microsoft to resolve and sometimes never get resolved.</p>

<h3> justinbe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen DPC_Watchdog_Violation problem</h2>
                    I have been getting the blue screen with the error:&nbsp;DPC_Watchdog_Violation. I installed windows 8 on an Asus N53SV laptop just last week, but I have been encountering the blue screens (happened 3 times) in the past few days. I read up that you could see
 if there is a driver problem by checking the dump file, but I have no idea how to open it nor read it. I would like to keep my programs, files and apps intact, explaining why I didn't do a refresh.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure if it is the cause of the problem, but I recently installed the Office 2013 preview (which is nice). The bluescreens came around after the install.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the link of the .dmp via skydrive:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=65F5934C73BD2B8B!6048&amp;authkey=!AFIFt-1a1wtrFFk</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am quite interested in how this works and how to read a .dmp, as I would like to learn how to fix this myself if it happens again (I don't know if that is reccomended though).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: Already in the past 10 minutes from now, I had the blue screen again, twice. The computer would restart after the error, load up and after a couple of minutes the error would occur again. :(</div>

<p>2. Delete all tasks in C:\Windows\system32\Tasks folder</p>
<p>3. Then add tasks one by one.</p>
<p>I found that task under M:\Backup\Task backup\Microsoft\Windows\Media Center called mcupdate_scheduled makes the message appear. Since I do not care much for Media Center I simply did not restore this task</p>

<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />Explains how to remove the Power button on the Start screen.<br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>Do you dislike the Power button on the Start Screen?&nbsp; There is a way to remove it, although you do have to edit the Registry to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://hosch250.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image8.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fhosch250.files.wordpress.com%2f2014%2f05%2fimage_thumb8.png%3fw%3d839%26amp%3bh%3d473" height="473" width="839" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, open the Run command by pressing Windows-R, by searching from the Start screen, or by right-clicking the lower left corner of the screen and type “regedit” without the quotation marks, then press Enter or click OK.&nbsp; Navigate to “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell”,
 then right-click “ImmersiveShell” and create a new key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://hosch250.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fhosch250.files.wordpress.com%2f2014%2f05%2fimage_thumb9.png%3fw%3d711%26amp%3bh%3d390" height="335" width="611" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, name the key “Launcher”, without the quotation marks, then right-click in the right pane of the editor and create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://hosch250.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/image10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fhosch250.files.wordpress.com%2f2014%2f05%2fimage_thumb10.png%3fw%3d711%26amp%3bh%3d390" height="340" width="619" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, name this value as “Launcher_ShowPowerButtonOnStartScreen”, again without the quotation marks.&nbsp; When this key’s value is 0, the power button will be off the Start Screen.&nbsp; Set the value to 1 or delete the key to get the power button back.&nbsp; The computer
 must be rebooted for changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Extending task bar across multiple monitors is available for Windows 8 to Windows 10. This is somehow possible for Windows 7 if you're going to use a third party software. The settings and options to do that will not really show on your device. You might
 want to check for possible third party software at your own risk. </p>
<p>

            Hi kahill1918,
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows by using the Media Creation Tool, here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity, and another computer you can do this on. In one of the prompts, you select “Create installation media (USB drive...” or something to that effect, select your flash drive, and let it work its magic.
<br />
<br />If you have any questions about this process or need any further assistance, let me know and I’d be happy to help. Good luck.       
        </p>

            Hi kahill1918, a reset should take less than an hour,  that reset has stalled, press and hold the Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down . . .
<br />
<br />Then try starting the reset again
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            kahill1918,
<br />
<br />I understand, but usually a clean install also serves this purpose, it should be pursued should your computer not be able to perform a factory reset.
<br />
<br />Also, with a clean slate, you’ll start from a good Windows installation, or foundation if you will.
<br />
<br />I’d recommend the steps above if a reset doesn’t work. You also don’t need to worry about activation and finding your product key since you can just simply click “I don’t have a product key”, and chances are it’ll activate just fine. Hope this helps.

            Many thanks, I will give this and the other method tries.&nbsp; But it seems you are thinking I want to start with a clean slate.&nbsp; It is not so.&nbsp; I am throwing out the PC, so perhaps the easiest way would be to remove the hard drive from the case and then drill
 into it to destroy it?

<br />
<br />I got it, so in this case, you'll need to use the Media Creation Tool, and when you boot up from the USB flash drive and see the setup screen with the Windows logo, and options like language, edition, keyboard layout, you hit SHIFT + F10 together, and you should see a Command Prompt window.
<br />
<br />Enter the following: 
<br />
<br />format C: /P
<br />
<br />This will make you perform a secure format, which will wipe the hard drive totally clean. Performing a reset will wipe everything, but not as securely, and it will bring you back to a Windows installation, it's not as good as formatting your hard drive securely.

<br />
<br />If you need any further assistance on how to do this, let me know. Keep in mind it takes a while for it to perform a secure format.
