<h2>            0x80070490 trouble syncing Smartphone and Mobile Device Center</h2>
                    
<p><span>My problem is that when I sync my phone, a message pops up and says something to the effect of&nbsp;"You are&nbsp;unable
 to sync at this time.&nbsp;Please try again later."&nbsp;There is no error message or error number on my PC, but it does however say that the sync has failed.&nbsp; Now, when I look&nbsp;on my&nbsp;Smartphone’s active sync, it has the&nbsp;support code "0x80070490." &nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am able to
 connect the phone and transfer files to and from my computer.&nbsp; The only things not syncing are my personal files (notes, contacts, appointments, etc.).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here is what I am working with: <br />
-&nbsp; Samsung sch-i730 Smartphone <br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Vista (therefore using Windows Mobile Device Center)<br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook 2007<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Here are the steps I have taken:<br />
- Checked with Microsoft's database for answers<br />
-&nbsp; researched what others have done (and if I found anything I cannot do it because of differences in software)<br />
- delete partnership, uninstall device center and reinstall, delete smartphone out of device manager, soft reset, restart computer<br />
-&nbsp;Also, through my research of people who have had similar problems - I have found that a hard reset does not help the situation.
<br />
-&nbsp;I did find one thread that seemed to discuss a similar problem to what I have, which is here:

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The problems I have with the thread listed above is that first, the instructions for moving the calendar is for
 outlook 2002, not 2007.&nbsp; When I searched for instructions on how to do it on 2007, I came up empty handed.&nbsp; And the second reason is I had installed outlook 2002 about a week ago (using an old CD of mine).&nbsp; I tried syncing it and that is when I first encountered
 the problem.&nbsp; I bought Microsoft office 2007 (because I was overdue for an upgrade and was hoping that it would fix the problem) but it did not help. Resultantly, I do not have a lot of stuff on my calendar.&nbsp; It was only three days ago, when I installed outlook
 2007, that is when I inputted birthdays of friends and relatives.&nbsp; That and holidays are the only appointments I have on outlook.<br />
<br />
If you guys have any advice, please help me because I am lost.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Thanks for your help in advance!<br />

            Hi,<br />
The error message is related to calendar items.&nbsp; You can create a new Calendar folder in Outlook 2007 by clicking on the name of the PST and then clicking on File - New Folder.&nbsp; Then enter the name for the folder and select Calendar Items as the folder type.&nbsp;
 Then click OK.<br />
<br />
Then click on the Calendar (the original one) and click on View - Current View and select All Appointments.&nbsp; Use Ctrl-A to select all the appointments and dragna dnd rop them on the new Calendar folder you created.&nbsp; Then sync.&nbsp; Then move the items in groups
 until you see the error.&nbsp; Then you can choose to edit or delete the Calendar item to fix the problem.

            Chris,<br />
Thanks for the response, but I still need help.&nbsp; I am going to be honest, I was a little confused by your last post.&nbsp; I am not sure where to find the PST file. I did however do research, but I was unable to find the PST location as&nbsp;you had described it (I was
 unable to create a new folder by clicking on file and when I created a new folder I could not drag items to it.)&nbsp; But since you had suggested that the problem was my calendar items, I decided that since I did not have a lot on my calendar, to go ahead and
 delete all appointments, events, holidays, etc.&nbsp; So now my calendar is completley cleared.&nbsp; After doing this, I tried synching again and it still did not work.
<br />
<br />
Also, I had done a little more research and noticed that this error comes up on PCs as well as Pocket PCs.&nbsp; Normally the error message (on a desktop computers) means that there is some sort of error (for example, updating windows)&nbsp;and I think the way to fix
 it is&nbsp;by cleaning the registry.&nbsp; Therefore, I downloaded a registry cleaner for my PPC and a better one for mu desktop and ran them both.&nbsp; Still no luck.<br />
<br />
<strong>Any other suggestions?</strong>

<h2>            Nokia 5530</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Nokia Members,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again.. the Nokia 5530 creates more and more problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, i have noticed without the memory card it makes a lot of difference, as there are fewer lags.</p>
<p>When I connect the phone via USB cable to computer without the memory card, it does not read the disc drive, with the memory card it doesn't recognise it either.</p>
<p>I have noticed I need to reformat my MINI SD card, I can't find a way to access my phone documents via USB.</p>
<p>How do you do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Nokia 5530 Owner</p>

<p>To format you can use a MicroSD card reader. But first if you want you can check if the memory card have an error in the file system. Using Window$ put the MicroSD on the card reader and open file explorer. You see that letter the card reader has been asigned
 in explorer. Suppose the letter "E". Then in the start menu click "Run" and type in: cmd<br />
In the MSDOS window that opens type:<br />
CHKDSK E:<br />
If find errors to repairing can run:<br />
CHKDSK E: /f /r<br />
Or directly can use Scandisk.<br />
<br />
On GNU/Linux&nbsp; for example assuming that the reader is detected as sdb1, unmount the unit and as root from console run:<br />
dosfsck -ar /dev/sdb1<br />
<br />
To format in Window$ I'd recommend "HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool".<br />
<br />

    <title>Email Lost After Windows 10 Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> purpleairplane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Lost After Windows 10 Reset</h2>
                    <p>I have had Office installed on my PC for years now, and used MS Outlook as my default email program. After having reliability issues with my PC I reset Windows 10. I noticed all of my MS Office programs were removed during the reset, including Outlook.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I've reinstalled Office (though through the 365 program now) but I don't know how to find all the years of old emails which were in my inbox prior to the reset.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails I've lost predominantly came via an ISP that deletes all emails from their servers after 45 days, so once they're gone, they're gone, but I am hopefull there is an inbox file sitting on my PC somewhere with all of these emails intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me get these back into Outlook?</p>

<p>If there is that would contain the default folder location for your OL data files, however if you were using IMAP to connect with your mail, it is lost, mail would only be retained if using a pop mail setup, in which case the default file is outlook.pst,

<h2>            Find my phone - 3 questions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days ago I lost my Lumia 925 phone. I was optimistic about using "Find my phone" option but I encountered the following issues:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The last location update was 6 days old - which is not useful.&nbsp;Why is it so old? what is the frequency of the location updates that are automatically made by the software once you activate "Find my phone" option on your device? (it took 2 hour to the one
 who stolen my phone to turn it off and no location update in these 2 hours).</li><li>I couldn't find anywhere information regarding the fact that if the device is
<strong>turned off</strong>, the 3 "Find my phone options are still working: Location/ Ring / Lock / Delete private info. In my case none is working. Do I have the chance to use this options even if the device is turned off?</li><li>It is impossible to change the mobile number used in the device (once you enter a mobile number in your Microsoft account t's impossible to change it or to delete it.&nbsp; Today I had the sim replaced so now I don't know if the device is searched by the IMEI
 code or by the phone number. It is improbable that the person who&nbsp;stolen my phone didn't opened the device... so why&nbsp;I receive no location update in "Find my phone"?&nbsp;</li><li>What is the difference between Microsoft Account/ Nokia Account/ Live account? Unfortunately, yesterday I took the bad decision to buy a new Windows phone (930) and seems impossible to make it work, as I am lost in the "Nokia Account", "Microsoft Account",
 "Live Account"&nbsp;and I still can't recover all&nbsp;my contacts I think some of them are on the old Live account which I cannot access.</li><li>It is impossible to find a call center number to receive support. In such an emergency situation, would be very useful to be able to call someone... after 2 days of self study and Internet Research, I still couldn't receive any support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>I was a great fan and promoter&nbsp;of Windows but I feel defeated by the quantity and quality of support the Android users receive... :(&nbsp;(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. Clearly there is no way for your device to transmit its location or receive commands/messages when it is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. By phone number</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Nokia Accounts no longer exist since April 2015. MS account= Live account. If you set up the new phone with the same default MS account as the old one, all your contacts will automatically be restored to it.</p>

            <p>Phone accounts:</p>
<p>The primary account on the phone is the Microsoft account. When you go to settings, email+accounts you will see the Microsoft account. The Microsoft account on the phone is used to purchase apps, find my phone, location of phone backup. The calendar and
 contacts from this account syncs by default to the phone. This is usually a Hotmail, live or outlook.com email address. You have only one Microsoft account.</p>
<p>You can add other accounts to the phone for email, contacts, calendar.&nbsp;These are added in&nbsp;settings, email+accounts, add account.</p>
<p>You can see any of these account contacts by going to <a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://people.live.com</a>&nbsp;on your PC. You will probably be logged in automatically with the account you are using in this forum. If you have two outlook.com accounts you have to log out of one and log back in with the other account to see that info.</p>
<p>The Nokia account is no longer used. This was usually the account that was setup to make purchases from MixRadio.</p>

<p>I have tested the Find my phone application on my new 930 before having a sim card in it. It was found. So, I don't think that the device is searched by the mobile number or sim card since before entering a phone number you have a clear option "no phone
 number". The problem is you cannot change or delete the number once you entered one. And if you change the sim card to recover your number, if the search is based on the phone number, than ringing on that number means ringing on my new sim/phone... Which is
 stupid.</p>
<p>But if you're right, is a useless application in case you really loose your phone or it's stolen. Could be useful only if you misplaced it fully charged in your home.... 😞 No trace of mine, couldn't lock or delete personal info.... and I doubt that the
 thief didn't turned it on... </p>

            It will record the location when the phone was last connected to the Internet. It is not a live tracking service which is what most users think it is.

    <title>Is there no way to add Format Painter to the Quick Access toolbar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _jg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there no way to add Format Painter to the Quick Access toolbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I spend most of my day using Office on Windows, where we have Office 2013. I always add the "Format Painter" command to my Quick Access Toolbar on top so that I can get to this function from any tab. It's really useful. However on Office 2016 for Mac
 (where the command is called "Copy formatting..."), I do not seem to be able to add this to the Quick Access Toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the obvious: add a command to the toolbar and choose "All Commands" (it's not listed). I've also tried going to the "Home" set of commands because that's where it lives but again, the command isn't listed there. Lastly, I even tried to record
 a macro so that I could then add that macro to the Quick Access Toolbar but somehow that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this? Am I missing something obvious or is this command completely absent from Office 2016 for Mac?</p>
<p />

            <p>This is the Clipboard Group. I think they put Format Painter in there only because they didn't know where else to put it. The group title is misleading when you're looking for the Format Painter command; it has nothing to do with copying or pasting.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure why you want to add Format Painter to the QAT. It's already on the Home tab, just to the right of the Paste icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command you're looking can be added to the Ribbon: </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Ribbon</strong> pane in <strong>Preferences&gt;Ribbon &amp; Toolbar</strong>.</li><li>Change <em>Choose commands from:</em> to <strong>All Commands</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and select <strong>Format</strong>.</li><li>In the right-hand <em>Customize the Ribbon:</em> list, click on the <strong>plus sign</strong> at the bottom and either add a new custom group to an existing tab, or a new tab to the Ribbon.</li><li>Between the 2 lists, click on the <strong>right-pointing arrow button</strong> to add the command to the new group or tab.</li></ol>
<p>If your aim is to have the Format Painter visible at all times (the only reason I can think that you might want to add it to the QAT), then add the command to a custom group on every tab of the Ribbon.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Uninstall Bluetooth Mouse Build 9860 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger stokes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Uninstall Bluetooth Mouse Build 9860</h2>
                    <p>Not so much a question as it is an "FYI"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious if anyone else has ran into difficulties while attempting to uninstall a bluetooth mouse from windows 10 technical preview (x64), build 9860?&nbsp; Normal step was to attempt to uninstall from control panel&gt;devices and printers&gt;remove devices.&nbsp; But,
 I kept receiving the error "due to restrictions this operation cannot be performed, please see administrator" ... I am the administrator.&nbsp; Everything else in there I appear to be able to uninstall (printers, bluetooth dongle which is 3rd party, fax machines,
 etcetera), just not the bluetooth mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have found to actually uninstall it was to go to device manager (right click on this pc&gt;properties&gt;device manager), locate the mouse under the bluetooth section, and then remove it from there = victory!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>There was one last step I forgot to mention, after deleting from device manager I then had to go back to Devices and Printers and then was able to successfully "Remove Device" without errors.</p>

            <p><span>I need to apologize, it looks like my steps above only temporarily remove the items. every time I rebooted they came back.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But...if you go through the pc settings app program (not the control panel) and then go through and find the bluetooth section and remove from within that (PC Settings&gt;Bluetooth&gt; highlight
 and remove the device) then everything magically seems to work and does NOT automatically reinstall itself upon rebooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Seriously Microsoft...really...you're going to purposely make control panel items or device manager items not work just so you can push your "APPs" version of stuff. That’s just wrong...so
 very wrong.</span></p>

            <p>As a further piece of feedback:</p>
<p>Running on a desktop which has a USB Bluetooth dongle, running into the same problem trying to remove a headset. &nbsp;However it doesn't even show me the Bluetooth control panel. &nbsp;I assume this is because Windows 10 is too smart for its own good, and assumes
 that, being a desktop, there's no way it has Bluetooth hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immensely frustrating: there is now no way short of a rebuild (that I can find) to remove this BT device, which is a necessary step in troubleshooting a separate problem with it.</p>

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ade71f30-9a10-436c-aefa-a73c6d35f79e" title="LumiAlessio">
LumiAlessio</a>. I understand that when the screen is&nbsp;in standby mode, WiFi connectivity is disabled. Is your phone running on WP8.1 OS? Does the problem also happened when you're connected to other WiFi? Prior to this, did you install any application that
 may cause the problem? You may try performing the hardware reboot. This reboot will not delete any personal data on the phone. To do this while the phone is turned off, press and hold Volume down and Power button keys at the same time until it vibrates and
 it will restart. If the issue persists, proceed with phone reset. This reset will delete everything on the phone. Please do back up all personal data to avoid data loss. To reset the phone go to Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset your phone. Please let us know the result
 so we can further assist you.

<h2>            Excel Online Can&#39;t Load Apps from App Catalog</h2>
                    <p>For about the last week no one at one of my clients can load custom Excel Web Add-ins from the SharePoint Online App Catalog in Office 365.&nbsp; This is happening in every tenant that I have access to.&nbsp; These are all Add-ins that worked fine prior to last week
 and they continue to work in an Excel Desktop.&nbsp; Its only when we try to load them from Excel Online that we get an error saying they can't be found in the App Catalog.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a service call open on this since last Friday and am still playing telephone tag with support.&nbsp; They promise to call at a particular time but then don't follow through.&nbsp; Then they call while I'm out of the office and don't have a computer available.&nbsp;
 If this is happening in every tenant I don't understand why this isn't listed as a system wide outage.&nbsp; Excel Web Add-ins are currently "broken" in every tenant I've seen.&nbsp; Is anyone else using Excel Add-ins and are they still working in your tenant?</p>

            Word 2011 supports digital signatures in two different ways.<br />
<br />
VBA Macro<br />
A macro is a bit of computer code that does stuff. Word documents, templates, and add-ins can contain VBA code. A developer can purchase a digital code signing certificate (fairly expensive) and use it to guarantee the authenticity of the computer code associated
 with the document.<br />
<br />
Email Certificate<br />
An affordable email certificate can be used to guarantee that a document was sent by the person who signed the email message using a digital certificate. This guarantees the authenticity of the sender of the document and the email message that contained the
 Word document. It's an indirect way of authenticating a document, but the only real practical digital certificate in existence. You save the email so that if you need to prove authenticity, you can.<br />
<br />
Something you should never do is to send or accept a picture of a signature within a document as evidence of authenticity. Pictures of signatures can be saved as files with a simple right-click and Save As Picture. Then that signature can be added to ANY document.
 It's an open invitation to fraud and identity theft.<br />
<br />

Microsoft BLuetooth stack driver 5.1.2600 build 2180<br />

Phone pairs fine with PC and other phones. Can transfer files using Bluetooth File Transfer Wizard (%SystemRoot%\system32\fsquirt.exe).<br />
In Windows Device Manager, E50 appears under Portable Devices using the PCCSWpdDriver.dll 6.83.31.1<br />
The Control Panel, Bluetooth Devices shows the phone.<br />
<br />
E50 is detected by PC Suite but does not allow connection. Error message "cannot authenticate the phone".<br />
<br />
Discussion below is related but solution does not work (did not quite understand remark: "You only need to enable to the serial port service functionality on the setup wizard for your own computer."). Added COM6 for incoming Using the Bluetooth Devices Control

            What you can try to do is to uninstall current Bluetooth drivers and then Windows will re-install those.<br />
<br />
1. Open Device Manager -&gt; Bluetooth Radios. Uninstall anything under that.<br />
2. Reboot computer<br />
3. Windows will install new drivers for your BT<br />
<br />
Does this solve your problem?

            thanks for your input. Removing the Dell TrueMobile Bluetooth Module removes also the Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator. Reboot and restart installs automatically both drivers. Issue remained. Removing the BT device from PC and phone and redetect did not
 solve it either.<br />
<br />
Do you know which MS BT driver is supported apart from the enumerator?<br />

I presume the last action of unistalling the Bluetooth radio drivers using Device Manager caused this change.<br />
<br />
Do you know what I am supposed to see in Device Manager for a working version? That is, apart from the Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator, what Microsoft BT driver is supposed to be listed?<br />

<br />
You have to enable AutoComplete for Address bar if you want to see the TypedURLs list now.&nbsp; However, you can now customize what it shows you, so it could be almost the same as what you were probably using before.<br />

Good luck<br />

<h3> just someone trying to redeem rewards  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing rewards - redeeming a reward without verificaton&#47;SMS</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to redeem a reward, it insists that I provide some verification. Now, I have an email associated with my account - but it refuses to send any verification code to that; the option just isn't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead the only option it has is to send a verification code via text to a phone. I don't want to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there really <em>no</em> way around this? It seems a little strange anyway. They're satisfied enough that I'm legitimate to allow me to go into my email account, do whatever I want with it - but when it comes to redeeming rewards with the points I've
 earned, they're just going to insist I give them my phone number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I just receive this code (if it really has to insist on this verification thing) via email?</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that you were not the first person to be sucked into the insider program and you will certainly not be the last. Unfortunately you broke your own tradition of not reading enough about the requirements before joining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Insider Preview builds are beta software still in the process of development and not yet ready for general release to the public. Microsoft needs people to test these builds so they can get feedback from the computer itself and customer feedback via
 the Feedback Hub for the thousands of different computer specifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you already take precautions against losing valuable data in the event of a disaster such as disc failure by backing up to an external drive/ cloud etc. Testing beta builds requires additional precautions<br />
1.&nbsp; Back up your OS as a disc image prior to joing the Insider program. This will enable you to revert back if you decide to exit the program. Alternatively, use the Media Creation Tool to create installation media for any computer of the W10 release version.<br />
2.&nbsp; DO NOT use your everyday working OS for the Insider Program. If possible, use another computer solely for the program. If this is not possible, install another copy of W10 in a dual boot configuration and use this for the program. There will be times when
 it may be nescessary to roll back/ reinstall so put nothing on the Insider OS that you cannot afford to lose.</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />You can't, if you removed an existing compatible version of Skype that worked with iOS 9.3.5, the App store doesn't provide access to older supported version.
<br />
<br />The unfortunate recommendation would be to upgrade to a newer iPad that supports iOS 10.
<br />
<br />Its not an answer but just the way things have been setup by the software developer and iPad maker. 
<br />
<br />You might want to consider Facetime as an alternative. Most of my Family members have iPhone and iPads anyway and its already built in.
<br />
<br />Another alternative you might be able to consider is Viber.

<div>As a workaround, Skype for iPhone can be used on an iPad with iOS 9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Install older iTunes 12.6.5 with AppStore support:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. 'Purchase' the Skype for iPhone by downloading it in iTunes. Make sure to login in iTunes with the same Apple ID as on iPad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Open Skype for iPhone in AppStore on iPad via this link:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Select 'cloud' icon to install Skype for iPhone. AppStore will prompt that iOS 10 is required and will offer to download an older version.</div>

<h2>            VMX Virus &#40;including dataup &#40;32bit&#41;, winvmx client, and svcvmx &#40;32bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently come in contact with a nasty and very protected virus called VMX or some variation of it. This program runs background programs that slow down my computer. The initial intent of the software was probably to be adware, but I've removed all
 adware programs and malicious browser extensions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that there are still programs running called: dataup (32 bit), winvmx client, and svcvmx (32 bit). They are all located in C:\Users\Yummywax\AppData\Local\ntuserlitelist\(either dataup or svcmx).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the fun part: when I try to delete these folders, I get "You need permission to preform this action." Thing is, I'm the administrator.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've already tried:<br />
I've gone into Safe Mode and tried to delete the files, but I get the same response.</p>
<p>I've already taken ownership of the folder and given myself full control under permissions, but I still "need permission."<br />
I've gone into the registries and done the "Take Ownership" trick, where it appears on my right-click menu but I still "need permission."<br />
I've gone into Command Prompt (as admin) and used "del /F /S /Q /A (file pathway), but "Access is denied."<br />
I've gone into Task Manager under startup, and tried to disable Cpx and svcvmx, but nothing happens.<br />
I've gone into the registries and tried to delete its startup entries, but I was unable to.</p>
<p>I've tried to run RKill (named iExplorer) and other antiviruses, but my pc&nbsp;says "The requested resource is in use."</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that this is due to user profile corruption. To further isolate the issue, kindly verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to delete other folders aside from the folders that you have mentioned?</li><li>Do you have another administrator account that you can use to test the issue?</li><li>Have you tried running <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">System File Checker</a></strong> to check for any system file corruption?</li></ul>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>In the registries, write down the non-harmful entries and delete the whole folder. I did this because I wasn't able to delete the virus' registries themselves, so I deleted the whole thing and it worked. Then, I just replaced the folder (key) and the non-harmful
 values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This helped tremendously, because it didn't run upon startup anymore, and was basically the turning point where I started winning the war.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hi Dave, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to your query as we are currently receiving a high volume of support request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based from what I've read, two Microsoft accounts were having problem sending email to your domain account. Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will definitely do my best to help you in rectifying this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing on the example error message that you've provided above, I have determined that the senders are using an email client to access their Microsoft account and the
<strong>SMTP Authentication </strong>needs to be turned on to be able to send an email without any problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise them to visit the the article provided below for more information and troubleshooting steps that they can perform to help them in resolving this issue:

            <p>Sooo, is there no way to get help on this?!?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have called MS and been practicaly hung up on when I asked for help with hotmail, twice.&nbsp; One person directed me here where I spent a day looking through information that didn't help.&nbsp; Now, its been over a week since my first post, with minimal help, that&nbsp;doesn't
 appear to apply.&nbsp; Does anyone know if hotmail engineers monitor these forums or if there is a way to escalate possible issues to them?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that not being able to receive messages from your two Hotmail users is very upsetting. Let me see what I can do to rectify the problem that you're having.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the error code that you've provided and as previously stated by Dhenz S., the senders were using an email client&nbsp; to access their Microsoft account and the
<strong>SMTP Authentication </strong>needs to be turned on to be able to send an email without any problem. That is why the previous Moderator gave you the proper SMTP server settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the possible cause of the error code that you have received:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Generic protocol error (SMTP error). The remote SMTP responds to our EHLO by generating a 500 level error, and the sending system ends the connection and reports this NDR error. This indicates that the remote SMTP server cannot handle the protocol. (For
 example, if a Hotmail account is no longer active, a 550 SMTP error occurs.)"<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We advised that&nbsp; you run an SMTP log or a Network Monitor trace to deteremine why the remote SMTP server rejected the protocol request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, for us to further investigate your concern, kindly provide us the complete link of your domain's website and the email addresses of your two Hotmail users that is affected by this issue in the private message area that I've created.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We're looking forward for your response in the private message area.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Another Week, and nothing. It has been almost a month since my first post to this forum and no one seems to be able to help me. Can you please respond to my last message from 9 days ago in the private section?&nbsp; Surely the escalations team can provide some
 information by now.&nbsp; I started this thread almost a month ago and have gotten no where.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Johan.&nbsp; Can you please provide me with some additional assurance that someone is responsible for this and that it isn't in a queue somewhere.&nbsp; Surely the queue for help aren't weeks long.&nbsp; Perhaps someone can respond in the private
 section to say that they personally can take some responsibility for looking further into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way we don't have this continued problem where I get a resonse from a new person every few days
</p>
<p>telling me that someone else is looking into it or telling me the same things over and over again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Calculated Duration following productivity Rate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wael s k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calculated Duration following productivity Rate</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I need to force project to calculate following my own formula or following a certain productivity rate.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>I have a task consisting of 1,000 sqm&nbsp;of tiling works.</p>
<p>I know that the average productivity rate of tiling is 2 sqm/hr</p>
<p>I will create to columns, one for qty, one for productivity and one for estimated Duration.</p>
<p>I need project to calcutale the&nbsp;estimated duration as&nbsp;(1000/2) = 500 hrs</p>
<p>I need to make project use this duration in he Grantt Chart.</p>
<p>Why we need this? well we have sometimes huge projetcs conataining lots of similar tasks related to the same productivity rate. If we are able to do so then we can change the productivity rate in one place and see how it will affect the whole project. We
 frequently do this on Primavera but I don't know how to do it in Project 2013. </p>
<p>That&nbsp;plan is not submitted to the client or consultants, it is internally used by our company to see various scenarios.</p>
<p>How can I do it?<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your support</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The only way to do it is through a VBA procedure. It's simple enough but it is necessary.</p>
<p>Supposing the sqm are in Number1 and the sqm/hr in Number2, here's the code:</p>
<p>Sub TilingDuration</p>
<p>dim T as task</p>
<p>for each t in activeproject.tasks</p>
<p>if not t is nothing then</p>
<p>if not t.number2=0 then</p>
<p>t.duration=60*t.number1/t.number2</p>
<p>end if</p>
<p>end if</p>
<p>next t</p>
<p>end sub</p>
<p>The website of fellow MVP Jack Dahlgren, masamiki.com, has the instruction on how to install and run macro's.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
