                    <p>I have tried all the methods listed almost everywhere online to try and remove write protection from this dell usb recovery media and none worked. &nbsp;I called dell but they said it can't be removed. &nbsp;Is there a way to do it?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Vista Home Basic SP2 32bit Windows Update code 80072EFE</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Vista Home Basic SP2 32bit. I just got the computer cleaned up from a bad infection. I am running MSE for anti virus. Both MSE and Windows Updates will not work. When I click on check for updates I get : Code 80072EFE Windows Update encountered an
 unknown error. IE 8 does work.</p>
<p>Here's the suggestions I have tried</p>
<p>1) Checked the date and time and verified to be correct</p>
<p>2) disabled firewalls, only using Vista Firewall</p>
<p>3) <span><span>Click Start, click Run, type in "SERVICES.MSC" and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Double click Cryptographic Services, and then click Stop (if it has been started).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>B: After stopping Cryptographic Service, please delete the "Catroot2" folder:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4) </span></span><span><span>Re-start Cryptographic Services:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>5) Tried to register the following dll files</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>regsvr32 atl.dll<br />
regsvr32 urlmon.dll <br />
regsvr32 Shdocvw.dll <br />
regsvr32 Actxprxy.dll <br />
regsvr32 Oleaut32.dll <br />
regsvr32 Mshtml.dll <br />
regsvr32 Browseui.dll<br />
regsvr32 actxprxy.dll<br />
regsvr32 softpub.dll<br />
regsvr32 wintrust.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
regsvr32 initpki.dll<br />
regsvr32 dssenh.dll<br />
regsvr32 CRYPTDLG.DLL</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When I got to</span><span>regsvr32 Shdocvw.dll I got an error message that reads
 :&nbsp; The module "Shdocvw.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that "Shdocvw.dll is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is as far as I have gone. I have also rebooted three times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would appreciate any suggestions to fix this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) did you install Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) and was the computer fully-patched at Windows Update at the time?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton or McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>=======================</p>
<p>You may encounter temporary connection-related errors [e.g., 0x80072EFF; <strong>
0x80072EFE</strong>; 0x80072EFD; 0x80072EEF; 0x80072EE2; 0x80072EE7; 0xC80003FA; 0x8024402F] when you use Windows Update or Microsoft Update to install updates<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836941</a></p>
<p>How do I reset Windows Update components?<br />
=&gt; Ignore the APPLIES TO section if Win7; Access KB971058 via Internet Explorer (32-bit) only; Run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes, then reboot [1]<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a></p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of installed updates in Add/Remove Programs (WinXP) or Installed Updates (Vista &amp; Win7).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) MSE was installed on 7-06-10. I believe that Vista was fully patched before the MSE install</p>
<p>2) Avira Anti Virus was installed and removed through Programs\Features and Avira Registry Cleaner was also run</p>
<p>3) Norton was installed before Avira. Norton was removed through the Norton Removal Tool</p>
<p>4) Norton came preinstalled on the system</p>

<p>A1. When (approx. date) did the computer get infected &amp; how was it "cleaned up?"<br />
<br />
A2. Assuming the preinstalled Norton application was a free-trial version, did you uninstall the free-trial and&nbsp;run the Norton Removal Tool and then install the paid Norton application BEFORE the free-trial period had expired?</p>
<p>The above notwithstanding...</p>
<p>Have you tried resetting Windows Update components yet?</p>
<p><strong>IE8 Tools | Internet Options | Connections | LAN settings | Use a proxy server for...</strong> &lt;=if this option is checked/enabled, does unchecking/disabling it resolve the problem?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Every 10? 20? 30? minutes I see ghost touches on my screen. I can see the round touch circles you get when you touch the screen. I can see a lot of them simultaneously (sometimes 10 or more). As you can imagine, these ghosts touches heavily influence
 everything on my machine (reorganize pinned icons, open programs, press all kinds of buttons of my open programs.. basically everything you do not want)</p>
<p>It is clearly after I've upgraded to windows 10, I never had this issue before (I own this machine for &gt;1 year).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. hereby the output:</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</p>
<p>Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.</p>
<p>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;</p>

                    I have Easy Face 2 on my new laptop, when I click on it, it asks for a password. What password would that be. The message says &nbsp; Enter password same as windows. I don't have a windows password.

            <p>They have no logical reason to ask for your Windows password.&nbsp; I'd suggest finding an alternative&nbsp;piece of software that does not solicit sensitive information.</p>
<p>I just googled <em>easy face 2</em> &amp; other people have been asking the same question as you but I didn't see any decent answers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Try searching for <em>webcam software</em> in google as there are plenty of others available.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in auto repair</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavilion that originally had Windows 7, upgraded to 10 during the free upgrade. All of a sudden it keeps trying to do an auto repair. Then it will say it couldn't &nbsp;fix the problem, didn't start or shut down correctly. It gives troubleshooting
 and other options but I don't know what to do. A geek squad agent looked at it and said I need an HP recovery disk but HP said they can't provide me with one because my computer is over 4 years old. I was also told to reinstall Windows 7 and not use 10. Any
 way to resolve this?&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. That</p>
<p>often will work when running from the recovery environment does not.<br />
<br />
You can make a Windows 10 Install disk and try to use it to repair the present<br />
installation. Do not try to do a clean install with it however because if the upgrade<br />
was not fully activated for a few days then the clean install will not activate.<br />
<br />
Make a Windows 10 Disk using the Media Creation Tool - select to install on<br />
another computer and the same version you have now. You can make a USB<br />
or DVD to boot with. Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options&nbsp; - Automatic<br />
Repair.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then<br />
boot with it - use method I outlined above.<br />

    <title>Remote App Permission Denied Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marktinder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote App Permission Denied Error</h2>
                    <p>I have an old contact resource management program that can only be installed on 32-bit computers. &nbsp;The main database is on a 2k3 server with SQL 2k5. &nbsp;We are in the process of migrating all of our desktops/laptops over to 64-bit hardware, and are about 30%
 there. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the CRM program cannot be installed on 64-bit architecture. &nbsp;We have set up a 32-bit VM that some users can log into in order to access the program for a few users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long term, of course, is to get a new CRM program. &nbsp;Not in the cards at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I thought I whip up a Terminal Server, install the endpoint program, and set it up either with web access, or a Windows installer package. &nbsp;As this has to be 32-bit architecture, that limits me to a 2k8 server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially was getting a comctl32.ocx/comdlg32.ocx error until I disabled UAC on the server. &nbsp;Additionally, the only person who could access the program (web access or Windows package) was me, the guy who installed everything. &nbsp;Even other Domain Admins
 could not launch the program without the *.ocx errors. &nbsp;Now, only domain admins can run it. &nbsp;Everyone else gets the "Permission to use object denied" error. &nbsp;I have tried setting other users up as local admins on their device, local admins on the term server,
 Full Permissions on the program folder, allowing Global Object creation on both the calling device and the term serv....kind of at wit's end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried sharing Calcuator and WordPad, and those work fine. &nbsp;Just this stupid program I NEED to get working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what I am missing?</p>

            Not what I wanted to do, but I was able to make things work by adding the remote app group to the local admin group. &nbsp;I am assuming this is an artifact of being a 2008 server with the first go-round for Terminal Services.

    <title>How do Multiple Storage Drives Work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zowieblaze  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do Multiple Storage Drives Work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm planning to build my own gaming computer sometime soon, but I was curious how having multiple storage drives work? I had selected the&nbsp;<a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3kL7YJ/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz75e250bam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Samsung
 850 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5" Solid State Drive</a>&nbsp;but 250GB fills up fast. My uncle recommended downloading my Operating System to that, but also having an additional drive for more storage. On my laptop I have Local Disc(C:) HP_Tools(H:) and Recovery (D:) drives.
 Are these all separate storage drives? How much storage does one recommend I allow minimum on a single SSD if I wanted a storage space for my OS alone, and heavy program to run on another storage drive?</p>
<p>Hope you can answer these for me! Sorry if they seem a little dumb. I'm more of a software person, so I'm not quite familiar with the actual hardware inside of computers.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disk Partitioning</strong> allows you to split a hard drive into appearing as multiple, different drives just like what you have in your laptop. Some use a third-party partition software but with Microsoft, you can use the built-in Disk Management
 Tool. </p>

            So would having everything run off of one drive not cause problems? And how would I know how much space to set aside for each false drive? I'd want at least one for my OS, and one to have everything else stored on.

<h2>            Installing Utilities and SDK for Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit on a brand new Dell computer with a Intel Core i5 CPU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the appropriate location in the control panel, I have activated the "Subsystem for Unix-based applications" feature. This then adds a start menu item which points me to a download page, where I can download an installer to activate the feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded "Utilities and SDK for Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications_IA64.exe" , which is the approriate intel 64bit package for my hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I try to install from this package, I receive an error dialog: "This installation package is not supported by this processor type. Contact your product vendor."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I successfully activate this feature?</p>

    <title>Why can I not choose english as my language&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why can I not choose english as my language&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am an american who has been living in Finland on and off for nearly 2 years now. Recently I've been having some troubles using my US XBL account to make purchases while in Finland. I was told by MS that changing the region on my account would take 6 weeks
 during which time I would not be able to use it online (which is absolutely ridiculous and totally worthless btw) so I figured it would be easier to just make a new account. During set-up I of course set Finland as my region however this changed my language
 options to only finnish or swedish neither of which are languages that I speak. The language on my console is set to english and some things like dashboard menus do display in english but things like game descriptions on the marketplace and e-mails i get from
 MS are all in finnish.</p>
<p>Why can I not set the language to use with my account independently from region? This seems to be really poorly thought out as in any given country there must be plenty of people who's native language is not the native language in that region.</p>

<p>changing your region will not help for 2 reasons</p>
<p>1st languages are setup by your country and that is offically supported languages setup by your country not by you</p>
<p>if english is not supported in finland then it is not supported</p>
<p>using an out of country account can cause purchasing issues people do that sometimes but they face issues with purchases just because they try and get dlc that isn't valid for their region</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd if you change to a region you are not currently in you will have problems accessing and purchasing an DLC</p>
<p>this is recommended that you use your actual region</p>
<p>6weeks means they manually transfer your account not flip 1 switch and they do have other work to do</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and to do it you must have an valid billing address from the region</p>
<p>so choosing UK will not solve your issue nor will choosing US unless you maintain a US address</p>
<p>but as stated before you will have problems with purchases as alot of DLC is locked to the region and you have to be physically there</p>

<p>Thanks for the response but I think maybe you didn't fully comprehend my question. I already know everything you've told me and that's why I came here to complain about it. As I stated having the language tied exclusively to region is idiotic as in any given
 region there is likely to be a lot of people who's native language is not the official language of the region. I realize language settings are tied to region and that is the problem, I don't speak the official languages of the region I'm in which means having
 a local account (which I do) is a pain in the @@@ because I can't read anything that shows up in Finnish.</p>
<p>Also I don't care how an account is transferred, when it comes down to it, it is the moving of digital information which anybody who has ever used the internet knows is pretty quick and easy. There is no excuse for me to lose access to my account for 6 weeks
 because MS can't handle transfering simple information in a timely manner. Besides I don't want to transfer my US account because I like being able to actually read stuff.</p>

<p>You can still use your US Xbox LIVE account but you may encounter issues when trying to purchase some restricted content on Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>One solution is, whenever you want to buy some restricted DLCs or games, you need to set up a VPN connection. Xbox 360 VPN setup tutorial can be found online if you search for it.</p>
<p>If you create a new account in Finland, you can only have Finnish or Swedish as LIVE language but it will have no effect on the language of games on the marketplace since the language in games is based on your system language.</p>
<p>So the solution here I want to give you is, login at Xbox.com and change Xbox.com language to English. Then you can browse all the contents on marketplace before you decide to purchase something. Of course you can just use Xbox.com to buy DLCs/games.</p>
<p>If you want Microsoft to help you change the region of your US LIVE account to Finland, you'll no longer be able to have English on your old account, only Finnish or Swedish, until the region is changed back to US. So don't do it.</p>

<p>I did comprehend Your issue complain to Your government or Your countries people</p>
<p>In order conduct business in a country</p>
<p>You must go with The majority</p>
<p>If only lets say 20k people speak english but only 50 want english games in Your country</p>
<p>Do Your really think spending 10000dollars to localize a game in english for Your specific region is worth It</p>
<p>Its isnt and They cannot take an us version and use Its in another region since regulations are different in every country v</p>
<p>pn isnt really a solution because they usually end badly due to incomplete downloads as xbox does check and stop downloads at 99%</p>

<p>I'm sorry but that's wrong. The region settings are not ruled by the government of my region, it's determined by microsoft. Every other service I use has no problem providing the service in my native language and not the language of the region I happen to
 be in. There is no legal reason why my Finnish xbox live account has to be in Finnish because I'm in Finland. The game companies don't have to localize anything and it costs them nothing because they already have the english text and in fact in Finland I have
 no problem getting my games in english. The problem is microsoft has foolishly tied language to region which it does not need to do. The language could easily be a completely seperate setting but instead the two are tied together making the whole service less
 usefull to anybody who speaks a different language. I get facebook in english, i get google in english, i get netflix in english, litterally every online service I use beside XBL can provide me with english text because it's not that hard. If you already offer
 different languages it's a very easy and sensible thing to make those languages available to everybody.</p>

<p>Linguistic and cultural: the translation of language and cultural references maintaining the feel of the game but making it more appealing for the receiving locale</p>
<p>meaning it still sold to the MAJORITY languages in your local country</p>
<p>Game localization or game globalization refers to the preparation of video games for other locales.
<em><strong>This adaptation to the standards of other countries covers far more than simply translation of language. There are different areas, such as linguistic, cultural, hardware and software, legal differences, graphics identity and music</strong></em>.
 Globalization refers to general Eastern/Western variations, while localization refers to several regional sub-divisions within the globalization.</p>
<p>as stated before you will not solve your issue by changing regions as alot of content is region restricted and you forfeit some or all downloads in the region change</p>

<p>Sorry, dude. Cry to wikipedia all you want, you are still wrong. First of all, I work for a game dev, I know what localization is. Second XBL is already in english, making that available is not a localization issue, the strings already exist. The only thing
 preventing me from having them is a foolish design decision made by MS to tie language to region. The language of games I play is not tied to region, every game I've purchased in Finland retail or XBLA has been in english. The language of system settings is
 not tied to region, I have 12 choices in there as opposed to the two I get to choose for my profile. Even the language of xbox.com is not tied to region, I can choose any language available. Let's just break down what you think is proof that something already
 in english would need to be localized in english to view in europe (I can't believe I have to even type any more after that sentence since the idiocy of it is clear as day).</p>
<p>linguistic - as previously stated most games in Finland are already in english retail or online</p>
<p>cultural - the only change we had to make in our last game was some in game advertisements that only appeared in one region, everything else besides text is exactly the same in every other region.</p>
<p>hardware - there is no limitation in hardware that prevents english. again, all my games are in english and the system settings on my console are set to english. the console is very capable of displaying english.</p>
<p>software - these days most software is not region locked, games i buy in the states work on my console here and games i buy here work on my console in the states.</p>
<p>legal - there is no law stating that online services can only be in Finnish or Swedish. If there was every service I use besides XBL, every game I've purchased in Finland and even every game I've worked on would be breaking that law.</p>

 have all that text in english already, they have just chosen to not make that available. A decision that decreases the usability of their product.</p>

<p>Ok what part of localization dont You Get?</p>
<p>Every region has their different laws You do know that right ?</p>
<p>Even with uk version uk laws do not apply to finland</p>
<p>Its is finnish laws that apply</p>
<p>Thats like saying indie games shoukd becase allowed because there are allowed in eu because uk allows them</p>
<p>A publisher will not publish something and spending 10000dollars to localize content for 10 people for example</p>
<p>If laws do prevent certain things like nazi zombies or hate objects dont Your think those laws apply?</p>
<p>Also certain music etc has limited distibution rights</p>
<p>They cannot becase distibuted to all non english speaking countries as copyright laws apply again Its is demographic</p>
<p>There is content laws look them up it goes by the majority not a minority</p>
<p>Xbox isnt limited to one region laws They do have to follow international laws and copyrights&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Shogun! As ngocphi stated earlier, you are not able to change the language for all aspects of LIVE and gameplay to a language not officially supported for your region. We appreciate your feedback though, and if you'd like to log it more officially,

    <title>Truncated wma tracks on playback after ripping with Windows Media - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Truncated wma tracks on playback after ripping with Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Truncated wma tracks on playback -- WMP</p>
<p>I ripped a big&nbsp;handful of CD's originally using wma lossless and encountered multiple instances of truncated tracks playing back through a Logitech Squeezebox.&nbsp; Of course I assumed the problem was Logitech's and even found a Logitech forum reference to truncated
 tracks when using&nbsp;wma&nbsp;lossless.</p>
<p>So I re-ripped 3 CD's using standard wma at highest quality.&nbsp; One CD then had no truncation (originally&nbsp;5 of 14&nbsp;tracks) some of the truncation disappeared but not all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I re-ripped to degrade&nbsp;the quality I came back to the computer&nbsp;I had originally&nbsp;used
 to rip the CD's (using Windows Media Player) and played the&nbsp;2 deficient ones through WMP.&nbsp; Lo and behold the same problem of truncation arose on the same tracks at presumably the same points in the tracks.</p>
<p>Now I'm feeling bad about assuming that the problem was/is Logitech's, since WMP seems unable to playback what it has recorded, and Microsoft needs to answer for this one.</p>
<p>Any help would be&nbsp;appreciated that doesn't involve continually degrading the audio quality.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try the following methods</span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try change settings that might help you in completing the rip.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Windows Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to Tools</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Options and select Devices.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select CD/DVD burner and choose Advanced.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place a checkmark on “Use error correction”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you’ve done that, try ripping the CD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the below link:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Change settings for ripping music</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the folders are present in the library</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on 'Tools' then 'Options' and then 'Rip Music' and see if you have a location the music is being ripped to. click on 'Ok' and close the window</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on 'Organize' at the top left then 'Manage Libraries' and 'Music', there should be a music folder location here, if there isn't press "add" and add
 the music folder.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now do the same for the other 3 libraries, Videos, Pictures and Recorded tv, all should have locations, delete the ones without a location.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now try to rip again</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check the status in a new user account.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Create a new user account check if they work.</span></span></span></p>

                    <p>I tried to install WD Access (from Western Digital) and I cannot reinstall or uninstall now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to reinstall or uninstall I get the following message:</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I look for the app in the windows settings &gt;apps list it shows as being present but when I try to uninstall it gives me the above message.&nbsp; When I use the WD Access installer it also gives me the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the app icon does not appear anywhere else and cannot be used. </p>

    <title>Trackpad Acting Weird after Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrusso01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trackpad Acting Weird after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8 and ever since that upgrade, my trackpad hasn't been working properly... every time I left click by pressing down on the trackpad, it double-clicks and if I just tap it, it single clicks. Right clicking is even stranger
 and I haven't figured out how to always get that one correct yet... If anyone knows how to fix it, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!!! I have an ASUS Q501LA if that helps...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I had the same exact problem with my Asus laptop as well but I think I fixed it. After upgrading to Windows 10, for whatever reason the touchpad driver for my laptop was changed to a Lenovo drivier instead of an Asus, maybe during the update it couldn't
 find a generic Asus driver so it grabbed a lenovo one instead, idk. In the device manager under Mice and other pointing devices try rolling back the driver and restarting your computer, the driver should be returned to an Asus version and should fix the issues,
 it did for me anyway. Hope it helps!

            <p>I have the same problem Michelle - in fact I have not been able to install a Windows 10 1607 cummulative update since I bought the PC in December 2016. January 11 Failed; March 17 failed; April 15 failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On each occassion, I ran the troubleshooter. On each occassion the troubleshooter fixed security settings, service registration, the update database and the update components. &nbsp;On each occassion, the cummulative update has failed when I attempted it again.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have three cummulative updates hidden so as to stop the PC constantly trying to install them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With so many users experiencing the failure of cummulative updates surely someone knows how to fix it. I would sure like to know!</p>

            <p>I have to respectfully disagree.&nbsp; Surely with the number of folks having this problem there are some techies out there that either have experienced it or can recreate the problem.&nbsp; I, too, have been having this problem getting an update installed.&nbsp; I realized
 today that it's the same update that is failing - KB4015217.&nbsp; The Microsoft techies should be able to get a handle as to why so many folks are having a problem getting the update installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get a chance I will see if I can get the info that Gerry asked for.</p>

&nbsp; 821 Event Name: BEX</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought the BEX thing would be independent of the other 3 main ones but now I'm not sure as some are interleaved eerily "coincidentally" IMO with some recent ones of the others.&nbsp; So, it might be an idea to do something about them to avoid that
 uncertainty.&nbsp; Who knows fixing this might help change your other symptoms.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 88 P1: PlexTranscoder.exe<br />
&nbsp; 248 P1: Plex Media Server.exe<br />
&nbsp; 484 P1: Plex Media Scanner.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if nothing else help please try uninstalling whatever package these Plex things came with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise it appears that the others occur in sets, starting with some of the POQ things which then get reflected in the CBS ones and then finally reported by WU.&nbsp; Let's look at the last instance of such an
<strong><a href="https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/newthread?category=archivecd&amp;forum=comsandbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft forum "sandbox"</a></strong> for its HTML editor feature.&nbsp; E.g. go there, open up the HTML editor and Paste
 in the lines that you want to see expanded, then use the Update button, then use the HTML button again (believe it or not). &nbsp; Result:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a couple ideas from these.&nbsp; The 0xD4 may mean that there is a problem with something listed in your Pending.XML file. &nbsp; As for the other, is there a another partition that we should know about, or something that would be protecting it from changes
 that you could remove?&nbsp; FWIW I didn't see any probable suspects in a quick scan of the rest of your System Information file.&nbsp; My only other guess from seeing&nbsp; P8:&nbsp; wusa&nbsp; would be that perhaps it has something to do with it but I know even less about WUSA than
 the scraps I've picked here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I notice that you have split stuff onto a D: drive.&nbsp; So, one possibility to look for which would include both facts is: something being "moved" there via Pending.XML.&nbsp; It could not be done via a rename which is typically the mechanism used to handle updates

</p><p>Just recently the hard drive has begun to run constantly. The PC is usable for about 5 minutes before slowing and becoming non-responsive.</p>
<p>It does not happen in safe mode.</p>
<p>I have tried a clean boot,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used Windows Defender to carry out a full scan in safe mode (it slowed to a halt in normal mode!). No threats found.</p>
<p>Can you offer any help?</p>

            <p>Managed to resolve issue myself. I realised that I couldn't open Windows Live Mail or Edge in Safe Mode. Decided to repair the Windows Live Essentials in the Control Panel Add/remove programs listing.
</p>
<p>It worked. </p>
<p>Don't know why it started though.</p>

<h2>            Don&#39;t have a product Key how to i Activate&#63;</h2>
                    Ive had windows 10 for a while and no matter how many times i get it activated every so often i continuously have to get it activated again. Im not sure whether it is a bug or what but i don't have the money to get the product key to activate it and this
 is getting kind of annoying. is anyone else having this issue? and if so how do i fix it?

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />General guide for Activation error in Windows:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/10738/...</a>

<br />To better diagnose the issue,
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.

            You need a product key to do a "permanent" activation. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like are running in trial mode. Trials last a limited time.  Actually, the fact that you are able to some how activate it multiple times suggests it is NOT a trial.
<br />
<br />Sorry, bottom line, if you want to use Windows you have to pay for a license.

            Hi Musical Photography, this does seem to be an issue caused by the 1803 update, a lot of users are reporting this over the last few days . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

 </blockquote> <p>Thanks for your reply Mister Maka. I got it from Amazon, this game is only on amazon and ebay right now. Bad things is game is 9.99 euro and the cargo was 14 euro If I remember correct,would be happier with a digital version, anyways backwards compability is one of the features I select xbox against ps, so waiting for my delivery to remember old SH 1 days :) Hope game is good as expected.&nbsp;</p>
