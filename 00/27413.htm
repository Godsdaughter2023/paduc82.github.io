<h2>            Outlook not displaying Unread message count</h2>
                    <p>I know this is going to sound similar to other questions asked, but I have an issue that seems to be the opposite. &nbsp;This is happening on my company founders machine. &nbsp;Windows 8 with Office 2013. &nbsp;Everything was working fine until a recent update (from his
 reports). &nbsp;Now when he has Outlook open sometimes the unread message count randomly disappears. &nbsp;I haven't been able to do a lot of testing as he only gives me a few minutes at a time on his machine (he's a busy guy, running the company and all).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that if I highlighted one of the Inbox sub folders, the count comes back. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running Outlook.exe /cleanviews. &nbsp;What I noticed was when Outlook opens the count is there but then instantly disappeared as the mailbox was loading. &nbsp;When I opened it again normally with no switches, the count was there. &nbsp;It has come and gone on
 its own before without any interaction from me so I'm not convinced the problem has gone away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one else ever see this? &nbsp;Any known permanent fixes?</p>

            <p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of email account is configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange and Exchange Active Sync)?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>If it is an Exchange Server, then your query would be better assisted in the <strong>

            It is an Exchange account. &nbsp;However I'm almost certain the issue is not with Exchange as none of the other employees who have this exact (or similar) setup have this issue. &nbsp;It is specific to this install of Outlook and some MS update that broke something.
 &nbsp;The issue was reported to have started only after a recent update. &nbsp;I have not been able to pinpoint which update it is yet or if removing it will resolve the issue.

<p>Unfortunately never seen a suggestion that works consistently.</p>

            That's why I was asking in here. &nbsp;I've seen a lot of posts about the opposite where it shows Unread message count even when there are no unread messages. &nbsp;Mine is not showing the count when there ARE unread messages. &nbsp;I'm thinking a recent update corrupted
 the local profile. &nbsp;Rebuilding the profile will be my next step, followed by a clean install of the Office Suite.

            Could try those, but from my experience with IMAP accounts and outlook 2010 / 2013, the problem reoccurs.

<p>
</p><p>As this forum is for Consumer level entry support, most of the settings/features/options of Exchange account are not known to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, ensure the service pack 1 for Office 2013 is installed in the Computer then check if that helps to resolve the issue.

            <p>Hi BobGeezer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked your account and upon investigation, I determined that your MSN&nbsp;account was an alias under your Live account.</p>
<p>It is possible that you accidentally renamed your account. Please be advised that once you renamed your account, the old account will become an alias of the new named account.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when you go to your mailbox, you will be prompted if you want to create a new folder or if you want to receive emails addressed to your MSN account directly to your inbox.</p>
<p>In your case, it is also possible that you selected to create a new folder. I suggest you to check if there is a folder in your mailbox with the same name with your MSN account.</p>
<p>Emails addresses to your MSN account ( your old email address) might be automatically moved or directed to this folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Can you please explain this in English?</p>
<p>I haven't renamed my 10 year old primary account anything.</p>
<p>I don't care what has happened: how do I correct the problem so I can recieve .msn emails?</p>
<p>The last one I got was in July.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a .msn folder in my HOTMAIL account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) but that has nothing to do with the problem as I see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is it possible that&nbsp;I can <strong>send</strong> emails from 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** or&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;but that I can't recieve them, and that, furthermore, there is nn indication to the sender (gmail accounts, for example) that they aren't
<strong>recieved</strong>?&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I appreciate your looking into my problem(s), however</p>
<p>I need a way out of them. </p>
<p>I can't recieve emails to my primary account, which was 
rdmcc@msn, for years and years.</p>
<p>I don't know if Windows Live Mail changed it to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** or not, making *** Email address is removed for privacy *** an alais?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an alias account that I never use: BobGeezer - I don't kow if it's on hotmail or msn.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Hotmail account works fine: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is it that I can still send, but not recieve emails from 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but not recieve any, and, when sending replys to msn.com, they don't arrive, but there's no rejected notice to the sender (e.g., my gmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything you can advise as to actually correcting this situation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail worked OK for a couple of&nbsp;years, but when Outlook came along, that was the beginning of all my problems.</p>

<p>It's too bad, because I've been a MS supporter for at least, 10 Years, and certainly won't be after this disaster.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, I’d like to collect some detailed information as follows:<br />
1. Do any other users in your users have the same issue?<br />
2. When did you notice this issue? Did it just occur all of a sudden?<br />
3. The entire mail header of the email which is delivered to the Undeliverable folder via private message. To retrieve the mail header, open the email&gt;<strong> File&gt; Info</strong> &gt;
<strong>Properties</strong>&gt; <strong>Internet Headers</strong>. You can access the private message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations<br />
4. To my knowledge, there is no such folder named <strong>Undeliverable</strong> by default in the Outlook client. So did you create it on your own? If yes, did you also set up any inbox rules that may move incoming emails to a specific folder? If not, please
 provide more information about how the folder is initially created for our better understanding.
<br />
5. Since all the users are using Office 365 Enterprise E3 plan, to isolate the issue from the Outlook client, please disconnect the client and send a test email of the kind you mentioned, then check if it will be moved to the Undeliverable folder in
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>thanks sam</p>
<p>1. yes, other users have this issue, client software versions; outlook 2016, outlook 2013, outlook for mac 2016</p>
<p>2. i noticed last week that an email had disappeared from microsoft partner services and today from my microsoft account manager. other people in our organisation noticed the folder a few months back</p>
<p>3. we have a messageheaderanalyzer app install on our exchange apps, the header looks ok.</p>
<p>4. agreed there is no such folder as default. a few users have checked outlook rules, one user doesn't have any local rules but still has messages being delivered to undeliverable folder.</p>
<p>5. i have been using owa since 11am to isolate client side and server side. it is difficult to send test messages as not all messages fail. this is emails from the microsoft account manager.</p>
<p>10.06 - undeliverable </p>
<p>14.06 - undeliverable</p>
<p>i then responded and her replies went to the inbox</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a55030f2-5c1b-4e26-8ed2-91f111fbad4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da55030f2-5c1b-4e26-8ed2-91f111fbad4c" /></a></p>
<p>i have just sent some test messages bcc sales group and:</p>
<p>"the koala and the lizard"</p>
<p>mark - inbox but deleted it</p>
<p>jordan - was reading it and went to his undeliverable folder after a little while 30sec/1min</p>
<p>dave - went to his clutter folder</p>
<p>next test message</p>
<p>"the fling scotsman"</p>
<p>mark - inbox</p>
<p>jordan - was reading it and went to his undeliverable folder</p>
<p>dave - went to his clutter folder</p>
<p>i have just gone through a bunch of emails with dave that were also sent to me and the pattern is undeliverable/clutter
</p>
<p>asked several people in the office about undeliverable and everyone's "messages moved to clutter" are there.</p>
<p>with checked all the rules on the exchange server and there's nothing there that could do this.</p>
<p>i'm leaning towards this folder being a clutter folder and some issues server side with clutter.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed updates. I’m sorry for my last post which looks a bit strange for the time being. Actually, your post was blocked when I replied in forum and then released after my post. Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
I have checked all your information, it seems you’ve already contacted other Microsoft supports regarding the issue, am I correct? If yes, would you mind providing the SR number in the private message so that we can review the case log and monitor it from our
 side?</p>
<p>Thanks for working closely with Office 365.</p>

<p>One of our helpdesk guys have raised a case; </p>
<p>They have also tried moving all the mail out to another folder and deleting the Undeliverable folder. Then rebooted, on restart the folder was back and all the email moved back into the Undeliverable folder. I've just tried something else and moved Outlook
 out of Cached mode at 15:00 today. so i'll wait and see it that does anything! I doubt it will as this is looking like server side issues.

<p>I have been experimenting over the weekend.</p>
<p>I have switched cache mode off - made no difference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Discovered that the email if moved from the Undeliverable folder to inbox returns to the Undeliverable folder after a short while. Mails moved from Undeliverable to Clutter stay in Clutter as long as they are in clutter for a while they can then be moved
 to the inbox and stay in the inbox. I think there is an issue in the way Clutter is functioning server side and clutter emails are being delivered to this Undeliverable folder. Are there any tags in email headers that Exchange Server uses to flag Clutter or
 is clutter managed in an Exchange side DB?</p>
<p>Any tech docs on clutter and how clutter functions? </p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>Regarding “Are there any tags in email headers that Exchange Server uses to flag Clutter”, the answer is no, Email message headers provide a list of technical details about the message, such as who sent it, the software used to compose it, and the email
 servers that it passed through on its way to the recipient.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are some articles that indicate how Clutter works:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Clutter-to-sort-low-priority-messages-in-Outlook-7b50c5db-7704-4e55-8a1b-dfc7bf1eafa0?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Use-Clutter-to-sort-low-priority-messages-in-Outlook-7b50c5db-7704-4e55-8a1b-dfc7bf1eafa0</a></p>

                    Twice in a week I have had my screen hijacked by a fake Microsoft Security Essentials error message&nbsp;requesting me to call 1-855-628-1810 for technical help. The screen background is all red with three sub screens on it. The only thing I was able to do
 was to shutdown. The&nbsp;PC came up ok , but want to know why Win Defender is allowing this to happen. Running Win 10.&nbsp; The red screen came up under a browser&nbsp;tab that said: Google Chrome&nbsp;Update.

<h2>            Javascript calendar control not working in IE10&#43;Windows 8</h2>
                    We have noticed that with Internet Explorer 10/Windows 8, the calendar isn't working properly. We have noticed the following things:<br />
<br />
1) The year isn't shown correctly, it shows 13, 14 etc up to 213, instead of 2013, 2014 etc.<br />
<br />
2) It's not possible to select 2012 or 2014, 2015 etc. If we select 13, it enters the year 2013. If we enter 14, it enters the year 1914. If we enter 133 it enters the year 1767 etc.<br />

<h2>            Using OneNote to Keep Track of Projects With Mutiple Contractors Who Are NOT My Employees</h2>
                    <p>Funny thing, but I've been an Office 365 user for at least two years now, I believe this is my third renewal coming up very soon and was using Office (mainly Excel and Word, occasionally Publisher too) for many years prior as well and I LOVE 365, what does
 it for me is the seamless integration with OneDrive, 1TB for each of 5 licenses and other than the pics I take for my biz (real estate and home renovation biz-I take TONS of pics to document work being done and even just to remind myself of various issues
 that need to be addressed as its often much easier than ether hand writing on paper or putting it on my tablet or laptop) but the pics use most of the smidgen of the 1 TB I use, even a complex Excel file isn't exactly a "data hog", but I've also been using
 Evernote for personal organization and WAS looking into how to set up Evernote to keep track of these various projects with the various contractors I use regularly, which can involve a full renovation of a badly treated home or multi unit dwelling, maintenance
 on rental units, etc., but then something funny happened!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so wrapped up in Evernote (and it is a great program/app for what it does) that I feel a bit dumb admitting I NEVER knew a thing about OneNote! It was only when trying to figure out the same question I've got here regarding OneNote that I did a search
 and saw an article titled something like "Evernote vs OneNote which is better for what use" and find out Microsoft makes OneNote (along with Google's version, Keep? Which from what I read isn't in the same league as these two) and this article seemed to have
 the conclusion that for the "work group" type features, (exactly what I NEED to do to keep order with my biz, transition from this being my personal organizer to being the ONE AND ONLY SOURCE from which ALL info and updates on various projects will come from
 as I've got a problem with too many people asking me the same question MANY times over, various back channel communication say between a plumber and an electrician and they both think the other one is going to fill me in on some important news or decision
 that must be made asap but they're both wrong and neither says a word, etc I NEED THIS ALL IN ONE SPOT AND ONE SPOT ONLY!!!)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote was the clear winner according to several articles I read in the along the same Evernote vs OneNote theme when it came to using either in a multi user, office or business setting, Evernote usually won on things like the "web clipper" (I still haven't
 ever used that!) PLUS, several said that for current Office 365/OneDrive users, OneNote over Evernote was a "no brainer" and that the seamless integration with the One Drive continues through to OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, that all makes a lot of sense then and assuming its all true, then I'm likely sold on OneNote (right after I'd FINALLY convinced several contractors, a few of whom aren't too "tech savvy" like where sending just a simple text only email is pretty "high
 tech" stuff, to download Evernote onto their smartphones, on which of course they use none of the features that make them "smartphones"!!) but here's my question, because these are ALL legally separate contractors, all with their own legit businesses, whether
 its an LLC or incorporated, NONE of them are my employees and/or on my payroll, as I gave up the massive hassle and endless government forms (and huge government penalties if you screw anything up, like forgetting to notify payroll company about yet another
 new hire who doesn't pay their child support, then I get to pay it myself, no thanks!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the various plans, I see where much like Evernote Business, if I owned a small biz with let's say 10 employees total, including myself, I could get 10 accounts through Evernote Business at $12/month per user, so $120/month total and then we'd
 all not only be able to use it individually as I do now for both keeping personal and business related notes, but we can all choose certain work related Notebooks and Notes to share with the entire staff, or maybe just the 4 people working on some particular
 project, etc and looks like it is basically the same deal with OneNote, but my issue is that again I don't have any direct hire employees (or even employees through a temp service or something like that) I simply deal with outside contractors and although
 I've got maybe 6 of them I use regularly, just since Jan 1 of 2016, I've written checks to a total over over 20 separate outside contractors for work they've done, as well as more checks to various vendors, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I see the incredible payback possibilities both money wise AND (just as important if not more important) in the reduction of my stress level etc to use either app to really organize things 10x better than they are now and have no qualms even paying
 the $12 or $13/month for each of those 6 regular contractors I use, but for this to really work, I'd need to have ALL of them able to share these notes and see the latest updates and by year end, that could easily be 50+ accounts! $600 a month is a sizeable
 chunk of change to me, I'm not Bill Gates after all! I don't want to do some cheapskate workaround either, like doing a daily cut and paste of each updated project every morning to my email and emailing it out and that defeats the whole "real time in sync
 across all platforms" feature that I'd say is the basic underpinning of Evernote and I'm assuming must be the same with OneNote, which I'm just starting to explore as we speak.</p>
<p>I'd GREATLY APPRECIATE ANY ADVICE, ANY IDEAS on how I ought to handle and set this up, its been a rather stressful year or so for me and looking back, I swear AT LEAST 50% if not far more of that stress can be easily eliminated by having everything in one
 spot, all info coming from one single source, be it OneNote, Evernote or whatever note!! Thanks in advance for your help!<br />

<p>
</p><p>Yes, apparently you did not read the VBA Mod help page.&nbsp; It states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>``Usually, the <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">data type of <em>result</em> is a Byte, Byte variant, Integer, Integer variant, Long</span></strong>, or Variant containing a Long, regardless of whether or not
<em>result</em> is a whole number. <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Any fractional portion is truncated.</span></strong> However, if any expression is Null,
<em>result</em> is Null. Any expression that is Empty is treated as 0.``</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is, the VBA Mod function is really only useful with integer operands.&nbsp; You are correct to use the Int expression instead for non-integers and for integers that might be larger than type Long can handle.</p>

            <p>Please <em>do not</em> remove/install the software. That's like amputating your arm &amp; sewing it back on again to address a hangnail. Besides, it isn't clear that you're referring to Dock icons in the first place &amp; installing Office 2016 doesn't add the application
 icons to the Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is the Dock icons you're referring to you should find that removing the Excel icon then dragging the actual application icon from the Applications folder to the Dock will restore the association. If not, there may be more to be addressed that reinstalling
 isn't likely to fix.</p>

                    <p>If you modify the default permission level for a site group (for example, if you change the permission level for Site Members from Edit to Contribute), and then select Site Permissions from the Gear in a modern SharePoint site, the permissions pane will
 still show that users in that group have the previous default permission level (Edit). If you click through to Advanced Site Permissions it displays the proper permissions. This is confusing for end users who are referencing and managing permissions. Please

<p><span>Hi Dave,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what you mean. The site permissions pane now only shows edit/read/full control permissions. The other permissions can’t be shown correctly.
</p>
<p>For your concern, this problem has been posted by other members to our UserVoice. We suggest you vote this UserVoice:

Permissions in the "Site permissions side menu" need to reflect custom permissions against my site</a> and monitor it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Multiple picture resize in MS Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nh1370  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple picture resize in MS Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I do a lot of work in Excel. &nbsp;this involves a lot of images. &nbsp;In the last couple weeks, IT upgraded my software from Office 2010 to Office 2016. &nbsp;I usually build a quick launch bar and minimize the ribbon, as it takes up too much room. &nbsp;MSO2016 seems to
 really like wasting space and unreadable color schemes.</p>
<p>I am pasting multiple images into Excel, and I need to resize all of them to be (for example) 2" wide each. &nbsp;Historically, I right click and change them via the width/height option. &nbsp;MSO in it's infinite wisdom removed this. &nbsp;I found it buried in the ribbon
 I have collapsed.</p>
<p>Is there a way to add this back into the right-click menu? &nbsp;I use this far to often to have to hunt it out on the ribbon and the custom ribbon is only so practical, since things can't be widened or really modified to make it practical.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I am not happy with 2016. &nbsp;After 4 weeks, I find myself 2 weeks behind... and I would say I am a fairly advanced user after 20 years and many classes. &nbsp;I even had a class on MSO2016 Excel before having it installed, as I use it that much
 and can't afford the productivity loss. &nbsp;MSO seems to be dumbing down the older it gets. &nbsp;Microsoft could at least make it so people can modify things back to a useable format to avoid the loss in productivity.</p>

    <title>Macros in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernt_r&#246;nnberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macros in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to insert a macro in MS Outlook. My problem is that I am by no means an expert on the Visual Basic language. In the past, I have recorded macros in Excel with the help of the Record Macro button. After recording the macros, I have been able
 to make small changes to the code directly in the Visual Basic editor view, as the Visual Basic language seems quite logical. But I have never started a macro from scratch in the Visual Basic editor since my knowledge of the language is almost non-existent.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with Outlook is that there is no possibility to record a macro. I would like my macro to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like it to select or go to the Sent Items folder. In the Sent Items folder, it should select all messages and move them to the Sent Messages folder. It's a very short and simple chain of operations, but I don't have a clue how to express this in
 the Visual Basic language. Is there some kind Visual Basic wizard out there who could help me by telling me if such a macro is possible, and by sending me the code needed to accomplish such a macro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance for your help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bernt</p>

<p>The short answer is yes it can be done, but there is some confusion as to where you want to move messages to. It seems you are moving them to where they are already located.

<p>Dear Mr Mayor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly for taking the time to reply to my question. The confusion may come from the fact that I didn't explain all the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed iCloud for Windows on my Windows 10 PC and my iCloud account is set up in Microsoft Outlook. The synchronisation between my iPhone and PC works well for received emails in the inbox and all the subfolders, but it doesn't work perfectly for
 sent emails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mail app on my iPhone uses different terminology (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Sent Messages</strong></span>) than Outlook (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Sent Items</strong></span>). When installing iCloud Windows,
 the folder Sent Messages was automatically added to Outlook. This means that any messages I send from the Mail app on my iPhone will be visible in the folder Sent Messages in Outlook. However, when I send messages from my iCloud account in Outlook on my PC,
 they are stored in the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Sent Items</strong></span> folder and do not synhronise to the Sent Messages (Sent for short but in the Settings the folder is called Sent Messages) on my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a macro via Google written by another gentleman that monitors the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Sent Items</strong></span> folder in Outlook and immediately saves a copy in
 Sent Items folder to the Sent Messages folder in Outlook, it did synchronise to my iPhone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I wanted to have a macro that simply moves messages from the Sent Items to the Sent Messages on a regular, i.e. daily or even hourly basis. I hope this explanation clarifies the confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply and useful advice.</p>

    <title>An advice about Lock Screen &#124; Cellular in Action Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surawich sunws  say:</h3>
<h2>            An advice about Lock Screen &#124; Cellular in Action Center</h2>
                    <p>In this discussion, I suggest two things about Windows Phone Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ONE]</p>
<p>On Windows 8, there are three types of password which you can use to lock your computer.</p>
<p>1. Common Password</p>
<p>2. PIN</p>
<p>3. Picture Password</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that it must be great if we can lock our phone with these three types of password. And I think that picture password is a great way to unlock Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[TWO]</p>
<p>It must be great if we can enable/disable Cellular Data on the Action Center.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 ProRetail stuck at 90&#37; - have disabled print spooler</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Having troubles with Office 365.... again.<br />
<br />
Getting stuck at 90%, have stopped the printer spooler but still having no luck. Have also tried stopping the firewall and any other services that I think may interfere with the process. Have also run the Fix Tool to remove anything that has been installed
 and tried all over again numerous times. <br />
<br />
Cheers,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            The Zune software can&#39;t access important data on your Zune</h2>
                    I have a Zune HD 16gb and I get an error, "The Zune software can't access important data on your Zune," even though I've updated the Zune software. After updating it, I connect my Zune and after a couple seconds, the error pop up. When I try to update
 my device, it gives me an error of C1010009 and says I was unable to update the Zune. It also said to connect my device even though it's connected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, when I press the "internet" button of my Zune, I immediately get a black screen even though my audio was still playing. I turned it off and restarted it, pressed the internet button again and same thing happen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do I have to resort to deleting everything in my Zune?

            Thanks, but I did those steps already. <br />
<br />
First, I updated the Zune software, thinking that was the main problem. Once it was updated I connected the Zune and tried to update the device, but I had that error that says the software can't access important data.
<br />
<br />
I think due to that error, it won't let me update the device. I turned it on and off, reconnected it and same problem occurs. After that error pops up, it says my device is not connected when indeed it is. I believe something's wrong with the Zune internally
 rather than the software. <br />

 Nothing changed. Zune is getting charged though... :-)<br />
<br />
When I restarted the Zune device I get this error "5&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact support." and there is a picture if Zune with a cross mark on it. Now the Zune is hung and nothing is happening. Its just wasting electricity. Does this mean my Zune is no more? My $300 are wasted?<br />

<h2>            N8 not charging after warranty repair</h2>
                    
<div>Hi,<br />
<br />
I sent by N8 to a Nokia care point in October 2012 as the bottom piece that enters the battery compartment had broken in one corner and thought I'd better get it fixed before the warranty expired in November 2012. When it was returned I checked it turned on
 and reloaded some of the software, however I then requested an unlock code from orange UK and that was the end of that as I had already made my sim into a mini sim for my new Nokia 808. Although I have&nbsp;just received&nbsp;an unlock code from orange (another story
 altogether) however when I turned my phone on the battery was nearly depleted.<br />
<br />
When trying to charge it with the mini jack, the battery icon doesn't change to indicate it is charging, I have tried many different Nokia chargers with the mini jack and it does nothing. When I plug it into&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;it recognises it as a Nokia N8 and connects
 to Nokia suite OK, it then tries to charge showing the nokia logo, and dot sequence but then disappears and stops charging. I have also tried starting the charge on my 808 pureview USB charger&nbsp;and then plugging the charger back into the N8 to the same effect
 as plugging it into the laptop.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this kind of thing before?<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Could a connector be disconnected beneath the bottom cover leading into the battery compartment?<br />
<br />
Is is possibly the battery that is the problem, is it worth putting it in my 808 to see if it will charge in that?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What are nokia like with repairing this fault as it was fine before I sent it for warrenty repair?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Robin.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of things to try:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does unlocking the screen before inserting charger make any difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With USB connection to PC you may&nbsp;need to remove microUSB and wait until it shows (on PC)
<em><strong>disconnected,</strong></em>&nbsp;then plug back in and see if &nbsp;two or three attempts of
<em>plug&gt;unplug&gt;plug</em> make any difference to result.</p>

            @aspergerguy<br />
<br />
The screen in generally unlocked when I have been trying to, but it makes no difference.<br />
<br />
As I said before USB charging does attempt to work but fails when the dot sequence starts. I have plugged in and unplugged in the way you have suggested to no avail.

            have you tried to charge it using an USB charger? You shouls see a white light beside the USB port of your phone and it will light up while charging, even on the mini jack, it will also light up. :)

<p>Maybe your phone battery or your OS has the problem. My phone is sometimes not charging, so I decided to refurbish it, and now it works better, and faster. :)</p>
<p><br />
I don't suggest you to do what I did, you should try to go to the nearest Nokia Care Services. Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hi Raghavan，<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing experience with us.<br />
<br />
For the error message, version conflict messages typically appear if you and another user attempt to change the same paragraph of notes at the same time, or if you make changes while another user's changes are being synchronized. You may also receive an error
 message if you and another user changed the same paragraph while you were both offline.<br />
Please try doing the following steps to check the outcome.<br />
1.<span> </span>Click the yellow Information bar at the top of your page to view a page that lists the conflicting changes.<br />
2.<span> </span>Incorporate the changes into the main page, if necessary.<br />
3.<span> </span>When you finish incorporating any changes, delete the Conflicts page by right-clicking its page tab and then clicking Delete on the shortcut menu.<br />
4.<span> </span>For your S5, open application manager and find OneNote to clear the cache.<br />
Regarding point 4 you describe above” You will see that dates …”, could you please share more details on the two dates?<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information with you:<br />
1.<span> </span>Have you edited your notebook on your phone without Wi-Fi connection?<br />
2.<span> </span>Two screenshots about the version of OneNote both on your PC and smartphone.<br />
3.<span> </span>Anything you had performed before this issue occurred?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>William</p>

<h2>            What are the negative effects of disabling Msseces.exe from startup</h2>
                    What are the negative effects of removing the msseces.exe registry entry under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"?&nbsp; I personally don't like the tray icon and hate using the "hide inactive icon" feature.<br />
<br />
Will my MSE still detect viruses, spyware, and malware and then alert me when it detects it?&nbsp; Will my MSE still auto update by itself when new virus definitions are released?<br />
<br />
Here's another question if you guys can answer it.&nbsp; I read that MSE uses "Windows Update" to update MSE virus/malware definitions.&nbsp; I currently have my Windows Update to "Notify me but don't automatically download or install them", so will MSE still update
 by itself or will it just pop up a notification like normal windows update?

<br />
A1. No &amp; No.<br />
<br />
A2. MSE auto-updates silently &amp; in the background (assuming MSE is running in the background). No "pop-up notifications."

<h2>            Switching numbered autoformats to plain text</h2>
                    <p>I am converting a word Doc to use it on a web page, and I like the auto number format feature.&nbsp; (I make a lot of lists.)&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I try to transfer the document to how I want it to show on a different program, all the formatting&nbsp;is wonky.&nbsp;

<p>did the "remove all styles" trick. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the numbers go away, too!</p>

            You can use a macro to convert auto numbers to text. Make sure the document you want to convert is the active document. Press Alt+F11 to display the Visual Basic Editor. Press Ctrl+G to activate the Immediate window. Type<br />
<br />
ActiveDocument.ConvertNumbersToText<br />
<br />
and press Enter. All auto numbers, including LISTNUM fields, will be converted to static text. Note that if numbering was applied with styles, you have to remove the numbering from the styles as well; otherwise it may resurface, for example when you press Ctrl+Q
 to reset paragraph formatting.
