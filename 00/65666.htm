    <title>New Update is the worst thing I&#39;ve ever experienced with Skype. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Update is the worst thing I&#39;ve ever experienced with Skype.  Issues within.</h2>
                    <p>First off, trying to just get help with the issues with Skype for Android is the worst thing ever. &nbsp;I have so much rage for this "ask the community" thing that I am shaking writing this. &nbsp;Skype has little to no connectivity on my Galaxy S7. &nbsp;This new update
 is out that changes the UI and it is the most buggy, frustrating, horrendous thing I've ever seen come out for Skype. &nbsp;And there have been some pretty horrible updates to begin with. &nbsp;Trying to get into contact to get some help is impossible it seems, so I'm
 going to lay out my questions to the "community" here.<br />
<br />
First of all I've uninstalled and reinstalled Skype. &nbsp;If I could find a way to take it back to the previous update I definitely would. &nbsp;So any tips on that would be oh so greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Skype will not connect to 4g or wifi networks. &nbsp;It constantly disconnects,
 and is the only app I have having this issue. &nbsp;I've tested my connectivity with other apps and devices, and it is the only one having any issues sending messages. &nbsp;If I want these messages I send out to be delivered, I have to uninstall and reinstall this
 god forsaken thing.<br />
<br />
If Discord or any other chat-centric app had the ability to video call I would use that instead of Skype at this rate, because I am so out of my mind frustrated with this thing that I'm about to just say oh well and delete it permanently from my phone and my
 computer. &nbsp;If I had any other means to video call to my partner, who is in another country, I would. &nbsp;Because frankly, I am tired of dealing with this. &nbsp;It worked mostly alright before the update, and now it can barely function.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Aside from the crappy connectivity, it also repeats my messages about five times when they do send automatically. &nbsp;Which they rarely do. &nbsp;The next message will pop up containing most of the words from the prior message. &nbsp;This at least doesn't break anything,
 but it is really annoying. &nbsp;Any ideas for fixes for this would be greatly appreciated, since apparently Microsoft's cs is so poor they can't even provide a direct contact for getting help with these issues.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Next issue is the calling. &nbsp;The calling will freeze on the phone app, with no way to go back to the video itself. &nbsp;If you go away from the video for any amount of time, it ends the video half the time. &nbsp;The other half it will end the video's visuals and
 leave only the audio behind, so the call will need to be ended and restarted if you don't want to lose the visual portion if you say check another app or accidentally press your phone's home button.<br />
<br />
Again, any fixing options or at least a tech bandaid would be appreciated at this point. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community and thank you for the detailed feedback on your experiences with the new Skype clients. I am suprised by some of the issues your having as I havent heard the same feedback from others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first like to provide a summary of the issues your reporting and then hopefully I can provide some answers for you.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The client is frequently unable to connect via 4G or Wifi</li><li>When it does connect it will repeat the same message up to 5 times</li><li>when you compose a message you frequently get the last word from the last message printed at the start of the next message</li><li>When in a call backgrounding the call will result in the call freezing and requiring to be restarted or video to be lost.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So assuming this is an accurate summary lets look at each one for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Unable to connect via 4G or Wifi</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unusal especially as you say other apps are working. Could you, when in this state, please type /dumpmsnp in a chat window. You may find it looks like nothing has been printed but if you long press on the white space it should let you copy it and
 paste it in here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Message sent multiple times</span></p>
<p>I'll be honest this is a new one on me and I will need to ask the team for some input so I will get back to you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Last word from last message gets printed as the first word in the new message.</span></p>
<p>This issue appears to only be impacting Samsung devices which have autocorrect enabled, see
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA34713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this FAQ </a>for more updates on the autocorrect issue. We are investigating a fix.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Backgrounding the Skype App results in call drop, freeze or video to stop</span></p>
<p>We have been able to duplicate this when you start another program that uses the audio stack will result in the call dropping. We are investigating and plan to fix this in a future release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Something similar here. Installed Skype on my new Galaxy S7. Skype will not send or receive any messages when wifi is connected (just shows the little circle and "Sending"). Turn off wifi and all the messages go out and come in. Turn on wifi again, everything
 stops. Haven't tried video yet. It was working fine on my old S3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, it's a brand new phone. Regardless, I uninstalled, reinstalled Skype, signed out, signed in, rebooted, turned off the PC app,&nbsp;etc, etc. No luck.</p>

<h2>            FAQ for Jigsaw</h2>
                    <p>After I in-installed, rebooted, and reinstalled, when I tried to load classic jigsaw I got a pop-up message to go to FAQ for jigsaw and lookup error 303019. There was no URL for the FAQ however. How do I find this FAQ?</p>

    <title>Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t login to old xbox account... Why - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nate64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t login to old xbox account... Why doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t my Microsoft Account &#40;LiveID&#41; follow the format &#38;quot&#59;&#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42;&#38;quot&#59;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Roughly 7 or 8 years ago, I bought an Xbox and created a gamertag for my new online profile. &nbsp;(I believe this was back before all Xbox gamertags were associated with a "Microsoft Account" or "Live ID".) &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then, about 5 or 6 years ago, I bought the new Xbox 360 to replace it. &nbsp;Rather than transferring over my old gamertag to the new console, I just created a brand new gamertag, with a new email address used to register the online profile. &nbsp;I essentially left
 the original gamertag alone for years.<br />
<br />
Flash forward to a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;On a whim, I tried to change my current/new gamertag to the same name that I registered years ago. &nbsp;(I was guessing it could possibly be available again due to such a long period of inactivity.) &nbsp;After checking to see if
 it was ever purged or re-registered, I was surprised to find that the gamertag is still in use. &nbsp;And to my delight... I'm apparently still the owner! &nbsp;&nbsp;I was obviously excited, because I thought that if I could still remember my login information I could probably
 recover the account. (I was a little fuzzy on the exact password, but figured I could always do a password reset.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>My next step was obviously to see if I could login to the Microsoft Account that should be associated with this profile by visiting "<em>login.live.com</em>" and typing in the original email address. &nbsp;I gave it a try, but unfortunately I was met with an
 error stating that there is no Microsoft Account associated with the address I provided. &nbsp;(This is obviously a big problem!) &nbsp;Because I was 100% certain that this email address is the one associated with my old Xbox account, I called Microsoft/Xbox customer
 support to see if they could help me figure out why I couldn't use it to login&nbsp;<em>as a Live ID</em>.</p>
<p>Microsoft/Xbox support requested the gamertag so they could send a verification code to the email address associated with the account, so I gave it to them. &nbsp;I promptly received the code in my old email inbox, and read it back the service representative.
 &nbsp;At this point, she informs me that because I gave them the code and proved I was the owner of the account, they could now give me my Microsoft Account ID. &nbsp;Success! &nbsp;(Or so I thought....)</p>
<p>However, my Account ID was apparently not the same as the email address I used to register. &nbsp;For the sake of example, let's pretend my old gamertag was: "<strong>abc10</strong>". &nbsp;Well, the service representative informs me that my Microsoft Account ID is&nbsp;registered
 as "<strong>abc10.owner</strong>"! &nbsp;Uhhhhh... what? (At this point, we are both trying to figure out why it is not an email address.) &nbsp;The service representative tells me to attempt to type it in on "<em>login.live.com</em>" so I can go through the password
 reset steps, but the only problem is I keep getting the following error when I input this ID:<br />
<br />
"<span>Please enter your email address in the format *** Email address is removed for privacy ***."<br />
</span></p>
<p>The customer service representative then informed me that she would have to escalate my issue to the Microsoft Customer Advocacy and Exceptions department, and that I should expect a follow up within about a week. &nbsp;I have not heard back from anyone up to
 this point, but it is still early.</p>
<p>I hope that my issue can be resolved, but I am still left wondering how this could have happened. &nbsp;I was really hoping someone could shed some light on the evolution of the Microsoft Account (i.e. "Live ID".) &nbsp;Was there ever a point in time that this Microsoft
 Account ID could be registered as anything other than an email address? &nbsp;Alternatively, is there any way of knowing what happened to the rest of all the first-generation xbox gamertags that may not have been previously associated with a Microsoft account?
 &nbsp;Surely, these can't have all been automatically assigned a Live ID in the format of "<strong>gamertag.owner</strong>".<br />
<br />
I realize that this is an off-the-wall type of question, and that an outstanding ticket with the Customer Advocacy group would make posting this question here seem superfluous... but at this point I'm really just trying to satisfy my curiosity as to what exactly
 happened to my account. &nbsp;Hopefully someone has some insight into the whole process of how these xbox gamer profiles are linked to Microsoft account logins.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses, but I thought I should definitely update this thread once more with the message I recently received from the Customer Advocacy representative.</p>
<p>By my own admission, I was not expecting to be able to recover the account in the first place... but still, I was hoping for an intelligible reply to my service request. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I can't help but feel extremely dissatisfied with response I received
 from the Customer Advocacy Team. &nbsp;As an (obviously) long-standing customer, I feel very offended that a Microsoft customer service representative would cut off correspondence with their client/customer in such an arbitrary fashion, without offering any further
 assistance, alternative solution(s), or opportunity for further questions.</p>
<p>Also, after explaining that there is no way to recover/convert my gamertag over to the new system (despite my ability to prove that I am indeed the original account holder...) &nbsp;I would at the very least expect for all of the personal information (email,
 phone, etc.) associated with my inaccessible and un-retrievable account to be removed from their databases. &nbsp;Otherwise, why retain it at all? &nbsp;I spent quite a long time on the phone with customer representatives that feigned being able to provide assistance
 to me on the basis of my information appearing as a legitimate account in their system.</p>
<p>I guess at the end of the day, I'm no worse for wear... but I am extremely upset that ANY customer representative thinks it's appropriate to advise "Sorry, but it just doesn't work that way" and then cut off correspondence with a vested customer who has
 been with them for almost a decade. &nbsp;It's pretty pitiful, if you ask me.... but read for yourselves:</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Hi XXXXX,</p>
<p>My name is XXXXX and I am with the Xbox Customer Care Advocacy Team. I would like to thank you for taking the time to contact us in regards to your Xbox LIVE account. &nbsp;Rest assured that I am committed to resolving your issue quickly and efficiently. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>The Gamer Tag "XXXXX" has been attached to a V1 Xbox account since 1/16/2005. All Xbox users were given ample notice about the conversion from V1 to the new version of Xbox Live accounts. If for any reason a user did not change their credentials or switched
 over to the new version: it is now permanently stuck/attached to the V1 account and cannot be re-associated to the new Xbox Live account; do to strenuous technical reasons the GT "XXXXX" will not and cannot be released or deleted from its setting.</p>
<p>I apologize that Microsoft Support agents cannot further assist with this issue and I will be closing your service request which closes all email correspondence regarding the matter.</p>
<p>I hope you understand that we value your loyalty to the Xbox LIVE service and we hope that you can continue to enjoy the unique Xbox LIVE experience</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>XXXXXXX</p>

<p>Digital: It requires an email and password to recover. Otherwise it's lost. I've made multiple attempts, one being within the last 3 months, to get it back. I have all of the original information including my old address and card number. Nothing can be done.</p>

<h2>            How do I get Windows 10 ver. 1703 to update to ver. 1709&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This computer has Windows 10 ver. 1703 updated from a retail version of Windows 7 Pro. I have the original Windows 7 retail DVD. My legal version of Windows 10 version 1703 has tried two times to update to Windows 10 version 1709 and has been unsuccessful.
 The normal update downloads Windows 10 version 1709 and starts to install it and gets about 45% installed and then a window appears that is labeled: "Windows Setup" inside the window is a red circle in the upper left corner with a white X. The text inside
 the window says: "Windows could not configure one or more components to install Windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation." But when I restart the computer I get a black screen and the following white letters appear: "Restoring your previous
 version of Windows."--then Windows reopens with the 1703 version of Windows 10 and it functions normally. When the 1703 version of Windows 10 started to update it said: "Feature Update to Windows 10, Version 1709. It has tried to update to the 1709 version
 two times and has failed both times with the same error window. How can I get help getting by this error window and getting the Windows 10 version 1703 on this computer updated to Windows 10 version 1709? Thank you.</p>

<p>This is an upgrade problem.</p>
<p>There are many causes for upgrade failures.</p>
<p>They can be troubleshooted by viewing the Panther logs.</p>
<p>By default they may be hidden.</p>
<p>If an upgrade fails often the operating system returns to the prior working version and generates the logs.</p>
<p>It takes time to troubleshoot these logs.</p>
<p>Many of the entries in the logs are error codes that need to be decoded and deciphered.</p>
<p>Some of the problems could be:&nbsp; problems with drivers, AV, insufficient disk space in partitions, etc.</p>
<p>The error codes are important as this would be the method to start the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open file explorer &gt; search for &gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\$windows.~bt\sources\panther</p>
<p>Within this folder you may find many files.</p>
<p>Look for:</p>
<p>setuperr.log</p>
<p>setupact.log</p>
<p>setupmem.dmp</p>
<p>bluebox.log</p>
<p>rollback</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be easier to find these logs using everything search: &nbsp;http://www.voidtools.com/</p>
<p>You should see immediate results as you enter characters and the more characters you enter the narrower the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use one drive or drop box to post the logs that you find.</p>

<p>As I&nbsp;stated the 1703 version of Windows 10 works well on my home built computer. Intel 6800K, ASUS Sabertooth X79, 64GB RAM, and yes I've run the "Windows Update Troubleshooter" and asked for an Update to the latest version of Windows 10. The update system
 appears to be downloading and installing the latest version of Windows 10, but it stops with an error window I have previously described. The window appears when the update stops, and it is labeled "Windows Setup". It is a white window with a red circle in
 the upper left hand corner with a white X in the middle of the red circle. Inside the window the text says: "Windows could not configure one or more system components. To install Windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation." and in the
 bottom right of the window is a small window with "OK' to click. When I click the "OK" button I get a reboot with black screen&gt; ASUS logo&gt; Windows logo&gt;then black screen, with white letters saying "Restoring your previous version of Windows"&gt; then Windows
 logo again&gt; "Working on updates to complete. Don't turn off your computer."&gt;then I'm back at my desktop. If I click Win logo +R and type winver&gt; I'm back to "Microsoft Windows Version 1703 (OS Build 15063.729) As I have previously stated, the update system
 will not update from Windows 10&nbsp;version 1703 to Windows 10 version 1709. Do you have any specific information about how I can get my computer updated to Windows 10 version 1709 (OS Build 16299.64)? If you don't have information about how I can do that, can
 you tell me how I can get help from Microsoft to get my Windows 10 updated to the latest version? Thank you.</p>

<p>This is an upgrade problem.</p>
<p>There are many causes for upgrade failures.</p>
<p>They can be troubleshooted by viewing the Panther logs.</p>
<p>By default they may be hidden.</p>
<p>If an upgrade fails often the operating system returns to the prior working version and generates the logs.</p>
<p>It takes time to troubleshoot these logs.</p>
<p>Many of the entries in the logs are error codes that need to be decoded and deciphered.</p>
<p>Some of the problems could be:&nbsp; problems with drivers, AV, insufficient disk space in partitions, etc.</p>
<p>The error codes are important as this would be the method to start the troubleshooting.</p>

<p>There is a setupact with 103,990 KB but no setupact.log and there is also a setuperr with 10 KB but no setupact.log. I don't find a setupmem.dmp or bluebox.log, or rollback. There is no problem with memory on the C:\ drive as it is a 930GB Samsung SSD. I
 don't see anything that is labeled an error code. If I do find logs I'm not sure how to post them to "one drive" or "drop box" as you suggest. Can the "Update" reinstall Windows 10? When the system tries to update it takes a very long time that seems long
 enough to completely reinstall Windows 10, but&nbsp;I surmise it doesn't because it&nbsp;still doesn't solve this problem and it returns me to Windows 10 version 1703.&nbsp;Can I get help from Microsoft with this Update problem so I can get updated to version 1709? Thank
 you.</p>

<p><span>The worse scenario is that Microsoft constantly upgrades to new version and it is not accessible for PWD! &nbsp;It is against ADA requirements!</span></p>
<p><span>Before put new version to production, developers should check with ADA requirement, how it would affect PWD.
</span></p>
<p><span>Last version still not accessible and there is Assessable Answering Desk doesn’t have an idea how to help because developers removed the option that those people may use to help.Shame of Microsoft developers who still can't

<p>Your explanation of things, "that happened" and other things that "maybe can be found", and "some computers may", and "almost always", and "may take a lot of time to decode", and "sometimes" are really too vague to be useful for a real world, nuts and bolts,
 workable solution, if there is one. Thanks for trying.</p>

thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/.../mwZmtLXVYbX4lMtRNIakIGQ.jpg</a> it slots in the 3.5mm socket in the back of the xbox. &nbsp;Make sure you remove the hdmi cable while you connect this cable to the TV to fix your issue.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the information you have provided, it seems like the issue is due to a corrupted operating system. It's possible that your computer encounters a problem during the installation process of Windows 10 1709 build that causes broken or missing components
 on the computer's system files. <br />
<br />
To help resolve your concern we suggest that you perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file. As mentioned by Andre Da Costa in this forum
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">article</a></strong>, performing this can repair broken operating system
 files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications. Check the article for the complete instructions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Back up your personal data and files to an external hard drive, USB thumb drive, or cloud location (such as OneDrive) before you begin the reinstallation of Windows 10 to avoid data loss.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or things you'd like to clarify, feel free to ask.

            DEP (Data Execution Prevention) has been around for a pretty long time and was added to Windows starting with Windows XP Service Pack 2 as a built in mechanism to protect against denial of service attacks and buffer over runs.

<h2>            Windows 10 Gaming Mode &#34;option&#34;. &#40;&#34;PERSONALIZATION&#34; or &#34;START&#34; MODE-for gamers&#41;</h2>
                    <p>"why not" a Gaming Mode?&nbsp; To best utilize the PC we paid for?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Video card upgrades are costly and seems "Video cards" are the ONLY major system part (other than the power supply to operate the video cards) that are slowing us down from 'mag-nanny-moss' gaming now days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(IMO)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other major components seem to be almost at a virtual standard now.&nbsp; Processors are still 'evolving' but they don't seem to be the issue now, including broadband/ cable speeds either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, updates, enabled programs at start up, phone sync options, including pictures, charging your phone via a cable to the pc may enable some features that would reduce gaming on some systems I'm almost (PC idiot here:) sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But "Why NOT"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why won't Windows allow Gamers a "Gaming mode", basically an "Xbox" like functionality on our PC's?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, just for you folks who 'may' think you can answer this question by saying... "Buy an Xbox if you want to play Xbox games"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Duh, not ALL games that utilize SO MUCH of your PC's video/ memory are available on Xbox.&nbsp; Get a "virtual" life, and you'll learn to know what I'm speaking of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and if 'somebody' with some 'real' tech 'nah-ledge';-) knows more about this, like HOW TO put windows 10 into such a virtual state.... "I'm listening".&nbsp; lol</p>

<h3> bobwuzhere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do you sign for an Xbox after sending it in for repair&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, just wondering something -- when you send a console in for repair and then Xbox sends it back to you, have you signed for it?</p>
<p>I could have sworn that the previous times I've sent it in, FedEx would knock, I'd come to the door and sign for it. If I wasn't there, then they'd presumably leave and try again the next day after placing a note on the door. Have you signed for it or have
 they always left it at the door? When I talked to Xbox Support, he said he never heard of FedEx just leaving it at the door and now I'm in a huge mess trying to figure out where my Xbox went, if it ever arrived at all or not. It says in the tracking that the
 Xbox was left at the door and that to was delivered but that's not the case.</p>

<p>Similar to onyx,</p>
<p>I should imagine that the repair team sent a fully traceable, signature-required, insured delivery. Incidents like this must happen regularly. The parcel goes "missing."</p>
<p>It's never happened to me, but in the UK, if a parcel is not delivered within 15 days, then you can file a lost parcel complaint and then you will receive some compensation and an investigation will be made.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            Hello ramy. Do you know if you had a OEM key or retail key? 
<br />
<br />With a retail key (purchased straight from microsoft) you can transfer the license. 
<br />
<br />If it was OEM you cant transfer licenses. 
<br />

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.

<p><span>I am a volunteer that manages a number of computers on our small church LAN, 2 computers operating on MS XP-SP3, 2 on MS Windows 7 Home Premium and my 2 problem computers that
 came pre-installed with Vista Home Premium of which I have performed an HP OEM upgrade to Window 7.</span></p>
<p><span>I have isolated this print driver problem to the Vista operating system and even when computers are upgraded to Windows 7 does not correct this driver error.<span>&nbsp;</span>I have
 also tried every possible print driver variant of the HP 8500, HP8550, PCL, PS to include the Microsoft versus HP versions with no success.<span>&nbsp;</span>In each case I get this error yet neither of the XP computers or the computers that had Windows 7 as a
 original operating system have no problems with their print drivers for this printer.</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, I have repeatedly searched and upgraded the operating system and print drivers.<span>&nbsp;</span>In desperation I have even tried to find the correctly behaving Windows 7 print
 driver and transfer it to these Vista upgraded to Windows 7 machines.<span>&nbsp;</span>However I could not isolate the driver location.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The only thing I can conclude is that this errant HP print driver was resident within Vista and remains resident even after a HP OEM Windows 7 upgrade.<span>&nbsp;</span>Additionally,
 all of these computers are configured to access this printer via its static IP address on the network<span>.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>The XP computers are 32 bit,&nbsp;all of the Vista upgraded to Win 7 and OEM&nbsp;Win 7 computers are 64 bit machines
 all with&nbsp;respective OS.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone please help me correct this problem?</span></p>

<p><span>Hi hartmarka,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Follow these steps in order:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>First completely uninstall the printer driver
 from your computer from Programs and Features.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below to do the same:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Also remove the printer completely. Follow the steps&nbsp;listed below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Click Start. Type Devices and Printers and click on it to open.<br />
b. Right-click on printer icon and select "Remove Device".<br />
c. When asked for confirmation, click Yes.<br />
d. Restart the computer and verify that printer icon is no longer listed under Devices and Printers.<br />
e. Click Start-&gt; right-click on Computer-&gt; Click Properties-&gt; Click Device Manager.<br />
f. Expand "USB Controllers" and verify that "USB Printing Support" is not listed.<br />
g. Disconnect printer USB cable from back of printer and computer.<br />
h. Restart the computer and re-connect printer USB cable to back of printer and computer.<br />
i. Check whether the <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?&amp;objectID=c02536257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Printer driver installs</a>.<br />
j. Again open the Device Manager and Verify that "USB Printing Support" and "HP Photosmart 8500 Series" is listed under USB Controllers of Device Manager.<br />
k. Verify that printer icon is displayed under Device and Printers too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now the Printer Settings should remain set as needed.</span></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4&#58; Imaging Devices missing in Device Manager and Webcam doesn&#39;t working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am using Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>I have problems with detecting my laptop's built-in webcam. I've tried going to the Device Manager and Imaging Devices as is advised, but Imaging devices option is not there. Windows Helo works, but Camera app shows just black, and other apps like Skype
 are saying that camera is currently in use by other app.</p>
<p>Please give me some advice.</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It came out in March when I was using my Microsoft Word. I had totally restarted my laptop for three times as this blue screen came out for three times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that my laptop had became very slow, I mean extremely slow. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me about 10 minutes just to switch on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I format my Windows 8 myself and everything look fine just like a new one until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This blue screen came out again, same error code when I was browsing the net.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it to a computer repair shop, they checked my hardware and said nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wonder if my hardware was fine, could it be the problems of the Windows? ( just guess )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I can get a answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>2. </strong>No Asus software is 'necessary'. AiCharger, etc, is optional utilities included in the motherboard CD, or optional Windows updates, that generally cause lots of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you crash after following the above, as I said, it's likely a faulty processor (or another form of hardware, but processor most likely) and sending it into Asus will get it solved as they will repair it for you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Apologize for inconvenience that you're going through with Windows 10. Not to worry. Let me help you in fixing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you remember making changes in the Computer that might have caused this issue?</p>
<p>Have you updated all the drivers in the Computer? If not, I suggest that you do the same through

<h3> challengercws  say:</h3>
<h2>            LogonUI.exe Entry Point Not Found</h2>
                    
<p>This morning I found this error message on my HP desktop. "LogonUI.exe - Entry Point Not Found&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The procedure entry point could not be located in the dynamic link library msvcrt.dll "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC had been restarted so I'm assuming it did an auto update
 last night as normally scheduled to do.&nbsp; It will not load in normal mode but will load in safe mode. It will not let me do a "restore"&nbsp; nor will it let me run sfc /scannow.</p>
<p>I've tried to run system restore but the screen seems to "refresh" with the safe mode screen and the above error message about every 10 seconds and it will cancel out whatever act I'm trying to do at that time. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thank
 you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>I'm running Vista 64&nbsp; SP2 and it is kept up to date automatically.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>What happens when you try to run SFC scan from safe mode?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are able to boot the computer in safe mode, then perform a clean boot from safe mode and then check if you can restart the computer
 in normal mode.</span></span></p>

<p>I tried SFC in safe mode with no luck. I performed the clean boot per the instructions and the same problem still exist. I tried system restore from an earlier point when it worked fine&nbsp;but the error message still exist and will not let windows start.&nbsp; I
 get this message during normal boot up right before my logon screen would normally appear. Once the error message "LogonUI.exe" appears the computer stops at this point. If I hit the OK button on that error message numerous times it will take me to the logon
 screen but it will not load any further.</p>
<p>The laptop that I'm using is also Vista but it's a 32 where the desktop is a 64. Is there any way of copying the file that is missing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for your help. I apologize for the delay in getting back to your answer.</p>

 a clean boot with disabling the service's and startup items per the instructions above. Problem still exist.&nbsp; Tried Startup repair - Will not run. &nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp; Have run Malwarebytes and small free Registry cleaner in safe mode - problem still exist.&nbsp; Tried to run&nbsp;
 sfc /scannow in safe mode but it will not run.&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW.. heres what I think is an important symptom:&nbsp; The PC was mostly locked up&nbsp; until I ran the Registry cleaner a couple of times ( in safe mode of course).&nbsp; After the registry cleaner I was able to start in
 safe mode "with" networking and connect to the internet. The problem is still there but the PC seems to be more 'cooperative"&nbsp;&nbsp; It will not load in normal mode no matter what and comes up with the "LogonUI.exe" error message before the logon screen and then
 stops.</p>
<p>HP Desktop Vista - 64 SP2&nbsp; Kept up to date via Microsoft scheduled maintenance</p>
<p>Another thing that's strange: The screen seems to "refresh" or reload about every 20 seconds and what ever I'm in the middle of is closed and right back to the desktop of safe mode.&nbsp; If I load in safe mode WITH networking the screen updates about every 5
 seconds and cancels out whatever I'm working on. It wont even give me time to type in sfc /scannow.&nbsp; I tried to use uninstall programs and updates but the screen reloads and doesn't give me time to &nbsp;see the recently installed updates. I would love to be able
 to fix this myself as I'm handicapped and taking it to a computer store is a huge job for me.&nbsp; But If I have to I have to.</p>
<p>It seems the registry cleaner did help the situation a little. What are your thoughts about any of the Registry repair tools available on-line? I know they're not suggested sometimes but is it possible that they can fix this common problem?</p>
<p>I really appreciate everyones help and advice with this problem. Thank you all so much for your assistance.</p>
