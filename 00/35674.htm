<p>Hi Jayy,</p>

    <title>1709 NOT compatibe with my Lenovo laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            1709 NOT compatibe with my Lenovo laptop</h2>
                    <p>I got impatient and decided to manually update to 1709 from 1703 however when I updated it I encountered several issues one of the&nbsp; issues was major one a black screen when I logged in, the only way I could fix that was to do alt ctr del until the option
 menu came and to open task manager then go to "file" option and click on "create new task" to open the run box and enter the command explorer. exe&nbsp;in the run box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second issue but a minor issue&nbsp;was the colors was the of the taskbar and title bars weren't changing&nbsp;when I changed my desktop wallpaper even though I have both the "start, taskbar and action center" and "title bars" options checked under the "show accent
 color on the following surface" section, as well as I have the transparency effects turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all these issues I had with 1709, I decided it was best to revert back from 1709 to 1703, even though Lenovo told me that they tested their computer and said they&nbsp;were "compatible" with 1709.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The fact is I already have 1709 on my desktop computer which is a different brand SkyTechArchangel and it seems to be working fine on my SkyTechArchAngel dekstop the only problem seems to be that Microsoft's own website doesn't load on the Microsoft Edge Browser,
 however with that issue I still like1709's feature of being able to share articles from the Microsoft Launcher on my Android phone to the computer that was the one major reason I wanted to get 1709 on my Lenovo laptop but ultimately had to revert back to 1703
 because of the issues I laid out above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question to Microsoft when is 1709 going to be coming to my Lenovo laptop? Lenovo said that their computers was compatible with the new build but ultimately I found out that wasn't the case. One more thing I forgot to mention is my computer came with
 Windows 10 preinstalled, however, i don't recall the build number it came with originally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here&nbsp; my computer details for the Lenovo laptop</p>

<p>Its the responsibility of the OEM (Lenovo) whether they support a release or not. Windows 10 and Windows Update only does a basic scan to determine compatibility: CPU speed, RAM and space. Apart from that, it can't tell if your chipset or other unknown component
 will prevent the upgrade from being a success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the following article to see if your make and model is listed as compatible.</p>

            <p><span>I’m looking for a definite answer as I’m confused about what media I need to restore an Image.</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 10 we create a recovery drive accessed by typing “Create a Recovery drive” in Cortana search bar. This recovery drive allows us to potentially repair our Windows and or restore an Image.</span></p>
<p><span>Further in Windows 10 Microsoft has restored the Backup &amp; Recovery process from Windows 7 and has labelled it as such, Backup and Recovery (Windows 7).</span></p>
<p><span>As part of the setup up process in Backup and Recovery (Windows 7) we are asked on one final screen to confirm our settings and then click “Save the setting and run backup”. On this screen there is
 a warning that “A system repair disk maybe required to restore an Image.”</span></p>
<p><span>The “Repair” (or Start) disk is a Windows 7 concept.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My question. Can I restore the Image created by the “Backup and Recovery (Windows 7)” process with the Windows 10 recovery drive (USB flash drive) or do I still need to create an old windows 7 Start

<p><span>I think the wording in the warning needs to be updated. If the Windows 10 recovery drive is required then state a “Recovery drive” maybe needed or state a Windows 7 repair disk is required.
</span></p>
<p><span>If a repair disk is required I would ask why? Disks are being phased out and I’m not even sure what media I should be booting from.

            I just ran a test and was able to access the "Image" created in Backup and Recovery (Windows 7) using a USB Flash drive I created using the Windows Recovery Drive process. (Not to be confused with Recovery Drive the vendors place as a partition on your&nbsp;storage&nbsp;drive.)&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody experience calling by Skype to landlines/mobile numbers and after 15 seconds this happens:&nbsp; connection is still on going, but I can't hear the other party anymore. However, the other party still can hear me, there is no further communication
 possible.. This happens all the time, I can't make any normal calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't changed any thing other than renewed a subscription. Before renewal all was fine.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>Today I have contacted the helpdesk. They suggested to uninstall and reinstall Skype, but this also didn't have an effect. The other options also didn't work. The helpdesk said that what happened (being cut down after 10 seconds) is when trying to call landlines/mobile
 numbers via Skype when there is no subscription. But I had. Don't know?? Anyway, we ended up cancelling the subscription. No calling via Skype for me... :-/ (BTW I'm using a Chromebook, there might have been recent updates that cause this? Because I was using
 Skype subscription before and it all worked fine.) Perhaps in future again?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Just spinning circle when try to set up device or guide - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Just spinning circle when try to set up device or guide</h2>
                    
<p>If i go through the initial setup and skip the TV, OneGuide setup I can see live TV.</p>
<p>However, if I try to set up any of these options, I just get a spinning circle that doesn't go away even after 20 minutes.</p>
<p>If I press the Xbox button on the controller and then go back into the live TV I just get a blank screen.</p>
<p>There is no way for me to get to the TV settings anymore--if I choose settings-&gt;live TV, it just bring me to the home screen with the live TV app open in a window, and if I select this I just get the black screen again. I need to reset factory settings to
 be able to get to the TV setup options again.</p>
<p>Is anyone else seeing this issue? This is really frustrating!</p>

<p>Hey kyool, sorry to hear this.</p>
<p>It sounds like one of the components that supports Live TV settings has crashed. Can you do a hard reboot of the console by pressing and holding the power button on the front for about 10 seconds?</p>
<p>Once you do that, you should be able to load TV &amp; OneGuide settings and set everything up.</p>
<p>Sorry for the hassle!</p>

<h2>            Optimize Drive does not have an option to Analyze C Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first question here and I'm not very tech savy. I'm running Window 10 on a Dell laptop and it was running kind of sluggish lately and some programs were not running up to par. So I looked at how much was on my C Drive and it was half full (mostly
 due to pictures). So I removed the pictures and now it is only about 1/4 full, but everything is still not running right. I checked to see if I could defrag my drive and this is what it showed:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdc244a4-4221-4787-9e30-5c505a4ef87a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdc244a4-4221-4787-9e30-5c505a4ef87a" /></a></p>
<p>It doesn't even give me an option to analyze and it says "canceling" under last run. When I click on any of the other drives under that it gives me the option to analyze. So my first question is where is the analyze button? Second, why does it say "canceling"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked under the scheduling section and it says it is scheduled for "weekly". Can I not choose to defragment now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>

<h2>            Error Code 8004B7D0 - Service Not Available</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on a Win 7 Pro machine with all the available updates installed, attempting to set up a Child under the Family Safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded Family Safety 2012, which seems to be the latest version available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I start to set it up, enter the Administrator's password, then I log in under the child's newly created @outlook.com account and after selecting that account to manage, press SAVE and get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, the service isn't available right now, please try again later.&nbsp; Error code:&nbsp; 8004B7D0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed this machine from the @outlook.com acocunts "Devices" and attempted again.</p>
<p>I've ensured that Family Safety has been allow permission to get through Norton's Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked through the various other posts on this website and can't find a solution which bring about a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to post this question under Windows Essentials, but the Product pull down menu does not include Family Safety, so I'm posting it under this section.&nbsp; Has Family Safety been discontinued??&nbsp; Is that why in 2015, it's called Family Safety 2012?</p>

            <p>Hello Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reviewed the two links and haven't found a solution at this point, other than the fact that I was unaware of a charge which would be applied for setting up a Child's Account under COPPA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'm actually surprised that there wasn't a check-box that the Parent had to check, acknowledging that a charge would be applied to their account and that they agreed to such a cost.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;there is no credit card set up under the parent account's profile, that may be issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll set up a credit card under the Parent account and reattempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have previously logged into the Family Controls for that child's account, without a problem, and did the initial set up.&nbsp; This error code has only appeared recently when I was attempting to go back into Family Controls to make some modifications.&nbsp;
 So I'm not convinced that the lack of a credit card is the root issue.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Xysaerv, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your ability to downgrade Windows 8 to an earlier version of Windows depends both on the version of Windows 8 that you have and on the method by which you obtained Windows 8. Not all Windows editions provide downgrade rights. If you do have downgrade
 rights and decide to use them, you continue to keep the license and rights of use for your original version and may "upgrade" back at any time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) downgrade rights apply to only Windows 8/8.1 Pro and allow for downgrades for up to two earlier versions (to Windows 7 Professional and to Windows Vista Business). If you were running Windows 7, Windows Vista,
 or Windows XP, you'll need to reinstall your previous version of Windows using the recovery or installation media that came with your PC (typically a DVD). Check the support section of your PC manufacturer's website for more info.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You will first need to go to the manufacturer’s website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows Vista native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows
 Vista by the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For further reference, you may refer to these articles.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer to know if you are able to downgrade to Windows Vista. Make sure you take backup of the data on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us posted on the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade fails after reboot</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to upgrade from my windows 7 several times. With or without media creation tool. The problem occurs when installer completes copying files (1st stage at "upgrading windows" screen) and restarts itself. After reboot, installer trying to attempt
 repairs but fails to do so and creates log file called </p>
<p>SrtTrail.txt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled UEFI and tried again. No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried to do clean install via USB installer (booted from USB and install). It was installed without any problem. But had no success to activate with my product key.</p>

<p>I have tried chkdsk,</p>
<p>this: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors</p>
<p>and also this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they found nothing. Besides, SSD's health status, bad sector tests etc. seems okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After "Automatic Repair" stage, I can't log into windows 7 by the way. I had to reinstall my windows7 every time it fails (glad to took backup image beforehand). I even tried upgrading to win10 with clean windows 7 install but again had no chance. Error
 happens every time after "copying files" stage completes and reboots. (Meantime, the percentage in the circle was around %28-%30). And as I said, there is no single problem if I do clean install w/ USB other than activation case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is Asus UX21E (2011). Latest BIOS version.</p>

            Exact same problem here. &nbsp;I'm on a Toshiba Portege R830 and I have tried so many times to do this upgrade but nothing has worked. &nbsp;I can however do a clean install of Windows 10 and it will take it fine but there is no way to activate it as I didn't go
 through the upgrade process.... &nbsp;Extremely frustrating!!!

            I have tried every bios option, chkdsk etc. but no solution at all. And because I have to reinstall windows 7 everytime I check if upgrade going to be success, I gave up. Waiting for solution from Microsoft

<p>I had a boot failure and use the installation disk to boot to the re and did an automated repair.&nbsp; The automated repair failed so I did a manual mbr fix and rebuilt the bcd.&nbsp;&nbsp; This repaired the boot and windows launches normally.&nbsp; I then built a repair disk
 on a bootable usb stick which works fine.&nbsp; However, when I booted to the re for testing it says that there is a pending recovery action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: What method can I use for current wre.wim to reflect this state.&nbsp; I am aware of that WAIK can build a new wim but I have not done this before.</p>

<p><span><span>Let's try to recover the registry from a backup to clear the pending repair.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Since this is a backup, you may have to reinstall some programs.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also make sure that you
 have backed up the important data before trying the steps.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the steps below and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. From a startup command prompt, browse to c:\windows\system32\config</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Type ren system system.old and press Enter</span></span></p>

            <p>Halo Franchise titles not included on the current Xbox One BC list 
has hit a combined 159,639 votes. That’s a lot of Halo fans to win over 
to the Xbox One if these titles were all made backwards compatible&nbsp;</p><p>Halo 4&nbsp;</p><p>Halo 3&nbsp;</p><p>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary&nbsp;</p><p>Halo 3: ODST </p>
<p><br /></p><p>These are 
just short examples and if you search up your favorite 360 game franchises and see
 how many votes they get as well as other games you’ll see a lot of them
 are in demand. There are so many 360 games and franchises that are 
getting huge amounts of votes that making at least 75% of these 
Backwards compatible will win over a lot of Xbox 360 fans over to Xbox 
One which is what Microsoft needs right now. The official site can be seen over here and you can see which games from franchises scored the most votes</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-backward-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-backward-compatibility</a></p><p><br /></p><p>You will have to search up each game independantly and add up the totals though hopefully Microsoft will update this site to show whih franchises from Xbox 360 are getting the most total votes for Backwards Compatability<br /></p>

            <p>When a title is published on the Xbox 360, Microsoft enters into a publishing agreement that allows them to publish that title on that console. This agreement does not allow them to publish on Xbox One. This means that for every title that is made Backward Compatible, Microsoft has to negotiate a new publishing agreement. Of course, these things take time. According to Phil Spencer in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8uBk0FmL5Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">interview with IGN</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/T8uBk0FmL5Q?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/T8uBk0FmL5Q?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>, "most publishers have been great i

<h2>            My account was baned</h2>
                    <p>Hello and good day, my problem is that my account was banned, by a player of gamertag "[Mod Removed]", that basically what happened is that during a game of Igualadas of Rainbow Six Siege, this player, was dedicated to bother me and a friend while we played, took us away, even being teammates, even got to the point of killing us. And what happened was that in my anger, I insulted him, and they banned me, so please, I ask them to disband me, and they ban him, because he was the one who started with the wrong behavior, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p><br />
I requested my previous topic to be deleted from the forums because I thought it would prevent me from receiving more false reports, but I don't care anymore. Since yesterday, I received a message from another player asking how I managed to get my reputation
 back in the green. I was surprised, and once I viewed my profile, I then noticed I was in the "Good Player" zone.</p>
<p><br />
I then proceed to check out my reputation statistics from <a href="http://www.enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.enforcement.xbox.com</a> and noticed that it displays my reputation as terrible throughout September. This is absurd. I don't see how these reports can genuinely be accounted for. Throughout this month, I have done by best to be a flawless and impeccable
 player; there was no reason to report me.</p>

<p>I hadn't sent abusive messages; I hadn't been unsporting at all, aside from winning; no cheating; no voice or communication abuse.</p>

<p>On top of that, I have contacted Xbox Customer Support through their live chat option. I spoke to someone named Juvy, and once again, I was redirected to the Xbox One Enforcement Team section of the forums. That doesn't help me at all, seeing as I posted
 in that section around a week ago and have yet to receive a response.</p>
<p><br />
For anyone who is curious, here's my reputation statistics: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9RDc0BF.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://i.imgur.com/9RDc0BF.png</a></p>
<p><br />
Just when I thought I was improving...</p>
<p><br />
Please post here with your story and your reputation statistics. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Same here. </p>
<p>The system is very flawed. Might just cancel my year subscription since I can't play online anymore.</p>
<p>The system is broken: you fall into the red. How are you suppose to get out of the red? Play multiplayer matches without getting reported....Except you can't play multiplayer matches....Extremely disappointed in Microsoft.</p>

<p>Hello again, Mechanic!</p>
<p>What I would really like to know is why am I in the "Avoid Me" section when my reputation has been in the green for the past six months and am noted as a "Good Player", according to the Enforcement page. Plus, I only have at least six files reported against
 me. I guess you're just put into the red regardless of how many files are reported against you? I also spoke to someone through Live Chat also and said that the issue was being looked into and should be fixed soon. I referred her to the old thread you made,
 so I guess she took it as you needed the fix and not myself! Which is still good though for you!</p>
<p>Here's a reference picture:</p>

<p>It's quite odd, I hope it gets fixed soon!</p>

<p>On topic, 19 unsporting?!?!?!?! WTF????</p>
<p>There is an absolutely HUGE flaw in this reputation system. People are being completely abused by this.</p>
<p>We are all victims. This is not acceptable by any means. I am in 110% support of getting this fixed and I will not stop trying to help get this flawed reputations system looked into. We need justice.

<p>I've fallen into the avoid me category as of last week and by the looks of it it is because of "unsporting behavior". I'm not quite what to say to this as my reputation has zero cheating, communication or any issues along that like of problems which makes
 sense because I play strictly Forza 5 which doesn't allow for cheating and I don't use a mic so this has to be from people who are poor sports or sore losers. My rep says 11 reports against me over the last six months. Is that really enough to warrant my avoid
 me label? Where is the so called leveling out effect from the thousands of gamers who did not report me because there isn't a positive feedback option nor would anyone take the time to do that. Xbox support says the forums are the only way to rectify this.
 I guess I'm just gonna sit on hold tonight until somebody refunds my entire Xbox system or corrects this issue.

<p>Will the enforcement team respond to this thread? I have tried contacting them by opening a discussion thread. Sadly, no reply. I need to know how long I will be in the red for. If it's a week, fine. A month or more and I will cancel my account subscription.
 I am not going to pay for a service if the service doesn't provide full working functions. Online multiplayer is essential, and if I can't enjoy that, there is no reason to have an xbox. I have been a customer for 6 years and have never had a problem until
 now. </p>

<p>This seems to be where you need to post. It shows responses to cheating being replied to within 24 hours. Hopefully legitimate complaints will be heard.</p>

<p>@S1rCharles, yeah a member of the enforcement team will respond but they give the same copy and paste response depending on what you're posting about.
</p>
<p>If you get suspended and post about it they'll just tell you why. For example they'll say "You're account was suspended due to cheating or exploiting a bug" or something like then. Then they'll leave a few links to things like the code of conduct and what
 not. </p>
<p>It's the same thing for everyone, just some copy and paste message depending on what you post.

<h2>            Hyperlinks not working in Windows Live Mail 2012 on a Windows 8 system</h2>
                    I am using Windows Live Mail 2012 Version 16.4 on new laptop Windows 8 system. Emails with hyperlinks do not work in Live Mail most of the time. It looks like plain text. I am using MS Live Mail because I could not get Windows 8 mail working with my pop
 mail account and the Microsoft help desk put Live Mail on my laptop to fix the problem.&nbsp; I have sent the hyperlink to myself using Internet Explorer 10. I have received other emails from my husband from his PC with hyperlinks in them and they do not work.
 I also receive a hyperlink from my husband PC forward from Firefox and that did work. I have sent myself a Hyperlink by using my Apple computer mail to this computer and that hyperlink worked.&nbsp; I try going to "Https://accounts.live.com" to find "under other
 options click on Use HTTPS automatically" but I could not find that option there. I also try to forward this email with the not working hyperlink in the body of the message and I put my cursor at the end of the hyperlink and press the space bar, the link turns
 on. How can I get hyperlinks turn on all the time?<br />

            <p>Hi BetsyLangas,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you are having issus with hyperlinks and this could be caused by your reading settings in Mail. Try to check if it contributes to the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Mail.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Options</strong> then choose <strong>Mail</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Go to <strong>Read</strong> tab and under <strong>Reading Messages</strong> section, please make sure that
<strong>Read all messages in plain text</strong> is not selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update us afterwards.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<p>There are dozens of threads on that page. Which one worked for you? </p>
<p>You didn't answer: do you not see any change to the ribbon if you just press the Alt key?
