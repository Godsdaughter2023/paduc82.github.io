    <title>Can browse on Google Chrome but not IE, can&#39;t download anything, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can browse on Google Chrome but not IE, can&#39;t download anything, computer says it can&#39;t connect to network even though the connection is already established.</h2>
                    Having trouble with our Internet connection. Can browse just fine on Google Chrome, in fact I'm posting this from it right now, but no other browser will work and we can't seem to download anything. I've been trying to update my phone on this computer
 but it keeps telling me there's no Internet connection, and I can't proceed until I connect. Computer comes up with the "Dial-up Connection" box and tries to connect to "Broadband Connection" but is always unsuccessful. Have run troubleshoot diagnostic thingys
 but the computer can't find a problem, probably because technically we're already connected... I don't know. We've called up the ISP, they can't do anything from their end. My brother was the one who caused this problem trying to remove the xbox from the network
 and deny it internet access but unfortunately he can't remember what he's done. Can anyone help at all? Running Windows 7, if that helps.

<h2>            Skype notifications</h2>
                    Old Skype used to notify me automatically when my&nbsp;contact logged in/off or changed their status. Now,&nbsp;when I want to check availability of my Skype contact I have to go to Contacts/Active to see if they are online. Did I miss something or is this standard
 procedure for finding active contacts?

            The newer versions of Skype are still missing a lot of core functionality. Its best you go back and stick with the classic version:
<br />
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,  then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>How can I remap F2 to &#34;Rename&#34; using the new Microsoft Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennis-l  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I remap F2 to &#34;Rename&#34; using the new Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.1 64-bit &#40;exe&#41; software&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is an annoying, in my opinion, feature that Microsoft made an "improvement" on: the addition of the F-Lock Function key. Basically it has remapped all the Function keys to "helpful" and perhaps useful functions that would otherwise be useless --- that
 is for the majority. Not us, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I simply would like to remap the F2 key to "rename" WITHOUT using the F-Lock key, along with the useful, and old method of refreshing with F5, which now is "open."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had to resort to using registry hacks to either swap the function keys so they behave like before or using one that removes the F-Lock functions altogether. Either one is fine with me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why not just offer a simple toggle option or an option to turn off the new Function key abilities? That would be very helpful, and at the same time you would be offering a simple option to satisfy some of your "old-school" users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can successfully remap F5 to "refresh" but CANNOT map F2 to "rename"! It just is not in the list of possibilities for remapping, which is strange since this was the ORIGINAL FUNCTION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'll give you a 50% grade right now, until then I look forward to you updating your software to include the rename function. That would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; I won't include a link to a website that has registry hacks which used to work, to do what I am looking for my keyboard to do. If interested, I can provide. I just really think this would be a feature that Microsoft could provide to its loyal customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any assistance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding Vijay, however I have been down both avenues multiple times in the past, and this is still an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now with Windows 8, the "commands.xml" file cannot be edited as it could in Windows 7. It just keeps getting better. :P&nbsp; I kid, but I am not happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Hardware Support spits out canned responses, at least every time I have contacted them in the past - and I did again for good measure. I was pointed to the troubleshooting link, which is utterly useless, because there is technically nothing wrong
 - this is the "new and improved" version of the software. :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and very disappointing to say the least, with Microsoft latest Mouse and Keyboard Center, they have left out a very important alternative: F2 &gt; rename.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>F5 is able to be remapped to "refresh", but leaving out the option to use F2 to "rename" is really disappointing Microsoft. something so simple, that has been used by your loyal users for many years, c'mon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would personally like to see a simple SWAP or DISABLE F-Lock new features would be most welcome. why would you not offer this option is staggering. I've had to resort to using registry hacks to get around this annoyance. very disappointing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about including this in your next update for Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center please. This is not an unreasonable request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, now whether I use "application-specific" customizations or not, I am STILL forced to push the darn "F-Lock" key in for example, World of Warcraft, before I can use say F7 as actually F7. Interesting to note, when I bind the key to
 an action in World of Warcraft like F7, the awkwardness shows through in that F7 simply gets mapped as "CTRL + R" which is the new F7 command output plainly in World of Warcraft as what it really is, just "CTRL + R", which by the way now removes the ability
 for me to now use "CTRL +R" as a key binding. So Microsoft has now messed up two of my keyboard mappings!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *sighs*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any help. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been successful with the F5 key, as refresh is one of the options available for remapping. The trouble I am having is with the F2 key getting changed to RENAME just like the in the old days.</p>

            <p>i see that it looks unlikely that i will be able to remap the F2 to rename.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the whole idea of this "improvement" not being optional bugs me. a simple checkbox option to use the function keys as the old method would be very helpful (and simple i would think).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the best solution is probably to remember to hit the F-lock key once (after every reboot) and everything is back to normal, like you mentioned. i wish there was an option either in the microsoft software or the ability to swap the state of the key in the
 BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your help. i look forward to seeing if microsoft will address this issue. i can hope! ;)</p>

            <p>Hi menace97,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not sure if you're still interested in an answer to this... I had the same issue, came across your problem and kept searching until I came up with an answer. The idea was to find a keyboard shortcut that could be inserted as a macro (Alt + F + M). You need
 to select Alt from the dropdown "Insert Special Key" when developing your macro. It is not the ideal solution, but works. A better one would be Menu button + M, however in their infinite wisdom the menu button is not one of the special keys that can be inserted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps, but if you need more help implementing it, let me know.</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>p.s. the first time you run it you might find it searching for files with fm in the title, but works fine after that.</p>

            <p><strong>HEY!</strong>&nbsp; I found a solution to this annoying problem.&nbsp; It is easy, but not obvious in another Microsoft published article.&nbsp; Cut to the chase? If you have a Microsoft keyboard with an "<strong>F Lock</strong>", pushing it 1 time to
<strong>turn off F Lock will revert the F2 key to our old, standard function - Rename</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find these details in the following article.&nbsp; I hope this helps others like myself who have been annoyed by this but have never taken the time till now to find the answer!&nbsp;<strong> ...SteveB from Boise</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out the article:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/894513</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>This is an annoying, in my opinion, feature that Microsoft made an "improvement" on: the addition of the F-Lock Function key. Basically it has remapped all the Function keys to "helpful" and perhaps useful functions that would otherwise be useless --- that
 is for the majority. Not us, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I simply would like to remap the F2 key to "rename" WITHOUT using the F-Lock key, along with the useful, and old method of refreshing with F5, which now is "open."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to resort to using registry hacks to either swap the function keys so they behave like before or using one that removes the F-Lock functions altogether. Either one is fine with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not just offer a simple toggle option or an option to turn off the new Function key abilities? That would be very helpful, and at the same time you would be offering a simple option to satisfy some of your "old-school" users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can successfully remap F5 to "refresh" but CANNOT map F2 to "rename"! It just is not in the list of possibilities for remapping, which is strange since this was the ORIGINAL FUNCTION.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll give you a 50% grade right now, until then I look forward to you updating your software to include the rename function. That would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; I won't include a link to a website that has registry hacks which used to work, to do what I am looking for my keyboard to do. If interested, I can provide. I just really think this would be a feature that Microsoft could provide to its loyal customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance.</p>

            <p>Cool. I can't believe I didn't try that (throughout everything you'd almost expect to do it by accident). Thanks for noticing and especially for posting.<br />
<br />
It's still missing Home, End and Insert though. Might be possible to map them onto something, but they're so central to everything (start and end of line/page, with shift for selecting, shift-insert for paste in the win-mode places that won't take crtl-v, so
 on) that I just called it after noticing that and went back to logitech. It found a new life as a remote for a tuner/media player/occasional web browser which is probably more what it was supposed to be, and it's fits the role very well. Still hoping for something
 with a 90% size (or even normal) normal 101-standard with the keypad replaced with a touchpad, multi, tactile buttons, but I've already spent too much on keyboards this round.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, I really mean it even if I'm not in the thread (put in on watch) - it's so hard to remember and yet so awesome when you remember an old issue or read the nth thread that just say "I don't know either" ten times over and over through the google
 pages.</p>

            <p>Thank you for that "obvious" help message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a MS keyboard that was in the boneyard here at work because my laptop keyboard sucks.</p>
<p>Therefore I don't have a manual... and who in blazes reads a manual anyway? The help function is supposed to tell all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft was never very good at help functions and documentation. BUt at least they are consistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be REALLY nice if they would actually say something like "F Lock is a toggle key that switches between custom and standard function key functionality."</p>
<p>Is that really so hard??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wasted 45 minutes trying to get F2 to do what it used to do. &nbsp;:-(</p>
<p>But if I counted all the time I have wasted searching for solutions to the hidden mysteries in MS World, my 40 year career would actually be about 30 years long in terms of productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, ... things like "why must all the controls be moved around every time a MS app or O/S has a new revision?". But, I digress.</p>

            Using Safe mode, you could logon a "Administrator" (the in-built administrator) account, which has blank password by default, and then reset the passwords for other user accounts from there.

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account.
<strong>In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here.</strong> Once in Safe Mode, you
 will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
<strong>In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode.</strong> At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).<br />

    <title>Problems with Windows 7 Home Premium since windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geraldbrennan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Windows 7 Home Premium since windows update</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday we lost wi-fi connectivity and noticed also that we could not open certain services in the Control Panel, such as Internet Options. We would click on them. Then the spinning circle started, showing that something was happening, but nothing happened,
 and the circle just continued spinning indefinitely. The same circle appeared over the connectivity icon in the lower right corner of the screen. I re-started the computer in Safe Mode and reset it to before the update that had been made the day before and
 re-started the computer and everything worked fine. At the same time I changed Windows Update to manual install so that the same update would not be installed again. However, later the same night, after the computer had been turned off, my iwfe needed to turn
 it on again and the same thing happened. When she booted up this afternoon, it happened again and we went throu the same rigamarole the third time. This time I double-checked Windows Update and noticed that my settings change to manual install had not been
 accepted, so apparently the same update was installed three times causing the problem three times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 1) Is there a problem with a recent update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) How can I be sure that windows updates do not install automatically? I couldn't do this in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help</p>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the Windows Update that you are getting is corrupted or incomplete. To better assist you, may we know what KB is being installed on your computer? Also, as our initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker tool</a>. It will help us find and repair possible corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result of running the scan.</p>

<p>It sounds like you need to figure out of there is one or more updates that cause the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can check the system when it is broken and get into Windows Update, View update history you can click the Date Installed column to sort and get a list of the updates installed today (or recently) and make a list.&nbsp; If the problem occurs after Windows
 Update one of those recently installed things sounds suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can include a screenshot of the list (see below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then change Windows Update Settings to Never check for updates and save that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then restore your system to a working state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to Windows update and manually click the Check for updates button and see what is offered which does not mean you have to install anything at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that one of those offered updates is the problem so you can post a list/screenshot of them and maybe somebody can spot something troublesome and give some advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use a process of elimination and install the offered updates one at a time (or a few at a time) restarting after each to see which one brings on the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have it narrowed down you can uninstall the troublesome update and consider hiding it and hope you never see it again.&nbsp; Of course it would be good to share the KB number and description of what you think is the troublemaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting Windows Update to Never check for updates and checking yourself manually puts you in charge if what gets installed on your system instead of Microsoft.&nbsp; Then you might not have these problems in the future.</p>

<p>Hi, Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update KB seems to be KB4033342. Since I last reset the computer to before this update, and set the updates to manual, we haven't had the problem again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to run the scan if the problem recurs without the update being installed.</p>

<p>Hi Johanna Gonzalez,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the picture your provided, if you mean it shows “Sorry, we couldn’t find your file” when you open your PDF file? Please try to confirm that the PDF actually exists. If the PDF file exists and still cannot open, please change your default viewer (Acrobat
 Reader) or uninstall it, and then click the PDF file to check if you can open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beside, may I know if you are using Microsoft Teams app or online? If you are using app, please sign in Teams online and check if the issue still occur, or you can open online or open in SharePoint.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0171f78c-af51-4b1a-babc-1cfc107ac04d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0171f78c-af51-4b1a-babc-1cfc107ac04d" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>If you still cannot open it even if you uninstalled the Acrobat Reader or open online, please provide some information as below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The screenshot of error message.</li><li>If it just happened to you or there are some others who occur same issue with you.</li><li>Where are the PDF from, from the Root site or any sub-site? And if all the PDF files cannot be open?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please contact us if you have any update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Johanna Gonzalez,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you also cannot open from Online, to narrow down the issue, please provide us below information and test result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Please confirm with your admin if he/she have set any group policy recently.</li><li>I’d like to know if you can download the PDF file from the Microsoft Teams. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to change another network environment which is different from that you use now and check the outcome. Meanwhile, please send the PDF files in conversation and check if the sender and recipient can open it in conversation.</p>

    <title>Why Win7 is not appying the monitor&#39;s color profile to the file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlos a. photo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Win7 is not appying the monitor&#39;s color profile to the file explorer preview pane&#63;</h2>
                    Control panel/Color management is set to the right icc profile (generated with a calibrator included with the monitor, an Eizo Coloredge CG275W), images look okey from Photoshop or Lightroom, but they look too saturated on the right-side preview pane of
 the file explorer. It is as if Win is ignoring the monitor's color profile, and rendering them in plain sRGB values (not translated to the monitor color space) or something close to that.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, the file explorer appears to be rendering correctly any color profile on the images (e.g. the same image converted and saved with different icc profiles look the same, so it seems to be aware of the meaning of an embedded sRGB, Prophoto, etc.
 icc profile), but for some reason it is not taking into account the monitor color profile when sending the image to the screen. Same thing happen if setting an image as desktop background. Even the icons on the desktop look too saturated (harder to tell, but
 I'm pretty sure).<br />
<br />
So, in short, it's as if the color profile is not taken into account for anything happening on the win 7 interface. There's no way to make Win7 show the preview pane images as they should? Thank you.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How long this issue has been happening? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Have you&nbsp;made any changes to the&nbsp;computer prior to the issue? </p>

            Hello Winston:<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer. First of all, I must say that the problem is being suffered by a client of mine (I'm a digital photography/retouching consultant). Color management issues are not my field, or at least not beyond basics, but I'm trying to assist him
 with this problem.<br />
<br />
1) The issue started happening when he bought his new monitor. Previously I think he had another Eizo monitor, uncalibrated and probably set to the default sRGB everywhere. There were no problems back then.<br />
<br />
2) No changes that I know have been made, other than installing the new monitor.<br />
<br />
I have considered the uninstall/reinstall video drivers option, but there are a thousand things that could be tried just for the sake of it, so at this stage and after already trying several things to no avail, I would like to know for sure, before trying more
 things, whether this problem shouldn't be happening or it's expected behavior. I mean, everything other than this (windows image viewer, ps, lr, specialised viewer software) are working okay, it's just the most basic level of windows interface (desktop background
 and icons and preview pane...) that seems to be ignoring the monitor profile. So I start to think that this is just the way Windows 7 works?<br />
<br />
This afternoon my client has scheduled a session with me, I will try to uninstall/reinstall the video drivers and see what happens, and post the results here later in the day.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
Carlos A. Oliveras<br />

            Well, my client didn't feel like losing session time uninstalling/reinstalling drivers without a clear reason so for now he has contacted Eizo and is waiting for an answer.<br />
<br />
I'll try to post the results here just in case somebody finds himself/herself in the same situation in a near future... Although I'm afraid the preview pane cannot be color managed for the monitor color profile.<br />

            Hello, it's me again.<br />
<br />
I've been running some tests on another computer. To make a long story short, this is what I have found out: the Windows interface (preview pane, desktop, icons, even interface elements inside applications) seems to *absolutely* ignore the screen color profile.
 Windows sends color information without any kind of adaptation to the display profile. It only applies the display profile to real images, not to interface elements (which wouldn't be so bad if it was not considering preview pane and desktop background as
 mere interface items).<br />
<br />
I guess this is the standard behavior of Windows, but I find it pretty strange. I still wonder if there might be some way of changing this (or at least changing the color space of the interface itself to make it match the screen's color profile).<br />
<br />
Any answer/help will be very welcome, thanks.<br />

            Hi Winston:<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time and attention. For some reason I can't see the link, but I can get to jrsubs profile. From there, I see a number of threads, one of them being "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/cant-apply-an-icc-profile-to-display-cant/71b8d8e8-afa3-435a-aae4-6a8a184b6439">Can't
 apply an ICC profile to display (...)</a>", which I guess is the one you meant. I already read it before posting this question, since as you point out, his issue seems the same as ours, but it made no difference - I already performed the same steps as jrsubs,
 and his additional step of checking or unchecking the "Use Windows calibration" checkbox makes no difference. I think jrsubs problem had more to do with Windows not loading the calibrated profile at all, while our problem has to do with Windows loading the
 calibrated profile but not applying it on the interface/desktop.<br />
<br />
I recently found <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/how-do-i-get-srgb-images-to-display-correct-in/e59e4056-c328-45b3-9a2f-263b5ae698d8">
another thread</a> which, despite being focused on Windows Vista, includes an answer from Michael Bourgoin (color specialist from Microsoft) which describes exactly the same issue my client is having (Windows desktop and most of windows elements not being color
 managed), and explains that there's no solution so far, even in Windows 7 (which I think was just released by then - it's a december of 2009 thread).<br />
<br />
Here's the link (this time as plain text just in case the previous one doesn't appear):<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-desktop/how-do-i-get-srgb-images-to-display-correct-in/e59e4056-c328-45b3-9a2f-263b5ae698d8<br />
<br />
Then again, I might be wrong and today (as of september 2012) this might be a solvable situation with Win 7, but I think this is normal behavior and so far haven't found proof for thinking otherwise - in fact, I tried the same with a different Win 7 machine,
 and the results were the same as my client's... the calibrated profile is only applied on color managed applications. Non color managed apps and the desktop/windows/interface elements get the "sRGB treatment" and are sent straight to the profile without translating
 the colors to the display color profile, which results in oversaturated colors because it's a wider gamut monitor.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help,<br />
<br />
Carlos<br />

            Hi John, it might be easier to change the port setting on XAMMP - that is just a case of editing the config file
<br />
<br />Stop the XAMPP server, if it is running already
<br />
<br />Open the file - XAMPP Installation Folder]/apache/conf/httpd.conf
<br />
<br />Search for the string Listen 80 (I assume that XAMPP was using the port 80
<br />
<br />Otherwise, just search for the string ‘Listen’
<br />
<br />Change this 80 to any other number which you prefer
<br />
<br />Then search for the string 'ServerName' and update the port number there also
<br />
<br />Save and re-start XAMPP server

<h2>            The Witcher 1 remake as parting gift for XBOX 360</h2>
                    
<p>Would you guys like to see this happening?I love The Witcher 2,its one of the best games i played and would love to have the first one also on XBOX 360.I know they were planing to release it a long time ago but something went wrong,i heard it was difficult
 cause of the engine built for PC but it could be maybe done a remaster on another engine.Nowadays there are less games coming out on 360 and this to me would be the best parting gift for my beloved console.I dont like missing some of the games in one series
 on a console with second or third installment(except for transition between XBOX to 360 to ONE)So if anyone wants this done PLEASE try to make this somehow happen.</p>

<p>Thanks Doc for the tip for Twitter.I think 1 guy asking for it is not gonna bring anything but if there would be a lot of us maybe,CD Projekt Red is known for listening to their fans i think,they even dont do preorder bonus items in game or paid dlc.Like
 you said Doc in my previous thread people nowadays want a new game in series out every year,no one much cares about good old games.I wouldnt mind if it comes on XBOX ONE either,would like to see good old games on the marketplace much rather then 90% of the
 new arcade and indie games.</p>

<p>I'm thinking if The Witcher hadn't used BioWare's Aurora Engine the port would have been simpler. I can't think of a single Aurora PC game that found a home, in its PC form, on console. They had to be adapted dramatically in terms of gameplay and whatnot
 to find a home on a console.</p>

<p>Yeah but CryENGINE isn't the Aurora Engine. The reason I can't think of a single Aurora game on console is because there wasn't a single one. BioWare's next engine after Aurora... the Odyssey Engine was the first to be optimised for console development.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that people think porting games across platforms is like burning stuff onto a disc, and is as cheap, but anyhooooo... as has been mentioned by Kanaye... if there was gonna be a port it'd be on generation 8. The X1 is basically a PC in a
 box with a Windows Kernel buried somewhere in its soul. The 360 is a different beast entirely... doe. Heh.</p>

<p>A port would be cheaper than a remake, and I don't think a port would reap back development costs at retail. For a ground up remake I think you'd have to petition a publisher rather than CD Projekt Red for that one, they'd be fronting the spondooley. So
 maybe if Atari or Microsoft could be convinced to do a revamped The Witcher HD for Xbox Arcade or something...</p>
<p>... if you do petition anyone for anything, let me know and I'll sign it. {=)</p>

<h2>            Windows ICE installation problem</h2>
                    I have downloaded ICE but when trying to install it am told to download and install .NET Framework 4.&nbsp; I have downloaded 3 separate copies of this, when I double-click on the installation file the egg timer appears but then disappears and nothing happens.&nbsp;
 This happens for all the 3 download files.&nbsp; I have tried rebooting in between but this doesn't make any difference.&nbsp; Can you please advise.

            I can't believe it but about an hour after first trying to install .NET Framework 4, the installation screen appeared and appears to have installed correctly.&nbsp; Anyway when I then clicked on the ICE installer, that went through OK as well.&nbsp; So everything
 is sorted.&nbsp; <br />
I'm sorry to have bothered you, it does seem strange for the download/installation process to take so long, perhaps it has something to do with the children being on holiday.<br />

                    The display glass appears wavy, especially on the upper side. You notice especially with the computer turned off, because the reflected images appear deformed. When it is on, however, you notice less. Do you also have this problem? Is it normal?&nbsp;

            Hi indiosama, thank you for your answer. In the angles there are the same problem, but minor. No significant bulging. The computer is new.

            You need to contact Asus and find out when they are going to release keyboard drivers for your laptop that are Windows 8 compatible.&nbsp; They are responsible for this, not Microsoft.

<p>I ran Process Monitor and filtered it down the the drive letter and I see that the process wmiprvse is the only process there.</p>
<p>I did some research on it and found a kind of solution. When go into cmd prompt and type net stop wmimgmt, the spikes in task manager stop. I can even restart them, and the spikes do not come back.</p>
<p>I have ran virus and malware scans on all my HDDs and I have found nothing.<br />
</p>
<p>I have a windows 10 machine as follows:</p>

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Your screenshots didn't post.  Here's how to create and post them back using Attach Image button in reply box:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />There is more information about troubleshooting  WmiPrvSe here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/332838/what-is-the-wmi-provider-host-wmiprvse.exe-and-why-is-it-using-so-much-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/332838/what-is-the-wm...</a>
<br />
<br />This can also be due to drive backup bloatware that comes on some external drives, and the reason most enthusiasts wipe the drives of all code before using them:  
<br /><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-External-Hard-Drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-External-Hard-...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag from sticker on PC.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Usually virus or corrupt software causes this. And other factors.</p>
<p>And you can exclude defender and indexing from scanning or indexing your external drives.</p>
<p><strong>After you run a FULL VIRUS SCAN.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2014/08/11/wmi-high-memory-usage-by-wmi-service-or-wmiprvse-exe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askperf/2014/08/11/wmi-high-memory-usage-by-wmi-service-or-wmiprvse-exe/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I seen where bad system volume info files or bad drives can also cause this while constantly error reporting. Bad software installations can also cause this.</p>
<p>I would look in Event Viewer for clues.</p>
<p>Also run check disk/repair and see if that fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Final option</strong></p>
<p>Is the drive empty&nbsp; ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>if not, is the data on it small enough to move to other locations and then you can delete the volume and reformat it Quick NTFS, Make it Active and assign a drive letter and restart PC and then move data back to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also temporarily move data to another PC on your home network.</p>
<p>Open Network folder&gt;select the PC and then the PC's Public folder. Now copy and paste the data to a folder there. Then do the format and copy the files back to the drive. Then delete the copies on network PC and empty its recycle bin.</p>
<p>I use copy instead of move, in case something&nbsp; happens during the transfer, then&nbsp; you do not lose you data.</p>

<p>Ummm, I'm not sure what all that was about. I am looking for anyone that can provide me with an answer, I only put the photos onto Greg's response as at the time I wasn't sure how to edit the post. Now I am.</p>
<p>If you say that you know what the problem is, then by all means please enlighten me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your advice, I have run a malware scan and two AV scans, all of which came back clean.</p>
<p>I have run a checkdisk and an sfc check and they came back clean as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the drive is pretty full, which is more thatn 1.5 TB of files, which I can't really move anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, whilst doing some investigating of my own, it seems that the offending process is called "Sink to receive asynchronous callbacks for WMI client application" when I end that process, the disk reading and writing stops.</p>

<p>Well, instead of going into a long comment, This pretty much shows what I would do. But I would use Windows Resource Monitor which shows specifics of what is reading and writing to the drive. And event viewer will give you the info on the processes and they
 will lead you to the issue. </p>

</p><p><a href="https://windowsreport.com/wmiprvse-exe-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/wmiprvse-exe-windows-10/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The way I see it from your 3rd party app you used. It is showing that it is creating file and the closing on a loop. The top right of the photo shows a
<strong>partial error code</strong>. Put that error code onto web search and see what info you get. I would first stop the service and restart PC and then start it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the drive shared ???? Or any folders or files shared ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also make 4 new folders and move all the data to them. about 400GB per folder. Delete the original folders. empty recycle bin and Restart PC and see what happens.</p>

            Thanks, David.  Yes, work through the steps I gave above and report back all results.  
<br /> 
<br />I would also Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>

<p>I would not use Seagate tools on any brand drive but Seagate. Usually each OEM has their own. BUT WARNING, you can lose all of your data using drive tools, so be careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you have a Seagate drive, they all are GARBAGE and I would replace the drive. I have lots of experience with Seagate, their tools and their garbage drives.</p>

<h2>            Dreaded Event 129 Warning</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing the dreaded Event 129 Warning that causes freezing of windows 10 as well as slow write speed or hung drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have narrowed it down to the drive it is occuring on. I can consistently produce this error when I run a batch program which performs a snapshot raid function. (Snapraid)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I run this command, the error occurs every 30 seconds in the log. The drive it occurs on happens to be the "parity" drive which is the one that is being written too. The same time this is running the disk shows as 100% utilized, -although there
 is no activity happening on it. &nbsp;The process hangs and the PC freezes although I cans still move the mouse around. This behavior is identical to the behavior described in all the other posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed this command runs successful by making a different drive the parity drive. Everything runs fine then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also also connected multiple drives to the same SATA port that seems to be causing the issue. Old drive, new drive doesn't matter. I always get the Event 129 error. What could be the cause? &nbsp;Does this point to a hardware issue with the port on the
 motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to point out I have tried all the other suggestions from every other forum in regards to changing the power setttongs / registry along with the scans on the hard drives. &nbsp;I have done fresh installs of windows multiple times, used the stock windows
 drives as well as the Intel RST drivers. The same result happens for everything. &nbsp;I am perplexed as many others are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have confirmed this command&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Get Paypal payments back in shape for Xbox Live Gold subscription</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I wish to kindly request assistance for this problem I've been trying to solve for more than one month.</p>
<p>Paypal payments for Xbox Live Gold subscription are being refused, while displaying this text:</p>
<p><strong>PUR-ProcessorDeclined hU0qrF5wLku/zRrS.0.0.32.11 2019/06/10 - 10:11:33 UTC</strong></p>
<p>For the "rest of the world", including Paypal support (contacted twice), the Paypal account is working. Paypal states no records remain about the transactions you are declining: it is not Paypal who is blocking.</p>
<p>I've been a Gold customer all the way since 2013, please fix my payment method availability and tell me how to help solving this problem. Anyway, please consider i already checked:</p>
<p>- the card is ok;</p>
<p>- the credit is ok;</p>
<p>- Paypal account is ok...</p>
<p>
</p><p>... why are you blocking my payments?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertvires  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>So I noticed that this happened to a lot of people during the TP phase in 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Windows 10 (upgraded from 7) on my HP Pavillion G6 today. Install went fine no hang ups. Restarted my CPU like it asked me to do. Logged in and saw my desktop come up. Cortana started walking me through the system and then boom the BLACK SCREEN.
 Re-booted and always pulled up my desktop then flash a few times and back to black. Can see cursor, and could get to task manager and that's about it. All I can say is nightmare for a guy who is deployed and uses his CPU to call home. &nbsp;Rebooted about 30 times
 with the same issues. Finally it held on long enough to find where I have 30 days to go back and let me go back to Windows 7. I really like the features of 10 and thought about trying to download again but worried it will shut me out and I don't have time
 here to fix it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions???</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Robert,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to, some of the drivers got corrupted,<span>
</span>output to unexpected port, and possibly also issues with the Lock Screen app.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a) While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b) If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Run <strong>System File Checker</strong> (sfc) scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>

            Ive got the same issue but I have no desktop at all, just blackness. Any way that we can re-install the upgrade as I'm pretty sure that it may've just been a corrupt install or something like that???

            Ok so no lockhostapp.exe in details tab. This is a new download thats even worse than last time. I regret trying this again. Tried to do system file checker. Couldnt figure itnout before the screen went black. Restarted cpu and this time it didnt go black.
 Now I have my desktop flashing on and off. This is absurd really disappointed

            <p>hi, this is exactly happening to me. I could not see the lockhostapp.exe in windows 10 and did a scan in windows 7, which i reverted back. I even downloaded it and burned it to a disc,&nbsp; the black screen&nbsp; started with flashing after a few minutes of rebooting
 and windows10 desktop showing up. </p>

            <p>I'm also having a similar issue after upgrading freom Windows 7 Pro. After login there is a black desktop screen and a mouse arrow. The only function that works is Task Manager from CTRL+ALT+DEL.</p>
<p>How can I revert to the old windows 7 OS?</p>

            <p>So the way I found to do it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press CTL, ALT, DEL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold down shift key and click restart dont let up on shift key&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take you do another page</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there click reload previous build</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. I tried to load 10 three times. Not worth the trouble and as you can see only 1 response to this question from Microsoft. Good luck</p>

            <p>After many hours trying to get windows 10 to work. I finally got the taskbar to stop flashing in &amp; out to a complete black screen, within minutes of starting up. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that if i opened a browser it stayed and did not go black. It was only the task bar &amp; desktop screen &amp; icons disappeared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to right click the desktop display before it went black and updated the AMD driver in the&nbsp;Catalyst control centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also clicked reset this PC in settings which seems to have reinstalled windows 10. But it removed all programs that i had installed on my computer. It didn't touch any of my Docs/Files.&nbsp; The first thing I did was reinstall my
 security software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm not sure what sorted it out, the updated driver or resetting my PC? But the black screen has gone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the reboot / restarting computer has speeded up, as this was also painfully slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've noticed that videos are showing a green screen at times in Firefox &amp; and black in the new edge browser. I can hear the video but can't see them.

            1. This is more likely to be a hardware issue or CD/DVD issue. Please check your CD/DVDs are not scratched and in good shape. 
<br />
<br />2. Try to clean your CD/DVD with a clean cloth to remove dirt etc.
<br />
<br />3. From Windows side, you can do following -
<br />
<br />A. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />B. Update driver
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand DVD/CD Drives &gt; Right click on entry below &gt; Uninstall Device &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />C. Review following Microsoft Help
