<h2>            Download Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new Surface and downloaded Office from Office 365 website. I had Office 2016 on my old device, but now only Office 2019 is available for download. Outlook 2019 is not compatible with my version of Exchange 2010, so I need Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I download the Outlook 2016 installer? or even the entire Office 2016 installer?</p>

<br />
<br />The only thing I can do in reference to that link is report it to MS (which I'll be doing right after I add this post. But to clarify something, Office 2016 is no longer available for purchase from Microsoft in the event I misunderstood the original post (I took that to mean you want to re-install '2016 using a license previously purchased). If you need a new license for Office 2016, you'll need to purchase it from a 3rd party such as Amazon.
<br />
<br />in the meantime, if this is not related to a new purchase, given that you should have an existing MS Account for the Office 2016 purchase - have you tried logging into the account ( <a href="http://www.office.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com/account</a> ) and check to see if you can install Office? You would have to deactivate Office on your old device since a perpetual license only applies for one machine)
<br />
<br />(*** I unfortunately don't have any perpetual license installs to verify the above before posting this)

<p>
</p><p>Correct. I have an Office 365 subscription and do not have an Office 2016 license. I was using Office 2016 on my old machine and want to use it on my new machine, but bad timing, only 2019 is available and 2016 is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should allow us to download previous versions for compatibility like Adobe does. For perpetual license users we can download previous versions of Photoshop or Illustrator in case the latest version isn't compatible with the latest OS. In this case,
 Office 2019 is not compatible with Exchange 2010 and now I'm screwed.</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Can't speak to what you were told by the MS agents. The following is the info I was provided by my contact on the Outlook team:
<br />
<br />"Forgot to mention that Outlook 2019 still supports Exchange 2010.  I asked about this recently and the Outlook Team has not discussed not supporting it or blocking per the normal n-2. " 
<br />
<br />So the first question becomes - have you even tried connecting to your '2010 server or just assuming that it won't? (I tend to trust the info rec'd from the Outlook team far more then anything from an MS Agent).
<br />
<br />As for the download info, have already provided the URL for the '2016 download along with the corrected "services" link - have you tried this? Keep saying this but I don't have an account for a '2016 perpetual license to test this otherwise I would.

<h2>            Office 2016 for Mac - Unable to Activate</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm wondering if anyone can help or has experienced a similar problem. I have a work account for Office 365 that'll allow me to install the latest version of office. I've successfully installed on my PC but on my Mac, I get an error that states "Unable to
 Activate Office". It looks like a few people are experiencing the same issues and I've tried things that were suggested to them but with no success. Can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            Sender&#39;s Email Address is not shown on email received or when email printed</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook Live and am having trouble displaying the sender's email when viewing or printing the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open an inbox email, only the sender's name is displaying (ie. the sender's email address does not show) - the same happens when I print the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can click the drop down arrows to display the sender details on screen - but these details Do Not display when the email is printed</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing difficulties as when the email is printed for filing and is later needed to be replied to by a person who does not have access to the original receiving email account there is no sender address displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can also cause difficulties later as if the letter is required for legal reasons, the printed version does not display the sender's email address and therefore is not recognised by the legal parties as the actual origin of the email is not known/recorded
 on the printed version.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop IE11 from automatically adding favorites&#63;</h2>
                    <p>IE11 is adding multiple copies of the same 3 webpages every time as a favorite whenever I visit them. Also, Bing&nbsp;gets added as a favorite multiple times as well (even when I haven't been to the webpage).</p>
<p>The 3 pages are being added under the favorites bar. Bing is just being added to favorites.</p>
<p>I delete them but they keep coming back and now there are hundreds of these same pages as favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 8.1 installed on a HP laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,<br />
<br />
This issue might occur due to virus, Add-ons.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to check if the issue persists in no add-ons mode and also try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</a><span><br />
<br />
</span><strong>Method 2:</strong><span> </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to reset Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Change or reset Internet Explorer settings<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11</a><br />
<br />
</span></span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy
 settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> I would suggest you to run online virus scan. <br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with
 your existing antivirus software.</span><span><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:<span>&nbsp; </span>1) </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft
 Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2)
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected
 with virus then they might even get deleted.</span></p>

<p>Open Windows Features and read them.&nbsp; Verify that they are in alphabetical order.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you saying that there is no item in there which starts with&nbsp; Internet Explorer?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your symptom means that that item is unchecked.&nbsp; However, somehow some users are finding that they do not have an item which can be checked to undo that effect.&nbsp; A suspicion is that this is something that an administrator could do&nbsp;or that installing a different
 browser may be doing this but the most likely scenario would be that malware is responsible for such a symptom.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In answer to your question you already have IE11 but you just don't have an iexplore.exe stub to use it with.&nbsp; To see this open msinfo32.exe at Loaded Modules, sort by Version and find modules which start with 11.0.&nbsp; There is no way to "install" IE11 (nor
 any complete, designed repair tools for it), only to reload your OS.</p>

                    My IIS7 server recently stopped authenticating my application (in IE8 but works in FireFox) when set to Windows Integrated mode.&nbsp; I've looked at articles that suggest kerberos is not working properly and that I should use NTLM (and one way to force IE8
 to use NTLM but that didnt' work).&nbsp; I saw an article that said use SETSPN.EXE but I can't find a version for Vista.&nbsp; Not sure where to get it, any ideas?

<p><span><span>Windows authentication, which includes both NTLM and Kerberos&nbsp;v5 authentication, is best suited for an intranet environment for the
 following reasons:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Client computers and Web servers are in the same domain.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Administrators can make sure that every client browser is Internet Explorer 2.0 or later versions.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>HTTP proxy connections, which are not supported by NTLM, are not required.</span></span>

</p><p>Can anyone help me to get the new builds to stay installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Several builds have been released since 14342.&nbsp; The fast ring group has been getting frequent new builds with 14376 received yesterday.&nbsp; I have it up and running on 2 PCs with no reports of major problems from the Insider group.&nbsp; The slow ring also got access
 to a very recent ISO.&nbsp;&nbsp; A host of bugs were reported as being fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is often difficult to diagnose an issue on a system that is not current.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a update troubleshooter that might help but I would be tempted to run it up to either the latest slow ring or even the fast ring.&nbsp; If this fails, then at least you know
 you are dealing with an issue that has not been corrected in later builds.</p>

<h2>            Move Outlook.com Custom Domain Hosting to Office 365 Home Premium NOT Small Business Premium</h2>
                    <p>I am an existing user for Outlook.com and I use custom domains for email</p>
<p>I also have an Office365 Home Premium subscription</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure everyone has received the email stating that Outlook.com will no longer be used for custom domain and MSFT is pushing existing users to use Office365 Small business premium.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Dear Outlook.com Customer,</em><br />
<br />
<em>We want to inform you of some important changes to the Windows Live Admin Center: As of April 10th 2014, Outlook.com no longer supports new custom domain sign ups. We appreciate that you have used this service and we regret to inform you of this change.
 This email will explain the upcoming changes and your options as a valued customer.</em><br />
<br />
<em>As a current customer, we will continue to support the ability to log in to Outlook.com with your existing custom domain email address, but as of July 31st 2014, you will no longer be able to add or remove accounts in your domain.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Instead, we recommend that administrators who wish to continue managing email addresses in their domain should consider Office 365 - Microsoft's premium online email service. By migrating to Office 365, you will be able to continue managing your custom
 domains, as well as benefit from modern enterprise-class mail, collaboration and communication tools.</em><br />
<br />
<em>We would like to offer you a complimentary 90 day subscription to Office 365 Small Business Premium for 5 users if you sign up before July 15th 2014. Office 365 Small Business Premium includes the latest copy of Office for your PC / Mac &amp; iPad, 50GB business-class
 email, OneDrive for Business online storage and more.</em><br />
<br />
<em>You will still be able to log in to Outlook.com with your custom domain during your Office 365 subscription, and even if you choose to cancel your Office 365 subscription.</em><br />
<br />
<em>How to redeem this offer</em><br />
<br />
<em>Click here to be taken to the Office 365 sign-up form. Your subscription will already be selected and all you need to do is confirm the transaction.</em><br />
<br />
<em>How to migrate your account</em><br />
<br />
<em>You can find a step-by-step guide to migrating your account here.</em><br />

<em>Sincerely,</em><br />
<em>The Outlook.com Team</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I am perfectly happy with Office365 Home Premium 79$ a year for 5 computers and I do not want to pay 150$ for just 1 computer with Office365 Small business premium because I don't need the other business features.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Is there any way I can move the domain admin stuff to Office365 Home Premium instead of Office365 Small business premium?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just the same as above. I've been using Live domains for a number of years now for my personal domain. Being pushed to use a business class service seems wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd consider paying for a personal offering, something along the lines of a Home premium + that allows the use of my domain with up to 5 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise I'll have to consider google as an alternative and look to return the Nokia phone I've just purchased.</p>

            The google service is no longer free either. Hasn't been for a while. I think it's now $5 per user per month. Not sure if you get any extras for the money - maybe you do.

<p>You are indeed correct, however my domain already&nbsp;has the google service attached and they honour the account for free. So I do have the choice to move services there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do however prefer the Microsoft service, but it's not worth the business rates and I can get similar services with google for free(perhaps they will change in the future also, but I suspect that's less likely).</p>

<p><span>First, we apologize for the delay in sending a response. We understand the concerns you are having with your domain accounts and we'll be glad to help you address it.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that after evaluating our custom domain service in Outlook.com we have made the decision to no longer support new custom domain sign ups and encourage those in need of domain services to use Office 365.
 For many custom domain administrators, Office 365 is an ideal service, providing access to its many productivity tools including shared calendars, cloud storage, instant messaging and GoDaddy domain hosting.</span></p>

            I tried that and it sadly didn't help. I even did a factory reset on my phone (moto z2 force). I'll try installing an older version of Skype but I know sooner or later I'll have to upgrade it so I hope there's another answer.

            <p>Hi Zakiyass</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your additional question. It has a bit of a complicated answer as it depends on the purpose and location of your ad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance in US and Canada it is fine to bid on a competitor name, as long as you are not using that name in any way that makes it look like you are the brand owner or are offering services that only the brand owner can offer. You would not be able to
 say in an ad that you offer 3rd party techsupport for a brand that you do not own. You also can not say that you offer&nbsp;products, like for instance a name brand purse, that looks like that of the brand owner but are not from that brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In countries such as the UK you are not permitted even to bid on the brand name of your competitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Misspellings are allowed, but again not in relation to uses above in cases of branding. For example, if your url were
<a href="http://www.zakiyass.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.zakiyass.com</a> it would be fine to bid Zaciyass.com, just be sure not to use dynamic keyword insertion as that may cause confusion.</p>

<h2>            LUMIA 610-- Sync problem or not supported in LUMIA 610 &#63;Tell me.....</h2>
                    
<p>First of all ,Internet Explorer donot allow the download of any videos or audios (mp3),instead if streaming is available it will play it directly, e.g. videos from m.vuclip.com or simmilar other sites<strong>.IE</strong> will stream the videos without giving
 the option to download it,so that we can view it in OFFLINE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to "UC BROWSER" I can Download the videos from any site of any format be it *.3gp , *.wmv , *.asf&nbsp; or any format and I can play that videos too in my mobile too in offline mode (without internet connection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all these downloaded videos are not available in ZUNE player of my mobile or NOKIA player of mobile,even though these files are present in the mobile.Every time I need to open the UC BROWSER in order to play those files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my downloaded files are visible in any of the video player of NOKIA LUMIA 610 nor it get Synchronised with my laptop when I connect it ,using ZUNE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I want to know is it a Synchronisation problem or Windows phone doesnot support the synchronisation of "SUPPORTED i.e. PLAYABLE VIDEOS FILES or MP3 FILES"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If presently its not available in our phone ,then can I expect the synchronisation of downloaded files (be it any browser ) of any format to our computer/Laptops ,etc.</p>

            <p>So my symptom of this problem is a little different, and I'm curious if your answer still applies/is sufficient?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have a hotmail account set to sync Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Reminders with Outlook 2016 on my windows 10 surface pro 3 (64bit)</p>
<p>- I have the same account set to sync Mail, Calendar, Contacts on my iPhone 6s&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until last week, this has been working fine, but now the contacts in outlook 2016 is empty???&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I log on to outlook.com, I see what appears to be the correct set of contacts, yet they don't have Names (just Company Names) - so SOMETHING has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my outlook contacts back/synching?</p>

 check Business again, and the same thing is happening.&nbsp; Is 'Validation' no longer a valid registry value for updatebranch?&nbsp; I also tried "FirstReleaseDeferred" and that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as of this week, I don't know how to&nbsp;use Group Policy or the Registry to set office&nbsp;clients to First Release for Deferred.&nbsp; Can&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;else verify whether&nbsp;or not they are experiencing the&nbsp;same issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Dchap123,<br />
<br />
I'd like to share the outcome of my research and test on Office channel update behaviors when configuring group policy "Update Channel" and related registry settings.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two Win 10 computers with a domain controller (Windows Server 2012 R2) configured to push group policy settings.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office Product “Office 365 Business” and “Office 365 ProPlus” installed via Office 365 portal on individual machines.<br />
<br />
Available entries under registry path <em>HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\common\officeupdate\updatebranch</em> are:<br />
<strong>Current</strong> --- Current Channel<br />
<strong>FirstReleaseCurrent</strong> --- Office Insider slow (First Release for Current Channel)<br />
<strong>InsiderFast</strong> --- Office Insider Fast<br />
<strong>Business</strong> --- Deferred Channel<br />
<strong>Deferred</strong> --- Deferred Channel<br />
<strong>FirstReleaseDeferred</strong> --- First Release for Deferred<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use "FirstReleaseDeferred" instead of "Validation" for First Release for Deferred channel. See reference
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt455210.aspx?f=255&amp;mspperror=-2147217396#Anchor_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8f625cf-f8d8-4257-9050-7a9134c58eff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8f625cf-f8d8-4257-9050-7a9134c58eff" /></a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same behavior happens for both “Office 365 Business” and “Office 365 ProPlus” when performing Update Now action after setting the registry/group policy.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting up corresponding group policy value will perform the same effect.<br />
<br />
Office client will not update when you want to switch between Current and First Release for Deferred channel by setting up the registry/group policy as above.<br />
<br />
For example, if the installed channel is Current Channel (i.e. “Current”) and you set registry/group policy value to “FirstReleaseDeferred”, Office client regards installed version as up-to-date and channel won’t be changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan<br />

    <title>Outlook Calendar Print Out Appointment Text is HUGE&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cashxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar Print Out Appointment Text is HUGE&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have been having issues with printing calendars since Office 2016 has come out. &nbsp;I usually print out our master calendar for the building so I can quickly glance at it when I need to. Been a major pain since moving to 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do a print preview on the monthly calendar the Appointment text is huge! &nbsp;The print out looks the same way. I have tried everything to try and fix it like printing to another printer, adjust Outlook/Printer settings and no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone seen this and know of a fix or is it a bug in Outlook that needs fixed by Microsoft? &nbsp;Below are some pics of the calendar, the preview and what prints out.</p>

            Is it an issue only with outlook or other office programs as well?<br />
Have you updated Office version to 15.19?<br />
Check if same problem occurs in new user account.

            Its just the Calendar in Outlook as far as I seen. &nbsp;I haven't updated to 15.19, I don't think an official release has been put out yet, but I guess it's patch Tuesday. &nbsp;Nothing showing up yet in auto update. Making a new account and removing prefs and
 starting fresh hasn't fixed the issue.

    <title>Videos and pics on Ovi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manudrum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Videos and pics on Ovi</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, all. Just started using Ovi with my N79. I have two problems, and i hope the most experienced users help me out with this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)When I use the Sync function, I set it to sync multimedia (pics and vids). The problem is that I dont know where are the files going, despite I set Desktop, I cannot find them anywhere in my computer.&nbsp;I know they are transferred to my pc because of the
 sync history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)When I open the gallery tab, the software begins to search for all the images, videos and music.The problem is that it searches not only for the files I created, but searches also for the temporary files. I have tried to erase the folder from My PC, and
 still they are shown on Ovi soft. I have tried to erase them one by one, but they are over 20.000 files, so I think it wouldn't be practical. I have attached a pic showing some of the files. I see it this way: Despite I erase the temp folder, the files are
 still shown, and it's like the gallery needs to be refreshed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The very first file you'll see, in the red circle, means that it couldn't be open, because I erased the temp folder, but as I say, it is still there. So my question is, is there anyway to "refresh" or make these files do not show up next time I open Ovi
 Software??? thanks and sorry for being so confusing...</p>

<p>I hope you are using Nokia OVI Suite latest version.&nbsp; If you can see the video files or pictures in Gallery of Nokia OVI Suite, select that particular video or picture, right click and check for Open containing folder, you can see where exactly those files
 are stored physically on your PC.&nbsp; I guess this is what you want to know :)</p>

<p>Does anybody know, how to store the converted videos onto PC itself...?</p>
<p>OVI Suite converts the videos to mp4 format and transfers it to Phone only. I cannot find the option to store the converted videos to PC.</p>
<p>Since this gives me limitation to always connect my Phone to PC, while converting the Videos through OVI.</p>
<p>What i need to do everytime is start converting video -&gt; it automatically gets uploaded in Phone -&gt; then copy back from Phone to PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of this , i want to convert all the movies first directly on to PC..isnt that better option to save the time...?</p>

<h3> pbetz  say:</h3>
<h2>            FILE ASSOCIATIONS</h2>
                    <p>After installing a trial version of Visio 2016 via Office 365, all the file associations for the other Microsoft Office apps became broken.&nbsp; Attempts to rebuild associations via Settings and/or Control Panel have failed (Office apps are unavailable).&nbsp; The
 Office apps are not available to re-associate with their file types.&nbsp; The apps themselves can be opened (from their icons in the taskbar) and used to open their file types, but clicking on the data files themselves brings error: "This action is only valid
 for products that are currently installed" or "How do you want to open this file?"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visio file associations are OK.</p>
<p>

<h2>            how to redeem points&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My 94 year old mother in law, my 80 year old mother and I each have separate bing accounts but we only have 1 computer since none of us have a need to have individual computers.&nbsp; when we tried to redeem points, we get a message that we need to contact support.&nbsp;
 When we did that Bing support said that our accounts have been suspended because we have multiple accounts.&nbsp; However, according to the bing rewards program, it just said that you need to be older than 13 years old and register under your real name, which we
 did.&nbsp; Is there an actual person we can talk to to redeem the points we've already accumulated?&nbsp; Doing the searches and playing the games have been the highlights of our day since we don't get out much.&nbsp; thanks so much for any advice you can give. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Using IF to determine value of Checkbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> just me_0315  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using IF to determine value of Checkbox</h2>
                    <p>I asked&nbsp; a question the other day and didn't get a response so I have checked other places and have one-half the answer.&nbsp; Here's the problem.&nbsp; I have checkboxes (created with FormControl) on one worksheet.&nbsp; On a second worksheet I have to display the value
 of 1 if the box is checked and nothing if the box is unchecked.&nbsp; I saw where someone said to create a link on the checkbox form control to the field on the other worksheet.&nbsp; That works fine.&nbsp; If I check the box on the main worksheet it puts the word True in
 the cell on the other worksheet and a False if I remove the check in the box. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the real problem.&nbsp; I need to change the TRUE value to a "X" and the FALSE value to "".&nbsp; The article said to create an IF statement in the cell containing the True or False to test for the value of True or False and change the value to what you want.&nbsp;
 My formula is =IF(B3=TRUE,"X","").&nbsp; =IF(TRUE,"X","") also works.&nbsp; It works fine the 1st time.&nbsp; It immediately changes the value to X or "" depending on the value of the checkbox.&nbsp; However, If I go to the main spreadsheet and change the checkbox to the opposite
 value the cell value containing the IF reverts back to the word FALSE&nbsp; or TRUE in the cell and my formula is gone.&nbsp; Disappears!&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks for any ideas!</p>

<p>As you have found, you cannot use a formula in the cell linked to the check box. Instead, use a combination of formatting and conditional formatting.</p>

<p>All cells now appear empty, but don't worry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Home tab of the ribbon, select Conditional Formatting &gt; New Rule...</p>
<p>Select 'Format only cells that contain'.</p>
<p>Leave the first dropdown set to the default 'Cell Value'.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;the box next to it, enter&nbsp;TRUE</p>
<p>Click Format...</p>
<p>Activate the Number tab.</p>

<p>In the Type box, enter three semi-colons followed by an X:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;;;X</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is possible that the email which you have received could be a Spam email.I would like to inform you that Spam is any kind of email that you don’t want and that you didn’t sign up to receive. Some spam is annoying but harmless, but some might be
 part of an identity theft scam or other kind of fraud. You can get spam in instant messages, text messages, and on your social networking sites.
</span><span>To&nbsp;assist you further could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>How do you access Outlook.com? Is it through a Web Browser or an Email Client?</span></span></li><li><span><span>What&nbsp; happens when you try to delete the Email?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you receive any error message?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you're using Outlook.com then refer to the link below for more information about spamming and how to deal with it:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/abuse-phishing-junk-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/abuse-phishing-junk-email</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also refer to the Microsoft help Article for more information and check if this helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/spam-prevent.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/spam-prevent.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, I would suggest you to set your Junk email filter to Exclusive. If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe Senders lists will be sent to the Junk folder. By default, the Junk folder will automatically
 delete messages after 10 days. This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address. Follow the steps below on how to set to Exclusive and check if this helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span>Sign in to your Outlook.com account.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click cog or gear icon then select Options.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under preventing junk email, click Filters and reporting.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under Choose a junk email filter, select Exclusive.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Hope this answers your query and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</span></span></p>

            <p>The sample application in my Simil download package is called "Northwind_Simil_2000.mdb". This suggests which version it was designed for.
</p>
<p>At the time it was the lowest version of Access I had available, and I used it hoping for the broadest reach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the intervening years comments have been received, versions have changed, and I am committed to publishing an Access 2007 ACCDB version "soon". It will still be 32-bit, per MSFT recommendations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time there are no plans for a 64-bit version of simildll, nor for a 64-bit version of the Access sample application. That said, I'm sure any average-level Visual Studio jockey can figure out how to recompile the DLL, and any average-level VBA programmer
 can figure out how to convert the API declarations to 64-bit. If such person approaches me with a winning version, I'll be happy to add it to the blog post.</p>
