<h2>            Install and activate Windows using OEM product key</h2>
                    <p>i had some issues with UEFI on my system and went to a local store as there is no support for acer in my country and the local guy flash my uefi bios to a non uefi version. i read in an article that product key to my preinstalled window was in the bios.
 i some how used a VB script that i found on a website to know my product key which is activated. (1) can i still&nbsp; use that product key ? . I ran the recovery drive utility and made a usb for recovery along with recovery partition.(2) can i use the product
 key with the recovery usb in case my hard disk system partions are also formatted?</p>

            <p>Why was the BIOS flashed to an older version? </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no WIndows 7 OEM embedded Product Key so I'm not sure what that means.&nbsp; I asked you to run two programs to compare the reported Windows 8 OEM-BIOS key.&nbsp; We are not interested here in any other reported key except OEM-BIOS.&nbsp; Do they match?&nbsp; If none
 is reported then it was wiped with the BIOS flash.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact the manufacturer's tech support to ask how to retrieve your key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it will reactivate without the embedded key if you reinstall.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However if it's presently activated then what I would do is follow <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10 Upgrade</a></p>
<p>to secure the free Upgrade now before it expires July 31st, then you will have permanent entitlement on the PC for Windows 10 in MS Activation servers apart from any WIndows 8 key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can first do the install to another partition you shrink from C in Disk Mgmt, as long as you boot the media during the install to choose the new partition, then watch after install to see if it activates from Windows 8 on the drive and if so feel safe
 to delete Windows 8 when ready (or not).&nbsp; Until then use the Dual Boot menu at boot to choose.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I would do in your position, and the sooner the better.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the embedded Product Key was wiped out during BIOS flash, and the manufacturer's tech support will not help you, your best bet is to secure free Windows 10 Upgrade for the rest of
 the life of the PC.&nbsp; The link provides the very best install and has no complaints reported at all from tens of thousands who have used it.</p>

I'm not really very knowledgeable when it comes to the way individual computer components work, or how to repair them myself, but if I'm having this problem wouldn't there be nothing I could do personally to transfer the data? &nbsp;I guess what I really need to
 know is, if I drop $100 on this repair, will I get all of my data back for my trouble? &nbsp;It wouldn't be the end of the world if I wouldn't, but if it turns out I don't, I might as well just buy a new hard drive.</p>

<p>Hey again,<br />
<br />
What I would do is buy a transfer cable. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/set-up-transfer-cable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here to learn how to use one</a><br />
<br />
I would buy a new hard drive because they are pretty cheap now-a-days. As Onyx said, MS isn't responsible for transferring your data so I wouldn't expect that to happen in all honesty.<br />
<br />
I just saw a transfer cable for 10 euro the other day. I would go that route unless you really want to get your hdd repaired (if under warranty) and chance losing your data.<br />
<br />
If you are not that concerned about losing your stuff, buy a new hard drive and try the transfer cable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Normally they will replace it and they will not transfer or save data. your better off buying a used drive locally and try to transfer the data yourself using a data transfer kit, usually you can get them both at the same place.
</p>
<p>you may also consider your data lost most likely the case sorry to burst your bubble. But you could put the money towards a new Xbox 360 S you'll be better off in the long run. you can re download all your content you will only lose game saves unless they
 are on the cloud or a usb as a back up.</p>

            Hi Adam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus?  I'd uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running the built-in Defender which assures best Windows performance and least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />Then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer stopped with &#34;Save Incomplete&#34; message.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to save my files to an external HD using Windows Easy Transfer&nbsp;so that I can upgrade my PC from Vista to 7.&nbsp; When the process was probably about 98% complete, the status screen displayed that the save was incomplete and the MIG files that were
 created during this 3 hour process all disappeared.&nbsp; I successfully used this application about 3 months, but never got around to doing the upgrade so I'm doing the backup again to make sure I cover any new files since that previous save.&nbsp; Any idea why this
 may have occurred?&nbsp; I have plenty of space on my external HD.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>1. What is the capacity of your external hard drive?<br />
2. What is the estimation of Windows Easy Transfer on the amount of disk space required?<br />
3. Are you trying to transfer any programs?</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the transfer process, Windows Easy Transfer will estimate how much disk space is needed to transfer your selections. If you use a USB flash drive, use one with enough storage space for the entire transfer.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Easy Transfer transfers only program settings, not the programs themselves.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you transfer files containing malicious software from your old computer, that software can be transferred to your new computer. You should run antivirus and spyware protection programs at all times, especially on your old computer, before you select
 files to transfer.</p>
<p>Try running a virus scan and check what happens: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials</a></p>
<p>Some malware/spyware/virus that is out on the Internet, will also change system settings, corrupt data, and log invalid registries that will also make annoying errors, as like the ones you are encountering.&nbsp; You can try a virus scan. Just keep in mind that
 if your system does contains a virus, the active virus can try to keep the system from installing/using the virus scan correctly. Online Virus scans (sometimes) will not have that problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://onecare.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com</a>&nbsp; - OneCare is Microsoft's Virus Scan.&nbsp; You can attempt using the OneCare Safety Scanner. That is OneCare's online Scanner. Sometimes it will not launch properly if your system is not under a specific
 ordinance.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />You can uninstall Outlook (along with the rest of Microsoft Office) by following these steps:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "Apps &amp; Features"
<br />- Click on the first result.
<br />- Scroll down in the list of apps until you find "Microsoft Outlook" or "Microsoft Office"
<br />- Click on it and you'll have the option to uninstall.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you'd like further support! Thanks!       
        </p>

<h2>            I&#39;m connected to the internet, but not connected.</h2>
                    I am currently connected to the internet. I can surf the web and watch videos. I recently tried to download AVG anti virus and it said I was not connected to the interent. I also cannot play any online games; it says I have no connection. I also tried
 to install updates to Itunes and microsoft office 2003, but it said I have no connection. I have other computers that are connect to this wireless router just fine, like xbox 360, ps3, and 2 laptops. This computer that is having the problem is home built and
 has only recently had this problem. Any help would be great. Thank you

<p>Who/What is this "it" that keeps saying that?</p>
<p>Do the messages really say:</p>

<p>I was able to download and run the suggested websites. Both the malware and spyware found a few things which it corrected, however I'm still not able to connect to the interent with some prgrams. The first program is an online game called World of Warcraft.
 I've contacted their support team which told me that everything with the game and its required ports was fine.&nbsp;I then called my service provider who also told me that my internet service was fine. When I try to play this online game it says "unable to connect
 to the internet". I clearly have a connection to the internet since i can be on the web at the same time&nbsp;as I get this error. I am currently running Internet Explorer 8. I also recently tried to download a trail version of AVG anti virus. This cam from the
 website&nbsp;Cnet just like the spyware and&nbsp;malware i downloaded yesterday. When it tried to check my connection it says I dont have one and asked for proxy settings which I am not running. Next, microsoft downloaded an update for my microsoft word 2003 program.
 It downloaded on my computer, but when I try to activate&nbsp;the update it says the "the activation&nbsp;was unable to find a connection to the internet." &nbsp;The last thing I tryed was running a Network Diagnostic from the tools tab on the interent. This says that "A

<p>Your msinfo32 looks fine except I wonder if you have manually adjusted your Windows Virtual Memory paging file settings? &nbsp;That is not your connectivity problem but it looks like it has been tinkered with. &nbsp;Unless you know more about managing virtual memory
 than XP, it is best to just let XP handle all that stuff and leave the settings at System managed size.</p>
<p>I am not a WoW player and do not use IE8 but it would seem that some of the other stuff should work. &nbsp;IE8 has the most overhead of just about any Internet browser you could choose to use. &nbsp;I will not be much help with IE8 issues, but don't despair... these
 forums are flooded with Microsoft MVPs and VSOPs.</p>
<p>Here is what sometimes happens after a malicious software attack and you can check these things on your system. &nbsp;Some of it depends on the&nbsp;unspecified"few things" found by the scans, which I don't know that either. &nbsp;SAS usually just finds some tracking cookies
 after MBAM.</p>
<p>If you are compelled to install AVG, I would advise you to do a custom install instead of letting it just install everything it feels like installing, or you may not be enjoying your WoW too much when you get done:</p>
<p>When installing AVG select the CUSTOM install option and do NOT&nbsp;install (i.e., uncheck) Linkscanner, Search-Shield, Active Surf-Shield,&nbsp;Security toolbar or any of the email scanning components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why you don't need your anti-virus to scan your email: &nbsp;<a href="http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm</a></p>
<p>Now for your connectivity issue:</p>
<p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>inetcpl.cpl</p>
<p>Click OK to launch the Internet Properties control panel applet. &nbsp;These settings&nbsp;control your Internet access for all browsers.</p>
<p>Or, from Internet Explorer click Tools, Internet Options, Connections, LAN Settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On <strong>most</strong> home environments, there will be a check in Automatically detect settings and&nbsp;the other boxes are (like Proxy server) are unchecked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Automatically detect setting = checked</p>
<p>Use automatic configuration script = UNchecked</p>
<p>Use a proxy server for your LAN = UNchecked</p>
<p>Some malware will tamper with these settings and your anti malware software can't tell if&nbsp;you changed them or malware changed them so after removing any infections, it will just&nbsp;leave the settings as it finds them (this is a good thing) but may leave your
 Internet&nbsp;access disabled.</p>
<p>Once connectivity is restored, reboot your system to be sure the connections "stick".</p>
<p>If things are worse, undo the changes and continue troubleshooting.</p>

<div>If the DNS configurations between the two machines are different - then the infection has left behind a false DNS instruction - and it has to be cleared.</div>
<div>Hopefully, it'll be as simple as opening the Properties for the Network Connection involved, and resetting to the default - which is to automatically find the DNS servers from the ISP's selection.</div>
<div>Some infections hide this, and it needs to be rooted out manually from the registry.</div>
<div>I had one machine, where malware had actually created a complete virtual Network connection that had to be removed from the registry before that PC could connect properly to anything outside itself.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>That should work - providing the ISP uses DHCP rather than static IP, and the malware isn't hiding behind windows changing things before they get to the network adapter,&nbsp;which is why I said to compare the output of the IPCONFIG - because that goes to the
 hardware and queries it, rather than the registry.</div>

<p>I know how it works, but Bronzegod and lots of other people may not know how it works or how to run ipconfig or how to look at the settings and make any adjustments. &nbsp;The advice is good, but sometimes results in additional and frustrating forum message cycles
 when if the advice had a few more details targeted at a novice user (but still work for more experienced users), they might get the problem solved in one message cycle.</p>
<p>I will add it to my copy/paste directions for the symptoms described so that hopefully even a novice can follow the instructions well enough to get their system running again for those situations.</p>
<p>I like to do as little typing as possible when it comes to fixing these routine issues. If I type it in once, I don't want to ever type it in again. &nbsp;I use speech recognition to utter key phrases like "verify internet settings" and will be able to just copy
 and paste relevant/all instructions from a window instead of doing any actual typing. &nbsp;This is why so many of my posts look exactly the same (sometimes with a little editing).</p>
<p>I was quite sure that Bronzegod was not going to get far and have the problem of not seeing the results of ipconfig and there was no advice for what to do when the results of ipconfig came in. &nbsp;Additional message cycles are generated and time is spent waiting
 for further assistance, and the problem is still no further along towards resolution than it was 23 hours ago. &nbsp;Not everybody knows what to do.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>No power to Laptop or computer does not turn on?
<br />
<br />
Do you see the power light on the Laptop, if not there could be multiple reasons like improper connections / Third-party hardware / Bad Power cable / Incorrect power supply / Bad Power Supply, power button, and/or power board or inverter. I would suggest you
 to reach out to the Laptop Manufacturer for additional support on this issue. <span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Do you get any error message which says that the issue is with .Net Framework 2.0?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The 404 or Not Found error message is a HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find what was requested.<br />
<br />
The web site hosting server will typically generate "404 - Not Found" web page, when users attempts to follow a broken or dead link, hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors users can find on the web</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>So, check with website if there is an issue at the server end.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Refer this link, download and install the pack.<br />

            <p>The error message says it cannot find Net Framework 2.0 even though it is on my computer. 2 other laptops in our home work. I'm thinking it has to do with a security feature with my laptop.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program is a sketching program inside of a form on a website. I click on the edit button and it takes me to a window that asks me to download Net framework 2.0. I agree and then it gives me the error message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other laptops in our home go directly to the sketching program. I have heard this has been an issue with several others.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Analog Stick Drift - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> purplelazer04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller Analog Stick Drift</h2>
                    <p>I've been playing Xbox for a while now. I started out with the Xbox 360, and I currently am using an Xbox One. I never had a controller problem with the 360, but with the Xbox One, I do. I've seen other posts about the stick drift and how the parts are the cheapest that Microsoft can get their hands on. Being a die-hard Xbox fan for years, I have no intention of switching to a different console. All I request is that I get help with fixing the analog stick, or a new custom designed controller like the one I currently have. I've tried fixing the stick drift for a while now. Everything I've seen online hasn't worked, and it's getting me irritated.</p>

<p>Hi </p>

</div>
<div>I'm currently not able to type an underscore, at all or use shift to make a plus. All the other shift and key combinations work, aside from plus but that does work by hitting the plus key on the numerical part of the keyboard. I also tried&nbsp;entering&nbsp;underscore
 with the on screen keyboard, but that did not work either. I have no idea when it started, but I cannot think of any obvious cause.</div>
<div>Does anyone have any idea what is going on? I'm stumped.</div>

            Solved! Thanks!
<div><br />
<div>I did what you said, but eventually used task manager to eliminate the process making trouble with those keys.</div>
<div>The problem was SoundBlaster Control Panel.</div>
<div>Solved it by removing the hot keys that were assigned to it.</div>

<p>Hello Gino, <br />
<br />
We hope that the Community can provide ideas that can help you meet the concern.<br />
<br />
Based on the details you've stated in your post regarding the make and model of your device, please note that it is not on the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-all-devices?type=WindowsHello#filter_block" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list of compatible laptops</a> for the said brand. Noting that no changes were made, but system fails to recognize the Windows Hello feature, it could be that system no longer supports the camera driver installed. We recommend to check with the device manufacturer
 to confirm if driver update is now available and if they have a more established workaround regarding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense to update the lock screen image to be displayed the day before and then the following day the lock screen could be a windows spotlight image.&nbsp; Just replace the picture I have to look at every day with an updated one the day before.</p>

 It looks like you have a work-around (sleep or hibernate) available to you at this time, and as such I'm going to bow out of the conversation now. :)</p>

    <title>Transfer Windows Live Mail emails from a dead computer to Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcorovati  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Windows Live Mail emails from a dead computer to Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, <br />
<br />
I am a technician and I came across a dead computer but the hard drive is still working. I put the hard drive into another pc and I have to save all the emails and the contacts that were saved locally in that pc.<br />
I found the main&nbsp;folder which contains all the data I need to save.<br />
<br />
The question is: is possible to use that folder to import emails into Outlook 2016 installed in the new pc?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention.<br />
Greetings.</p>

            <p>Hi Marco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description I understand that you are trying to import emails to Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve this issue you may follow the steps as suggested in the following Microsoft Article:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/980534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/980534</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> To be able to export Emails and other information from Windows Live Mail to Outlook, you need to make sure to have Outlook installed on the same computer on which you have installed Windows Live Mail. Once you have
 exported your WLM data from Windows Live Mail to Outlook, you need to transfer the data via the Outlook PST file to your computer on which you have Outlook 2016 installed.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps from the following Microsoft Article to transfer the Outlook Data File from one computer to the other:<br />
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Move-an-Outlook-data-file-from-one-computer-to-another-E7B2E7B2-FB87-406C-85C7-04D4B69CF9A0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Move-an-Outlook-data-file-from-one-computer-to-another-E7B2E7B2-FB87-406C-85C7-04D4B69CF9A0</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The steps mentioned in the above article are shown for the Outlook 2007 version, however the same steps apply for Outlook 2013/2016 as well.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Divya,</p>
<p>Thank you for the answer. <br />
The problem is that the PC where Windows live mail is installed is dead, the hard disk only is still working.<br />
I've put the hard disk into another pc but since the hard drive is going to die too I'm not using it as boot disk but as second drive.<br />
So, I copied the Windows live Mail folder (from c/users/user/windows/microsoft/windows live mail)&nbsp;into another drive and I'm asking if is possible to use this folder to recover emails and contacts.
<br />
If I put this folder into the new machine where's installed windows live mail, is possible to restore everything using that folder?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your attention.<br />
Have a nice&nbsp;day.<br />
<br />
<br />
M. R.</p>

            If the red and blue dots are staying in the same place they are likely stuck pixels.<br />
<br />
Check with the manufacturer to see if they will replace the monitor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some methods that claim to possibly repair a stuck pixel.<br />

<h2>            Cannot install driver for Canoscan 8800F on Windows 7 Home 64x</h2>
                    My Canon scanner has functioned without any problem for many months on my not so old pc with Windows Home Premium 7, until suddenly it did not work anymore, for no apparent reason. When I try to start it, I get an error message saying that the driver for
 the scanner has not been installed. I have tried using the official Canon CD that I got with the printer - it did not work. Then I downloaded the latest driver from Canon for Windows 7 (and the Canoscan 8800F), but it still did not work. When I try to launch
 the scanner, I still get the error message saying that the driver for the scanner has not been installed. What to do?

            <p><span>Thanks for your suggestions, Ben. Sorrry for not answering earlier, but trying to solve the problem took so much time that in the end I
 sort of gave up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I have tried both methods, but they did not solve the problem. I also put the question to a Canon forum, and received other suggestions,
 which I all tried, except for the last one (try from another computer), and they did not help either. Here is what the Canon forum suggested:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This is a driver issue and reinstalling windows wouldn't be necessary at this stage. To troubleshoot this issue further, we need more information from you.&nbsp; I would appreciate if you could check the Device status of the scanner in Device manager and
 if and if any installed driver is listed in the Device properties. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the <span>
Start</span> button, clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>
System and Security</span>, and then, under <span>System</span>, clicking
<span>Device Manager</span>.</span>‌ </p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Locate the Scanner and right click on it to select 'properties'.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>In the General tab, check the Device status. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Now, click on the driver tab and check which Driver is installed.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>If it shows no driver details, click on 'Update driver'.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Choose 'Browse my computer for driver software' and choose the location<br />
where the driver software that you downloaded from the<br />
manufacturer's website is saved.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get back to us with the results and also include the device status mentioned for the scanner in the Device manager.

            <p><span>Hi Bennet,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply. It seems the error message is correct: in Device Manager, no Scanner is listed. Each time I tried to install the scanner software, it must have completely failed in the end. My PC has Windows in Dutch, so also
 the Device Manager is in Dutch, but I think you will be able to understand most of it. Here is a screenprint:</span></p>

<p><span>(Since I could not copy pictures in my forum message, I give URLs instead)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I just said to myself, let’s try installing the software again, who knows? So I did the installation from the Canon CD-ROM. I chose Simple Installation, which installs many different programs, such as Presto Page Manager and Scansoft Omnipage,
 as well as Canoscan 8800F (it IS listed in Start-Programs) and MP Navigator, the two main programs. I restarted the computer and checked the Installed prgrams. Here’s a screenprint:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Canoscan and MP Navigator are mentioned, with the date of today, but no Volume or version type are mentioned.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you have any other suggestions?</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Hermes,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It appears that Windows is not recognizing this device. I would suggest you to try connecting the Printer to different USB port to and check if the device gets recognized. If the device is not recognized, then I would suggest you to try
 the following steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, disconnect the device and then uninstall all printer related software that you have installed in the computer. Now, try connecting the printer when there is no printer software installed. Open Device manager, click on ‘Action’ menu
 and select ‘Scan for hardware changes’. Check if the printer is recognized. Sometimes, in the absence of device drivers, the device may be also displayed as “other device’. So look out for anything displayed as “other devices’. Try this with different USB
 ports.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Step 1 was not successful, then I would suggest you to disconnect the device and then install the latest driver and software from the manufacturer’s website and then connect the device and check. You have mentioned that you have installed
 the driver from the cannon disc, which often contain the drivers which were available when the disc was issued. Installing latest driver and software from the cannon website can solve many issues. Here are the links to download and install the latest driver
 and software:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://www.canon.ca/inetCA/serviceDetail?m=load&amp;directLink=Y&amp;mid=2168B003&amp;type=D&amp;opt=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.canon.ca/inetCA/serviceDetail?m=load&amp;directLink=Y&amp;mid=2168B003&amp;type=D&amp;opt=1</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to boot the computer in clean boot state and then try Step 1 and Step 2. Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of
 the issue. You can refer to this article for more information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;Note: After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer to the step How to set the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting under more information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the device is still not recognized, it is possible that it a hardware issue. Connect to a different computer to check if it gets recognized. if it is not recognized in other computers as well, it must be a hardware issue.&nbsp;In this case,
 I would recommend contacting cannon for further support:</span></p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">(April 20: ) &nbsp;It might just be a hardware issue. Even after a clean boot, the driver would not install. Although, is a driver really hardware?
 I must try to find another pc and see if the scanner gets installed there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">(two days later) I managed to find another pc. I installed the Canon software on it from the official cd-rom, then hooked up the Canoscan
 8800F. The scanner worked. I was able to&nbsp; make some long overdue scans. SO the scanner is allright. The conclusion must be that I need to reinstall Windows 7, right? And reinstall all programs. Big hassle, but necessary, I’m afraid. What do you say, we close
 this thread? I thank you for your help!</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your question "<em>Was Windows 8.1 installed in the other computer where the scanner worked?"&nbsp;</em>: it's an old notebook with Windows
 XP (that I don't connect to the internet anymore). The scanner works on it without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried System restore: it proposed only one moment, November 22, 2013, which I chose, but it did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should mention that since a few weeks, my Windows 7 has not been successful in applying 5 or 6 security updates. Every time I shut down or start up, it tries to process the upgrades, but without success.</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are two ways for you to get the BitLocker recovery key. <span>If your PC is connected to a domain</span><span> please contact your administrator to get your recovery key. If you're not connected to a domain, you can use your Microsoft account or a
 saved copy of the recovery key. To know more about it, you may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026181/windows-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate your concern, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to perform a clean install using an ISO file? If not, you may check this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li><li>You mentioned about flash drive. Are you referring to a recovery tool of the laptop? Did the manufacturer give you a recovery tool?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>Hi, I’ve had the same problem and after searching online for replies, I managed to follow a link and retrieve the recovery key no. from https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to&nbsp;login to your microsoft account to get the recovery key no. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>

    <title>Instant ban because of some kid. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irish titan god  say:</h3>
<h2>            Instant ban because of some kid.</h2>
                    <p>Was playing Call of Duty WW2 today, was talking to myself with Mic on, was telling my friend sitting beside me about how stupid it was that the game has female Asian soldiers fighting on the American side in Germany. Get a message from some kid saying "calm down lul" I send a question mark, he says enjoy the ban. And I get a email from the infamous unreachable Microsoft "enforcement team" saying I am not able to use any form of communication for 30 days. His report and the email from whatever horrible automated ban system that is constantly being abused by little trolls were seconds apart. I don't pay for 3 month subs to be banned for no reason by some flawed automated system because I am having a conversation with someone sitting beside me. Can't talk to anyone, cant challenge the reports, This is THE worst customer service I have ever seen. I would say I'm glad I have multiple accounts that I can just switch over to and play on them but I'm actually getting sick of this enforcement te

 </blockquote> <p>nothing I said was against the code of conduct. That's my point. It was a false report by some troll kid that instantly got all my communications taken away. Like I said, we&nbsp;were&nbsp;talking about the game character options and how they ruin the immersion. The Mic is always on, I am talking to team mates. I am frustrated because I am getting punished by an automated system because an angry little kid reports me for the "lulz". The system is broken, I am not able to file for a case review.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Doesn't matter anyway. I have multiple accounts with gold so the mute was pointless and im not asking for it to be lifted, it's up on the 5th of May anyway. I am sharing my experience with the broken and completely flawed report system. the "enforcement team" don't care what reports are legitimate because they don't investigate the reports.</p>

<p>Hello Lousyshot,</p>
<p>On the Dell computer, right click on the setup.exe file for the Turtle Beach Micro II and select, "Run as Administrator".<br />
Does this make a difference? Are you using an Administrator account when trying to install the sound card?"<br />
<br />
Have you checked the event viewer&nbsp;to see if there are any error messages about failing the installation?<br />
<br />
Please reply back with an update and let us know if this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Not valid after motherboard failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahzad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Not valid after motherboard failure</h2>
                    <p>So I have Windows 7 home premium 64 bit edition. I upgraded to Windows 10 everything was perfect and working great. I had a motherboard failure and had to replace the motherboard, now I'm getting an intermittent watermark message in the lower right that
 tells me to activate windows 10, it won't allow me to activate windows 10 b/c it's telling me it's not valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked the answer chat and they want to have remote access to my pc to fix the issue. I'm not comfortable about giving anyone I'm not familiar with access to my pc. I'm pretty knowledge when it comes to pc stuff I build my own, I work IT. Why isn't it
 possible to generate me a new product key w/o having access to my pc?</p>

            i bought my copy of Windows 7,and upgraded from XP. Yeah I'm one of those who really liked XP and held on to it for as long as I could. They tell me that they can give me a new product key to solve the issue but they want access to my pc, but won't explain
 why they can only do it w/ remote access, only that they need to have access. That's what really bugs me if you can fix, you should be able to tell me why you need that access, but giving me vague b/c we do doesn't fill me w/ confidence. I would rather go
 out and buy a new copy of Win 10 pro before I give access to my pc b/c "we just do".

<p>You could see if a store will let you trade it in against a slim. They are €250 for a 250 gig ATM. Its a chunk of change, I know but if you scrape it together you could potentially be up and running before Christmas. Sorry to hear about your strife.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 won&#39;t activate when I put in the product key</h2>
                    <p>My PC was disabled via power surge, and went into an endless loop trying to logon. I restarted the whole thing via reloading from scratch, and now windows 8.1 won't activate. It gives me an error of invalid key, try another. I know I have the correct code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use internet, but cannot use microsoft office, as that gives me an error, can't load. another $149 wasted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need to work on excel. Please anyone help? </p>

</p><p>I spoke to a customer support person three days ago, and he said activation team was not working, and that I had an invalid key,<strong> because my key was for windows 8 and I was installing windows 8.1.</strong></p>
<p>He was very unhelpful. Not happy.</p>
