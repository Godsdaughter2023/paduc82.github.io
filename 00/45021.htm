<h2>            Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller using 100&#37; of cpu</h2>
                    For the last couple months my system has been running at 100% or close to it on all 4 cores of my cpu. After doing some digging, I have found that the high speed usb controller is causing this. When I disable the "Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller"
 in the device manager, the usage drops to normal. The 3 drivers that are listed for this controller are usbehci.sys, usbhub.sys, and usbport.sys. Clicking the update driver button etc just tells me I have the most current driver installed. Is there a way to
 download these files and replace them manually in case they have somehow become corrupt? Are there any fixes for this issue? I am running an Asus M2N32SLI-Deluxe MB. Thank you for any help you can provide.

    <title>Windows 8 File History saving incomplete backup sets - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 File History saving incomplete backup sets</h2>
                    <p>Just started using a new computer with Windows 8 and I'm having trouble setting up a backup set using File History. I'm saving this to a network location (not using a mapped drive letter) that is stable and doesn't suffer from disconnection issues. The problem
 is that when I first set it up and completed the initial backup (which took a number of days thanks to my slow network), I found that large swathes of files had failed to copy and they weren't being picked up when I tried to initiate subsequent copying. To
 give one example, I have a subfolder in Documents called 'projects' and about half of the subfolders in that had copied, stopping at about 'M' as it went through them in reverse alphabetical order.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No warnings or errors had flashed up, but upon going into event viewer, I noted that there were a few warnings and errors listed there, most of them as follows:</p>
<p>"Unusual condition was encountered during finalization of a backup cycle for configuration C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config"</p>
<p>"Unable to scan user libraries for changes and perform backup of modified files for configuration C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config"<br />
</p>
<p>"File was not backed up due to being open by an application: C:\Users\XXXX\Documents\Outlook Files\archive.pst Windows will attempt to back up the file at a later time."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The warning relating to the Outlook archive I can forgive because I do periodically use that file, but the others are worrying. The one about the 'unusual condition' happens whenever the backup is stopped, either manually or through shutting the computer
 down. I should note that the sheer volume of files I'm trying to copy and the speed of my antiquated network means that I'll never be able to save the full backup set in one sitting.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried deleting the backup set and starting again (even deleting the contents of C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\) but I noticed that it abruptly stopped saving files into the backup set while I was sat working at my computer
 without so much as an explanation (I was periodically checking the progress). I manually stopped and started it again and about half an hour later, started saving again, leaving the folder it had tripped up on incomplete. There isn't any cached data appearing
 in C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\ either. If I was to leave it to continue, I would be willing to bet that the folder in question would remain incomplete.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a really insidious problem because it results in a situation where File History claims to be working but isn't, leaving files without backed up versions saved. If I can't get this problem conclusively solved soon, I will need to move to a different
 backup system because there is a major integrity issue here. I can imagine one suggestion would be to make sure it is not interrupted during the creation of the initial backup set, but if it is sufficiently fragile to require that, I'm a bit dubious about
 relying on it to keep my files backed up in the background. Doing some searching, I can find references to similar problems that people reported around October last year, but I'd kind of hoped that Microsoft would have fixed these by now.<br />

            I'd already seen that first link and it doesn't relate to my problem or contain any definitive fixes. Those second two links effectively cover what I've already tried and don't contain any fault-finding. Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Unless I can be sure that this thing works, I'm loathed to rely on it as a backup solution. At this rate, I'm going to end up resorting to the low-tech version that is xcopy.<br />

            Thanks for getting back to me. Unfortunately, that particular error message does not seem to be appearing with any consistent pattern, so method 1 is a no-goer (the only error message with consistent behaviour is the 'unusual condition' one, which occurs
 whenever it is stopped for whatever reason). I have also found that if I delete the backup and start afresh, I can get an incomplete set being saved without that error, so it is possibly a red herring as regards this problem. As for method 2, I tried that
 but it didn't come up with anything.<br />
<br />
Something else I've discovered through repeated attempts to get it working (by deleting the backup set and starting again) is that it is the same subfolders that are consistently missed off each time, however there is nothing remarkable about the ones that
 are being missed.<br />

            As it happens, I had my music folder excluded anyway, so it can't be that. I also don't have any music files in the folders that aren't being saved either.<br />
<br />
The 'unusual condition' error I get whenever it is stopped for whatever reason (e.g. computer shut down or the initial save is manually interrupted). However if I check the files in the remote location as they are being saved, I begin to notice missing subfolders
 even if it isn't interrupted and under that sequence, I get no errors, so I suspect that that might not have anything to do with it either.<br />

            I tried checking the drive for errors, found nothing.<br />
<br />
As for optimising and cleaning up, I'm going to try these but even if it starts apparently working afterwards, I would need to be convinced that the problem is well and truly nailed and I don't have the time nor the inclination to go checking all of many many
 hundreds of GBs of files manually to make sure that they have all been backed up. I would also need convincing that the problem isn't going to reappear in the future.<br />
<br />
In short, I need something I can rely on and unless I can identify the specific problem and verify that it is fixed, I cannot use this as my backup solution.<br />

<h2>            Child account no longer showing active</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My child's account is hooked up to Microsoft Family Safety. We were just realizing his computer is not timing out anymore like it is supposed to so I checked the Family Safety site. The site says that he has not been on his computer for 5 days, which is
 untrue. So something isn't right. Certainly our son is not above doing something unscrupulous. Question is, how do we tell what he has done and prevent it in the future. We are trying to decide if he might have somehow figured out our password. We don't think
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we tell what has been going on with his computer (i.e. for all accounts)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>I had the same problem, and I think I figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime over the past week, Windows 10 stopped enforcing the daily usage&nbsp;limit for&nbsp;my 9 y/o. I took a look at the Windows Family Safety settings and saw that while the&nbsp;all settings (time and browsing restrictions, etc.) seemed to be correct,&nbsp;her&nbsp;"recent
 activity" page&nbsp;was empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After poking around, I&nbsp;began to suspect that this&nbsp;was&nbsp;a Microsoft account problem rather that an issue with Family Safety.&nbsp;For one, the avatar for her account&nbsp;was missing from&nbsp;the computer's sign-up screen. And when&nbsp;I signed in to&nbsp;her account&nbsp;went&nbsp;to the
 "accounts" page, it seemed to&nbsp;think that she was signed in with a Microsoft account, but the "manage my Microsoft" link was missing&nbsp;and the "sync your settings" page was grayed out because it claimed that she was
<em>not</em> signed in with a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried this: First, while still signed in as my daughter, I went to settings/accounts and clicked "sign in with a local account instead" to&nbsp;convert her account to a local account. (It gave me an error at one&nbsp;point during the process, but I shrugged and
 forged ahead.) Then I signed out, signed back in (as my daughter), and went through the process of converting her account back into a Microsoft account,&nbsp;verify it again, etc., just like I did when I originally added her as a user on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the process was done,&nbsp;the Windows Family Safety icon reappeared on the taskbar , her time limit was working, and the missing Microsoft account settings became available. This low-impact method also kept&nbsp;all of her settings, documents, and apps in place.
 Hope this helps!...</p>

<p>Hello. My xBox 360 failed to recognize the hard drive several days ago, so I had to format the hard drive. That's not a big deal, but I've lost Hexic HD (it was preinstalled on my console). I was trying to download it from the marketplace, however I could
 not: for some reason the offer is unavailable in my region (Russia). Is it possible to get Hexic HD back on my console?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 apps not working, link to incorrect drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armandbernard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 apps not working, link to incorrect drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Recently, I added a second (non-microsoft) account to my Windows 10 machine and all apps downloaded from the windows store, including the store, have blank icons and won't open.<br />
I dragged a shortcut of the apps to the desktop to check the filepath and, as I expected, all windows 10 apps now link to my D drive instead of the C drive, where they were originally installed (I have two internal hard drives).</p>
<p>Note this does not apply to regular programs installed externally.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is though, that the second account has no broken links, they all link to the correct drive!</p>
<p>I checked the default install location for regular programs, in regedit, and that is correct, but I have no idea where the one for Windows 10 apps is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched around on the internet and few people have my exact problem, all of their fixes have not worked for me, including:</p>
<p>services.msc related fixes</p>
<p>dism --&gt; restore health fixes</p>
<p>Get-AppXPackage related fixes</p>
<p>Windows App Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to stop the windows apps looking in the wrong directory, I would greatly appreciate it. I'd like to avoid losing all my files in a fresh install as well if possible.</p>

            <p>For anybody who comes along to see this with the same issue, I tried pretty much every solution i could find on the internet, but none of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option is to do a repair install of Windows using the media creation tool.</p>
<p>This will make you lose all your programs and settings but keep your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be careful to avoid doing any changes to the registry as it will cause you huge problems. Some of which cannot be fixed with anything other than a full factory reset, if you can even achieve that at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully no one else will ever have to read this, but if you do, I hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Surface Book audio output to display&#39;s built-in speakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornmuse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book audio output to display&#39;s built-in speakers</h2>
                    <p>I've got a minor issue that I haven't been able to troubleshoot or track down.&nbsp; Maybe the community can help.&nbsp; I've got a ASUS VS278 monitor connected via DisplayPort to a Surface Book docking station.&nbsp; The monitor has built-in speakers and I need to use
 those speakers for audio playback - I don't have the option of desktop speakers or a separate audio system at this time (in the middle of a relocation).&nbsp; The SB rarely recognizes the built-in audio.&nbsp; I have to disconnect and reconnect the DP connection or
 docking cable and, once in a while, the system will cooperate.&nbsp; The VS278 typically doesn't appear as a playback device.&nbsp; When it does show up in the playback list, I've selected the VS278 as the default audio. Everything else seems to be working just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is identical whether I connect directly to the DP port on the SB or if I use the docking station, thus ruling out the dock as the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, if the SB is connected and recognizes the VS2778 it may (or may not) drop it from the playback device list rather randomly.&nbsp; Sometimes I can go overnight and its still working, other times it will drop off after an hour or two of inactivity.&nbsp; Playback
 doesn't seem to correlate to a restart or refresh in any way I can discern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas and suggestions?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p><strong><em>The VS278 typically doesn't appear as a playback device.&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the state of the video port then?&nbsp; E.g. this seems to be normal if the video port is not in use.&nbsp; Try using Project, Second Screen Only to ensure that is the case; e.g. press Win-P, End, Enter.&nbsp; You will then have to respond to a Keep this? prompt
 which may not appear reliably quickly enough to click on.&nbsp; Pressing Tab, Enter works even if you can't see it but then you may want to have Narrator running (Win+Ctrl+Enter) for its clues but not if the video device's audio port is the default audio device
 (since you won't be able to hear Narrator), so plug in a headset and hope that it becomes the default audio device that way.&nbsp; I have not yet found a way to make Narrator switch to the default communications device and I have not yet found a keyboard method
 of making the switch to an alternate audio device while I can't see what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, instead of using hardware workarounds (which may cause unnecessary wear on your connectors) try to find some software methods which cause devices to be reset.&nbsp; For example, Win+Ctrl+Shift+B is one, and removing the device from the Bluetooth and other
 devices list is another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, if you want to test the audio make sure that the Sound dialog (for Playback devices, right-click Test) comes up over that screen; otherwise you may only see the Test's sound level animation but not hear it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the main quirks that I have noticed so far with W10 FCU and my HDMI.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10.&nbsp; Still an <em>Adventure</em> ("Twisty passages, all different.")</p>

<p>Build 16299.214</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes precipitated this, I've been fighting it for at least three months since I relocated and started using my on-board audio from my monitor. There are at least a dozen instances of similar behavior documented on the MS community using slightly different
 descriptions - typically "my TV sound doesn't play with HDMI" or some such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting - pretty much everything I could think of and I have 30 years experience in AV design.&nbsp; So lets start with its
<strong>not</strong> the cable - I've tried DP to DP, DP to HDMI via DP Dual Mode operation, DP to HDMI via active lane conversion, through the docking station and directly from the DP port to the monitor.&nbsp; The problem is manifest whether I'm using DP or HDMI
 (which makes sense - they share a considerable portion of the audio signal path). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio output is stable using the analog line output and I can use a USB Codec (my usual set-up) without issue.&nbsp; The only thing I haven't tried is using an DP-HDMI link into an audio de-embedder.&nbsp; Audio follows video via the HANC in the AV output, so maybe
 this will shed some light.&nbsp; I might gin that up this week just to keep studying the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, my Surface Book died about 3 weeks ago and I opted for advance replacement under the&nbsp; MS warranty (great service!).&nbsp; Problem was manifest with the old Surface Book and with this one.&nbsp; So we can probably rule out the device itself.&nbsp; Build should
 have been the same as both units are (were) up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for fun I just popped in my older Surface Pro running though its docking station.&nbsp; It correctly identified the audio playback as being the VS278, but I didn't leave it in long enough to see if this was stable.&nbsp; Remember, this is a frequent, but still
 intermittent, issue.&nbsp; I can't really keep that connected as this system is set up for work.&nbsp; Once I have the rest of my office moved it I'll re-configure this with audio via a dedicated AV playback system using a USB connection - that's been faultless for
 nearly 18 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible its the monitor?&nbsp; Yes, of course.&nbsp; I don't have two monitors.&nbsp; Can't address that issue, but I really don't think that's where the problem is.&nbsp; Maybe you can help explain how the Surface Book polls for valid audio pathways?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, of greater concern is the number of posts I see in this forum regarding missing sound using any number of "TVs", monitors and displays. That tells me there's something going on outside of just my set-up.</p>

<p>Video is consistently operative without issue.&nbsp; Let me reiterate. the system operates as it should, but on frequent intermittent occasions it fails to recognize the VS278 as an&nbsp;<em>audio</em> playback device.&nbsp; This tells me there's some miscommunication
 between the audio de-embedder in the monitor and the Surface Book itself.&nbsp; The audio is embedded into the horizontal ancilliary channel of the AV data stream. This wouldn't be effected by EDID, either, as that simply negotiates video.&nbsp; Video performance is
 faultless.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case you were thinking that I'm trying to play back audio without video - no.&nbsp; I just need to play back audio embedded in various web content (think webinars or streaming videos).&nbsp; It's actually working well today.&nbsp; I got it to recognize the VS278
 yesterday and it's remained connected since - even with an unplug-replug cycle.&nbsp; I'm willing to bet that within the next 24 hours it will "forget" this option again, though.</p>

<p>Perfect timing.&nbsp; I had a software update pending, did a restart and - without making a single change other than the restart - the SB lost the connection to the VS278! This after it had been connected and reliable for nearly 20 hours including a sleep cycle
 and an unplug-replug cycle!</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you see, the VS278 is just not there.&nbsp; Now I can unplug the docking cable and reconnect and it may or may not add the VS278 again. Might do it on the first try, might not do it until the 5th.&nbsp; I can play back sound via the Realtek (built-in) speakers
 no problem.&nbsp; But that's not the point -the issue is that this system is not stable.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit.&nbsp;It
 looks like the following:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.
</li></ul>

            My Surface Pro is completely draining after about 6 hours in sleep mode since upgrading to Windows 10. It also feels warm to the touch during sleep time, which means something is running that should not be running. Did not have this problem with Windows
 8.1.

            Yes, I too didn't have such issues with either Win 7 or Win 8. The problem is with Win 10. Microsoft should provide some solution for this asap.

            Apparently on my surface some things had gotten set to wake up the computer and even though I thought I had gone through and turned them all off some were hidden or missed. Now my surface only eats up 2-3% per hour in sleep mode... still more than with
 windows 8.1, but at least it is tolerable now.

            <p>Go into device manager (easiest way to do this is type device manager into the search box). Then right click each device and click properties. Go to the power management tab (if the device has one) and make sure that the box that says allow this device to
 wake the computer is UNCHECKED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: not all devices will have a power management tab; the ones that do not have the tab do not wake your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will at least keep devices from waking your computer during sleep mode. There may be other power drains, but this helped me a lot!</p>

            It didn't work for me. In Devises power management tab, allow this device to wake the computer was already UNCHECKED. But I check all devices to make sure. My battery is still draining.

<p>Can anybody please explain, or even understand, the current state of all this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean… I consider myself pretty advanced when dealing with technology. I've been wreaking online systems since before FidoNET and made my way through BBS, text browsing, ICQ, and so on. I like Microsoft,
 in fact I'm a supporter and I work all day using Microsoft products. But… These days with my main computer running Windows 8 + phone running Windows Phone 7.5 + Outlook.com + Skype…
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Messenger is gone. Ok. But then wtf is the messaging app in W8?
</span></li><li><span>Skype for W8 is not fully integrated (to say the least).
</span></li><li><span>We can't even "share" nothing from the charms bar in W8.</span>
</li><li><span>Skype for Desktop I'm not sure any more which contacts I have (FB, Live, Outlook, Skype…)</span>
</li><li><span>I don't know how to add a contact. I mean… I'm not sure WHERE to add a contact. Because if I add to Skype then I won't see it on my phone.
 And if I add it to Messenger then I won't be able to chat. Or yes. Maybe. …</span>
</li><li><span>The "People" hub in W8 still refers to "Live" contacts, among "Skype", "Messenger", "LinkedIn", "Facebook"… But it will only let me add "Live"
 contacts. Whatever that is.</span> </li><li><span>The "People" hub in WP8 will see my Skype contacts as duplicated.</span>
</li><li><span>Outlook 2013 will do something in between.</span>
</li><li><span>Messaging inside Outlook 2013 will sometimes identify the Skype contact, sometimes not.</span>
</li><li><span>Outlook.com will… I'm not even sure what it does.</span>
</li><li><span>Between Outlook 2013, Outlook.com, WP8 and W8 sometimes contacts gets duplicated, sometimes contact data is lost.</span>
</li><li><span>Some people I used to have in Messenger will see me online on the phone, others on Skype, others in the damn W8 Messaging app. Others won't
 see me online at all or I won't see them!!!</span> </li><li><span>As a bonus, I have lost tracking on how many different places the Microsoft account is linked and where the data is stored. If I wanted to
 change my phone number, it would prove impossible.</span> </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is: </p>
<ol>
<li><span>HOW do you manage contacts in a CLEAN and WORKING way?</span>
</li><li><span>HOW do you MESSAGE contacts in a UNIFIED and CROSS PLATFORM way? (inside of Windows environment, of course)</span>
</li><li><span>Simplify things guys, because the contacts, people hub or whichever you want to call it is a royal mess!</span></li></ol>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PD: As it was on purpose... The valid forum for this post could be: Outlook.com, Hotmail, Messenger, Microsoft Account, Mail, Windows 8 Email
 and Communications, Office Outlook, Windows Phone People Hub, Texting and Online Messaging... !!!</span></p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
I would like to jump on the band-waggon here to actually also ask the obvious question.<br />
<br />
The way I understand all of this is, that the general idea or goal of the "People Hub" is to have one place where you put all your contacts with all there informations (Name, Telephone, Skype, MSN and so on) and then you just can use them in all the different
 applications (Mail, Skype, MSN etc.).<br />
<br />
That would be a very useful clean system to handle contact information.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the current state of all this is weird. In my case I got a Windows Phone that hat some contacts, that are now lets say "Outlook contacts" on the People site of my Microsoft Account, and then I was able to integrate facebook contacts and link them
 with the contacts that I already have, which is also fine.<br />
<br />
Then I tryed to integrate my Skype Contact List with those ones, but after linking my Skype and Microsoft account, nothing happened. They are not linked. I do not see my contacts from my "People" site and on that site I see the Skype contacts, but I cannot
 merge/link them with the original ones.<br />
<br />
So at the moment all this seems to be a little bit not working as intended.<br />
<br />
For me it would be also ok, if this all is still under development due to buying and adapted software like Skype to the new format, but it would be nice to just get informations about this and not some random help topics.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />
Marcel<br />

    <title>Loose source routed IP frame checksum wrong recalculation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew solozobov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loose source routed IP frame checksum wrong recalculation</h2>
                    I'm a student and while doing my course work experiments I found out this problem:<br />
<br />
Problem of wrong IP header checksum recalculation appears when Windows retransmits IP frames with loose source route option of different length (tested for ICMP and UDP payload).<br />
<br />
Example of standard Windows ping ICMP request processing:<br />
<br />
Three hosts:<br />
&nbsp; 10.0.1.1 - Windows 7 Enterprase SP1 32-bit v6.1 Build 7601<br />
&nbsp; 10.0.1.2 - Windows 7 Enterprase SP1 32-bit v6.1 Build 7601<br />
&nbsp; 10.0.1.3 - Ubuntu 12.10 quantal Linux 3.5.0-17-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 9 19:32:08 UTC 2012 i686<br />
<br />
10.0.1.1 and 10.0.1.2 connected by Ethernet cable<br />
10.0.1.2 and 10.0.1.3 connected by WiFi ad hoc connection<br />
10.0.1.2 has network bridge between wireless network connection and local area connection<br />
10.0.1.2 has Routing and Remote Access service running and in windows register folder HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/services/Tcpip/Parameters keys are set: IPEnableRouter = 1 and DisableIPSourceRouting = 0.<br />
<br />
Ping 10.0.1.3 from 10.0.1.1 through 10.0.1.2 using loose source route IP option<br />
&gt;ping -j 10.0.1.2 10.0.1.3<br />

<h2>            Laptop Problem - Acer Extensa 5235 &#40;Home Access laptop from Comet&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
First of all, apologies for the extended essay but I wanted to ensure I provide you with all the details of the my problem in order to receive the correct help.<br />
<br />
My sister was on the laptop and I foolishly started&nbsp;moving my hand over the keyboard and tapping a bunch of keys, I don't remember which ones. (I basically manhandled it, but it has never been dropped). The laptop then froze, and so did the mouse and touch
 pad. She had to turn it off and tried to turn it on again, but it's not working. It is an Acer Extensa 5235 (a Home Access one from Comet). When I turn it on, it shows the Acer page, then the screen goes black for about 10-20 minutes. It then goes to a light
 blue screen (the login page) with the cursor showing (both the touchpad and mouse work as I can see the arrow move) and stays like that for 1-2 hours (sometimes longer), it then goes to Startup Repair. Below that, the text was:-<br />
<br />
"If problems are found, Startup Repair will fix them automatically. Your computer might restart several times during this process.<br />
<br />
No changes will be made to your personal files or information. This might take several minutes."<br />
<br />
Below that was a blue loading bar with the text "Searching for problems...".,<br />
<br />
and whilst this was happening, after around 30 minutes, a black box appears in the left corner of the screen with "X:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" at the top with nothing in the box, I exited this and it then says "Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically".
 It has the options of send information or don't send, and also a link to view diagnostics, I clicked this and at the bottom it said:-<br />
<br />
Problem Signature<br />
<br />
Problem Event Name: Startup Repair Offline<br />
<br />
Problem Signature 01 0.0.0.0<br />
Problem Signature 02 0.0.0.0<br />
Problem Signature 03 unknown<br />
Problem Signature 04 0<br />
Problem Signature 05 unknown<br />
Problem Signature 06 1<br />
Problem Signature 07 unknown<br />
<br />
OS Version 6.1.76002.0.0.0.256.1<br />
<br />
Locale ID 1033<br />
<br />
Read our privacy statement.<br />
<br />
(I didn't write down what it said right after "read our privacy statement, so I can't remember if there was any other information there).<br />
<br />
It also said:-<br />
<br />
"Root cause found. Boot sector for system partition is corrupt.<br />
<br />
Repair action: Boot sector repair.<br />
<br />
Result: Failed. Error code = 0x45d<br />
<br />
I clicked "don't send", once again went through various boxes and finally got to the System Recovery Options box, which showed the operating system as "Windows 7 on (D:) Local Disk", and had the following options:-<br />
<br />
- Startup Repair<br />
- System Restore<br />
- System Image Recovery<br />
- Windows Memory Diagnostic<br />
- Command Prompt<br />
- Recovery Management<br />
<br />
After clicking on system restore and other system recovery options, it appeared as though nothing was happening although the little blue search circle had appeared and then disappeared.<br />
<br />
However, after 1-2 hours, a box popped up saying "starting system restore. Please wait while System Restore starts. It might take up to a few minutes." with the search bar going across.<br />
<br />
After it says, "Restore system files and settings" as the heading and a big red circle with an X in it appears on the side of the box and says "No restore points have been created on your computer's system drive. To create a restore point open System Protection.
 System Restore can help fix problems that might be making your computer run slowly or stop responding. System Restore does not affect any of your documents, pictures, or other personal data. How does system Restore work?"<br />
<br />
However, when I click on "System Protection" a box pops up saying "Your computer is running in a limited diagnostic state. If you use System Restore in this limited state, you cannot undo the restore operation" I clicked OK and it went but I can't do anything
 further than this.<br />
<br />
I didn't create any system restore points, so clearly I cannot use this option and because the laptop is running very very very slow (It takes around 4 hours or more to get to the system restore section) I can't even try to create any system restore points
 at this point.<br />
<br />
The only option available when it goes back to the System Restore box is cancel so that's what I click, then it goes back to System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />
I can also click on Command Prompt and a black box with the heading "Administrator:X:\windows\system32\cmd.exe" with some white text in it, but I can't remember what it said and since I don't know what to write since I am not good with these types of things
 with laptops, I exit it.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can do is either click shutdown or restart. I clicked restart and it goes to a black screen saying:-<br />
<br />
Windows Error Recovery<br />
<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.<br />
<br />
If Windows files have been damaged or configured incorrectly, Startup Repair can help diagnose and fix the problem. If power was interrupted during startup, choose Start Windows Normally.<br />
(Use the arrow keys to highlight your choice.)<br />
<br />
Launch Startup Repair (recommended)<br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
- If I click on Launch Startup Repair, the whole process starts over again.<br />
<br />
A person I spoke to over the phone said I may have corrupted the Windows 7 software by tapping the various keys thus causing the laptop to freeze and not work properly and this is clearly what happened in my opinion since it did say "Root cause found. Boot
 sector for system partition is corrupt. Repair action: Boot sector repair. Result: Failed. Error code = 0x45d" when I viewed diagnostics.<br />
<br />
Also, I have emailed various laptop repair companies. One of them emailed me back saying:-<br />
<br />
"From what you have said you have indeed got corruption on the boot sector of the hard drive. These are the files Windows uses to start. This can happen because of a virus, hardware failure or other factors. Without seeing the laptop its impossible to say what
 has caused the fault."<br />
<br />
I don't have any installation CDs because the Windows 7 software came pre-installed on the laptop and I didn't create any recovery discs.<br />
<br />
I read a post about How To Write a New Partition Boot Sector To a Windows 7/Vista System Partition -
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/new-partition-boot-sector-windows.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/new-partition-boot-sector-windows.htm</span></a></span></p>
<span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/new-partition-boot-sector-windows.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>I followed the steps in the above link, when I got to the Command Prompt but it didn't fix the laptop. When I restarted the laptop, it went back to starting up as explained above.</span></p>
<p><span>I did speak to someone who said that it does seem that the nub of my problem is a damaged master boot record.</span></p>
<p><span>I then tried this http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm. When I got to step 6 in this link, I typed in the code twice as I thought I had gotten it wrong the first time I typed it in. When I got to step 8 of this
 link, it should have said:-&nbsp;</span></p>
Scanning all disks for Windows installations. Please wait, since this may take a while... Successfully scanned Windows installations. Total identified Windows installations: 1 [1] D:\Windows Add installation to boot list? Yes&lt;Y&gt;/No&lt;N&gt;/All&lt;A&gt;:
<p><span>But instead it said:-</span></p>
Scanning all disks for Windows installations. Please wait, since this may take a while... Successfully scanned Windows installations. Total identified Windows installations: 0
<p><span>Now when I turn the laptop on, it goes straight to the Now when I turn the Acer laptop on, it goes straight to the Windows Boot Manager and has the following information:-<br />
<br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
<br />
1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
<br />
2. Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."<br />
<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer."<br />
<br />
If you do not have this disc, contact your administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance.<br />
<br />
File: BootBCD<br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000f<br />
<br />
Info: an error occurred while attempting to read the boot configuration data.<br />
<br />
It only has the options of ENTER=Continue.<br />
<br />
And ESC=Exit.<br />
<br />
I can't even get into the System Recovery options by pressing F8. It goes straight to the Windows Boot Manager.<br />
<br />
Also, on the laptop, there's a symbol which lights up green to indicate that the HDD is active and was lit up when I had the managed to get the laptop to the System Recovery options (as discussed in my original post).<br />
<br />
Now, when I initially turn the laptop on, it flashes quickly, and then stops (indicating that the HDD is inactive obviously) when it goes to the Windows Boot Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>I have no recovery disks, or Windows 7 Installation CDs. I want to take it to a laptop repair shop for them to do a free diganostics test. However, to save time, what do you think the problem could be. I think I made the laptop worse by following the
 information in the links because I tried to change the BCD. It clearly seems as though I did especially because it says:-</span></p>
<p><span>File: BootBCD<br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000f<br />
<br />
Info: an error occurred while attempting to read the boot configuration data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Am I better off getting a new HDD and Windows 7 installation CD, and if I do this, would the laptop be fixed and go back to full working order?<br />
</span></p>

            <p>Have you named the logical name for your wireless network (SSID) the same for 2.4 GHz as 5 GHz? For example, the SSID for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz are the same.<br /><br />Do you connect your console using active or passive scanning?&nbsp;Meaning, do you manually type in&nbsp;all the credentials for your wireless network, such as the SSID and (of course) the password, or do you have your console to&nbsp;actively search for wireless network(s)?<br /><br />What is even&nbsp;more disturbing is to why your router loose its connectivity to the Internet.

            <p>I have the names for both different. Is that a problem?</p><p>When the xbox disconnects, it shows a list of networks in range, so does that mean active? We only have to type in the password.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I have no idea why I keep losing internet. It happens for a few seconds at a time. It is not a problem with any other device as it reconnects automatically. With the xbox, any app will stop and require us to select the network and reenter the password. We started losing internet intermittently after we canceled cable. We then upgraded internet speeds, and needed to get a new modem/router and it still is happening.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Kim</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

            <p>You have to excuse me, but the widely range of&nbsp;Technicolor gateways has always been notorious when connecting an Xbox console through one of their&nbsp;gateways, where wireless is more&nbsp;susceptible.&nbsp;<br /><br />Does it make any different if you connect to 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band? Or did you setup the same password for both 2.4 resp. 5 GHz?<br /><br />If you have a good signal strength over 5 GHz, from where you have your console positioned, try connect to this band.&nbsp;But before you do this, change the password/passphrase to something that you can easily remember, consisting of 8 characters (approximately).</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Adapter Issues with Windows 10 Bluetooth Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard_james999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Adapter Issues with Windows 10 Bluetooth Driver</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">So I recently bought a CSR8510 A10 Bluetooth dongle for my Windows 10 PC. It isn't able to recognize my Xbox One S controller however. A quick look at the Device Manager revealed that I only had the default
 generic Bluetooth driver installed. I figured I had to install the manufacturer's driver instead. So I followed my bright idea of installing the CSR Harmony driver, which I have only just learned that it is already obsolete. Right after the installation it
 overwrites all of my existing BT drivers and rendered my dongle unusable as it won't recognize any Bluetooth device that I have anymore.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">Without further ado I uninstalled the Harmony driver. On Device Manager I removed my dongle and scanned for hardware changes. Like other similar posts, the Device Manager recognized my dongle as an unknown
 device called CSR_BTPORT_01. I tried reinstalling the "Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Service" for it, which was automatically installed when I plugged my Bluetooth dongle the first time. Apparently Windows said my device is now working properly, but the Bluetooth
 function is still inaccessible to me. I have also tried the "Generic Bluetooth Adapter" but the dongle won't even accept the driver.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">Quick Google searching reveals uninstalling the driver on Device Manger will prompt a Windows Update to reinstall the missing driver. No updates were found after repeated checks however. I have also considered
 data recovery but I believe I don't have any recovery points set up prior to doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that my default Bluetooth driver is corrupted? I couldn't even open the Bluetooth settings on the Control Panel now. Is there any way to roll back to the factory version to make my dongle working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated.<br />
