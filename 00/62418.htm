<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Windows Update stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I noticed I had not seen my Windows 7 Ultimate x64 updating in quite some time already. I opened my Windows Update applet and it showed a shield with a red cross indicating it was disabled or non-operational.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then pressed the "Check for Updates" button and got a dialog:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running.You may need to restart your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I use the Manage applet to check for services it says that Windows Update service is STARTED. So why is it not working? I see that the last updates were applied on November 15th, 2017 !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I am still using Windows 7 because when I applied the free Windows 10 upgrade it screwed my whole system, I had to spend more than a week restoring my system from scratch and reconfiguring my whole development &amp; gaming setup. By the time I had an operational
 system, the Windows 10 free upgrade was over and I had lost&nbsp;work time on my projects</em>.</p>

<h2>            Hacking discussion and questions</h2>
                    Recently I have been doing some research on how to hack wireless networks and computers and I began to&nbsp;realize&nbsp;that most of the results I found especially&nbsp;&nbsp;when I researched on hacking wireless networks the results talked about ways to do it using Linux.
 My boss at work who did an ethical hacking course and also my teacher who hacks into systems ( legally) uses an Linux OS called Backtrack, I am beginning to think that all&nbsp;skillful&nbsp;hackers choose and train in using Linux to hack rather than Windows. I am deeply
 disappointed though, bit bias towards Linux to be honest. My question to you is weather or not it is true that all hackers you know or heard of use Linux and if it is even possible to use Microsoft to hack as I am&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;a bit of a die hard Windows&nbsp;fan.
 If it is&nbsp;possible,what &nbsp;hacking software would you recommended I use with Windows, as I am a bit worried with the amount of malware out there some skillful hacker might actu

            Hackers can and do, use any OS.&nbsp; Just as law enforcement officers do.&nbsp; We cant advise you on anything "hacking" related.<br />
<br />
Your best defense is to have good malware, firewall, and not click on things you dont know.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some corruptions in Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the link given below and check.</p>
<p><strong>Run the Windows update troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://Windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <strong>reset Windows updates components</strong> and check if that helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality

    <title>Windows 7 - Carbon Black Sensor Creating 10s of thousands of files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martavisgriffin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - Carbon Black Sensor Creating 10s of thousands of files using up all my CPU</h2>
                    <p>So I've been having a problem with a slow computer for a while now . Spent days trying to figure it out. And finally found the source of the problem. But can't figure out how to stop it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The path of the problem is</p>
<p>C:/Windows/CarbonBlack/store</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty much there are 10s of thousands of files being created creating gigibytes of data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Theres a text file and a data file created in each folder. The txt file simply has text like</p>
<p>"\Device\HarddiskVolume1\Windows\System32\NaturalLanguage6.dll"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is the issue because in safe mode I deleted over 2gb of these files and started my computer normal and it was faster than ever. But immediately there were 10s of thousands of files created and the computer started slowing down within a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing I can figure out to delete CarbonBlack, it requires administrative permissions and I can't even locate it in the regedit to do a forced uninstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a symantec endpoint anti-virus that says it has been quarantining a "Webcoinminer" malware, but says it has been fixed. I downloaded malwarebytes and malwarebytes finds absolutely nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on what I can do to stop this? Thanks</p>

</p><p>Hi, thanks for the reply. When I try to uninstall it from the uninstall.exe I get "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to do it from the 'Programs and Features' I get "The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed. This can occur if the Windows Installer is not currently installed. Contact your support personnel for assistance."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleaned the folder out again and tried this morning. Computer loads in like 15 seconds, it's amazing. But within 10 seconds there was already 2,000 files created and I just restarted the computer and booted in safe mode. Think there is some hidden malware
 or something? When I run a disk scan every thing checks out, all the drivers respond with saying they're up to date, malwarebytes doesn't find anything. Only thing that finds something is Symantec Endpoint but it says it's quarantined.</p>

<h2>            Unknown USB Device &#40;Link In Compliance Mode&#41;</h2>
                    I'm getting a UBS port error, over and over again, the sound of which drives me crazy. Device manager says "Unknown USB Device (Link In Compliance Mode)". There is nothing plugged into the USB port. Uninstall/reinstall doesn't work, deactivating it doesn't
 work, restarting doesn't work. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
I read through several other Q&amp;A about this on the forums did not contain the solution.&nbsp;

            In addition update the Chipset and any USB drivers from the PC or motherboard model's Support Downloads webpage,  
<br />
<br />If no newer you can open Device Manager, expand Universal Serial Bus devices, find the Enhanced Controllers, click on each, choose Driver tab and then Uninstall, restart PC.  
<br />
<br />If you use USB mouse or keyboard, first program the power button to Shut Down PC to effect the Restart Right click Start button to open Power Options, then Additional Power Options, then Choose what Power buttons do.  
<br />
<br />If that fails go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            May be a hardware issue.  Is the PC still within a year of purchase so you have included parts and service warranty?  
<br />
<br />Is this the factory or Upgrade install which most enthusiasts wouldn't even run because they'd expect endless issues?  If so I'd consider doing a Clean Install following this guide which  compiles the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>No, it's a 2 year of Lenovo Thinkpad. Factory install and whatever Windows updates have run since then. Windows 10 Home, Version 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. I'm going see what other solutions people have or I can find, then do a clean install if nothing else works.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Firewire &#40;1394a&#41; Drivers That Actually Work in Windows 7 64bit with Sony DSR-11</h2>
                    Serious problem finding FireWire drivers that will work in Windows 7 64bit for my Sony DSR-11 DV Rec/Play deck.&nbsp;
<br />
No timecode.&nbsp; No machine control.&nbsp; No audio and no video.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
System: Intel i7 960. 24gigs 3-channel ram running Win 7 64bit Advanced.&nbsp; Fresh install on new hardware and hard drive.&nbsp; System built around CS5.5.&nbsp; Premiere has listing for the Sony DSR-11 but is unable to talk to my deck. For the record, there are no errors
 posted in Admin startup logs for either Win 7 or CS5.5. <br />
<br />
Software:&nbsp; All three Firewire drivers resident in Win 7 have been tried.&nbsp; Repeatedly. OHCI, Legacy and Texas Instruments versions. Computer rebooted prior to every attempt to get a connection. With power to the DSR-11 both On and Off prior to each attempt.&nbsp;
 I have the latest drivers for the motherboard installed.&nbsp; I have all the updates available for Win 7 installed. I have the latest drivers and updates for CS5.5 installed.<br />
<br />
About the DSR-11. Deck works perfectly in my old XP Pro 32bit system connected via standard 4 pin firewire jack resident on my AMD Athlon MB with 8gigs of dual channel ram.&nbsp; I am using official Sony 4 pin cables (I have two-both work fine)<br />
<br />
Regardless of the drive installed on the Win 7 system, I get a tone acknowledging my DSR-11 being powered up and powered off but nothing else.&nbsp; The DSR-11 shows up under "Devices and Printers" only as a "AV/C Tape Recorder/Player" and does not show up as "Connected"
 in CS5.5 at all.&nbsp; Only as "Device is Offline"&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I've read that I am not alone regarding issues with Win 7 and Firewire.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; I really need this deck to work on the new editor. Thanks in advance for your help. &nbsp;&nbsp;

What a COP OUT ANSWER! I'm a tech and can't get the stupid thing to work on my camcorder with Windows 7 Pro either. I built my system and so did other people out there who cannot find the exact bits of code to make the thing work. It works fine in XP Pro and
 other tape based Sony camcorders work fine in Windows 7 64 bit so I want to use mine too. This was a $600 camera and I want to use it. I even bought the stupid firewire card with Windows 7 on the box and not one single video editing software knows it's even
 there. Yes I troubleshoot as a tech every scenario and read every complaint of so many people who are having the same problems with firewire and camcorders on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I have been a tech and used Microsoft products since DOS 5.0. I want ANSWERS not another stupid thing to buy!!!!! Now I hear Microgreed is putting out Windows 8 this year to take over your life in doing everything on the computer for you. Well I want my camcorder
 to work and to use it. I should not have to go through all these hours of frustration. Microgreed has made plenty enough money from everyone all over the world forcing people to upgrade to x hardware to run their new x OS blah blah blah....to support all the
 other tape based camcorders, whereby tapes are still sold for them, and they work just fine for many videos that are online right now. It is way past time for Microgreed to give back to us who have made them who they are today and paid their greedy salaries,
 their mortgages off, vacations, etc by now.<br />
<br />
So if you other so called professional techs out there have something important to say to actually help FIX the problem then say it, or else take your 'call x person' cop out solution somewhere else. All that says is you don't have a clue how to fix the problem
 and that is not helping the person looking for a solution, who by the way just might be a tech also, and has to skim through hundreds of those stupid non information solutions that helps no one!!!!!!!<br />

            I'm not sure if you have tried this yet, but Salahudeen_S on the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/canon-hg20-drivers/98b56945-974a-4a0f-9ef2-36a3b1b98480">
Canon HG20 Drivers</a> thread had a simple solution to a similar issue.&nbsp; After swapping out the cable that came with the camera with another one, the OS recognized his camera.<br />
<br />
I understand that we are talking the difference between a digital videocassette recorder and a camera, as well as being USB vs Firewire, but it might be worth a try.<br />
<br />
Also, you might want to try the suggestion given by John Cena in the <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprohardware/thread/65cb7a25-2a84-4875-aa27-b084537e8da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thank you for your reply and for sharing. I already did the John Cena thing that obviously makes common sense, but no it did not work. I don't have another cable and that did cross my mind. I'm going to have to go to Radio Shack and Best Buy to see if
 they have a newer one that might work, but I should NOT have to spend more money like this.&nbsp; I am so sick of Microsoft not being more community friendly when they can see all the problems everyone has just like I can. They should have a completely filled programming
 division that only deals with drivers needed for such devices because there is more than enough environmental damage now with so much electronics in the landfills already and my $600 camera should work without these problems.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion I'm going to check out Radio Shack first after I shovel Lake Erie out of my driveway tomorrow....maybe lol. Too cold so far to have any ambition to do it.<br />

            Have you had any luck yet with your Firewire problem.&nbsp; Have exactly the same problem.&nbsp; I use vegas Pro v11.&nbsp; I can see and control the camera but cannot capture any HDV footage.&nbsp; Can capture in DVCAM mode but connection keeps breaking.&nbsp; Have tried Legacy
 driver and texas instruments one.&nbsp; No help.&nbsp; If you've found a solution I would love to know it.<br />

Thanks<br />

            I do have an answer that most don't want to hear. It cost me money but...it worked.<br />
<br />
I finally (!) found a third party firewire card that worked with my DSR-11 on my system running Win OS 7 64.&nbsp; It was a generic PCI expansion card that featured a VIA chipset with two - USB 2.0 ports and one - 1394A 4 pin port on the back. Plus, one internal
 USB 2.0 and one 6 pin 1394. Bought it at Tigerdirect for about $30.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I also installed a older version of Sony Vegas that I got for less than $70 brand new and fully licensed.&nbsp; After some d*cking around installing and un-installing various older (heritage etc) 1394 drivers that were resident in Win 7 and the ones that I could
 download from the site of my newly installed expansion card, Vegas finally saw my DSR-11 and we all edited happily ever after. Just remember to reboot after each installation of a driver.&nbsp; Note: try and find the heritage 1394 driver from a XP 32 machine and
 copy it to your 64 system if you can get a hold of it.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What I learned for sure was that others who said that you must use a 1394A port with the 4 pin Sony cable were indeed correct.&nbsp; No other combination (6 pin to 4 pin for example) worked with my DSR-11.&nbsp; Even after I managed to get everything talking to one another,
 I decided to see if the internal 6 pin to 4 pin cable would work - it didn't.&nbsp; Put back the 4 pin cable?&nbsp; Success.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp;

<br />
My DSR-11 is a very old, very dependable machine.&nbsp; Its interface was rather proprietary.&nbsp; Translation? Finicky as h#ll as it was written in the era of Win 2K and the 1394A interface fell out of favor quite quickly in the consumer world.&nbsp; Only vid-geeks like
 me with Pinnacle linear editor or Canopus RexEdit&nbsp; hardware running Premiere 5.0/6/0 depended on the original Firewire for PC's.
<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope that helps you and anyone else that has this problem.&nbsp; Why Microsoft can't provide a functional heritage Firewire driver is beyond me but there it is.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now....can anyone tell me where I can find a driver for my very old, very dependable 1st Gen Apple IPod Touch that will let me see it in my Win OS 7 64 bit machine? &nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;
<br />

            Thanks for this advice.&nbsp; I think my situation slightly different.&nbsp; I have full control of my Sony Z5 camera via the firewire using either the default or legacy microsoft driver and I can capture intermitently in ~DVCAM mode but not at all in HDV mode.&nbsp;
 I'm waiting to hear back from Sony to see if there is a problem with my Startech firewire card.&nbsp; I've had no trouble captruing from the Sony F800 HD XDCAM camcorder using the Sony proprietry driver.&nbsp; Still a mystery.<br />

            The problem is Microsoft and their colossal stupidity. Its a windows 7 issue, and forums are filled with EVERY USB to Firewire not working because the driver fails. It will work on older versions of Windows but not Windows 7. This seems to be the case
 for standard firewire as well. Windows should have an update to fix this by now, but they don't seem to care.

            <p>This is really good information and advice in the previous posts - Thank you.&nbsp; With the help of the&nbsp;prior posts, I was able to get my newly built Win 7 64 bit OS editing system&nbsp;to easily recognize the Sony DSR11 Deck via Firewire 1394 A and using a generic
 6 pin to 4 pin firewire cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the Vantec UGT-FW210 Firewire card (PCIe ×1).&nbsp; If offers 1 1394A (400) 6pin&nbsp;port and 2 1394B (800) ports.&nbsp; I only have use for the firewire 400.&nbsp; Windows automatically loaded the correct drivers with no intervention from me.&nbsp; AWESOME!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works PERFECTLY!!!</p>

                    <p class="contentStandard">I started my notebook, logged in my user - it had the exact same name - and noticed the desktop just had the softwares, without any other files. Background was windows default.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That new user lasted for like 2 days, including reboots, and then after one reboot it came back to the old user - with the exact same name, as I said - and without the files, since I'd moved them to the other user.<br />

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />When user profile got corrupted and it will create a new one.
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps.
<br />1. Right-click Start link, 
<br />2. Open Computer Management.
<br />3. From the left pane, expand the Local Users and Groups tree. 
<br />4. From the expanded list, click the Users container. 
<br />5. You can see all the available user accounts in the right pane. 
<br />6. Make sure that user folder has no files that are important to you. 
<br />7. To see the files, you can go to C:\Users\&lt;the unwanted user name&gt;
<br />8. To get rid of the unwanted user, you can right-click its name in the right pane, and click Delete from the context menu.
<br />
<br />As you said you can't find files, it may be found at C:\Users\ in an similar name with special characters.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi winstyl
<br />
<br />This ia very normal, Windows 10 is counter intuitive and restart will always take a lot longer than a shut down and restart . . 
<br />
<br />When you shut your PC down, the current start of your RAM is written to your hard drive, then when you start your PC again, that state is read form your hard drive back into RAM
<br />
<br />That is known as fast Startup in Windows 10 - so no need to enable that, it is already enabled . . .
<br />
<br />When you restart Windows 10, it does actually shut down and flushes the contents of your RAM. so on a restart, everything in Windows 10 needs to be loaded and initialized
        </p>

<p>i did this but still restart took 1 min 40 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, when I unchecked the fast startup the restart took 1 min 15 seconds but after shutdown , starting time increased from 35 sec to 53 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what should I do keep after shutdown start time : 35 seconds and restating time less than 1 minute??</p>

<p>I've been searching and reading TONES of articles for about ...2 months now. tried every possible scenario and it seems that Windows 10 is freaking broken and the most unstable Operating system of all time, And from what i've seen and read, MS don't care,
 will never offer a real solution, and thus it's our cue to consider our options, aka switch to another OS and end this torture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10, a clunky buggy OS made for housewives and cheerleaders. don't let the fancy look fool you. Window 7 was way better in many different (critical and needed) aspects.

<p>Maybe you have too many things running in the background (programs and/or services) - it may be idle for you but there are still programs running and perhaps we can reduce that number.&nbsp; Some are a matter of timing (like when the system does automatic windows
 update or other scheduled tasks).&nbsp; Changing the timing may help keep tasks from overlapping and working the hard drive harder (that is not covered below, but you can check those tasks and their schedules).&nbsp; Here's some maintenance you can do that will reduce
 the amount of space on your system and improve performance (and reduce utilization):</p>
<div>
<p><span><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software (or whatever it calls itself)
 no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;</span>Most
 do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;</span>Vista keeps the registry
 clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed and&nbsp;space, do Disk Cleanup using: </span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp; If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box
 Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Do all of the options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced.&nbsp; It's a trade-off.&nbsp; The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points
 you will be able to retain - but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Also, system restore points are created in the background, so reducing the frequency will reduce the usage of the hard drive.<br />
<br />
This is probably the most likely procedure to help with this problem.&nbsp; Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting
 at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there - if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will
 free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;</span>When I did this on my
 system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, reponse times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also
 faster.<span>&nbsp; </span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>
 which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you can’t delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which MUST not
 be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

                    Facing the same problem for past 2 weeks many articles said update your system. I did the same but I didn't get any result. Reinstalled the app from store still remains same. Of course I ran app troubleshooter it says your version of windows cant run this

    <title>Intermittent USB wired mouse failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drakyri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent USB wired mouse failure</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been experiencing intermittent failure of a wired USB Intellimouse Explorer 3.0.&nbsp; After turning on and off at random intervals, it'll eventually stop working altogether.&nbsp; At this point, Windows notes that a USB device has failed (but is unable to do
 anything to help).</p>
<p>Plugging it back in will allow the mouse to work briefly, at which point it will fail again.&nbsp; Rebooting has the same effect.&nbsp; I can successfully use this mouse on other machines, and other USB mouses exhibit similar behavior on mine.</p>
<p>Things that I have tried without success include:</p>
<p>-using a USB-to-PS2 converter</p>
<p>-trying a different USB port (same problem, but they work fine for other things)</p>
<p>-updating the drivers (there are no updates)</p>
<p>-Using Microsoft's iPoint setup</p>
<p>-turning off power management for the USB mouse / root hubs / etc.</p>
<p>-reinstalling the USB root hubs / etc.</p>
<p>-adjusting the USB settings in the BIOS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>They should have been updated. However, I went to the manufacturer's site and installed the most recent version (ca. 2008) and rebooted.&nbsp; It does not seem to have helped anything.</p>

<p>Hi drakyri,</p>
<p>What is the brand and model of this PC?</p>
<p>If this is a laptop I suggest shutting down the computer and removing the battery for several minutes.</p>
<p>Then reattach the battery and restart the PC to see if the issue has been resolved.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth missing in Settings and Device Manager for Windows 10, TOSHIBA Satellite Skullcandy</h2>
                    <p>I've been doing my research on windows 10 glitches with Bluetooth and I've seen other posts on this site talking about Bluetooth missing in the settings, but nothing I've done has worked. My laptop has a built in Bluetooth (it even has the Bluetooth support
 service which I HAVE started and it still hasn't changed anything) but the overall bluetooth is just... missing. I can't find it anywhere and I can't pair up my headphones. I've also used the Driver Talent program and still, no changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted, I've actually never used bluetooth before. This is the first time I've used bluetooth on this laptop and my laptop just updated to Windows 10 last month and I got some new toys recently I wanted to used with my laptop. But I didn't think using bluetooth
 was supposed to be this hard.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Taskbar glitches&#58; start button, search, task view, ect. not working &#42;WIN 10&#42;</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago my computer started acting up. i suddenly couldn't use my taskbar anymore. with that i mean:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>the start, search, task view and notifications buttons stopped working (they don't react when i click them)</li><li>i can no longer peak at the desktop or go to it (without minimizing all the tabs)</li><li>i can't see the pinned programs on my taskbar anymore but i can still use them</li><li>the sound, internet connection, ect. buttons in the bottom right have disappeared and i can't use them</li></ol>
<p>simultaneously, i've also gotten a lot of sound problems. like, the sound will sometimes work when i start up my PC but when i start watching a youtube video, after a while, it just stops playing sound and the video keeps playing but there's also a loading
 sign there...</p>
<p>i've also had these sort of issues with other programs besides chrome</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've had this problem before and it went away after a day or so because of an update but now i've had it for three days and it's really annoying because i basically can't use my PC at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've tried to fix it but the advice there is online seems risky and it's unclear whether it'll even work for me +all of the commets are clogged up with people saying it's not working for them so idk what to do anymore. if i can't fix this soon i might just
 switch back to win 7</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Taskbar issue has good results by creating a new admin user account. The sound issue, to me may have to do with the way the upgrade was delivered. Clean install/upgrade I think gives a better W10 experience. Chrome and other third party programs, I found
 using portable apps on W10,&nbsp;installed to a folder on the hard drive,&nbsp;instead of installed. Work better. Especially Chrome.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>"but the advice there is online seems risky "</li></ul>
<p>Always copy personal files and product keys of purchased software before major Operating System changes. Be ready for the unfortunate event.</p>

            <p>thanks for the advice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think i've found the problem; my video card.</p>
<p>it doesn't show up in Device manager anymore and instead there's an unknown device.</p>
<p>also, this morning when i started up my PC the size of the screen was smaller than my monitor (it still is).</p>
<p>my computer is quite dusty and the videocard, an nvidia geforce 630, doesn't have a fan aimed at (edit* it does have a fan) it so maybe it couldn't handle the heat anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the videocard could just be a part of the problem, though.</p>
<p>i'm definitely gonna start copying important files too.</p>
<p>thanks again for the help</p>
<p>
</p><p>by the way, is sound tied to the videocard?</p>

<p>My NVidia card has DVI and HDMI ports, with Digital Audio drivers. So yes in a way. When I upgraded my RAM to system capacity 3 new NVidia drives loaded.</p>

                    <p>I understand you can't export emails from Windows 10 mail? So how do I backup, as I do now with Windows Essentials 2012?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've see an option that take you down this route, where you copy your mails : </p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\Username\Appdata\Local\packages\microsoft.Windowscommunicationsapps\Localstate\Indexed\Livecomm\any folder name\any folder name\mail.(C:\ being the drive where Windows is installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this does not have all the emails I currently have in Outlook and seems to only have mails up to 1/5/16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do you backup Windows 10 mail?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We are glad to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that the Mail app in Windows&nbsp;10 doesn’t have an option to export the emails or create a backup of the emails.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you can try this work around to make a copy of the emails before the Mail app sync online mail account and deletes the emails. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the following location:</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Users\Username\Appdata\Local\packages\microsoft.Windowscommunicationsapps\Localstate\Indexed\Livecomm\any folder name\any folder name\mail.(C:\ being
 the drive where Windows is installed)</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The app data folder in the above said location is a hidden folder. So, if you are unable to view, change the view options to show hidden files and check.</span></p>
<p><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find many folders for each folder in the mail folder (like inbox, sent, drafts). Open these folders and locate the folders that contains the emails.</span></p>
<p><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy and paste these email files in the desired location. You will be able to open these files using any email applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Do contact us for further queries. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Just the same as Alfie I have gone to the Appdata folder and what I found was it did not contain any of my messages.</p>
<p>I am very disppointed that this otherwise handy app. has no backup facility.</p>

<p>Hi Phillip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>your link is not working, and when fixing the link by removing the http:// at the end, the post from Santosh advises about WL Mail but this has been decommissioned, so it's not really helping.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Backup and Restore from  Control Panel</h2>
                    <p>When I click on the "Backup and Restore" inside Control Panel, nothing happens, no Backup and Restore window opens, so I can't run the system image backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is missing? Could it be a missing Registry record? How can I find out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA</p>
