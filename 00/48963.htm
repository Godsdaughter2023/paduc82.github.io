<h2>            File History not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I currently have 2 distinct problems with the File History back-up:</p>
<p>- I had reduced the save folders to D:users/myname and C:users/myname but it only backed up a very limited no of folders within those ranges and not the most important ones.</p>
<p>- I then decided to make the list of save folders more specific using the Add a Folder facility. But, after selecting a folder then clicking "choose a folder" there was a slight sign of something happening in the list of Save folders but then nothing happened
 - it looked exactly as it did before I decided to Add a Folder. i tried this several times but had no success</p>
<p>In the past i have used this Add a Folder facility without any problems.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Can please try following methods:
<br />
<br />Method 1: Let’s try these steps and check if it helps.
<br />
<br />Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.) Enter File History settings in the search box, and then tap or click File History settings. Tap or click Select a drive, and choose the network or external drive you want to use. Turn on File History.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the system file checker (SFC).

<br />Let me know if that helps.

<p>Hi Jamshed,</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you are telling me how to get into File History. I obviously know how to get in ( my method is control panel/update and security/backup then More Options) and file history is currently pointing to the correct external drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see where you have suggested anything which refers to the two problems which I have</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, i should also have mentioned that I did run the system file checker but it came back with "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"<br />
</p>

<p>I think the reason that File History was only&nbsp; backing up some of the folders in D:users/myname is that my main libraries (with the exception of Music) are held in D:users/myname/onedrive. All these OneDrive folders are physically held on the PC as well
 as being in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hold the libraries in the OneDrive folder so that, when updated on the PC, they are automatically available on my other devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does File History refuse to save any folders within the OneDrive folder even though they are physically on the computer?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If so, do you have any recommendations for getting round this problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be an issue with the installation or setup file of SQL Server Management Studio. If you are already using a Latest version of Internet Explorer (Internet Explorer 11), then it shouldn't be an issue. I would suggest you to post the same question
 in Microsoft MSDN forum for further assistance with this issue. In Microsoft MSDN forum we have a dedicated team to help you with this type of issues.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My son plays the xbox one Star Wars Lego: the force awakens game and twice now as he starts playing the Force Awakens sequence, the game has reset back to the battle of endor section. Is he pressing something that takes him back to the beginning of the game
 play or is anyone else experiencing similar issues?</p>
<p>thanks </p>

            <p>Hey there Newdinohunter!</p>
<p>When you start the game do you get a message stating that the game is syncing your game save? If that appears, be sure not to cancel it, as cancelling it may cause you to save over your previous save with a new file. </p>

<blockquote>Network icon disappeared from tool bar at the bottom of the screen. (it used to be next to the one for battery charge). How do I get it back?</blockquote>
<br />
The area is called Taskbar.<br />
<br />
3 ways to get it back.....<br />
1.) The easy way, if you are lucky :<br />
Right click on the taskbar &gt; click Properties &gt; at the top, click Notification Area &gt; can you put a checkmark on&nbsp; Network ? If yes, you are done.<br />
<br />
If it is unclickable .....<br />
2.) Use this Tutorial :&nbsp; <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/106787-notification-area-system-icons.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/106787-notification-area-system-icons.html</a><br />
Note : Depending on which Vista version you have, use Method Two or Three.<br />
When done, go back to #1 above and click the box.<br />
<br />
3.) Do a ysytem Restore. Pick the date when the icon was present as your restore point.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>The drive only requires it is connected to power and the computer is running in order for the eject/retract button on it to work - it does not require a data cable connection to do that. When the tray retracts with a disk in it, the disk should spin, and
 the led on the front of the drive should come on briefly. If that doesn't work when the data cable is disconnected (easy to do on a desktop computer), there is something wrong with the drive itself.</div>
<div>- the most common reason - the bearings in the motor are failing and the motor cannot spin fast enough or does not spin at all.</div>
<div>- a laser or it's circuits may have failed</div>
<div>- the drive's board may be damaged</div>
<div>- many optical drives have a rubber belt - if it is slipping the eject/retract may not work properly</div>
<div>.....</div>
<div>If the data cable is connected....</div>
<div>If there's nothing wrong with the drive or the disk, the drive will eject the disk, but you have these things going on....</div>
<div>- your mboard bios spins the disk(s) if present while booting - you can't eject the disk, if the boot order settings in the bios have an optical drive in the list, when the bios is trying to see if the disk is bootable.</div>
<div>- Windows spins the disks if they are present while loading Windows, and at seemingly random times while you are using Windows, even when you are not actively accessing the disk, and the led on the front of the drive does NOT always come on and it is often
 spinning more slowly, so you may not be aware it is spinning.</div>
<div>e.g. when you access My Computer or Windows Explorer, if there is an optical disk present, Windows will read the disk before loading either of those.</div>
<div>- the disk will not eject right away if Windows is trying to access it at the time, and the led on it is NOT always lit up when it is trying to do that&nbsp;</div>
<div>- if the disk is spinning at the time you want the disk to eject, it will not eject right away - the disk has to stop spinning first, then it will eject.</div>
<div>.....</div>
<div>If there is a problem with the drive reading a disk, there may be a longer delay until the disk ejects, and the led on the front of it may stay on longer or blink on and off longer. The disk won't eject until Windows has finished it's procedure and the
 disk has stopped spinning.</div>
<div>- you will get that if you try to read a DVD or other type of media in a drive that can't read them</div>
<div>- a burned disk other than a CD-R or a DVD-R may not read properly in a drive it was not burned in</div>
<div>- the disk you are trying to read may be defective, especially if it is a cheap bulk burned disk.</div>
<div>- the disk and the laser lenses should be clean - try using a laser lens cleaning CD in the drive, or on a laptop you can often easily see the laser lens on the drive when the tray is ejected and clean it with a Q tip or a tissue.A</div>
<div>Some burner programs will lock the drive and not let it be ejected. This is done because the program hasn't completed the final cleanup on the disc. Nero's 'InCD' is one of the programs that does this under certain conditions.</div>
<div>If there is any burner program running at the time this happens, try shutting it down.</div>

Yes, you can use the same product key. </p>

    <title>&#39;files on demand&#39;-feature causing lots of trouble - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidgretzschel  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;files on demand&#39;-feature causing lots of trouble</h2>
                    <p>I have been bewildered by the fact that the files in my OneDrive folders<br />
come with a loading bar wasting my time. When this was the case there was a little blue icon<br />
in the status column next to the file name.<br />
I thought, that with the recent reinstallation of Windows, that I would have not enabled a full sync</p>
<p>with the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I right-clicked the OneDrive tray icon, went to 'Settings' and looked under</p>
<p>'Account' and checked in ' Choose Folders' that indeed everything was selected properly.<br />
After googling around for a bit and not finding anything, I came to the conclusion that this was<br />
some kind of yet undocumented syncing bug and thought, that this was going to be a headache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the newly introduced feature 'Files On-Demand' that I've never heard from before</p>
<p>just blatantly ignores the sync settings.<br />
Now whilst I don't understand who would want this feature,&nbsp;as a high or even low-powered desktop computer or a Laptop that can only sync&nbsp;via WiFi or Lan anyway and thus would never waste traffic, as data plans<br />
are unlimited (well, where I live, they are anyway) I do not know.<br />
It's probably not meant for me.<br />
That's why I am asking that this feature should not be enabled by default, especially on Microsoft accounts,</p>
<p>that are older than the feature, as people will likely be as confused and annoyed as I was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the setting should not contradict the sync-settings, because that made it hard to realize what was</p>
<p>wrong in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even understand the naming of the feature 'files on demand' and ask for it to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, when I click on a file, opening the file is my demand. It opens immediately. My demand was met.</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now when I click on a file it doesn't open.</p>
<p>It shows me a loading bar, which I did not demand and noone in their right mind would ever<br />
want to demand. Then after about half a second has passed (proably a lot longer, if the internet is slow) it finally complies with my demand.</p>
<p>If my internet is down, I can demand all I want, but there are no files.<br />
This goes against the spirit of 'files on demand'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even know what'll happen, when I right-click a file to see it's properties or try to do a context-menu<br />
action. Or when I try to select locally available ones and 'on-demand'-ones together</p>
<p>and copy them to another hard drive. But it's probably worse and I don't want to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upload a bunch of photos from my phone and want to go thru them with<br />
a picture viewer and go thru the scans with the arrow keys, now each transition wastes time.&nbsp;<br />
To quote the legendary Adam Jensen: "I never asked for this!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I couldn't post this under the category "OneDrive" because the "Start a Discussion"-form tells me, that 'This forum has been locked'. As OneDrive installs with Windows, I feel that this is the next-most appropriate place for it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want online-only files then on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab under <strong>
Files On-Demand</strong> you need to check <strong>Save space and download files as you use them?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on an online-only file it downloads to your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can select
<strong>view online</strong> instead and you will be taken to the file online instead of having to download the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want all your files to show on your computer with little cloud icons then you need to go to
<strong>Account</strong> -&gt; <strong>Choose folders</strong> -&gt; <strong>Choose folders</strong> and check all folders.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done to avoid the constant downloading is to check <strong>always keep on this device
</strong>for all my files then I can leave <strong>Files On-Demand </strong>enabled and still have everything available on my PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helps.</p>

</p>
<p>Why would I want to view a file? Files aren't meant for viewing, they are meant for opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;tab under&nbsp;<strong>Files On-Demand</strong>&nbsp;did you check&nbsp;<strong>Save space and download files as you use them?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>I&nbsp;</strong>did not check it. It was checked&nbsp;<strong>for me</strong>, when the feature was introduced,&nbsp;<strong>without&nbsp;</strong>telling me what was going on.&nbsp; Figuring out that this setting even existed and what it does was
 hard. With the introduction of the feature, this shouldn't have been enabled by default, for at least the people who reinstalled Windows and didn't expect some obscure new feature ruining their day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want all your files to show on your computer with little cloud icons then you need to go to&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Choose folders</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Choose folders</strong>&nbsp;and check all folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. You are right. This is actually a very good description of the setting, as it is now. However the option&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;does not say: "Folders you choose will have little cloud icons." It says&nbsp;"Folders you choose will&nbsp;<strong>be available&nbsp;</strong>on this
 PC." Which is&nbsp;<strong>wrong</strong>, because the 'files on demand'-checkbox contradicts the availability when having slow or no internet.</p>

<p>If you do this for all your files, though....what's the point of letting&nbsp; 'files on demand' enabled in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not quite sure who could really benefit from the feature. OneDrive is only 1TB, and that's only if you max it out.</p>
<p>1TB isn't that much for a Windows machine. If you even have close to that much data, you probably do something important</p>
<p>with it, that requires opening and not waiting around (chances are the files would be very large to fill so much space).</p>

<p>Interesting, I'm not sure what you mean by that. I never noticed terrible things. Maybe I wasn't attentive enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was posted as a discussion, not a question, though I suppose you read it as a question, which is probably good, as people can get the fix without having to read my wall of text.</p>
<p>I just hoped to save some people some work, by stating the problem, so that people</p>
<p>can find it online. And maybe to let off some steam, because it upset me.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for reminding me about the feedback hub. I'll press windows+f and write to them. They built a shortcut into Windows 10, so they probably actually value the feedback after all.</p>

<p>It can be a pain if you are not connected to the internet and you can't get to your files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It's inconvenient to have to download a file and then delete the file from your PC.&nbsp; It more desirable just to have it available on your PC if possible.</p>

<h2>            How to clean up the offline files on Windows 7</h2>
                    I need to reset the offline files database on a local machine.&nbsp; I user tried to offline sync a entire share on the server whicj exceeded the system had drive space. We selected all the folders to not be synced and went the waiting process for it to finish.

<p><span>Hi zrock,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try deleting the offline files manually.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type Manage Offline Files and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the General tab, click the View your Offline Files button.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Navigate under Computers to the folder or a higher level and try to delete the cache content.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> This operation may take some time to remove
 and actually disappear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also delete temporary files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the
<strong>Disk Usage</strong> tab, click the <strong>Delete temporary files</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Pen Doesn&#39;t Work - White Flashing Light</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently having issues with multiple Surface pens which will not work on my Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of them have a white flashing light (I believe this means they're trying to connect to a device?). The batteries are 100% fine. I have tried multiple nibs. I have also gone through the usual steps (updating Windows, trying on multiple devices, the ol'
 turn it off and on again etc etc). I have tried these pens on Surface 3s, Surface Pro 3s and Surface Pro 4s and they do not work on any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hunch that these pens are trying to connect to a Surface which they were previously paired to, but can no longer find it and seem to be stuck in this trying to connect state (if that's not the reason then honestly I have absolutely no idea).</p>
<p>I would go to the Surface they were originally paired with to remove it from the known devices but as an organisation with approximately 1000 Surfaces... that's basically impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be hugely grateful of any advice, information or things to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenge you are experiencing with the Surface Pen might be software-related. This means that a setting may not be set up appropriately, or that a specific driver is not installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address this concern, we suggest that you <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install the latest Firmware and drivers for Surface</a>. Choose all the updates from the list.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023474/surface-troubleshoot-surface-pen-with-single-button-on-flat-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> under the article <strong>Pen won't pair with Surface or open apps</strong> for more troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists after following the steps mentioned above, you can check your options by visiting one of our
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Stores</a></strong> near your area for further checking or for a replacement.</p>
<br />
<p>Keep us in the loop with the result.</p>
<p>

<p>1. 90% of pairs pair and write correctly perfectly fine. These 10% of pairs which will not work will not
<strong>write</strong> on the Surfaces. I do not care if they can pair or not. I cannot test if these pens which will not write also do not pair as there are multiple pens in Bluetooth range so I cannot identify the correct pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Approximately 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. As these are out of warranty, is this going to be a paid service to get these replaced (if it comes to that)?</p>

            <div>I don't know how support for business will handle this. On the consumer side,</div>
<div>yes. But I would suggest taking a couple of pens and Surfaces outside the office</div>
<div>to a different location and testing there. And definitely changing batteries. I</div>
<div>know you said the batts are fine, but try one more time outside the office</div>
<div>environment. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The other thing to try, to rule out issues on the tablets themselves, is to</div>
<div>reimage one of them (as a test) with a retail, non Enterprise image and see if</div>
<div>you still have the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Unable to access account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, one of my friends on xbox can no longer access his account because of problems with the password. Issue lies in the fact the account was given to him by a relative (said relative has passed away) so my friend doesn't know the password. Password reset
 doesn't work cause the email with it can't be accessed either (the phone with the email no longer works).</p>
<p><br />
All in all he doesn't have any way to change/reset his email or his password so is there anything he can do or does he have to create a whole new 360 profile?</p>

<h3> cnagra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enabling IPV6 Stops NAS from Connecting</h2>
                    
<p>When i re-enable ipv6 on my new Windows 7 laptop I can't connect to my NAS drive (WD MyBookWorld Blue Rings).</p>
<p>As soon as the laptop is started from Hibernate or Shut down, the error comes up saying cannot connect to network drive.</p>
<p>If i disable ipv6 then I have no problems.</p>
<p>My questions is, am I missing out on anything on disabling ipv6? and will it stop any software from working?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Sorry to say that if the touchscreen does not work in the UEFI screen, it is a hardware issue. Microsoft does not sell parts (or repair screens) - they only exchange for a refurb, which has been running around $450 US. 
<br />
<br />There are some folks who have managed to find third party shops that have attempted to fix this issue without success.
<br />
<br />I'm really sorry for the bad news. Please don't shoot the messenger. If you want to pursue an exchange, if you are in the US, go to a physical retail Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a> - otherwise contact support <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>

            Does the touch screen work if you boot to the UEFI screen or not? 
<br />
<br />First step, shutdown your Surface Pro 3. Next, press and hold the Volume Up button and press Power. Keep holding down the Volume Up button until the Surface logo appears, and then release it. Surface Pro 3 will load the UEFI firmware, which you can navigate with keyboard, mouse or touch - does touch work here or not? This will help diagnose if this is a hardware or a software issue.

            Hi Belarmino.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Likely a corrupted account we see a lot here in Windows 10, but never I can remember in Windows 7.
<br />
<br />See possible fixes here:  <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/solved-user-profile-service-failed-logon-3495216/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/so...</a>
<br />
<br />You can create a new Local Admin Account to see if it will function properly:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If so move your files over, test all programs run correctly, then when ready delete the old account.   You can then link your MS account to the new one:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can enable the hidden Built In Administrator account to sign into to add the new account:  <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2014/11/12/how-to-enable-the-hidden-windows-10-administrator-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ghacks.net/2014/11/12/how-to-enable-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            What step did I give that makes you think I don't know what a Microsoft Account is.  I deal with them a hundred times a day.  
<br />
<br />I gave you very specific steps to create a new Local Admin account to sign into and Set up, until you can delete your old account.  Then you can link your MS Account to the new Local account to replace it.
<br />
<br />I even gave you illustrated tutorials for how to do each of these steps.
<br />
<br />Is this not clear yet?  If not keep asking questions until it becomes clear.

Likely a corrupted account we see a lot here in Windows 10, but never I can remember in Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
See possible fixes here: <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/solved-user-profile-service-failed-logon-3495216/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/so...</a> <br />
<br />
You can create a new Local Admin Account to see if it will function properly: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a> <br />
<br />
If so move your files over, test all programs run correctly, then when ready delete the old account. You can then link your MS account to the new one:

<br />
If necessary you can enable the hidden Built In Administrator account to sign into to add the new account:

I was following the first tip from TechAdvisor, and instead of copying the things, I just created a new user, logged in, restarted, logged in again, added a Ms. account, restarted.<br />
Everything was OK, but when I went to msconfig and change it, the user didn't appeared in the list of users as always.<br />
<br />
I used a Local Account to put msconf back to normal, and the account is there in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since is a new account, I didn't copy nothing from the older account that could make her corrupted as well, the new account is already corrupted by herself?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi <span>helpmetomorrow,<br />
<br />
I checked you account and found out the it was recently created. Please be informed that
<span>
Windows Live Hotmail accounts become inactive if you were not able to sign in for more than 270 days or within the first 10 days after signing up for an account. If the account stays inactive for an additional 90 days, the account name may be permanently deleted.
 If you don’t use your Windows Live ID for 365 days, your Windows Live ID may be permanently deleted.<br />
<br />
<span>Note</span>: When an account has been marked as inactive all its messages will be purged from the servers. Unfortunately, emails lost due to account inactivity can no longer be recovered.
<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks,<br />
<br />

<h3> jenniecockrell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bamboo Ink Stylus Not Writing</h2>
                    I've recently purchased a Bamboo Ink pen to use with my Dell Inspiron 13, 7000 series. The pen pairs through bluetooth and pushing the top will bring up the related apps, but when I put the pen to the touch screen it won't write. I've tried updating just
 about everything and uninstalling/reinstalling the applications, but nothing is making it work. I'm wondering how much of my soul I have to sell to get this pen to work?

<br />Let’s try to uninstall the bluetooth device / install back on a different way
<br />
<br />On the search bar, type Computer Management, click on Device Manager
<br />ON the list, look for the bluetooth device, right click then uninstall device.
<br />Restart the machine.
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade failed</h2>
                    From the media creation tool I downloaded Windows 10 Home 32-64bit for my friends Windows 7 Home Premium 64Bit laptop. I burnt the ISO to DVD and went to upgrade from the DVD. It went through all the setup procedure and got to Install (your computer may
 restart). After a second or two it failed, Their was a problem -&nbsp; installation failed. With no error message. I then decided to use the mefia creation tool to uprade the PC. It got to about 70% download and failed, this time with 0x80200013-0x90017 I have
 read on here it's the update proxy AV. However I chose not to update on installation.&nbsp; it's ages to download I can't turn off AV for that long. I have upgraded another laptop from 8.1 to 10 with no problem. What's going on

<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">By definition, an "upgrade" (as opposed to a clean installation) means that all data, programs, etc. are kept intact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">However there are no guarantees that it always works perfectly. However unlikely, it's always possible that something might go wrong. For that reason
 it's prudent to be sure you have a backup of anything you can't afford to lose before beginning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">If I understand you correctly, you are contemplating upgrading from a lower edition of Windows 7 to Ultimate. If so, that kind of upgrade is the least
 likely to cause you problems. But if I'm wrong, and you are contemplating upgrading from an earlier version of Windows, note the following: Microsoft has lately been calling some installations "upgrades" when thgey are really clean installations. For example,
 although you can use an Upgrade DVD to go from Windows XP to Windows 7, you can *not* do an upgrade with it, and must do a clean installation (what Microsoft calls a "custom" installation).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">If you do a clean installation rather than an upgrade, you will lose all your programs, data and everything else.</span></p>

            Depends on the version of Windows you have installed and the edition and architecture of Windows 7 you are upgrading to.<br />
<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.<br />
Windows XP &gt; Custom clean install only<br />
<br />

<br />
Upgrading from Windows XP?<br />
<br />
Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.<br />
<br />
Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).<br />
<br />
More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.<br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.

    <title>how do i get media center on win 8 enterprise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boledylocks  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i get media center on win 8 enterprise</h2>
                    I need direct access and stuff so need the enterprise version of Windows 8.&nbsp; But win 8 ent doesn't support dvd playback.&nbsp; Or music playback other than xbox music which appears to be just geared up to take your money.&nbsp; I can add media player for audio but
 it no longer supports video playback.&nbsp; Media center is what's needed but the pro pack "add features" option isn't available.&nbsp; Is there a way round this?

Praseetha K Nair</a>&nbsp;was not helpful. The question was about Windows 8 Enterprise, the answer was about Windows 8 PRO.</p>
<p>I have the same problem. I currently use Windows 7 Entreprise on all my PCs and I use Media Center. There is no upgrade from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 8 PRO but that would be useless anyway.</p>
<p>I cannot move to Windows 8 until Media Center is available for Windows 8 Enterprise.</p>
<p>Come on Microsoft; be sensible!</p>

            Oh dear.&nbsp; My plans have been scuppered. Move from iPad to surface, from iPhone to Nokia 920, iTunes to Media Center&nbsp;was the plan. But without a media management product the house of cards collapses.&nbsp; Media&nbsp;player doesn't play video so I'd be left with
 an unknown product line that has no media product support.&nbsp; As a Microsoft man I'm sorry to say Apple has won again.

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you are an MVP. Does this help you get a response from Microsoft as to whay they have such a stupid policy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is particularly stupid with respect to Microsoft Partners who pay money to get Windows licences but only get to purchase Windows 8 Enterprise so a blocked from using Media Center!</p>

            <p>I cannot run Windows 8 Pro for&nbsp;3 reasons.</p>
<p>1. My company is a Microsoft Silver partner and we can only get Windows 8 Enterprise under our agreement.</p>
<p>2. I currently use Windows 7 Enterprise and there is NOT an upgrade path to Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>3. Windows 8 Pro does not support Direct Access and my company requires all PC to start using Direct Access.</p>

<h2>            Printing via Wireless while plugged into Network.</h2>
                    I want to use a wireless connection to print from my Surface even though my Surface is connected via cable to the internet.&nbsp; The printer is too far away to run a cable between it and the Surface. So that is why I want to use the wireless network just to
 print. Is this possible?

            I don't know if this will work, but when you are cabled, try to set up the printer AGAIN as a SECOND Printer as an IP printer. This way you would end up with two printers. One would work on wireless and one on wired/cabled. 
<br />
<br />Hope this makes sense.
