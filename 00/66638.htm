<h2>            Windows 10 ethernet bridge on Hyper-V not functional</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I use Win Server 2016 Hyper-V and for testing purposes I have two Win 10 Professional virtual machines with this topology:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
LAN &lt;---&gt; external virtual switch&nbsp; &lt;---&gt; Win10 with ethernet bridge &lt;---&gt; private virtual switch &lt;---&gt; 2-nd Win10&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Win 10 ethernet bridge is not functional. When I try ping from 2-nd Win10 to LAN then it does not receive ARP response. I can ping only Win10 bridge and I can ping from bridge to 2-nd Win10. I disabled Win firewall on both Win10 I tried to change adapter profiles
 (public/private), reinstalling Bridge MAC Miniport, no success.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Is it something specific to Hyper-V and virtual machines ? What to do with that ?</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive turned off my AV program, Ive tried in safe mode, Ive tried downloading the tool rather than from the icon, Ive tried going to MS updates and downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all goes well until we get to the second boot and it just hangs.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I finally get sick of looking at the unmoving windows icon on a blue background, I turn off the laptop, turn on and I get the message we encounted an unknown error :(&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Have a couple of questions:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A) Which program comes up when you choose print option? Do you see Windows Fax and Scan or Window Picture Fax Viewer or any other Third Party Fax Application?<br />
</span><span>B) What happens when you try to print a .jpg image? Do you face the same issue with other file formats?</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>However, I would suggest you to check these MSDN and Windows Help &amp; How-to Reference Articles:

<p>Same problem; This (only this) update (KB4093118) is looping. Ie after successfully installed it keeps insisting that 'There's a new updata available'...</p>
<p>It does not seem able to tell the system that it is actually installed - OR the system believes/tells the user that is is 'successfully installed', although it is not ???</p>
<p>Even after a reboot the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since M$ does not want to hear about bugs (no way of reporting bugs), we'll just have to hope someone knows a proper solution to this problem.</p>
<p>I can only suggest to 'Hide' this update to avoid the issue as a stop-gap solution..</p>

 it would show on my installed updates because I would just uninstall it! FIX IT PLEASE!!!!

<p>Same thing for me... Fresh re-install of Win7 Pro on Dell Inspiron.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same update kb4093118&nbsp;over and over.</p>
<p>Only Partially updated, so I'm vulnerable to ALL the hacks until I get the remaining 500Mb or so of the updates required after a fresh re-install from CD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems unable to hide because even though installed about 10 times, doesn't show upon search.</p>

            That is exactly how it is showing on my computer. I also am having a problem with Intel doing an update and from what I have seen it may be due to the latest update with Google that took place yesterday for me.&nbsp; For the time being I have just put this
 update with windows into my hidden deal for the time being. Seems like that is usually the best thing to do until the issue is fixed. Be pleased you show any progress at all with the download I was not even getting that. It just shows as being installed twice
 and then like you does not show in the download history at all. I even did a restart a few times to see if it was due to just not installing all the way yet.&nbsp;

<p>Have the same issue, it said if I bought the Java edition before a certain date I could get windows 10 version for free, I have had original version since 2010. I clicked redeem on the code it gave me on the website and it looked like it worked. Then I open
 the game and it says sign in, I click on that and it prompts me to buy the game, or on the main screen, it says to unlock the full game. Nothing changed at all from when it was originally on my computer before I redeemed anything? It also says sign in to xbox
 live for free and if I click on that it tells me to buy the game again? I am signed into xbox already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What version of Minecraft did I get for free??? A demo?</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer thumbnail cache keeps being deleted. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ph0b0s123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer thumbnail cache keeps being deleted.</h2>
                    
<p>I know this has been mentioned before, but I wanted to see if any progress had been made for a fix now Win 7 is nearly a year old.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the cache of Windows Explorer thumbnails of all the pictures on my PC gets deleted every day. So every day when I want to look at my picture library I have to wait for Windows to search through and make new thumbnails of all my pictures
 again. Up until now I have been using the work around posted all over the net of denying delete access for all the users on my PC to the appdata/local/microsoft/windows/explorer directory and files contained there. This stops the system processes from deleting
 the files and I get instant display of the thumbnails of my pictures all the time. But this is not a proper solution.<br />
<br />
I was reminded of this problem recently when I reinstalled my OS and forgot to re-apply said work around. I let the latest version of live photo gallery find all the pictures in my library and make thumbnails for them. But the next day it started reprocessing
 them all over again. I then remembered I needed to block access to the directory above as live photo gallery seems to get it's thumbnails from the same cache files as Windows Explorer does.<br />
<br />
Anyway over the past year I have heard various rumors that it was a bug Microsoft was working or that it was intentionally setup this way for some unknown reason. So I wanted to post this up to try and it get finally answered why Windows 7 behaves like this.
 So please can someone from Microsoft let us know what is going on with this issue.<br />
<br />
Also if you same problem, please post in this thread so Microsoft can get an idea of how many people are affected by this. I would post links to all the places I have seen people discussing this problem, but I don't know if that would break any forum rules.
 Also I don;t know if this was the right Windows 7 sub forum to post this issue, so please move it if not.</p>
<p>Thanks....</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but this is not a problem with my program icons. These all display with out problems. The thumbnails that disapear and need to be re scanned by explorer, nearly every day, are the thumbnails of all the photos I have on my PC. And the
 only way to stop this is by changing the permissions to the files in the directory I mentioned above to stop the system deleting the cache files.</p>
<p>I have never had to go near the iconcache.db file and have never had issues wth program icon pictures. If it does not break forums rules I can point out the mutiple places where this is being dicussed by other users having the same issue. And also the many
 windows tweak sites that give the work around to this issue. I am hoping as more time goes on other users will post in this thread to show how many of us are affected.</p>
<p>One place that should not break rules as it is from this forum is here, where the user is having the same problem as me: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wlmedia/threa/1248b2a3-1bd8-4443-a096-68acdcdac5d9</p>

<p>It is extremely frustrating this issue has not been fixed despite having been reported ever since the Windows 7 BETAs/RCs came out. As ph0b0s123 indicates it concerns thumbnails of all files, pictures, videos, music, pdf, office files. It is extremely wasteful
 on energy &amp; resources for the user as COM Surrogate (dllhost.exe) can use over 50% of CPU to regenerate the thumbnails and can take an hour or more of browsing to new folders to make sure all thumbnails are regenerated. The issue is not system specific as
 it occurs on both my Windows 7 laptop &amp; desktop, completely different hardware, and occurs just a day or so after a new install after effort has been made to create thumbnails. The issue is covered on many threads on this forum and others such as these links:</p>

            I agree with all the posts above. This issue has been reported continuously but still no solution in sight. Looks like it will never be resolved as I am yet to see a proper response or acknowledgement for this issue from MS.
<br />
<br />
The issue&nbsp; is that the thumbnail cache file is restricted to a certain size and when it exceeds this size then it deletes the whole file instead of appending to it and recreates the thumbnails . This process is repeated every time the size of the cache file
 exceeds the pre-set limit.<br />
<br />
I have all but given hope for a solution. <br />

            It's only my opinion but I don't think it's a "bug" in the traditional sense.&nbsp; I can't believe MS would ignore something like this for so long if it were a bug.&nbsp; I guess there are people out there who like all their hundreds and thousands of pics displayed
 as img4438.jpg but personally, I think I'm in the majority who want a thumbnail.&nbsp; I doubt there's any point in adding to a list touting unhappiness with this "bug" as I don't think MS has any intention of fixing this.&nbsp; It's either "the way win7 works" and
 can't be changed or MS doesn't want us using thumbnails.&nbsp; Of course that doesn't stop me from saying I'm fairly disappointed and unhappy about this.&nbsp;

            Ye&nbsp;this problem is a real downer. I keep thousands of small videos and pictures and I lose all the thumbnails for every file and everytime it happens I feel so angry because replacing them all across all my mapped drives takes me nearly 2 hours. Why will
 they not fix it or give us control of the size, not that I'd want to delete my cache. The work around worry's me because when I move files there thumbnail will not be able to be deleted by the cache. I just dont get it, they were told about it back in the
 beta but they just dont care. I've just been hit just now and was so fed up I tried to find a viable solution but it's looking grim

The issue only exists when viewing a folder full of anything you'd normally like to view in thumbnail form such as a photo.&nbsp; It's most pronounced when you have many folders with many photos (thumbnails).&nbsp; If you don't have many and indeed if you normally view
 things as a list, you won't run into this issue.&nbsp; As a photographer, even though my computer is blazingly fast, it's still inconvenient to occasionally have to recreate thumbs when opening one of my many folders with hundreds of photos.&nbsp; It's not so bad when
 I'm viewing measly 2-10 meg jpegs but opening a folder with a few hundred tiffs that run 100megs plus can be irritating.&nbsp; I think that's the other issue too in that for many people with simple jpegs, numerous though they may be, are actually relatively small
 files and will recreate quickly.&nbsp; I enjoy thumbing my nose at the MAC people but in this case I'd have to say MS has let me (us) down.<br />

<p>I don't mean any disrespect but if you don't notice this, why are you replying to a thread that is more than three years old?&nbsp; And if you'd read the very first sentence..."The issue only exists when viewing a folder full of anything you'd normally like to
 view in thumbnail form such as a photo", you'd see that this "issue" does not apply to you.&nbsp; I too do not have any problems with anything that's an icon or list name.&nbsp; Try loading your computer with photos (for which thumbnails are infinitely handy), and I
 mean hundreds and thousands and then one day, magically, Win7 has to recreate the thumbs because you've reached some preset number (amount) and you have to sit there and watch them be recreated.&nbsp; Right now I have 14,809 photos in 610 folders totaling 90gigs.&nbsp;
 Just the other day, Win7 decided to make new thumbs.&nbsp; Yippee.&nbsp; Not a problem for piddly jpegs int he 2-20meg range but a pain for those 100-150meg tiffs.&nbsp; I'm glad it's not an issue for you and names are fine.&nbsp; However, those of us who use thumbs, should not
 have to have the computer bogged down now and again to recreate what's already there.&nbsp; I miss XP sometimes.&nbsp;

<br />
If you're referring to the Surface RT, then no, you won't be able to plug in many USB-based microphones, nor will you be able to run Audacity.<br />
<br />
Currently, I record small jams using the Surface RT's built-in microphones. The Pocket Recorder app, available free from the Store, works fine to record in WAV format, which I can then edit on my desktop PC.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for more professional recordings, using a variety of USB microphones and desktop software like Audacity, you'll want the Surface Pro.<br />
<br />
You can check the Surface RT's microphone compatibility here:<br />

 know), so is there any way I can get the info reset or something? The account has been inactive for like 2 years now roughly or something like that and has 0 gamerscore, its obvious no one uses it but how do I fix this? Is it even possible or should I give
 up? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /></p>

<h2>            cyclic redundancy</h2>
                    I am attempting to backup my computer using the wizard.&nbsp; I have vista, 64 bit.&nbsp; I am constantly getting the message "Data error (cyclic redundancy check). (0x80070017)."&nbsp; I have tried using a different DVD for my media to copy the backup to, no change.&nbsp;
 I have tried checking my hard for errors, however that program won't work either, tells me it can't check the drive when it is in use.&nbsp; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Where are you backing up the backup?<br />
2. Has it worked fine earlier?</p>
<p>This error occurs if the hard drive has some errors on it. I would suggest that you run a disk check on the C drive and try the backup again. You can help solve some computer problems
 and improve the performance of your computer by making sure that your hard disk has no errors.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Computer by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, and then clicking <b>Computer</b>.
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Right-click the
<b>hard disk drive</b> that you want to check, and then click <b>Properties</b>.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Click the <b>Tools</b> tab, and then, under <b>Error-checking</b>, click <b>Check Now</b>.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select
<b>Automatically fix file system errors</b>. Otherwise, the disk check will simply report problems but not fix them.<br />
To perform a thorough disk check, select <b>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</b>. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the hard disk itself, and it can take much longer to complete.
<br />
To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both <b>Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</b>.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;Click <b>Start</b>.<br />
Depending upon the size of your hard disk, this may take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it's checking for errors.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available
 on that might be lost.</p>
<p>Refer to the following articles:<br />
<b>Check your hard disk for errors</b><br />
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors</a></b></p>

<p>Damn, I will tell you the full story.<br />
My PC -Accidentally- after booting (W10Logo) show a problem message (actually two), I take a shot of them and will put them here in this post.<br />
To bypass this message I press Enter and the W10Logo appears for half second and message pop again, I press Enter contionsly to successfully boot and open the W.<br />
Today; when I opened my PC; PC shut down. After the W10Logo appear, and i am was in this loop.<br />
So I decided to Setup the W again, I used same W CD and format C and setup windows in it, that is the same thing that I do when setup a W.<br />
Now windows Setup complete "Copying Files" and "get files ready for installation" and other tasks below it, and the W restart to complete the Setup.<br />
After restart and W10Logo the error messages appear.<br />
WHAT CAN I SOLVE THIS PROBLEM!!!!<br />

            I suggest you download, create a new bootable copy then attempt the install again.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<h2>            Printer won&#39;t power up.</h2>
                    I have an HP psc 2110 all-in-one printer. Last week our electricity went out for a day. When the power was restored the printer would not power up when I turned the computer back on.&nbsp; The monitor and the computer both powered up fine, but the printer would
 not turn on.&nbsp; I unplugged it for a while, cleaned it, talked nicely to it......nothing.&nbsp; I am a technology-challenged senior.....&nbsp;Can anyone help me??

<p><br />
It's not a problem that you chose this forum - I was just stepping through the process of figuring out what was wrong logically.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The printer won't even power on - so the first place to go is the manucturer of the hardware - given all that you said you tried already.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Sounds like the power outage/surge that followed may have fried something.&nbsp; I assume you tried it in a different power outlet and such?&nbsp; You also - hopefully - have the entire computer at least on a surge protector if not a Battery-Backed Up Power Supply (UPS)
 with Automatic Votage Regulation (AVR) built in - to protect the equipment plugged into it from such things?&nbsp; (It's worth the investment in most cases.)</p>

<p>UPDATE: Game Informer has more details on the changes that 2K Games will be making to WWE 2K15 now that they have full control over the property. When they acquired the license from THQ last year, the game was too far into production to make many changes.
 The game will be the next-gen debut of the series on the Playstation 4 and Xbox One, along with a release on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Developer Visual Concepts will work with Yukes to have more control this time. It will add the scanning technology it used in the NBA 2K games and already has 90% of the in-game roster scanned in. In an interesting note, the classic version of Hulk Hogan
 is in the game but the current version has been scanned. Other wrestlers in the game include John Cena, Bray Wyatt, Daniel Bryan, AJ Lee, Roman Reigns and Cesaro.</p>
<p>The character models for the wrestlers are a lot closer to real life. Hair, skin, faces and ring gear have been upgraded and more facial expressions have been recorded so wrestlers will have more realistic emotions in the game. A "facial rig demo" for Cena
 showed expressions of "pain, excitement, and exertion".</p>
<p>The goal is to make the game closer to WWE's TV presentation, which means that VC is also trying to make match pacing and flow more realistic. They have a new motion capture studio with an actual WWE ring set up by a real ring technician. This means there
 will be five times the amount of animations in 2K14.</p>
<p>There will be a new cutoff date for WWE content which means the characters and storylines will be closer to current WWE. In other words, it's less likely that someone who has been fired will be in the game and someone who just debuted won't be.</p>
<p>Also read: â€‹Update: The WWE 2K15 Release Date Revealed</p>
<p>Audio is also getting changed with "five times" the sound of the last game. Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole will be recorded at the same time to create more natural conversation. There will be 30-35 hours of commentary per announcer to prevent many repeats.</p>
<p>2K hasn't revealed the theme of the game and it hasn't revealed the gameplay, but that could happen at E3 tomorrow. It will be released on October 28.</p>

    <title>Inaccurate reported screen times for Xbox on Microsoft Family - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pnw gamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inaccurate reported screen times for Xbox on Microsoft Family account...</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having some trouble with reporting of screen time usage for our child using the Microsoft Family account. The issue is that the time reported per day is clearly incorrect/off. For example, yesterday evening he used his Xbox for about 1.5 hours. Today,
 as I write this, he has not used his Xbox at all. Yet when I go to the Family account and click on Activity, down in the section labeled Screen time, it indicates that he had only 2 minutes of usage yesterday (as opposed to about 1.5 hours) and it indicates
 that he had 3 hrs 26 mins of usage today, when in reality he has had none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few details:</p>
<ul>
<li>For his account, under Screen time, we have selected "On" for the Xbox screen time and then for each day we've basically set it up for max hours each day (like from 9am to 9pm). This is because we don't want to impose any specific time limit for any given
 day. Instead, we simply want (both us and him) to be able to see reports of how much time he's spending per day on the Xbox. On that same page, under PC screen time, we have that set to "Off." So again, the reporting should be just for Xbox, as far as I understand
 it.</li><li>All of the reported 3 hrs 26 mins for today is shown to be attributed to the Xbox, so it's not like that's coming from some other device that he's using.</li></ul>
<p>I signed into the Xbox to confirm that it had the right date/time...which it does. I also confirmed that it has the latest updates (it's set to automatically install any updates and indicates that it was last checked just yesterday night).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any suggestions/help. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Toshiba Flash Cards Utility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmbrendon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Flash Cards Utility</h2>
                    <p>So I recently deleted Toshiba's Flash Card Utility from my All-in-One LX835-D3203 PC, and quickly realized it was a mistake. I was unable to change the brightness of the display using the F2 and F3 keys. I tried going on the Toshiba support page to redownload
 the software, but the website seems to be out of date. After inputting my serial number and then asked for my operating system, Windows 10 Home is NOT an option. Furthermore, even if I put Windows 8.1, the Toshiba Flash Card Utility is not present in the entire
 list of software. I've tried looking through forums, but could not find a single download page or another person with similar issues. Downloads of the Toshiba Flash Card Utility from other websites are also outdated and not for Windows 10 (if they even are
 safe). Please, if possible, HELP ME!<br />
</p>
<p>P.S. I can't even change the display brightness in the windows display options for some reason. Yes, I am on the latest version of Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I Just got a new xbox one. I would like to recover my old xbox gamertag. I can still access it on my old xbox, however the email for that gamertag has been lost years ago. I have no way of recovering this email. However i still have the only xbox this gamer
 tag has logged in with. Also i haven't been an active xbox live user since 2010. Is it still possible for me to recover my old gamertag?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disabling Auto Restarts for Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylor.reisdorf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling Auto Restarts for Updates</h2>
                    <p>When I bought a new computer, I had Windows installed for several reasons. Absolutely nowhere in that list was there to be found "So that Microsoft can **** up my work by restart my machine on me to complete updates when I've had to attend to something for
 five minutes too long". This has happened more than once, and I am officially fed up. I'm talking really, really fed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I was able to set the updates menu such that it required my authorization to restart. That option seems to have disappeared, and I cannot find where it has gone. Wherever I look for an answer, I seem to be told that the option has been removed
 for non-Pro versions, which can still circumvent this through modifying group policy. One acquaintance tells me it was done because Microsoft was experiencing security problems due to people not updating. Frankly, I care more about my great-aunt's itchy place
 than I do about Microsoft exposing themselves to security breaches because they designed a shoddy product. Neither Microsoft's inadequacies, nor any other excuse, are sufficient to move me from my belief that I--and I alone!--should be in control of my own
 damn computer. That also means that the pathetic conciliatory gesture of giving me "Active Hours" is not going to fly. I want full control of my computer again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am with a last-ditch attempt to get a satisfactory resolution to this. If anyone can direct me to where I can re-enable the requirement for Microsoft to obtain my permission to restart, please do so. At this point, I am open to going into the registry
 and manually adjusting stuff. I've already futzed around with some of Windows' back-end stuff; after I lost a bunch of work earlier I finally just went into Services and outright disabled the Windows Update service! It's not my idea of a permanent solution
 (now I won't get everything else automatically updated either) but, as I have been explicitly clear already, I am fed up. I am fed up of Microsoft cramming half-baked products down our throats. I am fed up of Microsoft putting us through **** to solve their
 screw ups. I am fed up of losing my damn work because Microsoft are a bunch of megalomaniac cretins who feel entitled to turning my computer off without my permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nobody has a solution to this, I am switching to Linux. Microsoft will have finally driven me away from their product with their aggressive automatic processes. I'll never buy another Microsoft product again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm having this issue as well. I think it's a major step back in reliability, I can no longer trust my Windows system to simply keep running and keep my data safe. It seems absurd that there's no proper way to disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, I disabled the Windows Update service under Services. I don't like this solution (no more updates at all) but it's less bad than the system restarting when I don't want it to.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in my original post, disabling Windows Update in the Services menu was my short-term solution, as well. I had really sincerely hoped that a more permanent option would be possible, but I spent 50 minutes talking to Microsoft's support team
 today and, though they weren't happy that I had chosen this route, they didn't have anything better and confirmed for me that this would, indeed, 100% prevent unwanted restarts from occurring again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also shared with me that I was not the first person to call about this, and my frustrations at Microsoft hijacking my computer were shared by many. The developers are apparently aware of the issue and are planning to come out with a solution. Unfortunately,
 the support team were unable to give me a time frame in which we could expect the restoration of authorization-only restarts, or even if it's scheduled for the next major update that Microsoft will be releasing.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Alright, I had a 50-minute phone call with Microsoft's support team today, and I have the following to share:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands now, the "solution" is to simply disable all updates from Windows (like I mentioned I had done in my original post). To do this on Windows 10's home version (i.e. non-Pro version), follow the following steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Access the "Services" menu by typing "services" into Cortana. It is classified as a desktop app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Scroll down to find "Windows Update".</p>
<p>3. Right-click, select "Disable".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will 100% prevent any updates from being downloaded from Microsoft's servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to do this, I highly recommend that you pay attention to the release notes for Microsoft's updates, especially where you have updates to virus definitions and bug fixes. Periodically, you should re-enable Windows Update to allow Microsoft to
 send you these updates, which are actually important. You can re-disable Windows Update after that information has been received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A final note to the developers: **** you. **** you for sabotaging my livelihood by forcing automatic restarts and making me lose valuable work. **** you for making your customers suffer for your inadequacies. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I don't
 foresee myself ever purchasing another Microsoft product because of the complete and utter lack of respect you have demonstrated for your customers with this ****.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you promptly resolve this by restoring my ability to determine exactly how and when updates are administered on my computer, I know now that you have no qualms with simply overriding my wishes when you think you can get away with it. You've destroyed
 any assurance I had that you would not abuse the back door access you have to my computer through the presence of your operating system. You have crossed a line in this matter and I will not forget it. Stay the **** off my computer unless you have my express
 permission to do whatever it is you want to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>After the recent update I was forced to kill any and all updates thru services... The forced update they hit me with 6 days ago accomplished one thing for me at least. &nbsp;I have 2 sizable paperweights now. &nbsp;lol</p>

            <p>Simply setting a time that Microsoft is allowed to turn off my PC without my express authorization is a concession I am unwilling to make. It isn't a matter of when a Windows Update can automatically restart my computer, it's a matter of if, and I absolutely
 refuse to allow it. Nobody but me should ever be able to restart my computer. And that's final. End of story. No debate.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My friend you are preaching to the Choir...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We no longer have any say at all over what is installed on the computers we have built, and streamline in most cases, that duty now falls solely on the mighty shoulders of Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly I was just curious if those options were there in Home. and I didn't understand your point on top of it.. I thought you just wanted to delay the restarts and were somehow content to have such an intrusive software dictate what, when, where, and
 how your pc runs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious since we already kicked the nest anyway.. Did you take a look at the &nbsp;Adjust the hours you pc is Active section??? &nbsp;in case you haven't I won't ruin it for you. Humor me tho and go there when you are able and set your active hours to something
 like Active hours from 9AM to 1AM. &nbsp;You should get a kick out of that little goodie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About half of the software that I use on a daily basis only runs on MS OS.. One very kind tech, during one of the recent phone conversations regarding my paperweights, had the nerve to tell me "Well we are not forcing you to use or own any of our products,
 If you are unwilling to upgrade your GTX 980 gfx card and use only the windows antiV and Fwall then you should move on to some other OS." &nbsp; &nbsp; Those are the moments in life that make me feel warm and cuddly inside. &nbsp;(sorry for the wall of text I'm bored and
 avoiding some work lol)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take care Mate??? &nbsp;sorry I am unaware of your gender so don't take offence.. you can call me anything you like if I just offended u..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANYWHO.. Best of luck T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Can we get an AMEN? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are hundreds upon hundreds of posts from people who have had their work put on hold. their computers turned to trash, and their time wasted in their attempts to get some viable support from Mircosoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe they should change whatever it is they are feeding the monkeys who test these updates out??</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all know that now that they have control of everyone's comps, their policies sure as **** wont be changing so that solution is out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** maybe they should have 24/7 support for their broken **** intrusive life controlling software. &nbsp;I mean a multi billion dollhair company could surely afford to support their own damn mistakes I mean products. &nbsp;TO the moron that is about to type that
 there is 24/7 support.. You are wrong unless you enjoy PAYING for tryin to fix a MS faux paux. &nbsp;OR of course if you happen to be disabled. NOT disabled disabled.. they only assist those using special equipment.. (there has been one exception to that rule)
 if you have seizures.. they politely suggest that you not take up the place of those in need of their service. &nbsp;I almost understand that one honestly, not quite since the main help desk hangs up on your **** if you fail to answer in XX time allotted due to
 a mild seizure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>LAST THING.. &nbsp;when I ask for a tech 3 so that we are on the same page and they are less likely to take the most difficult path possible to access things I have set up to do in one push of a button, where are they???? &nbsp;There is no need for me to call in or
 chat with someone who is reading from, and bound to, a list of options. &nbsp;I have already done those.. and more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK.. off the soap box.. it's all your fault you know lol..</p>

            <p>I believe I mentioned in my original post that the "Active Hours" feature was useless, that my problem wasn't when Microsoft was turning my computer off without my permission, it was that they were doing it at all. I don't have set active hours... I do a
 lot of work from home and so I may be on at 8 am one day or as late as 4 am another night. It is simply unacceptable to me that, at any time of any day under any circumstances, Microsoft can decide "hey, this update is important, so while you're not looking
 I'm going to shut off your computer and **** up your day".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply cannot fathom how they could possibly have ever considered this to be a reasonable feature to push on their customers. True, some programs like Chrome and Word will recover where you were, but if I am following something on a YouTube video in a
 program that isn't one of the select handful which saves my progress and opens up again where I left off with all the data saved, then I'm ****. And it's happened more than once. And I've had it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am almost tempted to demand compensation from Microsoft for this. I've submitted projects late twice now because I had to redo hours of work as a result of Microsoft's ****. Windows is supposed to be a reliable service, and I purchased it with a number
 of expectations that are not at all unreasonable. They are simply: run the programs that I need, save my data, and don't **** up my work. One out of three is a **** travesty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least the guy I spoke with apologised to me for this, not like your tech support guy who essentially told you "thanks for giving us a couple hundred dollars for this program; we're just going to take that money and run". Were I in your position, I would
 have escalated that all the way to the top. That ****-head's boss' boss' boss would have heard from me. As it stands, they recorded my phone call with my very, very strong opinions about the changes to the automatic update process and the judgement (or lack
 thereof) displayed by Microsoft to push them onto customers like this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to have some city zoning changes done of the area around the lead dev's house--behind closed doors--so that, when they're out at work one day, I can come by with a bulldozer and drive through their house to clear a path for a new freeway. Hey--it's
 important, so **** you and your say in it!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think I may have a possible solution. The idea is to create a script sets the active hours to go from 1 hour in the past to 11 hours in the future and run it every hour so that there is never a time outside the active hours window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I have no relationship with Microsoft, that this is <strong>UNTESTED
</strong>and there are <strong>NO GUARANTEES</strong> of any kind. Also note that you will be responsible yourself to find a good time to restart and install updates.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>St</strong><strong>ep 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a script named C:\Scripts\SetActiveHours.ps1 with the following contents:</p>
<p>
</p><p>$time = (Get-Date).Hour<br />
$timeStart = ($time + 23) % 24<br />
$timeEnd = ($time + 11) % 24<br />
$regPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings"<br />
New-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "ActiveHoursStart" -Value $timeStart -PropertyType DWORD -Force<br />
New-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "ActiveHoursEnd" -Value $timeEnd -PropertyType DWORD -Force</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the task scheduler (simply open the start menu and type its name)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Actions menu on the right, click "Create Task"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the General tab:</p>
<p>Name: SetActiveHours<br />
Run whether user is logged on or not<br />
Run with highest privileges<br />
<br />
On the Triggers tab:</p>
<p>Create a new trigger with "Daily" and "Repeat task every 1 hour" set<br />
<br />
On the Actions tab:<br />
Create a new action like this:<br />
Program/script: c:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe<br />
Add arguments: -executionpolicy Unrestricted -file c:\Scripts\SetActiveHours.ps1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Confirm with ok</p>

 have a look at it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use AHK for most things.. or one of my keyboard/mouse programmables for the ones that i repeat hundreds of times per day. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I plug in my sidewinder 3d pro (with a gameport to usb adapter) "unknown device" shows up in my devices and printers (windows 7). &nbsp;How do I get windows 7 to recognize it as a joystick so that I can use it?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Does this happen only with the sidewinder 3d pro?</div>
</li><li>
<div>Does the computer&nbsp;detect other USB devices?</div>

<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the device troubleshooter and check.</p>

            Yes it only happens with the sidewinder 3d pro, it detects other USB devices fine. &nbsp;When using the hardware and devices troubleshooter it says "problem detected with unknown device." When you click "view details" it opens an "unknown device properties"
 window with a device status of "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)." When you click next back in the hardware and devices window it says: "Problems found: Unknown device is not working properly , Hardware changes might
 not have been detected"
<div>Method 2 gave me basically the same results as method 1 but with an additional web browser opening for Microsoft fix it online which gave a solution of: "
<span>
Welcome back to Fix it Online. Unfortunately this page has expired</span>&nbsp;."</div>
<div><br />
<div>In terms of downloading the latest driver, windows 7 should do that automatically, especially since the joystick was manufactured by microsoft. &nbsp;The closest driver for this joystick is for windows 95/98 and isn't compatible with windows 7.</div>
