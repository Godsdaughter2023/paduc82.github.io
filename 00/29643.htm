<h2>            Error code 0x80073CF0 on Microsoft Store Windows 10 app install</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 home, 64-bit OS, on a Dell laptop. &nbsp;This is a new install (not an upgrade from earlier OS) on a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I attempt to install the Facebook app from the Microsoft Store, I get the same error message shortly after the app begins to download: &nbsp;"Try that again. &nbsp;Something went wrong. &nbsp;The error code is 0x80073CF0, in case you need it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to successful download/install/run every other app I've tried from the Microsoft Store, without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything recommended in posts about this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Windows and Store updates have been installed.</p>
<p>I manually deleted the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution/DeliveryOptimization folder.</p>
<p>I used admin PowerShell to uninstall and reinstall the Store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing worked. &nbsp;So I'd appreciate advice that doesn't involve resetting the PC to factory OS and starting over. &nbsp;That's way too much rework for something that is clearly a Microsoft OS/Store problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <span>Microsoft posted several times all over that soon Microsoft switch to Windows 10 and until July 29, we can upgrade it free.</span>
<p><span>One of my friends upgraded and said that PC starts run faster and better.She had Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Therefore, I decided to do it too but I have Windows 7</span></p>

</p><p>1. Can you tell me what Version &amp; Build of Windows Live Mail is installed (e.g.,
<strong>Version 2011 Build 15.3.9876.5432</strong>)?</p>

</p><ul>
<li>With Windows Live Mail open, execute keyboard shortcut <strong>Alt+F+B</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2. Assuming you're only accessing a Outlook.com/Hotmail account in Windows Live Mail, can you delete the contents of the

https://outlook.com</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When you run a manual check for updates, are any updates offered (e.g., KB3160005; KB3161608)&nbsp;and if so, will they successfully install?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I worked through the firmware update, deleted and reinstalled the camera app, deleted and reinstalled the drivers for both cameras, and did all the other steps recommended here and in the many other places where this issue is being complained about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ultimate resolution: I actually used the Microsoft tech support chat feature and allowed the tech to remote into my Surface. I wasn't able to follow all the steps (in part because I didn't understand some of them), but the tech edited my registry, installed
 at least two new MSI packages, and restarted the thing twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it breaks again, I'll have to go back to support, because as far as I can tell there is no published solution to this problem anywhere on the web.</p>

People, I installed the Bradesco Exclusive Browser application on my PC. But it does not open. I've done the install and reinstall procedure several times and the application does not open.<br />

I spoke with the support of the technical area of Bradesco and they say that there is nothing wrong with the application, and that the problem must be in my Windows.<br />

I am using Windows 7, original from the factory, and it installs the file but can not open. Would anyone have a solution to such a problem? Have you ever had a similar problem with the application?<br />

 ****. I want a clear answer, as to how I remove the write protection from a folder. If I do it from the settings, it just reverts itself back.

<p>Hi EliaHanin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modifying changes in permissions with folders and files requires you being logged in to your administrator account to ensure it will be saved. To help you remove the write protection from folders, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>File Explorer</strong> on the search bar then click on the folder you need to change permissions to.
</li><li>On the menu, click on <strong>Share </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced security </strong>

<h2>            Microsoft Paid Support</h2>
                    <p>I have had MS Paid Support for a few years, and I've recently had awful support! Is there anything I can do to get good PAID support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After MS tech installing a new "iso" win7 operating system on my pc, because I couldn't defrag.</p>
<p>THEN....</p>
<p>1. I couldn't backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Tech told me to "take it to the nearest computer store, find out what's wrong with it, call him back, and he'd fix it"!
</p>
<p>&nbsp; (I figured out how to fix it myself)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Then, the Task Scheduler is "corrupted", 1st tech hung up on me, (He didn't know what a Task Scheduler was..I even had to SPELL it)</p>
<p>&nbsp;2nd tech tried, then said she couldn't fix it, and would make me an appointment 2 dys later with upper level tech, after leaving me with a miss .dll file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; So, any suggestions on who to call or how to fix a corrupt TS? I've goggled till my eyes are crossed! :)</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>I understand that you're frustrated.&nbsp; Most of the people who respond here, including me, are not associated with Microsoft.&nbsp; We're just users of Windows -- like you -- who volunteer to try to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you certain that the tech support you've paid for is actually from Microsoft?&nbsp; How do you get in touch with them (what's the phone number or web site)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the problem with Backup and how did you fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are your actual symptoms of the supposedly corrupt Task Scheduler?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What DLL file are you missing (and how do you know that)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get any error messages, please provide both the complete text of the error message(s) and a detailed description of what you do to cause the error to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What edition of Windows 7 do you have?&nbsp; If you're not sure, press the "Windows Logo" key and the "Pause/Break" key simultaneously.&nbsp; Include whether you have Service Pack 1 and whether your system is 32-bit or 64-bit.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how I fixed backup, but I did, finally.</p>
<p>The # I call is:&nbsp; 800-642-7676, and was later given a "direct number" of 866-425-8809.</p>
<p>I have windows Home Premium 7 64 bit.</p>
<p>After they installed the "iso" file, the Task Scheduler was totally corrupted., so, last night, someone accessed my pc, deleted a lot of TS files in Regedit, couldn't fix another problem that popped up, (a "Conduit" file)...so, he created a new Users ID
 for me..copied a lot of things to it.</p>
<p>Today, ALL of my emails/contacts/folders, etc. in Live Mail were gone in the new Users ID.&nbsp; Another person logged into my pc, and SOMEHOW ended up associating MULTIPLE files on my pc with a program called "Express Burn Disc Burning"!!!!!...SO, I have now
 gone back to the original Users ID, and can access everything. I still have an error message of "missing conduit/background container.dll...but, I'm SO DONE with MS Paid Support. Oh, I should mention the guy who somehow associated most of my program extensions
 with the Express Burn Disc program sent me to "Windows Support", who never answered, and I hung up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF I knew Win10 would be a good OS, I'd buy a new PC and get it, but from the reviews I've read, it's not even as good as Win7.&nbsp; So, I'm basically in a catch 22!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm 70 years old, and I'm pretty computer literate, but some of this stuff is way over my head. I felt obligated to update you, as you were nice enough to respond. Thanks so much for your concern.</p>

<p>That does seem to be Microsoft paid tech support.&nbsp; Sorry it hasn't worked for you.&nbsp; You might consider calling back, escalating up two or three levels and complaining.&nbsp; You paid for support and your computer seems to be in worse shape than before they started
 "fixing" it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is largely supported by non-Microsoft volunteers, including those who have "MVP" or "Community Moderator" next to their names.&nbsp; Most of the folks with "Microsoft" next to their names are employees of third-party organizations that have contracted
 with Microsoft to supply "support agents."&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the non-Microsoft volunteers here have far more experience with Microsoft's products than the paid "support agents"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Conduit" is malware that infected your computer.&nbsp; See for example:&nbsp; <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Conduit-browser-hijacker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Conduit-browser-hijacker</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What are you using as an antivirus program?&nbsp; Do you have any other "security" software installed (if so, what is it)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>An "iso" file is an image of a CD or DVD.&nbsp; In the context of repairing Windows issues, this usually is an image of the Windows installation CD/DVD and is usually used to completely re-install of Windows.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the person who used the ISO
 file actually did a complete re-install, that should not have resulted in any Task Scheduler issues and certainly should have removed Conduit and any other malware you picked up.&nbsp; Thus, it's not clear at all what was done here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, if someone decides that a problem is caused by a "corrupt profile," the usual solution is to create a new profile and copy over the data.&nbsp; Email often doesn't get copied properly unless the person doing it knows how to specifically deal with it.&nbsp;
 See, for example, the unnumbered paragraph at the end of the directions here:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, is everything working properly except for the error message about the missing DLL file?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this error message pop up when you start the computer?&nbsp; </li><li>If not, when does the error message appear?</li><li>What is the complete text of the message?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>[<em>I forgot about &lt;&lt;associating MULTIPLE files on my pc with a program called "Express Burn Disc Burning"&gt;&gt;.&nbsp; I'll deal with that at the end of this post</em>]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming everything's OK but for this error, that message means that something -- probably your antivirus program -- has removed the Conduit malware but left behind an entry in the Registry that is attempting to start it.&nbsp; Usually, it's pretty easy to deal
 with this situation, but from what I've read, Conduit may have embedded itself deeply into your computer and so I may have to refer you to people who specialize in malware removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download Autoruns:&nbsp; https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns</li><li>Extract the contents of the Zip file -- right-click &gt; Extract All</li><li>Right-click on Autoruns64.exe and select "Run as administrator" ... respond as needed to the UAC prompt</li><li>When the scan is completed, select the "Logon" tab and look in the "Image Path" column for any instance of the DLL mentioned in the error message</li><li>If you find a line that mentions the rogue DLL file, UNcheck the box at the left.&nbsp; The nice thing about Autoruns is that if unchecking an item causes problems, you can just run Autoruns again and check the box; this is better than deleting something until
 you're really sure that it should be gone.</li><li>If there was no line in the "Logon" tab that refers to the bad DLL file, select the "Everything" tab, select "Entry" and then Find (or press CTRL+F) and search for the name.&nbsp; Be careful:&nbsp; unchecking or deleting items shown in the Logon tab is relatively
 safe but unchecking or deleting items elsewhere may cause serious problems; don't make a change to an item unless you know what it is.&nbsp; If you right-click on any line in Autoruns, you'll see some options that can help you research items.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to files that are associated with the disc burning program, the easiest way to fix that is to right-click on one of the files and select "Open with &gt; Chose default program..." and then select the program you want to use from the list.&nbsp; Be sure
 that the box to "Always use the selected program to open this type of file" is checked and then click OK.&nbsp; It's a bit odd that a Microsoft tech would have installed a third-party application like "Express Burn," given that Windows 7 can burn CDs and DVDs on
 its own.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span> and check if the issue persists.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />

            <span>You can change your password to something you will remember from another administrative user's account. If you only had one administrative user account and you've forgotten the password, all is not lost. You might then want
 to follow the general recommendations for setting up user accounts in Windows 7 that I'll give you at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place) is the better solution for
 you.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [press Enter]<br />
net user [insert your user account's name here] [insert new user password like 1234 here] [press Enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Remove the installation DVD and reboot the computer. Now you will be able to log into your user account using the password you set; i.e., 1234.</span><span>[Note: Some people have reported that this doesn't work for them. I've never had
 a problem doing this but if you are unable to change your own account's password this way simply log into the built-in Administrator account which you have just enabled. There will be an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen now. From there you can
 go to Control Panel&gt;User Accounts and change or remove your own account's password.]</span><br />
<span><br />
If you don't have a Windows 7 installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Windows 7 System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe
 Mode. Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Windows 7 Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</a><br />
<span><br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client
 will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. If you are creating the bootable DVD in an older operating system (XP, Vista), you will need to use third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a>
 ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively.<br />
<br />
Once you have fixed things, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges in Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult.&nbsp;</span> <span>
It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more than you want to do. Better not to put yourself into a bad situation to begin with.</span><span><br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Send E-mails Using My Sbcglobal.net Account</h2>
                    I am not able to send e-mails using my sbcglobal.net account with Windows.&nbsp; However, I am able to receive them.&nbsp; I went to the Geek Squad today to see if they could solve the problem and they told me that they have had seven similar requests in the last
 two days.&nbsp; They gave me the telephone number for Microsoft support as they said it is a Microsoft problem.&nbsp; The tech at Microsoft installed all of the available updates hoping this would work, but it didn't.&nbsp; He then gave me the link to this forum.&nbsp; Please
 note that I have sent e-mails with this account for the past six months.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to solve this problem?

    <title>Power profiles not working correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acecoolie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power profiles not working correctly</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 2 running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Microsoft includes 3 power profiles by default: &nbsp;Power saver, Balanced, and High Performance. &nbsp;In testing these profiles, there is a significant difference in performance and battery life. &nbsp;When creating new
 profiles or editing existing ones, there are a number of parameters and each one includes the setting for "On Battery" and "Plugged In". &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I want is to use the Power saver profile when on battery and the High Performance profile when plugged in. &nbsp;Since I don't see a way to switch profiles automatically (Third party software such as Battery Bar Pro can do this but I've ruled it out for
 other reasons), I am attempting to create a single power profile that uses the settings from Power Saver for "On Battery" and the settings from High Performance for "Plugged in". &nbsp;This is not working as expected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When creating a new profile, you are first asked which existing profile you would like it based on. &nbsp;I choose the Power Saver. &nbsp;Then, I manually edited the "Plugged in" options to match those of the High Performance profile. &nbsp;When I plug in my tablet and
 click on the battery in the notification area, I get a little popup with a warning that my current settings may impact system performance. &nbsp;To verify this, I ran the NovaBench Benchmark. &nbsp;Even though the tablet is plugged in and should be using high performance
 settings, the benchmark score is the same as running in the Power Saver profile.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The next test I performed was to create a new profile based on High Performance. &nbsp;Again, I manually configured the "On Battery" parameters to the same values as the Power Saver profile. &nbsp;This time, when clicking on the battery icon in the notification
 area, I don't get any warning about system performance but if I unplug power, I get a warning that my current settings are affecting my battery life.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It appears to me that the power profiles affect more items than those available in the advanced options because changing them doesn't fully affect system performance. &nbsp;How are we supposed to create a single profile that gives the longest battery life yet
 the highest performance when plugged in?</div>
                </div>

            <div>I'm doing this from the desktop. &nbsp;I'm using the NovaBench benchmark version 3.0.4 from novabench.com. &nbsp;I'm running all the tests and getting a single final score. &nbsp;I then repeat the process with a different power profile selected. &nbsp;The runtimes were determined
 by running a number of my common apps like twitter, a slide show, and some browsers etc. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>NovaBench scores:</div>
<div>High Performance = 606 &nbsp;Runtime = Few hours, never tested</div>
<div>Power Saver = 356 &nbsp;Runtime = 7 hours</div>
<div>Balance = 605 &nbsp;Runtime = 5.75 hours</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Balance Profile has the speed I want when plugged in but the battery life isn't as long as the Power saver Profile. &nbsp;The Power Saver Profile has the longest battery but the performance plugged in isn't good. &nbsp;What I'm trying to achieve is a single
 profile to combine those scores.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used to use Battery Bar Pro. &nbsp;This nice little utility showed the charge/discharge rates and estimated run times etc. as well as let you select which power profile to use when plugged in or on battery. &nbsp;I configured it to use the High Performance profile
 when I plugged it in and switch to power saver when unplugged. &nbsp;This worked fine except I found that Battery Bar Pro itself caused battery drain by running its processes in the background constantly checking the battery etc. &nbsp;With power saver installed, my
 max batter with the Power saver profile was about 6.5 hours. &nbsp;With it removed, I get 7 hours.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This lead me to try and create my own profile as I described in my first post. &nbsp;If I create a profile based on power saver but change all the plugged in settings to values for best performance, I still get the speed of the power saver profile and I get
 a warning when I first click on the battery icon in the notification area that my current profile settings are affecting performance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I go the other route and create a new profile based on High Performance but alter the On Battery settings, I still get fast speed but the battery life is shorter than the Power Saver profile and when I click on the icon in the notification area, I'm
 warned that my current setting may impact battery life.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I create a profile based on Balanced, I seem to get good performance but not as good battery life and also no warnings.</div>
<div><br />

            <p><span><span>The power profiles have hidden effects that are not visible in advanced settings and cannot be changed by a standard user action. New, custom profiles inherit that behavior, so
 you have to choose wisely on which of the three default profiles you’re going to base a new one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Power Saver will always strangle the computer (or device) dramatically, no matter how one has set the visible advanced settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>High Performance is always eager to ramp up performance even for minor background ‘noise’, no matter the visible advanced settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Balanced performs okay, but does not ramp up performance as eagerly as HiPerf, no matter the visible advanced settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don’t know at the moment of possible registry tweaks to overcome these built-in limitations, though there might likely be some.</span></span></p>

                    <p>i'm have a similar issue i get this &nbsp;"preparing automatic repair&gt; flash screen looks like cmd prompt very quickly can't even properly see it it comes and goes so fast &gt; diagnosing your pc &gt; repairing files (or some phrase very similar). This could take up
 to an hour to complete " then after going through the "repairing file"s process it shuts down, reboots, and says "stop code: unmountable boot volume" shuts down reboot &nbsp;and starts again with the preparing automatic repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of this started last night after windows update said it need to restart my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never get the screen with the "automatic repair" with the two buttons that say "restart" and "advanced options" - it just tries to automatic repair on it's own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can't use installation media either because the windows iso for my win10 system and build is too large for my blank 700mb cd-r and &nbsp;it's too big for my 1 gb usb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried using f2 and changing the boot up sequence</p>
<p>i tried using f12 to boot for the onboard nic rather than the internal hdd</p>
<p>i tried f12 and running diagnostics - that told my pc had no problems</p>
<p>wanted to use f12 to boot via safe mode -but safe mode isn't listed under f12</p>
<p>
</p><p>i saw on line that people of have f5, f8, or f11 to get into their computers so i tried repeating tapping on f5, f8, &amp; f11 &nbsp;on various reboots when my pc is on the intel loading screen - nothing happens my pc just acts like i never pressed anything<br />

            <p>Hi Ziana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you made any changes to the system prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try performing a startup repair using an installation media and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Follow the steps given below:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>Download the media creation tool and then run it. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Create installation media for another PC</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit). </p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <span>Finish</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<span>Next</span>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Repair your computer</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Choose an option</span> screen, select <span>Troubleshoot &gt;</span><span>Advanced options</span> &gt;<span>Startup repair</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>However, if you can get to the login screen, you can click the power button, hold the shift button and click restart. This will take you to the recovery environment. From there, continue with step 9.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>I had just plugged in a brand new external Bluetooth adapter, and it was in the middle of installing it's drivers and needed materials when windows update told me it needed to restart my PC. I told it I would restart later. I did restart my PC after the
 Bluetooth device finished it's work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I may know why the PC is messing up, but I need to be able to access my "device manager" and "programs and features" in order to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better yet if I could access the "automatic repair" screen I could use the "Advanced Options" button and restore my PC to an earlier point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and extracted the Win10_1607_Korean_x64.iso because it's the one Windows/Microsoft said I needed. Since at the time of the windows update, and rebooting my PC -- my PC's primary language was Korean -- something I setup a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know others got the same error, however, after getting the "preparing automatic repair" and "diagnosing your PC" screen I saw that they get an "automatic repair" screen, but I never get the "Automatic Repair". It goes from&nbsp;"diagnosing your pc" &nbsp;to "repairing
 disk files. this may take up to an hour to complete" after this is reboots says "stop code: unmountable boot volume" reboots, and I'm back at "preparing automatic repair" and the process repeatedly repeats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: I've had Windows 10 build 14393 for about a month, before that I had Windows 10 build 10586 for about 2 months.</p>

            <p>I have the ISO file that I downloaded onto an external hard drive "E:". I have the Win10_1607_Korean_x64.iso . Original Windows Anniversary updated my Windows 10 build 10586 to build 14393 using Win10_1607_English_x64.iso (I'm guessing since this is how
 the Korean ISO is labelled)&nbsp;but i changed my primary display language, time format, and date format to Korean&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a reminder the PC in question is currently stuck in an infinite loop of "Preparing Automatic Repair" &gt; "Diagnosing Your PC" &gt; "Repairing Disk Files" &gt; reboot &gt; "Stop Code: Unmountable Boot Volume" &gt; reboot &gt; &nbsp;and repeat</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to find a DVD disk or USB flash drive big enough to burn the ISO file onto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to reinstall Windows 10, I really just want to get to a point where I can restore my PC to an earlier point (yesterday morning (8/22/2016), or the day before (8/21/2016)).</p>

            <p>Actually, this is what happened to me on a laptop, using the Anniversary Edition.</p>
It does not even log or get to the safe mode.
<p>Too bad a USB or DVD made with the media creation tool can't upgrade an offline OS.</p>
<p>There is no hope to fix it, just re-installing it.</p>
<p>The poorest experience ever.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>NVIDIA nForce 10/100/1000 is a wire network card (you need a cable).</p>
<p><strong>Most Laptops have a physical switch for the Wireless card. Read the computer's manual and make sure that the Wireless card is On.</strong></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you receive error while opening GIF files. I will be glad to assist you with your query. However, let me ask you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which Internet Explorer version are you using?</li><li>When was the last time you were able to open GIF files?</li><li>Did you make any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>Check to see if you have enabled to play animated .gif in Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
To enable animated GIFs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Select "<strong>Internet Options</strong>" from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab</p>
<p>Scroll down to the Multimedia section, check the "<strong>Play Animations</strong>" option and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, close Internet Explorer, re-launch and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, try performing system restore and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose the date from the restore points&nbsp;list to a date when you think you were able to launch GIF files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform system restore, refer to the article: </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>System Restore</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> <span>
<em>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know the result, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The version of IE I'm using is 8.0.7601.17514.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The last time I was able to open GIF files without this error was maybe a week or a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The most I can think is that I upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Professional.</p>

            It is not specific to any ONE .GIF file, but this only happens on .GIF files, period. The reason I use IE to open GIFs is because it will display animated GIFs, unlike Windows Photo Viewer.

    <title>Network Discovery Not Working after Upgrade to 1511 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Network Discovery Not Working after Upgrade to 1511</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">
<p>Since upgrading my 4 PC's on my private LAN to 10586, Network Discovery will now
<strong>only work on one computer</strong>. &nbsp;Interestingly it's always the <strong>
first one that I switch</strong> on after they're all switched off - so I can move the problem at will. &nbsp;They are all configured exactly the same and are members of a Homegroup. &nbsp;There are no protocols missing or options not set - in fact everything worked
 fine before this upgrade. &nbsp;I can still network by using the path and a password, but this then gets lost on a reboot and I have to do it all over again - very annoying. &nbsp;I have done all the usual things like deleting network drivers and reinstalling, &nbsp;checking
 all the settings, &nbsp;making sure all the appropriate services are started etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution to this yet?</p>

            Network discovery is on on all the computers and I have already set up a new Homegroup. &nbsp;That's not the problem - everything is set up exactly as it should be. &nbsp;The peculiar thing is that if I turn off all the computers, the one I then turn on first works
 just fine and discovers everything I've shared on the others as well as the Homegroup shares. &nbsp;I can do this with any of them - the problem is that only one PC works - the one I turn on first. &nbsp;This only started happening straight after the 1511 upgrade.

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the netcfg -d on all 4 computers and it hasn't fixed anything. &nbsp;The same is happening as before - if I turn off all the computers, then the first one I turn back on is able to see all the others on the network as I switch them on, &nbsp;but the others
 don't see anything except perhaps just one other PC occasionally and sometimes themselves. &nbsp;When they can see another PC in the network and I try to access it, it gives me a network error saying it can't access the device - when I click diagnose it finds nothing,
 but then I can access the other computer. &nbsp;If I try again in a few minutes I have to do it all again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has to be a bug in 1511 as it was all working fine until the November upgrade. &nbsp;I also see that there are a number of people with the same or similar issues on forums around the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks John</p>

            <p>I agree "has to be a bug in 1511".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 computers (2 are running Win8.1 and the third has had Windows 10 for several months.).&nbsp; My Win10 machine will not recognize ANY network attached drives, while my Win8.1 systems are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored my Win10 system to an image from before the 1511 update and all of my NAS drives connected fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bob Pritchard</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;&lt; Postscript&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After messing with this all day yesterday, I took a break for Dinner.&nbsp; When I returned an hour later, my NAS drives had been discovered on my Win10 (1511) system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further testing reveals that if a DRIVE is mapped to any share, this is immediately available on a reboot, but the NAS drive itself will show up much later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing is that my other computers are ALWAYS located as soon as they boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my conclusion is that while this is a major inconvenience, it does work...just have to be REAL patient (i may be talkin hours here) to see you drives in the Network list.</p>

            Same problem with 2 machines here, and probably the rest as they get "upgraded." Even did a fresh Win 10 install on one machine and none of my computers are showing up in File Explore --&gt; Network. I can't use Homegroups because I also have two Linux boxes
 on my network (and yes SMB / CIFS file shares are turned on). I've read in other forums where people are having the same problem. Not sure how MS could miss such a huge bug. &nbsp;In the meantime I've manually added Network Locations to the shares I most frequently
 use until this gets fixed.&nbsp;

            <p>OK, so I have been playing and I think I have some alternatives.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you open File Explorer and enter the high level path of the desired location (\\somename) then it will be added to your Network list.&nbsp; This will allow you to create some Mapped drives pointing to one or more location within the location.&nbsp; These are immediately
 available after reboot, even though the location itself may not be listed in the Network list.</li><li>You can also use the Add a Network feature to add a network location directly to the "This PC" list.&nbsp; Just like #1, you can enter the name of the location here and. similar to mapping a drive, the location has to be a "share" at the network location.&nbsp; This
 too will also be maintained across restarts/reboots.</li></ol>
I hope this is useful information.&nbsp; It addresses my needs.

            <p>@BobPritchard - I know that I can map the drives and have had to do that for my Home Theatre PC, but, it doesn't resolve the issue. &nbsp;I also have some networked drives and network discovery doesn't show them up either. &nbsp;The most peculiar thing about all this
 is that I am able to move the problem around the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said originally, "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>The peculiar thing is that if I turn all the computers off, then the one I then turn on first works just fine and discovers everything available on the network,

<p>It's also time related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave all PCs up and running with the network discovery problem in evidence and come back after 2-3 hours I will find File Explorer showing all network shares running perfectly on Machine A.&nbsp; Leave it another 2-3&nbsp; hours and Machine A loses the shared

<h2>            Second family account on Surface Pro gets Black Screen and Cursor after logging in.</h2>
                    <p>I setup a second login account on my Surface Pro to allow my wife to use it with her own personal settings, short cuts etc. Everything looked great until she logged out and then tried to log back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst her account remained logged in, we could switch users without difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When she logged out and then logged back in, all that was displayed was a black screen and a cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logging out, Rebooting, Powering off etc. has not changed this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted her user account from the Surface Pro three times and reset a new account. Each time it works whilst remaining logged in (and switching users) but goes to black screen once logged out and then logging back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried giving the family account administrator rights - same issue after logging out and then logging back in</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried creating a local account - same issue after logging out and then logging back in</p>
<p>Ditto for local account with administrator rights</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary account is unaffected by any of this.</p>

<p>Hi Simon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your screen goes black or blank after signing in to Windows, try a Windows Key sequence to wake the screen. Simultaneously press the
<strong>Windows </strong>logo key + <strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>
+ <strong>B</strong>. If you’re in tablet mode, simultaneously press both the volume-up and volume-down buttons, three times within 2 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, start your device in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and try log in using your wife's account. If you're able to log in to safe mode reinstall the graphics card driver.</p>
<br />
<ol>
<li>Select the search box on the taskbar, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>device manager</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Display adapter</strong>.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click) the display adapter, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Uninstall &gt; OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a>. This will <span>start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work,&nbsp; create a new Microsoft account. Create a new user account with the newly created Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then there could be an issue with your Windows. Run the

<h2>            Windows 10 apps won&#39;t open fully on first try - have to close and reopen for them to work</h2>
                    <p>Windows Apps such as the Windows Store, Calculator app, Skype app, and Mail app usually do not open fully on the first try. The app window will show up, but the functions are not available. I will only see the logo of the app in the center of the solid theme
 color. <br />
<br />
However, if I close the window and reopen the app, it will work fine. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this so that an app will open normally the first time?
<br />
<br />
(I have attached a picture of the Calculator app to demonstrate the problem.)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you're having issues opening your Windows apps is due to corrupted system files on your computer. We recommend that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
run the troubleshooter for Windows apps</a> and follow the on-screen instructions to address this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result.</p>

<p>I have the identical problem on my Dell XPS desktop.&nbsp; I have a Samsung laptop that never has this problem, but I have the problem on the desktop all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why corrupted files would be the answer, since the problem only occurs after some period of inactivity for me.&nbsp; I leave my computer on all night.&nbsp; First time I open any Windows 10 app in the morning, I get exactly what you are getting.&nbsp; Just
 close it and reopen it and its fine.&nbsp; During the day, again, if there is a period of inactivity, it will happen again, just like early in the morning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the inactivity is per app either.&nbsp; This seems to be across the board.&nbsp; Just came back from lunch and computer was idle for 1 hour.&nbsp; Calculator would not open 1st time just like the poster showed in his graphic.&nbsp; Just blue screen.&nbsp; Close and
 immediately reopen and it runs fine.&nbsp; Once I open it, all the other Windows 10 apps will open fine, so its not about the calculator its about all of the Windows 10 "store" apps.&nbsp; Leave them alone for some time and whichever one is opened next gets stuck and
 won't open.&nbsp; Close and reopen, all is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think corrupted files would prevent it from opening all the time.&nbsp; This has something to do with inactivity, at least on my Dell system.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your post, it seems that the apps that shows such behaviour are only those from the Windows Store. Having said that, it would still be recommended for you to run the app troubleshooter to diagnose and repair any issues related to Windows apps. At
 the same time, it's also possible that there are other programs or drivers that can caused conflict. To help us idetify the proper solution, kindly provide us with the answer to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How often does the issue happen? Is it sporadically or it started after recent changes have been made?
</li><li>Have you tried performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot
</a></strong>to check if the same issue will occur? The clean boot environment can help you diagnose if certain programs causes Windows apps to freeze after being idle.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon. </p>

<p>Thank you for your response, Jennifer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior of Windows 10 "apps" not opening the 1st time, but always opening the 2nd time, occurs, as I stated originally, every single time there is a period of inactivity on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example.&nbsp; If I workaround the problem once and open Facebook twice, so I can get into the Windows 10 Facebook app, I can close and reopen Facebook many times.&nbsp; I have never timed this, but if I do not open Facebook again for a long time, it will not
 open again the 1st time I try to open it, but will open just fine the 2nd time, 3rd time, 4th time, etc., as long as the time between attempts is short.&nbsp; How short, I'm not sure.&nbsp; I haven't put a stopwatch to this but it absolutely has something to do with
 the interval between openings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps are not broken or corrupted.&nbsp; They work 100% perfectly once they are opened the 2nd time, 3rd time, 4th time, etc.&nbsp; Once opened, I can close them and reopen them many times without any problem, "as long as I am doing it quickly".&nbsp; If I let the store
 app remain closed for some period of time, the problem reoccurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single day, this happens when I wake my computer up from sleep.&nbsp; Every single day, if I don't open the Facebook app or Calculator app or as far as I know ANY of the other store apps for a long period of time, they will not open the very 1st time I
 try.&nbsp; But they will open and they will function perfectly the 2nd and 3rd and 4th time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I purchased an SSD drive, thinking perhaps the traditional drive might be spinning down into a sleep mode, as this was happening before I bought the SSD drive, but there was no change.&nbsp; It happened on the traditional hard drive and continues to
 happen on the SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because this is absolutely something to do with inactivity, my guess is that Windows itself has some kind of sleep setting that is causing this.&nbsp; I was just checking my screen saver time to see how long that is.&nbsp; I right clicked on my desktop and selected
 display settings.&nbsp; The Windows 10 settings applet would not open.&nbsp; It froze.&nbsp; I closed it and repeated the request.&nbsp; Windows 10 settings applet opened fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now this seems to go beyond store apps.&nbsp; Many inherent Windows 10 screens exhibit the same behavior after inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate your detailed response. We'd like to ask for your cooperation so we can further isolate the issue. Although it may seem that the issue has something to do with the power settings, we would like to also check other possible causes to make sure
 that we won't miss out on anything. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What build and version of Windows 10 are you currently running?</li><li>Have you already tried entering Safe Mode and experienced the same issue?</li><li>Were you able to check and install the latest updates both for Windows and the device drivers?</li><li>Have you already updated your display driver?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After you have run down the list, please try the <strong>Power </strong>troubleshooter for initial troubleshooting found in the Settings app. See image below:

            <p>The most straightforward is to login to any account on the system and check if it has administrator level access.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for your question, there is no way (except a system image) to save software that's already been installed.&nbsp; If he installed it from a CD, he'll have to install it again that way.&nbsp; If he downloaded it from a website, he'll have to download it again.&nbsp; Most
 online stores and companies make your purchases available for future download, you shouldn't have to pay again.</p>

</p>
<p>Since it's from a pawn shop, I'm guessing you do not have the CD-ROM disc to reinstall the system.&nbsp; In that case you'll either need to:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A) Contact the manufacturer of the computer and ask for a restore CD</p>
<p>B) Find out if the manufacturer included a restore function on the computer itself</p>
<p>C) Go to the store and purchase a copy of Windows and install it</p>

Well, you would simply reinstall the $75 video edting program from the original installation files.<br />

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for confirming the complete error message.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to access the files on the CD/DVD that you insert in the drive or play music (if it's a music CD/DVD)?</li><li>What is the exact make and model of your computer system and of the CD/DVD drive installed?</li></ol>
<p>There are several causes of Code 39 errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A required device driver is missing. </li><li>A required binary file is corrupted. </li><li>There is a problem with the file I/O process. </li><li>A driver that is referencing an entry point in another binary file is unable to load.</li></ul>
<p>The recommended solution to the issue is to uninstall and reinstall the driver of the concerned hardware.</p>
<p>Uninstall the driver from Device Manager, and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again.
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Device Manager.</li><li>Expand the <strong>DVD/CD-ROM drives</strong>.</li><li>In the device's <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box, click the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab, and then click <strong>
Uninstall</strong>. Follow the instructions.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Open Device Manager, click <strong>Action</strong>, and then click
<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>. Follow the instructions.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware
 Wizard which may ask for the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor's website.</p>
