<p>The following comment might be useful:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long ago I wrote a paper which describes fitting a two-parameter (normal) distribution to right-censored data using Excel.

</p><p>The paper is listed as "Normal Probability Charts" in that section of the webpage.</p>

    <title>Question about Nokia N91 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chaudliefde7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Nokia N91</h2>
                    I had purchased my N91 in UK. Though now i am in USA. I am hearing things about a firmware update, and i am encountering the problems that this update is "suppose" to fix. I was wondering how i can get it updated here in the US. I dont know if there are
 nokia service centers in US. I tried going to the US Nokia Support site and i cant find anything on service centers ect. Wouldnt it make sense to have an authroized place update the N91 espicially due to the fact that its a GSM phone and that it can be used
 anywhere. If it has that type of mobility, then you truly cant expect the phone purchased to only stay in the place it was purchased. I do know that the N91 is sold in a US Version but i had already bought one before it came out in US. I have searched all
 over the net on where to get it updated it here in the US. I am even willing to pay a reasonable price for it. Can anyone redirect me in a way or a site/thread that i have not seen yet?

                    <p>I updated today to the latest build. First I noticed my sound did not work so I rebooted the system. Now when it boots up my mouse goes active but when the new Windows blue logo boxes the mouse and keyboard just quit. It jumps to the choose an operating
 system. I know that is a known bug but once it gets here I am unable to do anything with the system, neither the mouse of the keyboard works. It boots to the main login page but where I would normally click and sign in. HAs anyone seen this issue? I am dead
 in water, besides reinstalling the OS again.</p>

            This is a desktop system. I had the last version of Windows 10 Technical Preview installed. I don't recall the build number but it was the one right before this one. I tried multiple mouse and keyboards with no change. I even tried a Bluetooth usb dongle
 with same effect. This is why I am assuming it is something to do with the USB. <br />

            Symbian is in maintenance mode, so there is no more active development or new features being implemented. if you require live wallpaper, then perhaps you need to invest in a phone that you want, because the situation is not going to change for Symbian.
 Nokia has moved on with the Asha lineup and its Lumia range of Windows Phones.

<p>The behavior of Native Windows 10 One Note is significantly different than the earlier versions, I personally wish they would have kept it as a separate application that you have to pay for.&nbsp; I use it often and have purchased versions from 2007 and 2010
 separate Window applications. The newer One Note has predefined parameters that require the user to undo them as opposed to 'selecting them', typical stupid 'let us do the thinking for you' ms mentality-under the auspices of 'we are making it free so don't
 complain that we&nbsp;preselect everything about it'&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love one note just NOT the newer versions- </p>

<p>FYI, some people install onenote included with office 2016, because if you're using sharepoint at work, you can't really use the free included onenote, and your users easily get confused with issues loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have had to remove onenote that comes with windows, as all of our machines get office 2016 and require the use of onenote 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so... you must run this power shell command from an admin elevated prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get-AppxPackage *OneNote* | Remove-AppxPackage</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It only takes about 10 seconds to run, but life is so much better once you are able to clean up diskspace that perhaps you need. also, leaving programs on your computer you don't use is just bad practice.. "<em>delete the shortcut and move on</em>" does
 not answer the question of how do I uninstall this program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the case where the OS requires a program to be able to function.. like... Windows Explorer? yah.. you can say, you can't uninstall it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lumia 520 Unable to unlock</h2>
                    Hi, a month old Nokia Lumia 520 bought on Vodafone network would not unlock.<br />
I have purchased the unlock code from Vodafone.<br />
Instructions on what to do has been given, I have followed this instruction that requires me to insert another carrier SIM card. Advice to key the sim pin if necessary. After this I should be migrated to SIM unlock UI platiform where I sboulder be able to insert
 the NUC. All my other carrier Sim cards are not pin protected but this phone kept asking for sim pin.<br />
Even if you put the generic sim pin it will come up with error message stating that you have 9 attempts renaming. From here it will not recognise and pin if you have one.<br />
I did not even allow me to get to where I will insert the NUCI got from the carrier.<br />
Please has anyone experience this type of problem.<br />
Please what shall I do.<br />
Thank you all.<br />
<br />
Sola

            3 incorrect entries of the PIN cause the SIM to lock, so if the phone's telling you that you have 9 attempts remaining then you've already locked the SIM and it's the PUK code that you need now.<br />
<br />
Once you've entered the PUK it'll ask you for a new PIN. Thereafter you should be able to enter the restriction code that you got off Vodafone.

            Thank you for yo55ur assistant.<br />
But if I insert any Vodafone card it does not request me for sim pin<br />
I shall like to express that even when I inserted another card which is from another carrier it shows 10 attempt and when U just enter the a pin it come back with error, but this is just only one attempt, it does not even allow 2nd attempt less the 3rd.<br />
I have inserted 2 different cards which are not pin protected as these card works on my other phones.I have been to the Vodafone customer centre to see if it could be opened. The customer service attendant and myself collect another carrier SIM card which was
 not pin protected. It shows 10 attempt at the beginning, and it will allow an entry for once and come back with error and from thereon nothing could be possible.<br />
Please how do I get this PUK.<br />
Thank U

<p>If your Sim is blocked you can still use your phone by inserting another SIM.<br />
<br />
PIN and PUK are two different codes, PIN is 4 digit and PUK is 8 digit. PIN has 3 attempt beyond which it will ask PUK. While PUK has 10 attempts, beyond 10 wrong entries it will block SIM.<br />
<br />
Your SIM wasnt PIN protected as you say, but for some reason your phone may have asked you to enter PUK. (which you seem to have mistaken it for PIN)<br />
If you have forgotten your PIN/PUK number, call the carrier helpline and they will help you.</p>

            Thank you for helping me.<br />
I do understand that the PUK is different from PIN.<br />
<br />
I have inserted different SIMs of different carrier into this phone but it kept asking for the SIM PIN.<br />
<br />
As I have said above I got the Network Unlock Code from the Vodafone already.<br />
<br />
The procedure I need to follow is to insert another carrier sim card and that if it requires pin I should put it then it will take me to the sim unlock UI when I shall enter the NUC..<br />
But my problem is that it kept requesting for sim pin of other carriers sim even if they are not sim protected.<br />
<br />
This phone can only accept the Vodafone card without asking for sim pin.

            Okay.<br />
Sim card may not be sim protected, but in some occasion it does ask for PIN, like while saving gprs setting or so.<br />
Did you try putting correct PIN for new sim card when prompted? I hope you know that PIN number is different for different sims.<br />
After entering PIN it should take you to unlock UI. Do let us know if it worked.

            Its like majority of my contributors are not understanding my argument.<br />
<br />
Let me start again.<br />
<br />
I want to open a Lumia 520 to work with any phone carrier as it is presently restricted to work only on the Vodafone.<br />
<br />
I have contacted Vodafone to buy a Network Unlock code and I was issued with 20 digit code with the instruction on how to carry out the process.<br />
<br />
Please follow me from here below is the instruction given.<br />
<br />
<br />
Further to your communication with Vodafone regarding the unlocking of your Nokia Lumia handset, I have set out the following procedure and unlocking code:<br />
<br />
1 Switch the phone off and Insert a non-Vodafone SIM Card into the phone<br />
<br />
2 Switch the phone on and enter SIM card PIN code if requested<br />
<br />
3 Wait for the SIM unlock UI to open<br />
<br />
4Type in the 26174305934158463591 (20 digits) and press enter.<br />
<br />
NB. If the handset fails to unlock, then please do not attempt to enter any sequence more than twice, as you will risk permanently blocking your handset. I hope that you will find this information straightforward.<br />
<br />
Above is the instruction but the problem is the stage 3.<br />
<br />
Now if I insert a non-vodafone sim of any carrier it kept asking for a sim pin EVEN IF THE SIM IS NOT PIN PROTECTED.<br />
<br />
I have made effort to collect an orange non sim protected card from the T-Mobile shop, this Nokia phone still request for a sim pin.<br />
This has not allow me to proceed to stage 4 of the procedure.<br />
<br />
I will not think that all other carrier sim will require PUK code as suggested above.<br />
<br />
Please could anyone assist on how to contact Nokia directly as this problem seems strange.

            I understand that YOUR SIM ISNT PROTECTED, but what I am trying to tell is that at some cases it does ask for PIN. Yes it may ask for PIN, even if it is unprotected, as stated in step 2.<br />
<br />
But since you said that even after entering generic PIN its not accepting, please contact Vodafone for assistance. They will help you at best. Or get it unlocked from them itself by visiting Vodafone Care Shop.<br />
<br />
If you wish to contact Nokia, you can check on their website for helpline number or nearest Nokia Care.

<p>Nokia supply SIM-free handsets to the networks, which then decide whether and how to lock them. Both the unlock codes and the unlock procedures are owned by the networks, not by Nokia. Nokia cannot do anything about unlocking a handset, it is 100% up to
 the network which has locked it, therefore you should pursue the issue further direct with Vodafone, preferably in person in a Vodafone shop.</p>

<h2>            expression web4</h2>
                    Does Microsoft support Expression Web4? It does several strange things when I try to use it. I no longer get a password box when I try to edit. I can no longer do live editing. It often does not publish to the server (godaddy windows). Godaddy says it
 is a problem with the software,<br />
<br />
I tried to go back to Frontpage and had the same problem. I called the microsoft support line and had a terrible experience,. I could not understand the people, they did know about the product or how to help me, They tried to switch me to someone on a chat
 line and that person kept stalling and was of no use. I finally hung up in great frustration.<br />
<br />
Does someone know of another way to get real technical support without having to pay for it.
<br />
<br />
I have been purchasing and using microsoft products for over 30 years and I cannot believe the problems I am having,<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

    <title>Cannot Install Microsoft Office Home &#38; Student - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> responsibletransportation  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Install Microsoft Office Home &#38; Student</h2>
                    <p>Recently purchased a new desktop, an HP that runs Windows 8. &nbsp;Last Friday, we purchased Microsoft Home &amp; Student to run some things. &nbsp;Everything was going fine, payment went through, and we received an email confirmation with an activation code and a receipt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing that happened was the program installed and everything seemed to be running along fine, however after the installation completed my computer screen got really odd, like a static TV screen, and then restarted without warning. &nbsp;The computer is
 new so Thursday and Friday were the only days it had been running for, and this was the first instance it restarted without warning. &nbsp;I know how restart usually goes, and it was abnormal as far as they go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon the computer turning back on, there was an icon available to click into Microsoft Office however it would not work and insisted it needed to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon attempting to reinstall there was an error message. &nbsp;The first 10 or so error messages recommended that I "fix/repair" the program on my computer, since it successfully "installed" but it would not open or actually work. &nbsp;So I did that, and it did not
 help. &nbsp;Each time it would get to about 45-50% through and give me the same error message that suggested I repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then "chatted" with a representative that suggested uninstalling and then clicking the green "install" button on my acct page. &nbsp;This did nothing to help except that I now get a new error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Office</p>
<p>Couldn't Install</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry, we had a problem installing your program(s).</p>
<p>Is your internet connection working? &nbsp;Do you have enough free space on your hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please try installing again after you've checked the above"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have wireless connection, I've tried on two different networks, and it still will not work. &nbsp;I have also tried the installation in both Internet Explorer (Friday) and then Google Chrome today. &nbsp;I also clicked on the bottom message that allowed me to explore
 more troubleshooting options, but so far have had no luck. &nbsp;The computer is brand new so has never had any other Office installations, but I ran the "fix it" option when going through other troubleshooting suggestions. &nbsp;I have also disabled my firewall/security
 for brief periods of time attempting to install in case it was keeping the program from going ahead but that has had no impact either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty tech-savvy, so I believe I've tried the basics of getting it to work. &nbsp;I have never worked with this kind of desktop before, however, since it is new, so I'm a little slow navigating it and that may be slowing down my problem-solving skills also.
 &nbsp;Help me out, kind Office helpers!<br />

<p>
</p><p>Okay, thank you for your information. &nbsp;I'm just the secretary so I buy whatever is listed to me. &nbsp;Thank you for your advice, although if there is an installation problem with Home &amp; Student, that will probably be no different for installing or buying anything
 else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before I spend additional money on other Microsoft products, I need to know if they are going to work or not and how to address the installation issues that are happening here.</p>

            <p>OK. First of all, if it's a new machine then it's highly likely that there's a

            <p>Gordon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I bought Office I uninstalled all extras on the computer, therefore there was no Office already installed when attempting to install the new one. &nbsp;Perhaps I uninstalled something vital to being able to put Office on the computer? &nbsp;I'm unsure if that's
 a possibility but maybe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been to Control Panel&gt;Uninstall and searched for all instances that Office would occur on my computer and it turns up 0 results. &nbsp;So I know nothing is on there to keep the current version from successfully downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only area on my entire computer that references Office is my "recent downloads," there are many instances of my failed downloads sitting that went absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I'm being such a pain, I'm sorry! &nbsp;I don't know what the issue could be here. &nbsp;But I tried the uninstall, reinstall thing already. &nbsp;At one point after I had installed the paid-for version, there was an Office option in my programs, but I uninstalled
 it to attempt to reinstall as a remedy last Friday, and it just changed the error message I get now when attempting to install the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your advice.</p>

            <p>Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good morning! &nbsp;I thought I would just update you on my progress. &nbsp;The suggestions you gave were good, however there must be a deeper underlying problem with the computer. &nbsp;I'm thinking when my boss had a majority of things that came programmed on the computer
 uninstalled, it may have taken out something important or messed with how the Office installation went, although I have been able to download and install other things aside from Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out today that we have an IT guy that can access my computer remotely, so I installed LogMeIn and we shall see today if that solves any problems. &nbsp;Otherwise, my uncle works for Microsoft to some degree so I will call him afterwards if that doesn't
 help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boss said we probably need to get Office 365 anyways, based on what you've said. &nbsp;But hopefully we can still figure out how to fix whatever issue Microsoft Office and my computer are having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your patience and help on the subject, as well as the information you've given!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hailey Brown</p>

<h2>            Pie Chart&#58; Labels overlap.</h2>
                    When inserting a Pie Chart, sometimes the labels overlap each other (Perfect fit, inside, outside or whatever). Please, other options, macro or VBA code to solve it. Does Office 2010 solve this?. PLEASE, DO NOT TELL ME TO DO IT MANUALLY. It´s for 3000
 graphs. Thank you.

<p>Great. I finally did it the old fashioned, mathematical&nbsp;way, assigning&nbsp;the labels values to variables.<br />
Works great. Not a single overlap in 600 graphs so far. <br />
One of my problems is that I work with a Spanish version. MOST items are translated, but the code is still in English, of course. Leads to confusion.<br />
Working fine now.<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>Oh. I suppose you could use a bogus Reply-To address on the outgoing mail. Then it will bounce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd probably take a different approach and set up a dedicated (unmonitored) address that has an auto-responder on it. You can make the autoresponder say whatever you want - for example a gentle reminder of the proper way to unsubscribe or how to reach the
 proper departments.</p>

<h3> spreadsheet lady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Hours to Time &#38; Date.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a crazy one.&nbsp; Industrial machine manufactures so many lbs. per hour.</p>
<p>Trying to add hours listed in A1 to Time Format&nbsp;listed in B1 for scheduling machine.</p>
<p>A1 contains Hours (Manually entered in cell A1) 19.5 (hours)</p>
<p>B1 contains Start Time (Manually entered in cell B1) 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>C1 contains Start Date (Manually entered in cell C1) Jun/18/2010.</p>
<p><br />
Calculations:</p>
<p>In D1 formula: To add A1 (19.5 hrs.) to B1 ( 6:00 PM)? Result would be 1:30 PM the next day.</p>
<p>In E1 formula: That will calculate date in C1 to advance 1 day to Jun/19/2010 because D1 went past midnight?</p>
<p><br />
Have all my books out and burned the late night oil last night trying to get something to work. I can't find much on adding hours to a set time.</p>
<p>I'm assuming to do the calculation, you should convert B1 (6:00 PM) to 1900 digital time maybe?</p>
<p>Time and Dates is the one area that I have not messed around with in XL.&nbsp; The more I work on this one, the worse it gets.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanx in advance.</p>

<br />
You're seeing 1/1/1900 if you format E2 as a date, but what do you see if you include the time in the cell format?

Check if your Outlook .pst file exceeds maximum size limit. How to configure the size limit for PST files in MS Outlook 2010, you can refer to this

<p>
</p><p>I am having a major problem with Sharepoint as I have 37 folders shared with 37 individuals external to my organisation, with each folder containing 30-125 files.&nbsp; The drag-and-drop ONLY works in Internet Explorer (it doesn't even work in Edge) and as my
 colleagues will be using a variety of devices, operating systems and browsers, the only way many of them can download these files is by opening each one and saving it locally - a process that is taking hours.&nbsp; I can't even sync without installing additional
 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way for external sharers to download shared files without having to install additional software, or should I just go back to Dropbox and write Sharepoint off as a bad investment?</p>

            <p><span>Hi MrCranky---01,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your requirements, the best practice is to share the folder to those external users. They will receive the invitation from SharePoint Online. Access that folder and
 then use the <strong>Open with Explorer</strong> feature to copy those files to local drive.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: In the new UI of document library, click All Documents&gt;View in File explorer. In the old UI, click the LIBRARY tab&gt;Open with Explorer. You may need
 to let your tenant admin to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-external-sharing-for-your-SharePoint-Online-environment-c8a462eb-0723-4b0b-8d0a-70feafe4be85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable external sharing for your tenant</a>. So, you can share folders to those users who are not in your organization.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>IE is the default application on Windows operating system, and with
<strong>Open with Explorer </strong>feature, external users don’t have to download OneDrive for Business application to sync all these files. They only need to use this feature when they want to download the files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, we understand there are some limitations for using this feature. You may submit your suggestions and feedback via Uservoice (<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook
 Uservoice</a> or <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Uservoice</a>). Let the related team hear your voice. Many good features are added from users’ suggestions.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Well, as there isn't a setting to control auto rotation within the OS/UI of the phone there isn't much that can be done other than to try a soft reset first. Just press and hold the volume down and power buttons together for about 12 seconds until the phone
 vibrates. The phone will now restart and hopefully be in a proper working state again. You won't lose any of your personal data after this reset which is basically the same as pulling the battery out.</p>

    <title>All incoming and outgoing Skype calls dropped after 9 seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            All incoming and outgoing Skype calls dropped after 9 seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Skype for many years without any major problems, first on PCs and then on a Mac. However, during the past two months or so, perhaps ever since Microsoft took over Skype, all my calls are dropped after about 9 seconds so I'm unable to communicate
 with anyone over Skype. Strangely enough, the only calls that do succeed are to my mother's iPad in Sweden. For all my other contacts, the calls are dropped almost immediately. I've uninstalled Skype completely and reinstalled it, but no luck. I've scanned
 various forums but there doesn't appear to be an answer. I'd be grateful if anyone out there can help. Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>We're always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you are calling are using the latest version of Skype. Close any applications that could be interfering with your call. File sharing applications, streaming audio
 or video, or even just having a web browser open are all things that can eat up bandwidth.&nbsp;You may try the basic troubleshooting steps below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete Shared and Config :</p>
<p>1. Press Command+Shift+G at the same time and the Go to the folder will show.</p>
<p>2. Type ~/Library/Application Support</p>
<p>3. Look for shared.xml then drag it to the trash.</p>
<p>4. Open the folder with your Skype Name and drag config.xml to the trash as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rename Skype Folder :</p>
<p>1. Press Command+Shift+G at the same time and the Go to the folder will show.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Type ~/Library/Application Support</p>
<p>3. Search for Skype and rename it to SkypeOld</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply to this thread if the issue still persist. Thank you!</p>
