<h2>            How are students able to send an annotated pdf assignment from their iPad&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When students receive pdf files and open them in OneNote on their iPads, they then annotate on the pdf. When they try to send the annotated document back out of OneNote, it only allows the original pdf without their work for the teacher to see. It shows
 up blank when submitted. This is all in the case of the teacher not using OneNote on their end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is a good workflow for students to work on pdf within OneNote and then send it out flattened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I saw the "flattened" option somewhere, but now I am unable to find it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has less features than Windows 7.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>First, I see in <strong>Windows 10 less features than Windows 7</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Less appearance settings. No advanced appearance settings like in Windows 7. No Aero. No Themes. No Customizations options. Only flat and ugly design, with bad and heavy colors that makes eye strained and lack of constrast between areas on the Window of
 an application (see Office 2013). No option to expanded All Programs menu like in Windows XP.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Less Protect System options. No Shadow Copies or Prevoius Versions. File History is unusefull. No Backup &amp; Restore.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Less Network options. No Network map. Less Wi-Fi features. No Manage wireless networks option. No option to save a wifi connection to a flash drive from the Wireless Network Properties box under the Connection tab. No GUI option to "Set up a wireless ad
 hoc", only via netsh command. No Bluetooth File sharing. Less Dial-Up Networking options.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- In every Windows feature less options and customizations than Windows 7 or XP.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Never wants BIOS secure boot. Never buys computers who cannot change the OS or imposible to install more OS that wants.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- No desktop games. No Windows Experience Index.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- General ugly UI without options. I dont like FLAT.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- No Briefcase or similar new feature. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Libraries are deprecated.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Unusefull information on Blue Screen errors (BSOD). CHKDSK utility not shows the progress percentage.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>In general, Windows 8.x and Windows 10 is a tablet/mobile OS, but not a desktop OS. A good tablet/mobile OS. But no more. Its also designed exclusively for tablets.</strong><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why change Windows 7 with an OS <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">with less features
</span>like Windows 8.x and 10?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only new is:<br />
</p>
<p>- Ugly Metro/Modern UI does nobody wants and solicitated this. <br />
- Simple apps with ADS that are practically unusefull on desktop PC and more on enterprise.
<br />
- Cloud!!! Who, in their right mind, puts his own private data on the cloud? <br />
- Cloud!!! Who, in their right mind, puts his own company private data on the cloud?
<br />
- Nobody wants to create a Microsoft Account or use a Store of Simple apps with ADS. Nobody solicitated this but Microsoft wahts to makes money.<br />
</p>
<p>- Serious and professional developers never develop Windows Store/Metro-Style apps.<br />
</p>
<p>- They develops .NET, Windows Forms Applications, WPF, MFC, C++, etc. applications.<br />
</p>
<p>- That is the actual technology that people are using, learning and jobs searching.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And what Microsoft means Modern or actually:<br />
</p>
<p>“Windows Store/Phone Projects”<br />
</p>
<p>is technology that never wants, nobody asked and needed for.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I never see a decent “Windows Store/Phone Projects” or a rich client app on that technology. I only see garbage, spam, ads and its the better platform for spammers, and people who want to get my money badly and with bad ways.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>“Windows Store/Phone Projects” is the best platform for thieves, crooks, swindlers and more.</strong><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I never develop to a simply unusefull platform whit limited technologies and a platform in which Microsoft gets 20% of my work.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I want .NET technologies, WPF, Windows Form and to create exe files. For Mobile/Tablet platform i used .apk files that not need a store to distribute them.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I expect from next version of Windows to create local accounts and options to COMPLETITY disable Metro and Windows Store with the restore of removed features like Shadow Copies, Backup and Restore, Aero, Advanced Appearance Settings, Expand All Programs
 in Start Menu, Games apps like Solitaire, Mineswipper, Chess Titans, DVD Maker and more removed features.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If Microsoft not do this, the next version of Windows continues to be another disaster like Windows 8.x and people stick with Windows XP and 7 in order to think about migrations to Mac OSX or Linux.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyone can see the marketshare of the OS’s.<br />
</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't get what people are complaining about in the start menu ... you can literally kill every tile and set the apps up however you want inside of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>solitaire and minesweeper are not gone ... you just have to download them ... dwindling market share shows DVDs are on their way out ... why licence and include software that
<strong>most </strong>of your user base doesn't use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as windows apps are concerned you still can develop them however you want within reason ... you do have to use at least semi modern languages ... windows has a lot of flexibility there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's now 2015 ... computing has changed a <strong>lot </strong>in the last 10 years ... it's time to adapt or get left behind</p>

</p><p>no, it never was&nbsp;a waste of resources, because it was optional,&nbsp;and users can enable or disable it anytime.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>false, most of companies still prefer to store their data in local servers&nbsp;due privacy and security reasons, thats why they still continue using intranets with XP/2003/W7 machines that are never connected to internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>

            <p>Please, I beg you (and everyone who complained about 8 and 8.1), get a copy of the short, simple book
<em>Who Moved My Cheese?</em> by Spencer Johnson. You can find .pdf copies of it for free online, it is in every single bookstore and library and online e-book service. It is inexpensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>READ the whole book. Understand it. Make it yours. LIVE by those principles. I promise it will help you become a much more happy person. The whiny, gripey, "It's all about me and what I want" tantrum is quite simply not flattering on you and really is a
 turn off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, too, really like graphics-centric user interfaces. I really LOVED Aero. For a short time, Vista Pro even allowed animated wallpaper (similar to the animated Bing home pages) that i just adored. Yes, I am a bit disappointed over several of the changes.
 But my role is to give constructive feedback. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite frankly, SuperCocoLoco and MELERRIX, chrisgault is 100% correct with his facts. Microsoft has done extensive surveying, listening, and data-mining of its users to determine what a majority of the users want. One of the absolute most often asked for
 change was a flat user interface. Get used to it because that IS what Windows 10 has. It is not going to change. The othewr 7 and 8 icons that still exist will be changing soon. And as I have continued to use the TechPreview with an open mind (rather than
 the whiney 'who moved my cheese' rant that must go through your head all the time you are in front of a computer) I am seeing and understanding the new design concepts and how they are working together. They have actually started to help me get things done
 more quickly. File Explorer in particular, with its frequent folders, recent files, and seamless integration with my unlimited (right now 10.1TB) OneDrive cloud storage&nbsp;has&nbsp;unexpectedly become one of the things I use most and it saves me time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every company, school, and governmental agency I have worked for since 2000 has used some sort of remote storage space. Every sing CIO/IT person I came in contact with was trying to solve storage because the large organizations I worked for have people literally
 all over the globe. We used "the cloud" we just didn't call it that. Today more and more and more companies are following suit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, take of your blinders; get rid of your blind, un-warranted&nbsp;loyalty to last-century's technology (did you REALLY invoke XP as your go-to? That is like wishing that the Edsil was still being manufactured exactly the was it was in the 50s.) I invite
 you to come join&nbsp;us up here on the flight-deck. and find out what is actually possible.</p>

            <p>Sorry but <span>I do not</span><span>agree with you.</span></p>
<p><span>First, I read that book long ago.</span></p>
<p><span>Second, i respect all opinions, all design preferences, all new advances. The problem is that in Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP, Vista and Seven i customize and configure my system in the manner that i want and
 that i need.</span></p>
<p><span>With Wincustomize orother plugins or programs i configue my user interface like i want: Flat Style, 3D Style, Apple Style, Linux Style, etc. With Windows 8.x and 10 i cant. No customization options. That is
 the problem and the error.</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, in Windows 7 and older versions of Windows, i have all the options i need and i want to configure my system including network options, dial-up options, bluetooth options, backup and restore options
 with shadow copies (previous versions), etc. With Windows 8.x and 7 you have very very less options to configure and customize your all OS.</span></p>
<p><span>This are the real reason of why Windows 8.x had a very low market share.</span></p>
<p>Thrid, you mention OneDrive. All companies that i know who uses OneDrive, has had to migrate to Dropbox because Windows 8.x and 10 that not allow to install the desktop application. Only the LIMITED Metro versión, with a very very lot of less features. Also
 the Metro version not integrate with the desktop Explorer or Desktop applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, my company and all companies that i know and all computer technicans, <span>
agree that</span> <span>the way</span> <span>Windows</span> 8.x and 10 that<span>are taking</span>
<span>is a big wrong</span> <span>that</span> <span>
will cost a lot</span><span>.</span> <span>In fact</span>
<span>it is costing</span> <span>a lot now</span> <span>
and is losing</span> <span>a lot of money</span><span>.</span></p>

            <p>And "please, I beg you"... spare us this trite <em>"Who Moved My Cheese?</em>/resistance to change" mantra.</p>
<p>I'll save everyone's time, and sum up this book's message... it amounts to "always embrace change and adapt as soon as possible or you will be left behind and die".</p>
<p>This fable has been overused in the corporate world to justify every workplace change (no matter how detrimental to employees) and it is now overused by fanboys on the internet to defend every move made by their brand of choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with this line of thinking is that it's based on two assumptions that often don't apply in the real world: 1. change is always desirable and 2. every change is inevitable.</p>
<p>In this particular case 1. is highly debatable and 2. is completely false. Unlike the mice/people from the book, customers aren't stuck in a maze and can make their voice heard. If a company chooses not to listen, customers can take their money to another
 one who does. And it's the company that could die.</p>

</p><p>Companies make blunders and backtrack on changes all the time. Look, they've already brought back the start menu, as well as window shadows (which is the opposite of flat design). Not every change is a progress for everyone. Keeping one's mind open to potentially
 positive changes is one thing. Having a sheep mentality is another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, no extensive survey showed that "a majority of the users" wanted a flat UI (or you really don't understand how these surveys work). Sure, there are quite a few fans who enjoy this designer fad but there is also a lot of negative feedback. Let's hope
 that this time the people at Microsoft don't ignore it (like they did during the Windows 8 test phase) and that they'll give users a choice or they'll have another flop on their hands.</p>
<p>If completely flat design was so popular with customers, Windows 8 would have been a hit on PCs or at least phones and tablets and we wouldn't already be talking about Windows 9... sorry, 10.</p>

            <p>There is a difference between adapting to change and blindly conforming to it. There is nothing at all selfish about providing Microsoft with feedback about what the user wants. Statements such as "Yes, I am a bit disappointed over several of the changes.
 But my role is to give constructive feedback" or that you believe voicing an opinion against a change is the same as throwing an "all about what I want" tantrum actually really worries me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; Microsoft has done extensive surveying, listening, and data-mining of its users to determine what a majority of the users want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is one of those sources. If nobody speaks their mind and discusses changes (good or bad), then the results of their "extensive surveying, listening, and data mining" produce inaccurate and possibly detrimental results.</p>

            I like the feel of Windows 8, but hate how limiting it is. Speaking as someone who has learning disabilities that used the Advance Appearance settings in Windows 7 to reduce the contrast to help alleviate the strain and reduce dyslexic tendencies. I tend
 to find the Windows 8 and 10 to be confining and not as user friendly due to the lack of Advance Appearance settings.&nbsp;

            Only few people would be able to use such an approach appropriately. Digital Rights of Applications would be a hinderence as well. Hardware wise the Nokia phones are capable to support this. Nokia has the longest business relationship with the ARM products
 and can understand the pro and cons very well. The risk could be that the Nokia brand may get negative remarks for amateur's actions if the installed OS would not be working properly!

            I also don't think that is easy to obtain. It would be a mess. I see terrible compatibility issues and more unhappy customers.<br />
A better option would be to make Similar handsets that run different OS's. Like they did with the N9 and Lumia 800. That is a good way to tell how people react to the different OS's. Honestly though, How many would choose the 800 over the N9??

<p>Indeed, the mobile device business is not yet in a position where you can buy (or make) your own unit and install the OS of your choice as you can with a PC, the components are not standard across the whole industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile operating systems are currently designed for specific hardware configurations, and we're not just talking about the processor of the main board, even the exterior UI features are not the same across the systems mentioned in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for any manufacturer to create a truly generic mobile device, you would first need an agreed standard hardware configuration from the three companies who own these systems, so the ball really isn't in the hardware court.</p>

            Hypothetical question - Nokia now has Meego, Symbian, and Windows. Would it be possible to build a new phone (call it the N10) which when booted up asked the user which operating system he wanted to load. The phone would need enough memory to "store" the
 last known configuration for each OS.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the massive amount of programming, would it be theoretically possible to select one set of hardware that satisfies these three OS?<br />
<br />
(And thanks for your answer above - that explains something I've been wondering about for a long time. I didn't realize that was the case until I read your post.)

<p>Of course it'd be possible. However, Nokia probably would have to select whatever hardware that Microsoft supports as the base, and then also adapt the other OSs to it, too. There are no technical obstacles for such a thing; just a matter of assigning enough
 people and time to the task.</p>

<p>This will never happen while Microsoft is around. They would just pull all rights to use there software from Nokia as soon as it was thought of. That is more than likely why Nokia are not going to develope meego much longer. Microsoft have prob told them
 "if you want to use windows phone 7.5 get rid of meego"</p>

            A triple boot to select Meego, Symbian or Windows will be nice. Don't think Nokia and Microsoft will allow installation of Andriod.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since people has jailbreak iphone and install Andriod to run on iphone successfully, I don't see why it can't be done on Nokia phones. Most hardware should already be compatible. It will not be cost efficient for Nokia to use too many incompatible components
 for all their varies models.

<div>If you recreate the second slide, does the issue occur? It sounds like you may have copy and pasted the first slide and didn't properly remove the video.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, check your Custom Animation window to ensure the first video isn't listed to play automatically. If it is listed, removing it should prevent it from playing.</div>

<h2>            Sharepoint Migration tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 23rd Oct, I used SharePoint Migration tool ( <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Introducing-the-SharePoint-Migration-Tool-9c38f5df-300b-4adc-8fac-648d0215b5f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link here</a>) to migrate the data on my local drive to SPO team site. As per documentation ((<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-use-the-SharePoint-Migration-Tool-65462df1-42fe-40cf-88f7-e39f82f5130f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">documentation</a>),
 I selected incremental migration to ON in case of migrating only&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">the
 new or updated files in the source location (means new files added after 23rd Oct).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Now I want to verify if Incremental migration is going on or not ?
 If not , how to run it to upload the new &amp; updated files( from 23rd Oct to 3rd Nov) in source location to SharePoint team site .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Please suggest.</span></p>

<h2>            Content Organizer rules not working in my 2013 Online Version.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Drop-Off Library where my content organizer rules are set. I also have an approval Workflow (SharePoint Designer WF) in the same Drop Off Library .My expected solution is &nbsp;, only after successful completion of the approval process &nbsp;, my routing
 should happen based on the content organizer rule. . But what i'm getting is : Even after successful approval , the documents are not getting routed automatically unless I click the SUBMIT button in the item (document) properties pop-up.<br />
<br />
Routing is happening if i'm disabling the WorkFlow , but when the workflow id active , the process is getting stopped at one point ner the SUBMIT button , if it's clicked,manually , it's fine . Please help me .!</p>

<p>No, the timer jobs in SharePoint Online are managed by Microsoft. There is no option for users to adjust timer job configuration in SharePoint Online.</p>

<p>Hi Bashya,</p>
<p>Please first note that, the timer job of Content organizer processing would be daily. If we put a file into the Drop Off Library, it will be automatically send to the target location in one day.</p>
<p>Could you help to confirm whether the rule is working after 24 hrs?</p>
<p>Please feel free to post back at any time and we will discuss the situation further.</p>

Tell Bill to get out of retirement!  Only a few on my clients have this problem and receive the "winmail.dat"  from ****.  The only difference is I am using 64bit windows 7 ultimate with Outlook 2010 32 bit.  No windows server so we can take that out of the guess solutions I see from some of these Outlook experts!  This has been a problem for Outlook for many years as I research to try to find a solution.  You think someone at Microsoft would really look into this and provide some real solution.  I keep seeing don't use RTF.  I don't use RTF only HTML.  So the RTF is not the issue!  I have to send emails to these people from my personal Yahoo email to work around this Outlook issue.

            Somewhere along the line, the message is being converted to RTf. If you ever sent a meeting request to the address, the RTF entry is probably in the autocomplete entry. If you don't use Exchange server mailbox, you can disable RTF capability&nbsp;- see

<h2>            Internet Explorer won&#39;t import favorites from bookmark.htm file</h2>
                    <p>I exported the favorites from a laptop running Windows 8.1 with IE 11 and saved it as the usual bookmark.htm file (saved to a USB thumb drive). I wiped the hard disk of the computer and installed Windows 7. Once all the updates were complete and I installed
 IE 11, I tried to import the favorites. Everything works as normal but when I get to the final step it says "Some settings were not imported successfully" and it has a red X next to the word favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a few things, such as attempting to import the favorites to another computer (this one running Windows 8.1) and saving the bookmark.htm in the documents folder and trying to import it from the usual location instead of the thumb drive.&nbsp; I keep getting
 the same result.&nbsp; Any help?</p>

<p>Hi Athira,</p>
<p>Before moving on here, I would like to suggest you follow the steps in this reference to troubleshoot it on your side:
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-problems-e12c6a8b-4bbe-4391-9c23-1a52b55a1967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Fix-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-problems-e12c6a8b-4bbe-4391-9c23-1a52b55a1967</a>
</p>
<p>If the issue persists after that, please provide more information requested as below:</p>
<p>1. What’s the error message? </p>
<p>2. Does the issue happen if you use the same account to sign in to the OneDrive for Business sync client in the other computers? Please give it a shot to see if it’s a matter of the client or the file.</p>
<p>3. Do you use OneDrive for Business 2013 or 2016, in Windows or Mac?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>April </p>

<p>&lt;Split from this thread&gt;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am running OneDrive for business on rds (terminal) servers. After upgrading to office 2016 I am experiencing the exact same issue. Now, it is defenately not an option to delete all user profiles and add them again. Is Microsoft really expecting me to do
 that, I mean, I have a business to run, and do not have time to play those "small" games, like reinstalling, resetting etc. This is software I have bought and paid for!! What if I bought a car and the wheels broke once I installed a new radio, would that be
 okay??? To fix it, I should rip of doors and mount them again..</p>
<p>NO MS, get on with it, make a patch, solve the issue instantly!!! I would also like to know what to tell my users and general managers on monday when they are not able to access OneDrive like normal???</p>
<p>Why does it not simply state on MS OneDrive page, that the application is not compatible with office 2016, windows 10 etc., its outrageous !!!</p>

                </div>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>Sorry for my delay.</p>
<p>I totally understand the inconvenience you experienced now and know it may not a good choice to delete cache(user profiles you mentioned) on your side. So I'd like to confirm if your scenario is that you deploy OneDrive for Business sync client on the terminal
 server, and then every use can log into the server to use this sync client. If no, please correct me and clarify your situation. If yes, please try the following two methods:</p>
<p>1.Restart the OneDrive for Business sync client:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right clicking the One Drive For Busienss icon in the system tray and pressing “Exit”.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the Windows Task Manager and exiting Groove.exe if still listed.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start OneDrive for Business by clicking the groove.exe in the installation folder or searching OneDrive for Business in the Windows Search bar.(Optional:If it is convenient, reboot the machine before doing this step.)</p>
<p>2.If method 1 doesn't work, please try <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-sync-connections-in-OneDrive-for-Business-21aac895-9f32-4e3e-a75a-6f12824f0975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repairing sync client</a>&nbsp;to check the outcome.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to identify the root cause quickly, please provide the following information for analysis:<br />
1.Your Office version. Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What version of Office am I using?</a><br />
2.Your OneDrive for Business version. Refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn938436.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to determine the version of OneDrive for Business Sync client</a>.<br />

    <title>Windows Mobile 5 with MyPhone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmjstandin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mobile 5 with MyPhone</h2>
                    I signed up for MyPhone, waited for the invitation then tried to download it.&nbsp; However it said that I need Windows Mobile 6.&nbsp; My HTC P3600 is running Windows Mobile 5 so I suppose this means MyPhone is not for me.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But, is it of much interest given that I already sync all the PIM data with Exchange and use the Files synchronization for files that change fairly frequently.&nbsp; I backup the storage card manually from time to time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Or will MyPhone become something more than an alternative sync/backup ? <br />
<br />
Thanks anybody who can clarify.

<p>Does anyone know if there are plans for supporting WM5 phones? <br />
<br />
I just got a new WM6.1 phone and I need to transfer my sms messages from my old WM5 phone. For some strange reason the PIM sync platform doesn't take care for syncing sms messages and there seems to be be no adequate 3rd party software to serve this purpose.
 MyPhone service seems to finally fill this gap ... exept that it won't work with WM5! :-(</p>

            The problem could be with one of the music files you are trying to sync or one of the files on the phone, Are there any songs that dont play for you? Or do you get an error message like "file not recognized" or some thing similar?<br />
If so then you may have a corrupted file that needs to be delete. Or you could re-install the software on your phone using the ovi suite to get rid of any bad files.<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<p>I got the best solution to this. First let me expalin the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> The problem is <strong>Music Library not refreshing</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cause: </strong>There may be&nbsp;one or few which files which are corrupted or such format is not supported by the firmware, those file(s) create such problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;I have over 500 music files in the memory card. and there was only one file which was creating the problem. So I did thourugh search like removing all music and audio files from memory and moving them back into memory card in batches
 of 10 and than refreshing the library. this sorting helped me to find that file. If this solution doesn't work than go for the below
<strong>solution B</strong>....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Connect your C7 to you PC in Mass Storage Mode&nbsp;<br />
2. On your PC you will need to have allowed to "Show" hidden files, do this from Explorer/Tools/ Folder Options/ View and select "Show hidden files and Folder"&nbsp;<br />
3. Open your SD memory card/Removable Disk in My Computer on PC&nbsp;<br />
4. Go to E:\ Private there you will see 3 folders 2000CEA3, 101ffca9 and 10281e17 .&nbsp;<br />
5. Go to Private\2000CEA3\cache there you will see .dat files. Delete all the .dat file BUT NOT the Folder.<br />
6. Now go to Private\101ffca9 there you will see another .dat file, Delete the dat file NOT the folder.&nbsp;<br />
7. Finally go to Private\10281e17 There you should see 4 files 2 are Mp3 files other are Podcast files. Delete mpxv2_2.db &amp; mpxv2_2.db-journal for Mp3 files list and Delete pcv6_1.db &amp; pcv6_1.db-journal for Podcast files list.<br />
8. Close all windows and disconnect your Phone. Go to Music Library and it should automatically start a refresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work than go for solution C and repeat solution B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution C:</strong>&nbsp;take backup of all your audio files in your PC. now follow
<strong>Solution B</strong>. Now move the files in your phone mass memory in batches of 10 (to allow sorting out the corrupted file/unsupported file.) disconnect your device from the PC. go to music library. first time it should start refreshing automatically
 and afterwards you have to do manual refresh. keep moving files in batches of 10 or 20. I'm damn sure this will help out to find out the culprit (the corrupt file) ---&gt;
<strong>This has helped me. I was facing this problem for a long one month.</strong></p>

<p>Based on your description, you get the error message when you open the notebook created from Teams in OneNote 2016, we'd like to confirm some information before the troubleshooting.</p>

<h3> oysteinf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create new content library</h2>
                    Hi! We use class notebook at our school. I have created a class notebook for each class. In the content library we publish Weekly plan. Pupils have read permissions but do not have write / edit rights.
<strong>I would like to create a new content library for some of the students</strong> included in the class notes book to provide that no other students should see the personal weekly plans for the numbers of students that I have «put into» the new content
 library. How do I do that? Best regards Øystein&nbsp;

<p>Hi Øystein,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can’t add additional content library in class notebook nor we can give edit permission to specific students.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your requirement, you can try using <strong>Collaboration Space</strong>. Create sections in your Class Notebook Collaboration Space to facilitate student group work. Then, choose the students who can view and edit within that section. Grant read-only
 permissions to the whole class when you’d like everyone to see a section, but not be able to edit it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know how to give this permission, please check <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/give-student-groups-separate-permissions-in-the-collaboration-space-a87b4fd0-72e2-486f-a978-cdbb78822b30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Char styles and how to prevent them</h2>
                    
<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>We are&nbsp;currently covnerting to Win 7 and Office 2007 - so maybe half the company has made the switch.</p>
<p>My question to you is how do we prevent char styles? We use content templates and formatting templates and as we are getting documents back from writers/authors we are finding more and morre of the char styles coming into to documents and if we don't delete
 them some of our formatting changes won't take - example a table won't change to the required fonts and size or headings or captions won't update with the proper numbering, then if all the char styles are deleted and we re-apply the formatting styles all is
 good. Where to the chars come from and is there some training that I could provide to prevent it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and assistance,</p>

<p>Char or unlinked styles (such as Heading 1, Char) occur in W2003 and before, when&nbsp; a different style is applied to part of a paragraph or when text&nbsp; in a different style or formatting is pasted into part of a paragraph. The ways to avoid this in W2003 &amp;
 before is through user training: to&nbsp; paste as unformatted text and to be careful that nothing is selected when pasting (that is,&nbsp; paste into the paragraph not over selected text--even a space).</p>
<p>I've used W2007 for&nbsp; four years on client documents, and in my experience, styles do not unlink in W2007/10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(But because&nbsp; the new improved linked styles are not supported in W2003 and before,&nbsp; if you use linked styles to make run-in headings that can be&nbsp; captured by the TOC feature, then when it is opened in W2003 &amp; before, the styles unlinked. )</p>
<p>So another way to avoid them is by never allowing your files to be edited in W2003 and before. I am not able to train users and can't avoid receiving files from&nbsp; W2003 users, so I clean up all files that come to me from the writers before I put them into
 my master.</p>

<h2>            File picker crashing</h2>
                    My Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE File Picker keeps crashing no matter what application tries to pick a photo or video. I cannot send a photo using the Messaging app, Facebook (using the web browser) Yesterday I was able to send one photo by selecting the photo
 in the Photos app, then using the share function to choose the Messaging app, then typing in the name of the contact. I cannot find a File Checker Scannow Defrag or maintenance tool on the phone. While typing this on the phone browser the phone was dragging
 waiting 20-30 seconds to put the letters on the screen appearing to be delayed by the built in spell checker.

<p>Soft reset is like removing the battery of the phone. It clears your current activities on the device. Turning the phone on and off will save your activities on the device.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Apple's drivers seem to only work on/support Windows 8. Is there anyway I can get the drivers to work on Windows 10 Technical Preview?

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum: <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the query is related to installing Windows 10 Technical Preview using Bootcamp. I would suggest you to post your query at Apple Bootcamp support.</span></p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I wouldn't normally respond like this but your email is, and I'm not sure how to put this, rather unhelpful in the extreme, even though you appear to help, you do the opposite and give the brushoff rather too well...</p>
<p>Firstly, the apple drivers do, at least in my circumstance on my early 2011 macbook pro, with technical preview 9926 work fine.</p>
<p>However, that's not why I am responding.&nbsp; Bootcamp is a great solution for macbook users wanting to run windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The point is, that if the OP does post the same question on the Apple support forum he's very likely to get a John working for Apple, thanking him for his query but directing him straight back here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also a frustrated Windows user working on a macbook pro as my windows laptop.&nbsp; I'm having difficulty upgrading from 9926 to 10074?&nbsp; (the latest insider preview) and I don't know how to get support either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be that the macbook is a great piece of hardware that does allow a dual boot (via bootcamp) with OS X and WIndows whatever version.&nbsp; So it's a question of great competing hardware v great competing software and at the interface is the
 customer; lucky when it all works, but caught between two stools when it doesn't.</p>
<p>BTW that's a UK English expression&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Steve</p>

            <p>What size MacBook Pro are you using? Was your sound working fine as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a MacBook Pro 15" 8,2 (Early 2011) but it's been a struggle to get Win 10 sucessfully installed. I finally installed build 10074 and BootCamp drivers but sound and discrete graphics don't work. I know the cause of this issue is because the Windows
 10 installer recognised my computer as UEFI capable and so it installed Windows 10 in UEFI BIOS mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you run msinfo32.exe and tell me what BIOS Mode is reported?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a similar issue to you, I installed build 10074 from the ISO but when I use Windows Update, my system will fail startup and Startup Repair will continually attempt to fix the problem &nbsp;unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi I wasn't trying to install update for that driver, I did experience a problem with AMD Drivers about a month ago and I managed to solve the problem when I discovered a site that provided downloads for all main drivers for my Acer directly from acer.com.
 I simply uninstalled all drivers and installed new one's and everything was perfect. Now I don't think i will be having anymore problems with W 10 Tec Preview as I don't think I have windows 10 anymore, what had happened is I checked to see if there were any
 update's this afternoon and there was, I installed the updates and now&nbsp; after signing in desktop will flash on and off a couple of times and I'm left with a blank screen. I think my computer has bricked up, this is my second computer now so I think its all
 over for me now and Windows 10 for now and I so wanted to be a part of this and was so excited now I don't know what to do.</p>
