            <p>Hi Princely, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can actually check the manual which comes with the Smart TV for more information on how to connect your TV to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, press the <strong>Connect </strong>button in the action center to find your device. Windows 10 usually finds devices automatically when you plug them in or turn them on. If it doesn't, follow these steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>From the list of search results, select <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Add a device</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are able to find the device, you can now use the Cast to device option to Stream the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<h2>            Stuck in Temporary User Profile Windows 10</h2>
                    After an automatic Update and restart, my computer was acting weird.&nbsp; All of my settings had changed.&nbsp; I restarted my computer.&nbsp; Then, I got a blue screen with a few options:&nbsp; Restart, Restore, Fix, Start in Safe Mode, etc.... I couldn't run any of these
 options.&nbsp; It wouldn't allow me to restart or run safe mode or anything.&nbsp; The <em>
only </em>option that worked was command prompt.&nbsp; I finally figured out what to type in so I could go into safe mode.&nbsp; I scanned the system and it repaired some corrupted files.&nbsp; I ran it again, and again.&nbsp; Everything seems to be fine except that now it always
 logs me into a temporary user profile instead of my original profile.&nbsp; I can't find any useful information on how to fix this problem.&nbsp; Please help!

            At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Sign into the temporary profile:
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            How do I set a password for my External Hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    I have an external hard drive that I use for very important documents on my computer. I will be moving my external hard drive to my living room where my work table will be. I would like to put a password on my external drive so that you have to enter a
 password in order to use my external hard drive.<br />
<br />
What I am trying to prevent is anyone who sits at my desk with a laptop can not access my documents and important files by plugging the USB into the computer.<br />
<br />
So this is what I want:<br />
<br />
1. Attach the USB to the computer.<br />
2. The external hard drive prompts you to enter a password to enter the hard drive to do anything you feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
What programs can I use?<br />

<h3> janpenkava  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Skype 4 Business 2016 from Office365</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>we use on-premise exchange and have ad synced to office365 solely for s4b/lync. locally instllled office,tested on 32bit standard and 64bit pro. the only common bit on the computers is that both are win7 pro 64bit os.</p>
<p>the software that installs fro office.com says it is 2016 (16.0.6366.2068).</p>
<p>following symptoms appear</p>
<ul>
<li>error message popping out that outlook can not acces the file....<br />
<em>"we're sorry, but outlook has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. outlook will need to be closed as a result. would you like us to repair now?"<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7fc58467-bd1a-4bf5-91ab-1aef90b97148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7fc58467-bd1a-4bf5-91ab-1aef90b97148" /></a><br />
</em></li><li>the message is triggered by lync process despite the header says outlook. none of the options (repair, close) has an effect, the message comes back periodically about every 10minutes. it does not show when either s4b or outlook run on their own, just when
 both run at the same time. first is always displyed within 30seconds from launchin the other programm from this pair.<br />
<br />
</li><li>contacts do not get synchronised to outlook contacts\skype for business contacts folder<br />
<br />
</li><li>&nbsp;right clicking any contact and chosing "find previous converstaions" nothing happens. the conversation history does get synced to outlook and can be searched there, the search triggered from s4b however does not work.
</li></ul>

<p>this is clearly problem within s4b 2016 version as when lync 2013 (32/64) gets installed(available in ms downloads), this then gets updated to s4b 2015 (15.0.4787.1002)</p>
<ul>
<li>the file access error message is gone </li><li>contacts start to synchronise to outlook contact folder </li><li>search trigerred from s4b launches outlook search windows and filters out related conversation.
</li></ul>
<p>both versions can be isntalled at the ame time on one computer, when 2016 from office365 runs, these syptoms are permanently detcted. once lync2013/s4b2015 runs, all works fine.</p>

<p>can you have a look into this please.</p>

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>To better understand the issue, I’d like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;About “we use on-premise Exchange and have AD synced to office365 solely for S4B/Lync.”, did you set Hybrid environment? Can you provide the detailed environment?
<br />
2.&nbsp;When you mentioned “Error message popping out that Outlook cannot access the file.”, does the pop window occur automatically or you click some buttons?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you download the Office applications from office.com, not the Portal?<br />
4.&nbsp;Based on your description, I want to confirm whether everything works fine if you use Lync 2013/SFB 2015 and the issue only occurs on SFB 2016?<br />
5.&nbsp;Do all users in your organization have the same issue on their computers?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Erick, </p>
<p>- yes we have hybrid environment with selected user accounts synchronised to azure directory, passwords synced. These users only use S4B, rest of our apps run on premises.
</p>
<p>- no, user does not need to do any action. It pops up about 30 seconds after both outlook and S4B 2016 started and periodically repeats every 15 to 30 mins. Apparently this is when S4B attempts to access local out file to sync.
</p>
<p>- the S4B is downloaded from office365 portal by each user after they log in. So far rolled first 10 users out this week, all of them seem to suffer this problem.
</p>
<p>- yes, if we run the Lync 2013 (that later us upgraded to S4B 2015), &nbsp;all runs fine. The error is not throws, contacts get synced to outlook and we can look up past conversations from S4B 2015.
</p>
<p>- yes, appears to be problem for all office 2013 std/pro and S4B 2016 installations. Does not seem to be specific to certain user or machine, appears general for this combination of products. Will try with office &nbsp;2010 next week.
</p>
<p>Regards, Jan </p>

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>To further narrow down the issue, I’d like to confirm the following with you.</p>
<p>1.Did you deploy local Exchange integrated with Lync online since there is no EXO license?<br />
2.After upgrading the new version, does it work when you create a new outlook profile and clear the Lync cache?</p>
<p>To clear the Lync cache, here are the detailed steps:<br />
1.Right click the Windows icon<br />
2.Click Run<br />
3.Paste the command：%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</p>
<p>Then a window will pop out, delete the file names *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Please post back with the answers and we will conclude whether it’s a pure client issue or not.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>. Said twice already in my earlier posts, we run rest of our services on premises with only Lync from O365. So it is internal Excahnge server to which local Outlook connects.</p>
<p>- Creating new profile does not help this issue. </p>
<p>- Tried reinstalling Office, S4B too. No change.</p>
<p>- tried deleting the cache eralier last week too (as found this being recomended solution for similar problems that some users had with Lync 2013) - this however does not fix it. The cache files are recreated when S4B starts, contacts do not get synced and
 the message still comes up every now and then as soon as both S4B and Outlook run at the same time.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jan</p>

<p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, add-ins can cause this issue. Could you login to the Outlook client &gt;
<strong>FILE</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Add-Ins</strong> &gt; click
<em>go</em> on the right of Manage: COM add-ins &gt; <strong>untick</strong> all the check boxes &gt; ok &gt; restart the Outlook client?</p>
<p>If the issue persists, since Lync 2013 works fine with your account, the issue only occurs in the Skype for Business 2016 client. It seems like a client issue.</p>
<p>To investigate the root cause, we’d suggest you post the issue in <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-us/home?category=ocs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business forum</a> which is a specific support channel for handling Skype for Business client related issues.</p>
<p>Your understanding is appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Lance,</p>
<p>the issue continue with all COM Add-ins disabled too. There is also S4B 2016 Outlook Meeting COM Add-in so I tried all disabled but this one just in case S4B2016 needs it, but the behaviour is the same.</p>
<p>Will post to S4B forum and hopefully this gets addressed there.</p>

<h2>            Task Scheduler Can&#39;t &#34;Stop task if it runs longer than...&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I've set up a task in task scheduler to act as an alarm clock.&nbsp; The task starts media player and opens&nbsp;an .m3u playlist file.&nbsp; It start whether I'm logged in or not, with the highest priveleges, set up for Windows 7.&nbsp; All of this is working correctly.</p>
<p>I've also set task scheduler to stop the task after 90 minutes, and to force it to stop if it doesn't cooperate.&nbsp; This part it will not do.&nbsp; I have to fire up task manager, pick "show processes from all users", locate wmplayer.exe and kill it.&nbsp; If I forget
 to and go to work, then my wife will be very angry when I get home, and an angry wife is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this thing doesn't stop when it's supposed to?&nbsp; Is there any way to force it to stop?&nbsp; Is this a bug in task scheduler?&nbsp; Is it a bug in media player or in the kernel?&nbsp; If it's a bug, when will the hotfix be available?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I know this is far from ideal, but here's one thing you could try as a workaround: &nbsp; schedule another task to run the command (or possibly a batch file containing this command): &nbsp;<strong>taskkill /im wmplayer.exe /f</strong></p>
<p>This command will forcibly kill media player.</p>

<h2>            How do I install Windows Live Mail - 2011 in Windows 10 when every reference to &#34;Windows Live&#34; has been deleted&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>How do I install Windows Live Mail [WLM] - 2011 in Windows 10 when every reference to "<em>Windows Live</em>" has been deleted?</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have been and am running Win 10 [very happy w/ it] &amp; am current w/ all updates since they get installed automatically.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I was updated to WLM-2012 from WLM-2011.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All of a sudden, after working fine, when I tried to send an e-mail to a defined group, I had to<span>&nbsp;
</span>fill CC: or BC: w/ an e-mail address.<span>&nbsp; </span>I'd had this problem once before some time ago &amp; had gone back to WLM-2011 to correct it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, I was going to try that approach again.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I used IOBit / ASC uninstaller to uninstall WLM-2012 so I could take out the registry values that were no longer needed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>[I've used that many, many times. In fact, when I go to the Win Uninstaller, the IOBit uninstaller comes up.]<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now, all of Windows Live&nbsp;Essentials [WLE]&nbsp;seemed to have been gone, &amp; WLE will
<strong>not </strong>reinstall.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Then, MS Tech Support performed a clean install of Win 10 on my machine, but alas I still couldn't install WLE or WLM.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In reading further abt. my problem, I found out that 1) I should be using WLM-2011 &amp; not WLM-2012, 2) I should clean all references to
<em>Windows Live</em> out of my registry, and then 3) reinstall WLM-2011.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>[Fri.,
</span></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>10/28/16</span></span><span>- MS dumped a lot of new updates
 into my laptop.]<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I did all of these things, but WLE-2011 nor WLE-2012 will
<strong>not </strong>install!<span>&nbsp; I also followed the instructions at </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/18614/windows-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/18614/windows-essentials</a>&nbsp;for installing WLE-2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,<span><span>wlarp.exe
 is nowhere to be found in my computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>As I understand it, wlarp.exe gets installed with WLE, and since WLE is missing, wlarp.exe is nowhere to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I am VERY unhappy with Win 10 Mail because I've lost all my e-mail rules and user-defined folders when using it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>I don't want to use Outlook.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>HELP ME, PLEASE, by&nbsp;providing a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">surefire </span>way for me&nbsp;to install WLM-2011.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Many THANKS for providing a workable solution.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong></p>

            <p>You will need to borrow a English Windows 7 Home Premium retail upgrade or full version disc or an OEM System Builder&nbsp;disc from a friend or family member and use that with your COA product key to reinstall and reactivate Windows:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a retail copy of Windows 7 Home Premium, you could try obtaining a English language version using the product key;</p>

</p>
<p>Another option, if you do a factory reset, you should be give the option to choose English as your language:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<span>
<p>For Dell, press F8 on the keyboard until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen.</p>
</span><span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

<h3> donaldworthington  say:</h3>
<h2>            Standard User can connect to new wireless network only in local mode - no Internet pass through by the router.</h2>
                    My wife is now taking a notebook computer (HP Pavilion) with her on business trips. &nbsp;The computer is running Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit Service Pack 2 with all current updates. &nbsp;I have her account set up as a standard user, just to keep her out of trouble.
 &nbsp;However, with her own account, she can connect to a new wireless network, such as one a hotel or company she is visiting might offer. &nbsp;But invariably, she gets "local only" access - no Internet pass through connectivity. &nbsp;I've had to give her my account credentials
 as an administrator, and then she is able to connect with no difficulties.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Obviously, this is not an ideal situation - a standard user should be able to connect to the Internet through a new wireless network. &nbsp;Alternatively, I should be able to edit her account in such a way that she can be granted this authority without necessarily
 opening up the entire system and its associated vulnerabilities.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help, suggestions or solutions?</div>

<h2>            Tutorials for Windows-10 installed Photos</h2>
                    <p>I have a lot of photos in the built in Photos that came with W-10. Lots and lots of duplicates!&nbsp; I have tried many times to move one photo from it's file into another file.&nbsp; But I have never been able to figure out why it won't let me.&nbsp; I can handle deleting
 mountains of duplicates, but for the life of me, I cannot move a picture of my late husbands best friend into the folder I am try to finish for his memorial book.</p>
<p>Then I started wondering about why I have never seen a How To section anywhere for that application.&nbsp; And right now, if I want to share a photo from Photos to another file, I am very limited in what file or program I can share it with.&nbsp; I don't want to put
 any of the photos in the picture viewer file, because that's all it is, a place to view the picture.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can find some kind of tutorial on this app?&nbsp; I sure would like to learn how to move photos around in it, and then also be able to burn the photos stored there to a disc or flash drive.</p>
<p>Thank you to anyone who can help.</p>

<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>DVD playback - D:\drive - "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action, please install a program or if one is already installed create an association in the Default Programs control panel."</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>No doubt somebody out there has had the same issues as I am when it comes to put in a DVD/Audio CD into their DVD/CD drive and pressing on the DVD icon in file explorer and we expect it to automatically open up Windows Media Player and play the disc,
 however in my case I keep getting the error message in the title field of this post for my DVD playback and I am looking for a solution from the community for this one.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Naturally you may ask have I done of the ground work to ensure that to check my settings and stuff and looking in the Default Programs in the Control Panel I can see the the my Windows Media Player is set as my default player for DVD playback and in
 the the "Associate a file type or protocol with a program," part of Default Programs, the .VOB file extension is correctly associated with Windows Media Player. However my question I would be looking that this error is more associated to be a issue in the
 Windows Registy where the actual settings for DVD playback have been probably been changed as a result of using a registry cleaner such as AML Registry Cleaner, hence the error messages appearing as decribed in this post. The Autoplay feature on my PC works
 fine with no issues as well.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>I had the same problem with Audio CD playback and I was able to correct this with a registry tweak from the Windows Eight Forum website so now I can play an Audio CD from File Explorer in Windows 8.1 by just pressing on the DVD icon and Windows Media
 Player opens up and plays the CD back with no problems at all, however I am sure there is a resolution for DVD playback to in the same fashion hence me asking the Microsoft Community.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Please if you know the registry settings to correct this error please be kind enough to post this to this by return and all contributions are gratefully received with many thanks.</b></div>

            are you trying to play a dvd movie? if so you may need a codec pack or Wmc if you need a codec pack goto google and search for Klite Codecs pack free from google this will allow windows media player to play dvds movies etc .<br />

also u can download Vlc media player free from google<br />

            <p>This error seems to come about when Realplayer is downloaded. Not figured out how this is the case but I have subsequently taken Realplayer off my PC at the time and since this was posted I have brought a new PC and I have not installed Realplayer on so
 therefore I have not had any occurrences of this since then.</p>

            I was unable to play dvd (video) on my ACER laptop, phone support told me I had to download a 3rd party player, which I did not do. Months later, I was exploring control panel,hardware,then sounds and AUTOPLAY-BINGO, no setting were selected, I selected
 windows where offered, then Acer, built in (cant remember the name). I was the able to watch video DVD's, on a laptop w/ windows 8 or 8.1, whichever it was running at the time&nbsp;. I watched around a total of 4 DVDs, in a 3 week period, then suddenly it did not
 work again. I called acer, who told me that the lens was off and to send it in (SURE). From the little I have read, windows 8-8.1 is not supposed to have the dvd vid. option, well then HOW was I able to watch them, and did an "update" stop the capability?
 I have messed w/ autoplay settings, and no dice. I am really FED UP with windows, and WILL NEVER BUY another acer product- there was a "recall" on something, and UNDER WARRENTY, I had to pay the 40.00 to ship it to Dallas to have part

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>When I connect my brand new Surfacebook 2 to my windows docking station the internet goes to a crawl speed and limits what I can do in terms of work.</p>
<p>I need the 2 screens connected in order to do my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 3 hours trying to fix this with no joy, questions;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do I fix this, can you prove this fix works</p>
<p>2. Can I get a refund if my laptop, screens, docking station is under 30 days old?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can feel my frustration as I have saved up every penny I have to buy this rig and now its useless and I may as well use my old set up!</p>

<p>so it seems when the lid on the surface book is open the internet works better, but when the lid is closed the internet stops working so well,</p>
<p>so I think the modem on the computer stops working when the lid closes...how to fix please? seems like a software rather than hardware issue</p>

<p>on hold for over 2 hours to Microsoft 'Support'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoke to the first support person who couldn't help, who then passed me to another team, was on hold for over 2 hours!! until I had to hang up due to other commitments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the point with having a support service that is this poor?</p>
<p>Does Microsoft care, will they compensate me in any way for the hours I have spent to fix this problem, over 7 hours and counting??&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do they all work like this? if I change my laptop to a new one, I am guessing it will also have the same issue?</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling the Marvell adapter and it has had no effect, also my internet doesn't work when I force it to use the 5GHz&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent about 10 hours getting the data onto the laptop...</p>

            to add insult to injury, I called Microsoft support who listen to my issue and then passed me to another team, 2 hours later and still I was on hold. The support from Microsoft is so unbelievably bad, you can't even go into a Microsoft shop and get support
 like you can with Apple. They are not even monitoring their own forums...feels like they don't care about the small local consumers.&nbsp;

            Slow wifi on SB2 is all over the internet.&nbsp; Microsoft is refusing to fix the issue. It's been around for a long time.&nbsp; That either means they don't care or they don't know what the problem is.&nbsp; Either way, it's time to get rid of your Surface products.

<h2>            SEVERE failure after recent Windows update - too many errors to list</h2>
                    
<p>I have an old computer that has been running Windows XP Pro 32-bit for probably about 7 years now. A few days ago it failed severely. Now you may be thinking hardware, but let me describe the problem and what I've done.</p>
<p>First, specs. Remember, it's an old machine, but it has been working fine:</p>
<p>* Pentium 4 1.8 GHz</p>
<p>* 256 MB RAM</p>
<p>* 120 GB HDD (21 used; 93.8 GB free; one partition, which is NTFS)</p>
<p>* nVidia GeForce2 MX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symptoms: The computer was working perfectly fine. The next morning, it booted straight into VGA mode. I<em>really</em> mean VGA, as in 640 x 480 and 16 colors.</p>
<p>Upon log in I receive: Windows cannot load the user's profile but has logged you on with the default profile for the system. DETAILS - Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.</p>
<p>After a while I am presented with the desktop. Desktop icons are present but it's still in 640x480 16 color video mode. I can't do anything - no program will run. For example:</p>
<p>* Tried to start taskmgr (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), received: The application failed to initialize properly (0xc000012d).</p>
<p>* Tried to start winver (Start -&gt; Run, type winver, to check how much RAM it's reporting), received: Attempt to access invalid address.</p>
<p>* Tried to start notepad, received: Not enough quota is available to process this command.</p>
<p>* Tried to open a command prompt, received: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.</p>
<p>* If I log off and log back on, I recieve: userinit.exe The application failed to initialize properly (0xc000012d).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I've done thus far:</p>
<p>* Ran thorough HDD diagnostics by booting off a floppy; ran Hitachi DFT (it's a Hitachi hard drive). Ran the "Exercise" test which scans the whole physical medium and then runs a bunch of random seeks for about half an hours. Zero errors.</p>
<p>* Also ran Seagate SeaTools diagnostic and received zero errors.</p>
<p>* Ran MemTest86+ for a while (sorry, don't remember how long). Zero errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then did the following software troubleshooting:</p>
<p>* Boot in safe mode and check device manager. No problems.</p>
<p>* Check BIOS settings and error log. No problems.</p>
<p>* In safe mode, disable Symantec (Norton) Antivirus (Corporate Edition). Note: I tried to uninstall it but the uninstall service will not run in safe mode. Instead, I disabled all Symantec services and removed any Symantec programs from the Run registry
 key.</p>
<p>* Tried uninstalling almost all the devices in device manager from safe mode, in case there was a faulty driver.</p>
<p>* Ran SFC</p>
<p>* Ran MalwareBytes anti malware in safe mode.</p>
<p>* Installed the hard drive as a secondary drive in another computer and ran extremely thorough scan with Avast! antivirus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I still had nothing. I ran a repair install, which worked. I installed SP2, and everything was still fine. I had SP2, IE8, and all the updates. I had a bit of a problem because the IDE controller was in PIO mode but that was fixed when I installed
 the Intel "Application Accelerator" IDE drivers. Everything was fine at this point.</p>
<p>Next I installed SP3. Now I'm sorry to say at this critical point my memory is a little hazy. I believe it was still fine when I rebooted. After all, SP3 had already been installed for many months and working fine. I think I then ran one more update to get
 the updates since SP3. Upon rebooting after that, to my horror, I was in 640x480 at 16 colors.</p>
<p>I'm all out of ideas. I'm trying a system restore now, and will remove updates if needed. I'm not sure which one the poisonous update is but Microsoft needs to know about this. Whatever they messed up they did a REALLY good job of it. Any help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: One more thing I forgot to mention: Sometimes I was able to get taskmgr up and I noticed the kernel memory usage was almost equal to the physical memory size. Based on the error messages it is apparent that something is really draining the resources,
 presumably memory in particular.</p>

            Do you install only critical security updates? (That's all I recommend.) Or do you install everything that is offered, including optional updates as well as drivers? A bad graphics driver could&nbsp;be resppnsible for&nbsp;your problems. I would only ever install
 drivers form the hardware manufacturer's website, NEVER from Windows Update.

<p>You have commented that "something is really draining the resources, presumably memory in particular".&nbsp; You have also received an error message, "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service."&nbsp; Availability of resources is not only
 a symptom of your problem, it is probably the primary cause.&nbsp; 256 Mb RAM is the absolute minimum for Win XP Pro (SP3) and many computers struggle with 512 Mb.&nbsp; Assuming nothing else is wrong with your system, your computer would probably work much better with
 512 Mb or preferably, 1024 Mb of RAM.</p>
<p>Another possibility is a corrupted user profile.&nbsp; Do you sign into Win XP with a personal User Account (with administrator privileges)?&nbsp; If so, try to sign into the built in Administrator account, instead of your personal User Account.</p>
<p>Your operating system is Win XP Pro, so at the first sign in screen, click on Ctrl + Alt + Del together twice.&nbsp; At the subsequent sign in screen, enter Administrator as the User Name. Leave the password field blank (unless you have previously assigned a
 password to the built in Administrator account).</p>
<p>If you are able to sign into the built in Administrator account, you should be able to perform other maintenance tasks (including removal of Norton and de-installation of Service Pack 3 - see below).&nbsp; You could also create a new User Profile, if your existing
 one is corrupted.</p>
<p>It is advisable to disable any embedded anti-virus products, before you install Microsoft Service Packs.&nbsp; Consequently, I suspect you may have a flawed installation of SP3, particularly if Norton was running in the background when you upgraded from SP2.&nbsp;
 Try to uninstall SP3 and revert to SP2.</p>
<p>You say you have disabled Symantec (Norton) Antivirus (Corporate Edition).&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I would never install any Norton product on my computer.&nbsp; Symantec / Norton security products are not only resource hungry, they also become deeply embedded in the operating
 system.&nbsp; Removal of Norton products via "Control Panel / Add or Remove programs" is insufficient, because it leaves traces of the program, which subsequently conflict with other embedded security software and can interfere with your operating system.</p>
<p>Try downloading the Norton removal tool from -<a href="http://us.norton.com/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080710133834EN." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.norton.com/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080710133834EN.</a>
 I don't know whether you would be able run the tool from Safe Mode (or from a command prompt).&nbsp; However, if you can sign into the built in Administrator User Account, you should be able to use Add/Remove programs, followed by the removal tool.</p>
<p>Finally, you will also need to discover what is running in the background.&nbsp; Next, add additional memory, remove or disable all unwanted programs and disable any embedded security software - before you try to re-install Win XP SP3.</p>

<p>Bob, although I agree that 256 MB is not much these days, that is not the problem. How do you explain the fact that this computer has been working perfectly fine for a long time now, including all the updates, up until a few days ago? We're not talking about
 running low on memory; we're talking about not having enough memory to even log on. And that happened all of a sudden. This is way more than running low on memory. This is something allocating ALL the memory to itself and effectively disabling the system to
 the point that the ordinary drivers can't even load.</p>
<p>Also, if you look at my post, I cannot see what is running in the background as I cannot start any programs including taskmgr. I have no reason to assume that anything started running in the background magically as I have not installed anything lately and
 extensive virus scanning showed no problems.</p>
<p>This is not a user profile problem. It happens before you even log in. Furthermore, after reverting the updates, I can log in fine with the same profile as I tested with.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be rude, but I am frustrated that I went to great lengths to write a very thorough description of the symptoms, circumstances, and attempted fixes, and you clearly didn't even read it. I know it is common to read useless "help, my computer
 doesn't work" posts, but mine is not one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daavee, I agree with you. I only install the updates that are presented automatically. Actually, I cannot say that "I" ever install the updates; it's my parent's computer, and I have automatic updates turned on. You know when you shut the computer down and
 it shows the Windows security shield icon and says there are updates to install -- whatever is included there is what's been installed and nothing else.</p>
<p>I'm pretty much convinced this is because of a bad update. I can't find any other explanation. The system has been working perfectly fine. There have been no hardware or software changes, and suddenly, I think maybe around Saturday or Sunday, this started
 happening. After doing a repair install and installing updates it continued to work fine until I installed the very latest updates, at which point the same symptoms immediately occurred, as I said. I then did a system restore and the computer continues to
 work fine today, but without the latest updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't use the computer except to install programs and updates. My parents are the users and they always run under a limited user account, so there is precious little chance that something so deep in the OS got messed up by accident or random malware.</p>

<p>Without seeing this PC, it's pretty hard to take a good guess.</p>
<p>One potential issue:</p>
<p>&gt; Next I installed SP3. Now I'm sorry to say at this critical point my memory is a little hazy. I believe it was still fine when I rebooted.</p>
<p>If your memory is not 100% accurate, then all bets are off. ;-) That is, SP3 may have borked the PC. Are you aware of the "best practices" method to install SP3?</p>
<p>Also, there might have been a Symantec update that wound up borking the system (and a Windows update might just be a coincidental red herring).</p>
<p>If it is a bad Windows update, it would be helpful to know which one! If you cannot identify the actual one, can you identify the whole batch (it would be one of those)? Also, posting to the Windows Update forum would probably give you better results if
 this is indeed the problem.</p>
<p>Although it's certainly possible (but not recommended) to run XP efficiently with only 256MB of RAM (I have successfully done this), Symantec will undoubtedly hog the RAM, forcing overuse of the pagefile. Since memory is (usually) cheap -- and even if the
 problem in this case is something entirely different, it is highly advisable to install more RAM!</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, Daavee. I agree with you -- both on my memory, as in my brain, and my memory, as in what's in the computer. :) I'm going to run MemTest86+ for longer.</p>
<p>As for installing SP3, I am fairly sure this computer has had SP3 on it since nearly the day it came out. As to best practices on SP3, no, I am not particularly educated on that point. In a corporate environment it would obviously be totally different, but
 for me I just made a system restore point (even though I know the SP install does this anyway, presumably) and let Windows Update handle it.</p>
<p>As to a Symantec update, yes, that could certainly be possible. However I have set the startup state of all Symantec/Norton related services to "Disabled", checked the auto run keys in the registry, and everywhere else I can think of, to make sure none of
 that is loading. I won't deny the possibility, but it seems unlikely, especially considering that after the repair install everything was perfectly fine until the very latest updates.</p>
<p>To further support my theory about an update causing this, some interesting developments: Today while I was away at work the computer automatically installed updates, which it is set to do. There are four updates that show as having been installed today
 (1/14). SP3 is NOT installed right now. What's interesting is it's sort of in an intermediate broken state now. Sometimes it will come up in VGA mode, sometimes it won't. If it does, sometimes I can log in anyway and it seems OK, but one time I got the error
 again about 'cannot load your profile, using default profile, detail: not enough resources', etc. Also when I would try to run programs sometimes I would get a mysterious error about drive/device not found.</p>
<p>Anyway, at this point it's mostly a matter of curiosity. My parents have needed a new computer for a long time now (as you can tell by the specs) and I'm getting ready to build a new one anyway, so I'm just going to give them the one I'm using right now.
 Upgrading the RAM isn't really an option; since this is a first generation Pentium 4 machine, from when the Pentium 4 was first released (the very uncommon socket 423 actually, rather than the ubiquitous 478), it takes RAMBUS RDRAM, which to this day is ridiculously
 expensive considering what tiny (by today's standards) modules are available. It's definitely not worth it.</p>
<p>Still, I'm not the kind of person who's satisfied with a fix; I want to know <em>
why</em> . But I'll admit in this case it just plain might not be worth the time to find out. Nonetheless the evidence is strong that this is connected to a recent update released this month. To determine which one exactly I would have to try removing them
 one by one. It would be very interesting but I don't think I can work up the patience for that. I'm going to give it a much more thorough MemTest86 run anyway. I actually hope it fails because then I'll at least have an answer.</p>

<p>There was an issue a while back with a particular update (can't remember which one) which predictably broke Windows XP, but only on PCs which already had a particular malware variant on it. Malware is ALWAYS a possibility.</p>
<p>And if there's no malware, it's still possible&nbsp;a particular Windows update conflicted with some legit (but somewhat flaky) software on the PC.</p>
<p>You're probably right that it's not worth your time figuring it out at this point. But I hear what you're saying; it would be satisfying to know what the deal is!</p>

<p>I have experienced a similar problem with an old IBM desktop running XP Pro SP2.&nbsp; The error and response were inconsistent. Sometimes UserInit Application error, some times not enough system resources. Sometimes left with wall paper only, sometimes with
 a light blue blank screen. Sometimes task manager would run, sometimes it gave an application error also.</p>
<p>Anyway, after much trying, I renamed the Symantec directory something else in safe mode, and removed all Symantec servicesin msconfig. System seems to be working now.&nbsp; (Also unistalled Symantec after I was able to boot normally).</p>
<p>The Symantec version I had was from 2005, and had not been updated in years since the original subscription expired. Also the computer had not been used on the internet recently, but it does have automatic windows updating.</p>

<p>Cant believe I'm expected to pay to get a issue fixed that must of been present from manufacture.</p>
<p>I've hardly used the console, and since setting it up its never been moved.</p>

<p>If the hardware has failed and this is a day one console I can't believe that you would think it would be repaired free of charge. &nbsp;Not sure after all this time why you would consider this a manufacturing issue? &nbsp;The unfortunate fact is that things break.</p>
<p>Have you tried the normal troubleshooting processes such as a hard reset. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord
 back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test for results.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work maybe you could start by letting us know what you have done to try and resolve the issue. &nbsp;Good Luck. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If what Genesis has suggested does not fix you issue you could also try and unistall and re install the affected games and if this does not resolve the issue you should carry out a factory reset before you even consider sending the console away for repair.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity do the games run from the internal hard drive or an external one?</p>

<p>They're installed on the internal Harddrive. And ive tried the Hard reset. As well as completely wiping the console and started again.</p>
<p>And I know things break, but this its just over 2 years old. </p>
<p>As I say it hasn't been moved or mistreating in anyway. I could understand if I was constantly on it, or was slapping it in a backpack and moving it about every other week. Then I could understand how damage could of been done to it that would break it.
 But it hasn't been used in any way that it wasn't designed to be used. </p>
<p>I honestly believe the GPU was faulty to begin with, and it's only now with the latest releases of games pushing the power of the console that it fault has become a visible problem.

<p>If you have used it successfully for over two years however minimal that use may have been it is extremely doubtful that the GPU was defective because if it was a manufacturing defect it would be impacting ALL the consoles manufactured at that time which
 it does not seem to be doing. &nbsp;However, anything is possible I guess but that does not eliminate the fact that the console is beyond the warranty period and it will probably cost to have it repaired. &nbsp;If that is the route you decide to take you can go to this
 link <a href="http://support.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/</a> to set up a repair or you can call their toll free number 800-469-9269 and explain the situation to them and see if they will assist in a repair for no charge. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

<p>I'm going to leave it for now, who knows a xbox one slim or something maybe announced.</p>
<p>Like you say no way I can prove if the GPU was defective to begin with. It's just that all my older games still play without any problems. And if I were to buy a boxed AMD GPU for a PC they typical come with 3 years warranty.</p>
<p>But thanks again for the help.</p>

            That statement is nowhere near true. You Fanboys who ride the coattails other manufacturer that you like do them a disservice by always patting them on the back even when there is issues. No GPU no motherboard no circuit is the same even if it comes from
 the same Factory that's common knowledge.

<h2>            Audio playback&#58; intermitent squelching noise of approx 3 sec duration.</h2>
                    Need help to fix the above problem. It occurs whether I am hearing audio from iTunes, VLC media player, Foobar2000 or streamed audio from internet. As far as I can ascertain all the drivers are up todate. The noise may not be heard for a couple of days
 and then it may happen a few times in one day. It is quite loud. When it happens my external DAC displays 'error' I have spent much time trying to find a solution to this but so far have not. Anyone any ideas?<br />

<p>Hi Ratandeep</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The answers to your questions and suggestions are in bold.</p>
<p>I seem to have solved the problem. I recorded the horrible sound and was able to play it back to two computer tech's. They had never heard a sound like it and were no help. I then took it to a technician who specialises in computer audio. He recognised the
 sound immediately. he suggested that the noise is the result of the DAC receiving junk data and the resulting noise is what junk data (even though the audio files themselves are not faulty) sounds like as the DAC attempts to make sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>His suggestion was to hook the computer up to the DAC with an optical cable. I did so and have so far had two days of error free playback via optical cable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also: I had tried hooking up the DAC using four different USB3 sockets at the rear of the computer. Each time I still got the errors.</p>
<p>After the success with the optical cable I thought I'd give USB another try. I used a USB2 port at the rear of the computer and so far have had error free playback via USB too.</p>
<p>This surprised me as I was under the impression that USB3 is backwards compatible. Obviously not always.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. Kind regards, Jonathan<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1. Have you made any changes to your computer recently? <b>No.</b><br />
2. What is the make and model of the computer? <b>PB Technology with Gigabyte GA-Z77X-D3H motherboard.</b><br />
3. what is the external DAC displays 'error' message? <b>The External DAC is an Audiolab CDQ8200</b>.
<b>It just says 'error' when the event happens.</b><br />
</p>
<p>4. Have you connected any external spoeakers or headphones with mic? If yes, Please disconnect them.
<b>Did so. Makes no difference.</b><br />
</p>
<p>5. Is there any electronic devices near your computer? If yes, keep them away from the computer and check.
<b>No.</b><br />
</p>
<p><br />
One could be the sound card driver isn’t up to date. Updating the same could fix the issue. Other possible reasons for the crackling sound could be electrical interference, dust, etc.
<b>Have updated all drivers including the ones on the motherboard.<br />
&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft article that contains solutions to some common sound problems on your computer:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p><br />
Try these steps and check if that makes things any better: <b>I have done all of the following. It made no difference.<br />
&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, and select Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Select Hardware and Sound and click Sound.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Under the Playback tab, select Speakers and click Properties. <br />
4. Select the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Uncheck the Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try disabling the audio enhancements and check if that helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Open Sound by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type sound, and then click Sound.
<br />
b) On the Playback tab, click Speakers, and then click Properties. <br />
c) Click the Enhancements tab, and then select the Disable all enhancements check box.
<br />
If you don't see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you may also put the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue recurs.
<b>Didn't need to do this as I found a work around.<br />
&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Wifi error. Error&#58; WLAN Extensibility Module has failed to start</h2>
                    <p>Before i start off this had happen with two USB Wireless Adapters a Netgear N300 Mini Wireless and a TP-Link TL-WN822N. The Netgear was using the latest drivers from them and the TP-Link is using the latest drivers for Windows 10 which are included with
 it (see TP-Links site for details it will show the device is support on 10 under these drivers). Right now I'm using the TP-Link which was brought to replace what I thought to be a faulty Netgear (the N300) adapter, both however produce the same result. I
 have also done all the things like clearing winstock/ip made sure my router is on the latest firmware (no other devices on 10 have this issue) running net command -d and what not. For those wonder I have no VPN's installed currently and the only other networking
 device bar my MB LAN is for Virtualbox which was installed after the issue started. I'm also using the latest version of Avast Anti-Virus and my Windows 10 is always updated with the most recent May updates being installed days ago. Also note i'm running Windows
 10 version 1511 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So the problem itself... &nbsp;Well it's strange really, so if i let my computer boot up and automatically connect to the wifi it will connect but one of two things happen, I either expensive connectivity issues or the more major issue
 my whole wireless network will crash, this is the only device which causes this, i believe it could be causing a broadcast storm but I'm not so certain. Anyway here is where the issue gets interesting so if i set my pc to not auto connect to wifi then reach
 the login screen and connect to wifi &nbsp;manually there everything is fine... no wifi crash or connectivity issues but i have gotten tired of doing this all the time for the past 3 months or so. The only bit of evidence i have got is in event viewer, in the log
 it would say that the WLAN Extensibility Module has failed to start<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">. Module Path: C:\Windows\</span></p>

            <p>I'm not sure if Microsoft bots (assuming you are, judging by your reply style) could help but thanks for trying</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "set other applications" part is referring to other programs that would give that error, it has been suggested to run them in compatibility work, regedit.exe (registry editor) is a completely different case here and its a native windows program / application
 that shouldn't be run in compatibility mode (and cannot be run in compatibility mode!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't revert to previous Windows versions because I've been a regular insider (as my rank says) so I deleted every previous version (and its not like my HDD is big enough to handle previous version leftovers) so no, that wouldn't work and I am calling
 out Microsoft devs to provide people with seamless in-place downgrade (that keeps files and settings) to Windows 7 / 8, the forced Windows 10 upgrade policy is horrible and makes the OS look bad (even if it wasn't; and is getting better). Don't get me wrong,
 I love the performance improvements but the issues are pretty annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have another problem where audio icon is crossed (red circle with white cross) and says "No Speakers or headphones plugged in" like seriously? audio works fine but I cannot control audio from the taskbar? Acer Launch manger can also control
 volume but not Windows 10, it hates everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for fixing my "regedit.exe (Registry Editor)" problem, I will try enabling Windows Insider Preview builds and update to the latest build on the fast ring (Build 14342) and I hope this solves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Edit:</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Updating did not solve the issue, it carries on to the next build. Any idea what's going on??</span></p>

            <p>Unfortunately I have tried elevated mode before and tried it again with CMD in elevated (admin) mode and it still gives the same error, this has to be a system related error, something must be corrupted.

<p>
</p><p>As for the audio issue, I don't know where to start, it is showing multiple Audio driver, I'm not even sure if my Acer5742g uses those but I have the manufacturer / website drivers for the laptop. I tried installing manually before and nothing helped.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How is it even possible to have both Realtek and Nvidia audio?? I've never encountered such an error before the final version of Windows 10 (the previews were completely fine). I was actually more than happy with the Win32 based start menu in initial builds,
 and I know that is not coming back sadly.</p>

            <p>I too have this problem. It started with the update from Windows 1060 to 1511 and has carried over to the new Anniversary update.</p>
<p>Regedit.exe will run properly from any location other than the System folder. Additionally, regedt32.exe will not run from the System/system32 folder but it will from any other location.</p>
