<h2>            Can&#39;t Activate Office - Can&#39;t Enter Password</h2>
                    <p>Hello all--</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently received an Office 365 account via my father. I previously had one, but it was through my university email - the university recently refreshed their email domain and erased old emails (like mine); thus, that account no longer worked for Office.
 However, the one from my father should. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Late 2011 MacBook Pro 10.10.5 (highest I can get with this model) and had the Office 2016 suite installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my fancy new Office 365 account, I tried to activate via Word by clicking the Activate key in the bottom-left of my Word template display. It brought up a popup that prompted me to either buy Office or sign-in. I select sign-in, and it takes me to the
 Enter Email popup. I enter my email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), hit Next, and here's where I get stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The popup spins and spins and spins and spins and...you get the picture. It never refreshes the popup to allow me to enter my password. My email is correct for my Microsoft account as a) I can sign-in to my Xbox with it, b) I can sign-in to Microsoft.com
 with it, and c) it's the email account that my dad shared the Office 365 account with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarted the computer</li><li>Uninstalled/reinstalled Office 2016 </li><li>Clearing any/all old Office licenses &amp; caches via Keychain</li><li>Signed out of other devices before trying to activate</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Ready for another crazy? I have Office at work, and if, for grins &amp; giggles, I enter my work email into the email Pop-up, I'm immediately redirected to a company-specific login where I can enter my password and am then told that I need to verify my certificate
 (which I can't, so that's not a viable route).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help folks can offer would be terrific. I'm relatively tech-savvy, so throw me your suggestions and I'll give 'em a try. Thanks much~</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes! The contact name shows when typing the number...however while dialling and incoming call from that number...the name does not get displayed. At times the missed call also does not reflect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution: deleted and re-saved the number and the problem dissapers. But practically can't do this for 1800 odd numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pls suggest on any ideas/tricks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I import Outlook Mac 2011 Notes that are already in the Data Records Directory on my Mac</h2>
                    I have deleted a POP email profile from MAC Outlook 2011 on which I also have Exchange email profiles which I am currently using. &nbsp;However, I would like to recover the Notes from the POP email profile. &nbsp;I can restore the Notes folder from my Time Machine
 backup but can't figure out how to get the Notes back into Outlook since I have deleted the profile they were associated with. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.

            Deleting the account should not delete the data (since POP accounts data is stored locally). For a POP account, everything is stored in the On My Computer section of Outlook. Make sure that section is not hidden per your Outlook preferences.

<h2>            Word 2013 - How to change the radius of corners in a crop to shape picture&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to crop to shape a picture and change the radius of the corners. In word 2007 I believe I was able to use a yellow box in the upper left hand corner of the picture to change the radius of the corners after I did the crop to shape rectangle with
 rounded corners. I don't seem to be able to find that function in word 2013. I can crop to shape with rounded corners but can't change the radius of the corners.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>You can get almost identical results from inserting a picture and using the Crop To Shape tool, or by inserting a shape and using the Shape Fill &gt; Picture command.&nbsp;For reasons known only to the wizards in Redmond, though, the Crop To Shape tool doesn't include
 the handle for the corner radius.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the picture, and insert a rounded rectangular shape in its place.</li><li>On the Drawing Tools tab, click Shape Fill and click Picture. Browse to your picture file and insert it.</li><li>Adjust the corner radius as you expected, and also resize and position the shape as needed.</li><li>Click Shape Outline and choose No Outline.</li></ul>

<p>I spoke with a guy from Nokia care last week, who claimed that the first update was planned for "...three months from now...".</p>
<p>However, the guy didn't give me a very knowledgeable impression.....</p>
<p>The other thing is, I wouldn't rely on a fix for the notification light issue by SW update, because its mainly a construction flaw that would need a HW update to get fixed. So in my opinion chances are big that this never gets fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least this is what we have to assume, as long as Nokia refuses to say a single word to the community, on whether or not this will get fixed.</p>

            Hi.. even I FEEL THE SAME about Nokia e6... which needs a early firmware update to fix issues on battery, loading ovi store, light indicator, signal strength, drop calls,call quality. music player without a adjustable equalizer etc etc..<br />
Please fix these issues early with an update.<br />

</p><p>You can select default SIM for each individual contact and further for each individual number, you can set a default SIM to make calls to that particular number for a contact by swiping between SIM1 and SIM2 and same applies to messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now you cannot set default SIM for All Messages and default SIM for All Calls. You can request this feature here

<br />
locate the desired file.<br />
double click on the file (not the name, on the file icon).<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
open Excel.<br />
Go to File menu &gt; Open<br />
Browse to the location of the file.<br />
Choose desired file.<br />

<h2>            Installing Internet Explorer 9</h2>

<br />
this seemd to download OK and I ran the install but it does not seem to be installed.&nbsp; It is not in Programmes and Feaatures so I am unable to uninstall it and there is no entry from All Programmes.<br />

I then tried to install another version but this reports that there is already an installation.&nbsp; I have tried to download and install IE 8 and that says this computer is not suitable.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Professional 32 bit.&nbsp; How can I either correct the installation that has gone wrong or remove it so that I can install a correct version?<br />

            <p>I was unable after numerous tries to update from build 10130 PRO&nbsp;to 10162 PRO&nbsp;using the Windows Update service. I finally bit the bullet and created a 10162 ISO and was successful with a clean install. The install did ask for a product key. After trying
 the keys mentioned above without success, <strong>NJ4MX-VQQ7Q-FP3DB-VDGHX-7XM87</strong> worked for the install but not for activation.</p>

<p><br />
How did you send this "test message" - by composing a new message, or by using the "Test Account Settings" in the mail setup dialog box?</p>
<p>If the former, try the latter and it may throw up a more detailed error message.</p>

<h2>            In Outlook 2016, how to restore &#34;Move to folder &#63;&#34; box</h2>
                    
<p>In Outlook I was trying to create an additional folder in my Inbox called "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Saved</span>". While I was able to do that without any problem I somehow also ended up changing the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Move
 to folder?</span>" box itself so that rather than giving me choices of folders to move the email to it just instantly takes the email to my "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Saved</span>" folder. This is obviously very annoying since there are often
 times I want to transfer an email from one folder to another and now I'm not able to do that other than sending it to the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Saved</span>" folder. Is there any way to restore the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Move
 to folder?</span>" box to its original condition (so that when it is selected a choice of folders is given)?</p>

<p>hi steven,</p>
<p>thanks for the detailed feedback. since the file you uploaded contains some of your privacy information, i have removed it for security considerations.<br />
i have tried to test the same situation according to your description, and i found that whether you can choose the folder depends on whether you select the “always ask for folder” option. to do this, you can right-click
<strong>move to folder</strong> -&gt; <strong>edit move to folder</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c43123b-40b0-4c42-84ad-c1655cce8af5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c43123b-40b0-4c42-84ad-c1655cce8af5" /></a><br />
if you have tried it and the issue persists, i’d like to confirm the points below:<br />
1.&nbsp;what’s the detailed version of your outlook client, and the os version of your pc?<br />
2.&nbsp;if you remove the current profile and re-configure your account on a newly created profile, can there be any improvements?</p>

            An episode of the Twilight Zone?<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have to buy Office 2013 (it is hard to find copies of 2010 now) just to fix this problem. And it probably wouldn't help.<br />
<br />
Programs "break" unexpectedly because something has changed on the computer.&nbsp; The most common change is Windows Update, but installing addons to Office apps and even apparently unrelated programs can also cause problems.
<br />
<br />
You didn't answer my first question. Is there any chance that there has been another version of Office installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
Use the appropriate Fix It, or manual method from the following tips to uninstall ALL of the other version of office<br />

</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: 2 people have said that the Fix It in method 2 would not run in Windows 8.</p>

<p>Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the "normal" uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 1 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries.</p>

<h2>            After Changing Users Domain, Their Name Appears Twice When Sharing Document</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give everyone some background information, we previously set up our domain using the help from this forum
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_domains/adding-company-domain-without-changing-email/0c625c04-6acd-473c-ad3a-a411d6e9ff96">
here</a>. Basically we verified our domain but have not integrated our Exchange with Microsoft (by choice).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We started moving our users from the default user domain ( name @ domain 2 . onmicrosoft . com) to our primary company domain (name @ domain 1 . on . ca) and setting it as their primary email for Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The functionality is exactly how we wanted, but when sharing documents to a user who has had their domain change, it will show their name twice, which each account being linked to different accounts (one is the onmicrosoft domain, the other our primary).
 While selecting either will still share the document correctly, we believe having two entries for a single user is confusing for our staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a previous call with Microsoft, I was told it was because the Microsoft Admin panel had to "call out" to all the other applications in order to make the domain change, and it may take up to 3 ~ 7 days for the listing with the default onmicrosoft domain
 to disappear. It has now been over a week and it is still showing duplication (see attached).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stephanie</p>

            <p>Hi Felix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had an external consultant come in today to help with our O365 experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The duplication error was eliminated by deleting the previous onmicrosoft domain user accounts from the Office 365 Admin Panel "Deleted Users" by using a Powershell script (as O365 does not give the option to empty the bin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason OneDrive is giving us the option to share files with deleted users...</p>

<h2>            When Windows 10 is released, will it automatically download and I will not have to restore to 8.1 again&#63;</h2>
                    I want to upgrade to Windows 10 preview. When I upgrade, will all my files upgrade with 10? Also when Windows 10 is officially released will it be able to upgrade to full version and let me keep all my files and folders with out having to do clean install?
 I have never beta tested before and I am actually really wanting to do it.

            <p>You can do an upgrade install of the preview OR the final/full version and all the files will still be there, BUT, a small number of people have had the beta/preview cause a problem with their hard drive. &nbsp;They were able to recover the hard drive, but they
 had to do some procedures that normal computer users would not be familiar with. &nbsp;Search for the word "bricked" in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why it's recommended that for beta testing purposes, you install the preview in a clean install in a computer that you won't be depending on to do important work. &nbsp;If you only have one computer, I wouldn't do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current 9926 build is not that great - please read the other posts in this forum to see what kinds of issues others are having, and whether or not you are willing to accept the possibility that you may encounter the same problems. &nbsp;If I had a friend
 considering joining the preview I would say wait until the next release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see a post about a problem, it doesn't mean it's a common problem - read the thread and see if there's a lot of "me too".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The vast majority of beta testers seem to be doing ok, and by participating you can provide input to the Windows 10 team using the feedback app, and by comparing notes with others in this forum.</p>

<p>I want to upgrade to Windows 10 preview. When I upgrade, will all my files upgrade with 10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes, Windows 10 supports in place upgrades from Windows 7 SP1 or later.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when Windows 10 is officially released will it be able to upgrade to full version and let me keep all my files and folders with out having to do clean install?
</p>
<p><strong>That is the intention, you will be able to upgrade from the preview to the final release.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never beta tested before and I am actually really wanting to do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

                    <p>Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I have been eyeing to use Morph transition to supplement my deck and somehow I could not find it on my desktop version of my Powerpoint.</p>
<p>It baffles me that I can use the Morph transition on Office 365 online but it is unavailable on the desktop version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this, or maybe I'm missing any updates.</p>

            If you want Morph on the Desktop you do need to install a subscription version. I would always uninstall existing versions first.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your touchpad isn’t working, it may be a result of a missing or out-of-date driver. For us to better assists you, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows version and build are you using? Type winver on the search bar and press Enter.</li><li>Have you made any significant changes on your device prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you run the Device and Hardware Troubleshooter on your device. This tool can automatically identify and fix any underlying factors that maybe causing the issue. Select and click
<strong>Find and fix problems with devices and hardware </strong>in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the prompt to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after running the troubleshooter, try uninstalling your touchpad driver: open
<strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>, right-click (or press and hold) the touchpad driver, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that didn't work, try using the generic driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in
<strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>, right-click (or press and hold) your touchpad driver &gt;
<strong>Update</strong> <strong>driver</strong> <strong>software</strong>... &gt; <strong>
Browse</strong> <strong>my</strong> <strong>computer</strong> <strong>for</strong>
<strong>driver</strong> <strong>software</strong> &gt; <strong>Let</strong> <strong>
me</strong> <strong>pick</strong> <strong>from</strong> <strong>a list of device drivers on my computer</strong>, select
<strong>HID</strong> <strong>compliant</strong> <strong>mouse</strong>, select <strong>
Next</strong>, and follow the instructions to install it. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If changing your driver doesn’t help, there may be a problem with the touchpad itself. Contact your PC’s manufacturer for help.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
        </p>
