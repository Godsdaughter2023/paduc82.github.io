            Interesting, but if scans revealed no malware, I would not be concerned. There are loads of javascript ways to modify the mouse pointer while on a web page. I suspect that there are Flash and other ways, too. How it changed while you were not at the PC
 and actively browsing is strange, but perhaps it was through an affiliate advertisement that loaded on a cyclical refresh of ad content.

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />If I understood correctly you have a link to another document and you want to :
<br />- copy the content of the 2nd document to 1st
<br />- for Word to automatically convert the link to another document content into a link to content in the same document?
<br />
<br />Is that the request? Did I understand this correctly?
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)! 
<br />Margarida

            After inserting the articles into the main document, you will need to replace the links that you had in the main document with links to the relevant part of the main document.

<p>Hi Doug and Stephan, Is there no way round this ?</p>
<p>I am dealing with long articles and multiple links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a book that references articles i wrote over many years.</p>
<p>Surely I am not the first Paw-Paw to have the problem?</p>
<p>Basically what I have to do is recreate every bookmark for every article I add to the main manuscript. I also have to read through the Mss and alter every hyperlink. Whew!</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having the same issue. &nbsp;It appears to be happening on all sites for all accounts, including newly created sites that have never had Sharepoint Server Publishing nor Community Sites features enabled. &nbsp;I've also checked the scripting settings, and those
 are both enabled. &nbsp;I know in the past (&gt; 4 months ago), these links were present.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>hi katy,</p>
<p>please try the methods below to see if there is any improvement:</p>
<p>1. go to sharepoint designer to edit the corresponding parameter.<br />
1) open the site in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sharepoint designer 2013</a>.<br />
page -&gt; edit -&gt; edit in sharepoint designer<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f194c635-06c6-446f-b8db-9a8155110e64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df194c635-06c6-446f-b8db-9a8155110e64" /></a><br />
2) click site options in the top ribbon -&gt; find the savesiteastemplateenabled parameter -&gt; change the value from false to true -&gt; ok -&gt; ok, as the following screenshot shows:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ae70a48d-5f66-4b67-92e9-82e5743fef22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dae70a48d-5f66-4b67-92e9-82e5743fef22" /></a><br />
3) go to the site via browser -&gt; upper right gear settings -&gt; site settings -&gt; site actions, and see whether the save site as template option has been back or not. if yes, please check if it works fine.</p>
<p>2. deactivate the option sharepoint server publish infrastructure.&nbsp;<br />
go to the site collection -&gt; site settings -&gt; site collection administration -&gt; site collection features -&gt; sharepoint server publish infrastructure and check if it's active. if yes, deactivate it and then go to the affected subsite -&gt; site settings -&gt;site
 actions to check if there is the save site as template option.</p>
<p>3. use the url directly: append _layouts/15/savetmpl.aspx to the site url.<br />
for example: https://**.sharepoint.com/sub1/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/_layouts/15/savetmpl.aspx</p>
<p>feel free to let us know if there is any update.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
hale</p>

<h2>            Editting Groove Music</h2>
                    I just updated my computer to windows 10. I am having issues with editing my music. I have some friends of mine that make their own music and the only way for me to get it is from soundcloud. So I convert the files, but I can't edit the song names or the
 artist. Does anyone know how? I have tried to edit it through my files, and that does not work. Does anyone else know what could work?

            You can edit tags in Windows Media Player. Or a lot of other software, but WMP comes with Windows 10.

<h2>            Changing colour tone of hotmail from white and black to a different setting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, presently I'm beginning to struggle reading white page with black text as I'm finding the white to be too bright for my eyes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I clicked on 'themes' under quick setting and dispointed to find it has only changed the header 'outlook' to green and white. Given white background still exists on the majority of the page</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to try a full conversion where I can have hotmail show green background with white text or yellow background with black text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing it under beta and didn't lead anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's possible to do a full conversion please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b860a6b-4144-49a7-b1ea-dbda9f371ede?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b860a6b-4144-49a7-b1ea-dbda9f371ede?upload=true" /></a></p>

 otras versiones las tienes que desisntalar. Ya ho hice pero sigue apareciendo la misa leyenda. En otro decía que podía ser el antivirus, ya lo desinstalé y sigue la misma leyenda. Estaba trabajando con office a petición y también ya borré todo y desinstalé
 todo lo que tenía que desintalar y la leyenda sigue apareciendo. Intenté comunicarme con Microsoft en cd de México pero es prácticamente imposible. Necesito ayudaaaaa! me urge para hacer trabajos escolares y del trabajo :(

<h2>            Geographic discrimination - why&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Love that MS is trying to catch up to Apple, but what's with the geographic discrimination of app availability? Why is MS doing this and excluding legitimate, money-in-hand customers from buying apps purely based on where they are located.<br />
<br />
Is this going to change? Why is it there at all? MS, get your act together-&nbsp; not happy (in case you hadn't noticed)<br />
<br />

            this has been discussed on many other thread on this forum...<br />
<br />
the explaination is quite simple :<br />
- developers pay 100 USD to be able to publish 5 apps // &nbsp;publish = 1 market (market = 1 country/language couple)<br />
- developers pay 10 USD to publish to additional markets<br />
<br />
Example for an application multilingual, multicountry (a tool that send GPS coordinate by mail for example) :<br />
- 1 credit on the 5 available (that makes 20USD) : publish on France-French<br />
- 10USD for Quebec, 10USD for Belgium-French, 10USD for US-English, 10USD for US-Spanish, 10USD for England-English, 10USD for Belgium Flemish, 10USD for Netherland, 10USD for Spain (and so on)<br />
just for this tool to be available on 9 markets it will costs 100USD.<br />
Now suppose this tool is a free applications<br />
<br />
If microsoft open markets for you to be able to get applications for any countries, why the h## developers would pay those 100USD when they can publish per language (making this example total cost=1credit+2 additional language = 40 USD)....<br />
<br />
I think you have your answer of "why microsoft won't drop the marketplace geographic filtering".<br />
<br />
PS: I posted a small hack here : <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/marketplacewindowsmobile/thread/28cd9ee4-d66b-4fd0-928f-10a2acbfd4c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/marketplacewindowsmobile/thread/28cd9ee4-d66b-4fd0-928f-10a2acbfd4c5</a><br />
there is a wonderfull tool that allows you to use any markets available, you will just be able to get free apps but well it's ok for me, if MS don't want my money I will spend it on other places......<br />

            Actually I do not really care the reasons MS may find. I just think such kind of policy is discriminatory and not acceptable as such.<br />
<br />
By the way, I guess it's also contrary to the European <span><span>regulations relating to freedom of movement for goods, stating that you cannot ban any European customer to buy a good proposed in another European country.

Interresting point...So MarketPlace should filter by Europe instead of european-countries :o)) (just like US, not filtering per states)<br />

Yes, I hope too.<br />
<br />
And what about MS's discrimination based on language? Why should I be obliged to buy a software in French if I don't want to. What about if I'd like to have it rather in English or any another language I chose.
<br />
<br />
How can MS force you to buy a restricted number of apps, only in French language, just because your PC is located in France. Do they know my native speaking language?
<br />
That is weird, unfair and I call it discrimination.<br />
<br />
So no filters, thanks. There is no custom barriers in the European Nation now, except for MS. Rules apply to everyone, even for Microsoft.<br />

This Marketplace restriction is so wrong, I tell you. I bought an HTC from a vendor in United Kingdom, but my carrier is in Switzerland. For some reason, I get the Marketplace from UK but I have never been in the UK! That's actually good because who knows what
 kind of apps I'd get in Switzerland... The sad part is that the Windows Marketplace doesn't let me change my billing address and it assumes I have a credit card from UK. I have a card with a billing adress in Switzerland, in US, in my home country... but NOT
 IN UK. I'll just have to solve this somehow...<br />

<div><br />
<div>As for the language discrimination, I prefer all my tech to be in English.</div>

                    I own a HTC Titan Windows 7 phone (OS version 7.10.8779.8) and a Windows 7 laptop. When I first purchased my phone I was able to update it using the Zune software but I haven't felt the need to update it in a while since I wasn't downloading new apps etc.
 I want to start downloading apps again and so I decided I better finally update my phone but every time I try to do so I get Error Code:&nbsp;8018119C relating to a problem with the Background Intelligent Transfer System (BITS).<br />
I have tried every solution I could find: I've ran the fix it service, restarted both my phone and my computer, restarted BITS, manually stopped and started BITS yet nothing has worked thus far. This leaves me unable to download newer apps that I've been waiting
 years to be made available on Windows Phone and I'm considering switching to a different OS if the problem persists in order to get these apps.<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hello SupaKawaii:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum.&nbsp; The error you are getting most often&nbsp;indicates an issue with your computer or your network that is preventing the update from completing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The quickest way to get this resolved is to update the phone from another computer on another network.&nbsp; As this is a laptop, I might suggest trying the same computer on various networks first.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Copying macros used in Word 2003 to Word 2010 does not work with windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>In windows XP our organizational templates were available from the folder 'program files/common files'. I have tried to duplicate it in windows 7 but without success. The following is one of the scripts used to access a letterhead template:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CommonPath = "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set fso = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommonPath = fso.ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%CommonProgramFiles%")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set fso = Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documents.Add Template:=CommonPath &amp; "\IFAD standard\IFAD letterhead.dotm" _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , NewTemplate:=False, DocumentType:=0</p>
<p>Unfortunately this no longer seems to work with windows 7, word 2010.</p>
<p>Can someone offer a solution or an explanation?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Go into VBA and step through the macro to see&nbsp;EXACTLY where you get the error and post&nbsp;the error code and exact error&nbsp;message text back here.</p>
<p>The thing is, often macro's don't abend where you expect them to.</p>

<h2>            Contact Initials wrong in Circle &#40;or bubble&#41; for Contact... Picks up Title initial</h2>
                    <p><em>Problem:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>M</strong>r.
<strong>A</strong>be <strong>L</strong>incoln</span>'s initials appear as <strong>
MA</strong> in the initial circle (bubble) for the contact.&nbsp; It appears the initials are being pulled from the FULL NAME field when they should be pulled from FIRST NAME and LAST NAME fields.&nbsp; The problem is that the FULL NAME includes the contact's TITLE field.&nbsp;
 All contacts that have a Title associated with them (set in Details of the contact) will produce this error whether it be Mr., Mrs., Dr. Prof., etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c056c58-b32e-4b29-a560-e2d5483e542c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c056c58-b32e-4b29-a560-e2d5483e542c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the Contact's File As field but it doesn't make a difference.&nbsp; I can't find where I can change this setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried going into File\Options\People and changing the <strong>Names and Filing&nbsp;</strong>options.&nbsp; No&nbsp; change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this error.&nbsp; I can remove all titles to work around this.&nbsp; The trouble is, that when you do that, you are unable to tell whether a person's first name like Frances is masculine or feminine.&nbsp; Adding a picture for the contact will replace the initials
 but that is not the goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            No option to open new window in OneNote for Mac 15.36 &#40;released July 11, 2017&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to the latest version of OneNote for Mac (15.36) today. It is supposed to introduce a feature where under the View tab (or using control-M) you can have multiple windows/pages open side by side (like on the Windows version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't appear to have that option after updating. Any suggestions?</p>

</p><p>Hi Julian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it means that even though you have the latest build, you don't get all the features, when we roll them out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We roll out features in a staggered way, so that if we see any issues we can control the rollout and limit any potential bad side effects.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Are those red triangles in the upper right corner of the cells? And does a text pop up if you hover the mouse pointer over them? If so, the triangles are comment indicators.</p>
<p>In general, controls from the Forms toolbar are more dependable than the ActiveX controls&nbsp;from the Control Toolbox. They are less customizable, though.</p>

    <title>Converted document crashes Word 365 Insider build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter r cook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converted document crashes Word 365 Insider build</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 installed on two machines. A desktop running Current Channel&nbsp; (Version 1706 Build 8229.2103) and a Surface3 running Insider Slow (version 1707 Build 8326.2059)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a converted word document that will open on the Desktop (and in Word 2007 on another machine) but not on the Surface. The document is one created ( I think) from a PDF in Word 2007 and later converted to Office 365. I have created two simple documents
 that exhibit the behaviour. They are available at https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvPfyBxsnDhggwdpcoXLZjqkipP6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Test Compatability Mode.docx" is a Word 2007 document that opens successfully in compatibility mode on both the desktop and the Surface. It has individual boxes in a row (the real document is a form).&nbsp; "Test Converted.docx" is the same document that has
 been converted to Office 365 format. The row of boxes are automatically converted to one long box during the conversion. It opens (and converts) successfully on the desktop. It opens successfully in Word 2007 - but all the individual boxes reappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to open it on the Surface results in Word hanging with the splash screen showing (the dots stop moving and the bottom left corner says Processing). The WinWord.exe process runs at 30% CPU and has to be terminated to stop it. Opening "Test Compatability
 Mode.docx" on the Surface and attempting to convert it results in Word again hanging at 30% CPU, and again needing the process terminating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can fix the underlying document issue easily enough by recreating the form sections that are causing the problem. The question is why it fails on the Surface but not on other machines. I have done a full repair/reinstall of office 365 on the Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to work ( before Christmas?) on the Surface - so it is something that has changed in the last few months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be a bug in the insider build, or something more subtle on the Surface. I don't wish to remove the inside build from the Surface just to test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me any pointers, or suggest a way I can find what in the copy of Word 365 on the Surface might be the culprit?</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm Chris, a Software Engineer with the Office Word team.&nbsp; Thanks for reporting this issue.&nbsp; I've tried the documents you've linked with Word build 8326.2059, as you suggested, and both documents open without any issues for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been quite a long time since you originally posted, and I apologize for the late response, but hopefully you're not still having this problem.&nbsp; If you are, I have two suggestions.&nbsp; One, if you have any add-ins, disable all of them and see if you still
 can't open the file.&nbsp; Two, 8326.2059 is no longer the latest Insider Slow build, so try upgrading to the latest build and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Thanks for responding. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The converted test document still shows the problem. I have (been) upgraded to the 8326.2076 version of Word, and 10.00.15063 version of Windows 10 Pro. Starting Word in safe mode (or disabling add-in's) makes no difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the document directly from the OneDrive location, it comes up in protected mode and opens OK. However as soon as I switch to edit mode Word hangs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop machine with my other Office 365 licence on it, and access to a university copy of Office 365 on a third machine - those two open the document fine. The documents were OK on the Surface up to about a year ago when I last edited the real
 thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at them in detail (on the desktop) there is something about the way the boxes were created from the original PDF and then are converted to Office 365. In the compatibility mode version the verticals seem to behave (when I attempt to edit them) like
 a series of nested&nbsp; boxes which have been grouped. In the converted document all the verticals (except the last) are compressed to the LH end (as if the grouped boxes have been set to zero width).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the problem on the Surface is some sort of error in one of the libraries (dll?) that render these zero width(?) boxes when Word opens the document in edit mode - but not when it opens them in protected mode. Possibly an interaction with the
 display driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I don't have the skills (or tools) to identify which part of the code is hanging when Word stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a practical level I have edited all the original documents to eliminate the boxes. I am simply hoping it is a rarely used path (associated with zero with grouped boxes) through the code on the Surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way for us to figure out what's causing your crash right now is to look at Windows Error Reporting data that gets sent every time Word crashes.&nbsp; All we need from you is a Fault Bucket number - it just aggregates identical crashes into a single number.&nbsp;
 Here's how you get that number:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Repro the crash<br />
&nbsp;2. Open the Event Viewer (Search for “Event Viewer” in the Start Menu)<br />
&nbsp;3. Go to Windows Logs -&gt; Application<br />
&nbsp;4. The crash will be recorded as a “Windows Error Reporting” source, and it will be the last entry of that type in the list (see the Date and Time).<br />
&nbsp;5. Click on it, and below you’ll see the Cab Id and Fault Bucket number. The process name should be WinWord.exe.<br />
Sometime these IDs won’t show. In this case, try to repro again.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a248f93-3637-406b-9780-fbaa8d04291b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a248f93-3637-406b-9780-fbaa8d04291b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully with this data we can pinpoint what's causing your problem, and if it is indeed your Surface or it's something else.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mistake, it turns out diagnosing hangs have a different method than diagnosing crashes.&nbsp; I appreciate all the effort you've gone through!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to diagnose a hang is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Boot Word</p>
<p>2. Run your scenario to get Word to hang</p>
<p>3. Go to the Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Esc)</p>
<p>4. In the Details tab, find WINWORD.EXE, and right click on it to bring up a context menu.</p>
<p>5. Click "Create dump file".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should instantly see a "Please wait..." dialog, followed some time later by a dialog telling you where the WINWORD.DMP file is saved.&nbsp; It's probably somewhere like C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This dump file is probably huge, on the order of 100MB - 1GB in size.&nbsp; I'd compress it (use your favorite zip utility, or Windows 10 can do it by right clicking the file and choosing Send To &gt; Compressed folder) then place it on OneDrive, and we can take
 a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've found your bug!&nbsp; It turns out Word, when using a touch monitor, is just unfathomably slow opening that document.&nbsp; One of our engineers said it took him minutes for Word to finally respond, but it did successfully open the document.&nbsp; The need for a
 touch monitor explains why you're only noticing the problem on your Surface and not your other devices, and also explains why I could not reproduce your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's definitely a Word bug, and our team is working on a fix.&nbsp; I don't have a timeline for when you'll actually see the fix, but at least you now know your Surface doesn't have a problem.</p>
<p>

To delete any content on the device only, connect it to your PC with the zune software already running.
<div>click device (top left) so you are viewing device content, not PC content. &nbsp;Find the content to delete, and right click-&gt;delete. &nbsp; you can grab a bunch at once by using shift-click to select.</div>

    <title>We NEED the ability to customize the colors of the DESKTOP. It&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lonnieveal  say:</h3>
<h2>            We NEED the ability to customize the colors of the DESKTOP. It&#39;s about READABILITY &#38; EYE-STRAIN</h2>
                    <p>The old <em><strong>'Window Color and Appearance'</strong></em> control is Gone from Windows 10 and the default of
<strong>BLINDING WHITE</strong> for the Window Text window or the WORD Text window is going to be
<strong>MURDER</strong> on people who happen to be OLDER than 25.<br />
<br />
It Causes<strong> HEADACHES</strong>. Especially when you consider that Unlike Microsoft Engineers, most Workers in Offices DO NOT have Generous Bosses with unlimited budgets who can buy everyone a 40" Monitor. Most Small Offices use 19" Monitors, and making
 users squint at the tiny Letters against BLINDING WHITE backgrounds is frankly, Design Stupidity. I've seen numerous other posts concerning this and all that follows is the limp-wristed:
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em><strong>"We understand how you feel about the situation.
</strong></em></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><em><strong>We're sorry for the trouble this has caused."</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>No...You DON'T UNDERSTAND. And I don't think any of you have actually looked into this.</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<em><strong>And NO--</strong></em> the Option to go to <strong>HIGH CONTRAST</strong> only makes matters worse. I understand why Engineers think it's cute: Because the High Contrast settings shows off high quality Monitors...you know the ones that cost $1000
 with the curved screen. But on the regular DELL or HP 19" monitor, your subjecting WORKERS to BURNING CONTRASTS that still induce nothing but blurred squinting and HEADACHES.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What people Most used the <strong>'Window Color and Appearance'</strong> control in the office for is to turn the
<strong>BLINDING WHITE</strong> Window to Softer <em><strong>Light Grey</strong></em>. THEN reading Documents and text on the Monitor is like reading on a Kindle Tablet. The eyes immediately stop straining. It becomes easier to relax and do your job. But you
 people TOOK that SIMPLE SOLUTION AWAY!!!<br />
<br />
<strong>DID ANYONE EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS???</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>And NO--</strong> it is USELESS for people to pass around links for REGISTRY Hacks to change color on an ITEM by ITEM nature. That doesn't MAKE SENSE. Give us Back the Simple controls.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 being Test-bedded for Staff Usability in a VM and I had to install
<strong>WindowBlinds</strong> to get back that old granular color control...and that was JUST to make the Text Window Lite Grey!!!&nbsp; However, the notion of buying Windowblinds for every PC in an office just to address Worker eye-strain discomfort is nonsensical.
 But as Windows 10 stands now, for people who work STARING at a monitor All day Long, this Binary Choice between
<strong>BLINDING WHITE </strong>or<strong> ARCADE GAME SATURATION LEVEL HIGH CONTRAST BLAZING COLORS</strong> is
<em><strong>Unworkable.</strong></em><br />
<br />
You guys need to DO Better. You Need to HIRE someone, who is <strong>OVER-40</strong>, whose job is to TELL YOU whether a setting or LACK THEREOF<em><strong>'HURTS MY EYES'<br />
<br />
STOP LISTENING TO THE 20-Something who Gushes: "Oh, this is Cooool!"</strong></em></p>

<p>Well I'm 42 and do not have the problems you state.&nbsp; I am using pretty average monitors too.&nbsp; The desktop colour scheme is crisp and functional.&nbsp; If it's a little bright I adjust the monitor brightness.&nbsp; I do not get migraines or have to squint.&nbsp; I know
 of many in the same situation as me, many of whom are older than me!</p>

<p>Have you tried the Dark Setting. If not Go to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Settings/Personalization</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Color</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">s</span> tab then you might have to scroll down in the right side of the Settings window to see the Option that needs to be selected
 to use the Dark Mode. This does not change the background colors on web sites and not on all apps but some apps have settings for their Default background colors.</p>
<p>

<p>Okay-- You have no Problems with it. <strong><em>Oh Joy</em></strong>. And the People you personally know have no problems with it.
<em><strong>How peachy</strong></em><strong>.</strong> And yes, you obviously represent the
<strong><em>Entirety</em></strong> of the User Population, so therefore what you experience is the Norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know that with one blue LED from my Verizon Modem, I can see in the dark and can navigate my house without needing to turn on any lights? So can my Brother. So Obviously, everyone else should be able to do the same...Yes? Isn't that Sensible?</p>
<p><br />
This NOT a creditable answer to a USABILITY Question. <strong>YOU</strong> are <strong>
<em>NOT</em></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EVERYBODY</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Excuse me for being snarky...But I manage a Large Staff in a Medical center. People of ALL ages. I had one young worker in his 20's. he had an eye condition that made it painful for him to read on-screen text with a white background. And when he tried the
 Hi-Contrast setting, he got headaches. When I showed him how to set the text background to grey-- he was able to get back to work. He told me that his eyes stopped tearing up after looking at the screen for more than 20 minutes. This Fellow is a top notch
 input worker who is responsible for scanning and uploading reports and documents. I NEED him where he is.<br />
<br />
Another Worker is a Doctor. He HATES using the EHR that we've now switched to when we stopped using Paper Charts. He has Macular degenerative problems. The man is over 70 yrs old. He regularly PRINTS OUT everything patient related in order to read it comfortably.
 And we will be fast approaching the point wherein even basic access to patient information will require him to directly access the info ON-SCREEN. I already know from him DIRECT, that he cannot READ ANYTHING against the Blinding White. I had to go and reset
 his PC color scheme to the soft grey. That is the Only machine he will use. After he did so, the OTHER Doctors asked me to make the same adjustment for them also. And this is Possible because we are still in a Windows 7 environment. What? I'm gonna tell this
 fellow, Suck it up and deal or retire?<br />
<br />
ANOTHER Worker is a Mid 50's Billing person. ALL of our Billing Expertise and Speed resides in his hands, her head...and her EYES.
<em>"It hurts my Eyes"</em> she told me one day when we first switched over to Windows 7. I didn't tell her:
<em>"Well the Other 5 people next to you don't have a problem so I don't understand what you're grousing about. Just suck it up and deal."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I didn't Argue with her. Her work was VALUABLE. She can't do her work-- We don't Get paid. I made the adjustment. She was happy. Work continues with minimal complaint. And all it took was a little tweaking of the color selection in the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">'Window Color and Appearance"</span></strong> control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would you do?&nbsp; Say to these people-- "Well you aren't a large enough number to make this a significant problem, especially since I PERSONALLY don't have a problem with it--, so suck it up and deal, or Quit?
<br />
<br />
Again-- It's great that Windows 10 color scheme work for you. Joy!<br />
<br />
However, this Issue <strong>IS NOT ABOUT </strong><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">YOU</span></strong></em>. Try and STOP thinking like a self-satisfied Home User and Put yourself in the shoes of someone running a Department who actually
 has to deal with Worker Related Usability Issues.</p>

</p><p><span>Yes, As I see in the snarky NON-Answer from <strong>MarkInKent</strong>...Not everyone has an issue with the Generic Win 10 Color scheme and can make do with the Hi-Contrast Option. But Not EVERYONE CAN. And in a large work environment, you WILL have
 a set of the individuals whose eyes cannot handle Hi-Contrast. It's Like Staring at an Old Video Game. It's NOT good for Reading.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you Can't Bring back or Outrightly REFUSE to bring back the 'Window Color and Appearance' setting...then perhaps add a THIRD option. Call it the
<em><strong>KINDLE or the E-READER </strong></em>Option. There's a deeply researched REASON Amazon's Kindle is designed the way it is. Being<strong><em>EASY ON THE EYE
</em></strong>promotes Longer use. <br />

            You're concerned needs to be posted in the Feedback Hub where Microsoft people will see it, as for your remark about 20-something is way off as I'm in my 70's and haven't had any issues, but I do know how to set levels to match what is pleasing to me,<br />
I have a customer base of over 400 most in the later stages of life, I have had very few complain about the issues that you have posted and the ones that did have some issues were shown how to adjust the levels using the monitor's settings, I will agree that<br />
a few more options for colors, levels would be helpful, but when a company is making a product that works on millions of different combinations, I give them credit as for the fruit company who controls the whole process doesn't have to make a Operating Systems<br />
that works on just about any combination. Think about it.&nbsp; &nbsp;

</p><p>While you may get some satisfaction from venting here, your shouting is just irritating those who use this forum to report problems they are encountering on Windows 10 Insiders Preview builds and looking for a solution with other Insider Preview users help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please right click on your Windows 10 desktop, select Personalize, and use the Colors page (including High Contrast settings available in Windows 10) and possibly the Themes page to experiment and see if you can find a set of values that
 will meet your organization's needs.</p>

<p>Okay-- I often hear the argument of "but when a company is making a product that works on millions of different combinations, I give them credit as for the fruit company who controls the whole process doesn't have to make a Operating Systems<br />
that works on just about any combination."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to my ears, it's becoming a cop-out response for people who don't want to be bothered.&nbsp; Which to me means, I and my organization will stay on Windows 7 until the very End of Life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I now understand and accept that this is really just a User Forum. My Mistake for thinking it was an attenuated line to Microsoft. And I did post my concern to the Internal Feedback to Microsoft...but I won't hold my breath waiting for a reaction.
 This isn't the Microsoft I remember. And Yeah Times Change, but this change is not for the better...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the tone to people to normally frequent this Forum...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...but still, hearing variations of: <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"It Works for me, I don't see what your problem is"</span></em> is really becoming the Mantra of the the entire Software Industry. And I'm hearing it from everywhere now.&nbsp; This
 is not a good turn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, Toodles</p>

<h2>            Access Tab Control - Undo Record Updates</h2>
                    <p>I have a form with a tab control. I'd like to add a "cancel" button to the form to undo any changes, and this works fine for changes made to the first page of the tab control. But if I change anything on the second page, these changes are not cancelled.
 The second page consists of individual controls, not on a subform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using VBA:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Private Sub cmdCancel_Click()</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">If Me.Dirty Then&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Me.Undo</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">End If</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">DoCmd.Close&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">End Sub</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried using the command button wizard to create the cancel button. Both options work for edits made to page 1, but not page 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something special I need to do to also cancel the updates on page 2 of the tab control?</p>

<p>Your code works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a form with a tab control, and bound a table to that form. I placed 3 controls on one tab page, and 3 on another (all of them bound to the table).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered data into all controls, and then clicked my button (which contained exactly the same code as yours). The form closed, and when I checked the table there were no new records in the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have an Autonumber field in my form, and that Autonumber was incremented, but that's not really important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure you're not working with Subforms? The behavior you describe sounds just like what happens when you move from a main form to a subform (the main form saves immediately).</p>

<p>Alan,</p>
<p>Thank you for the information, and the quick reply.</p>
<p>I gave the MFCMapi tool another try and this time it worked.&nbsp; I'm guessing that the end user was still logged into web mail during my first attempts, even though I asked her to log out.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
