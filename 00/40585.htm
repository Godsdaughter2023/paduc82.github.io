<h2>            Windows laptop video resolution</h2>
                    My windows 10 - HP laptop videos (YouTube, movies, etc) display is zoomed in so much that I can't get a clear view of what is playing. This is even more bothersome because I watch videos for my courses online. I cannot find any resolution for this and
 have tried adjusting screen resolution on my control panel.

            <p>If this is only on YouTube (I assume other things are normal as you were able to use control panel without problems).</p>
<p>The following solution is a stab in the dark, but just to&nbsp;rule it out as a possibility worth a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to load a YouTube video (or a webpage where you experience this problem).</p>
<p>If you are using Edge click on the three dots <strong>...</strong> upper right, and see if
<strong>Zoom</strong> level is set too high.</p>
<p>Keyboard-Shortcut to change zoom level to default is Click Ctrl+0&nbsp; (Click and hold
<strong>Ctrl</strong> then press <strong>0 (-zero-)</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that wasn't the problem, what Browser are you using, and have you tried other Browsers?</p>
<p>And is this a problem&nbsp;with all webpages and also&nbsp;other programs on the computer?</p>

            Chances are you will be notified if you are a winner when the draw is completed. If you hear nothing then you weren’t one of the lucky winners.
<br />You would’ve had a confirmation of the entry either via email or on the webpage after entering wishing you good luck.

<span>Hi ljthompson,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to run the Windows 7 audio troubleshooter and check for problems.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix
 the problem. It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers or headphones.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi, Cae is right, the system does not have a dedicated "reset" button but turning the system off and on again will do the same. As a point of clarity, why would you need to reset the system. Using the guide button will return you to the dash from any application.</p>

<p>It might be possible that your Xbox 360 could be overheating. Be sure to keep your console in an area with enoguh space, and in an ucrowded space. Also, you could try putting it in a place where there isn't too much dust, dust accumulates inside your console,
 and causes it to heat up faster. So i would recommned putting in a place where it isn't crowded and doesn't have a lot of dust, or even try buying the coolers at gamestop, to keep your system from over heating. These should help solve the problem</p>

<p>A System resetting it's self is something to do with it's power lines. It has nothing to do with heat sources and tv cables. It seems to keep losing power then getting it back right away. It's either the PSU or it's power lines might be damaged.

<p>PSU is the power supply unit. It's the brick that comes with the system. If your system isn't operating as intended like you said. Get the person who got it for ya to return it. It might still be in warranty to return if the shop goes that long. If not then
 the only answer is requesting repairs. But the chances it might be the PSU.</p>

<h2>            Getting rid of spyware and other trackers&#63;__</h2>
                    I use McAfee software, but think I have spyware, malware, cookies and other tracking devices "significantly slowing down my computer"! When I log-on to my Comcast internet, it takes a long time and I see "waiting for bridgetrack, or Zedo, Generic Malware.com....and
 others" before I get logged-on. Then my computer searches are very slow! How do I get rid of all these trackers? Help really appreciated.<br />

            McAfee is possibly the worst choice for an antivirus, with Norton a close second. Recommended antivirus programs are NOD32 (commercial), Avast or Avira (both have free versions). However, you need to get your computer cleaned up before removing McAfee
 and installing another antivirus.<br />
<br />
Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
Include scanning with David Lipman's Multi_AV and follow instructions to do all scans in Safe Mode. Please see the special Notes regarding using Multi_AV in Vista.<br />

<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.

<h2>            Will Windows 10 be stable when compared to earlier OS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Stability</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed WIN8 on three laptops, and purchased two twoers with it preinstalled. I had to do complete factory fresh reinstalls of WIN8 on all 5, including twice in 30 days on one of the new towers.&nbsp; A Microsoft Tech did a remote install on the laptops,
 so one presumes he knew what he was doing. I finally finished recovering what I could from the first tower's sevond factory new installat about 4:am eastern time this morning. Please tell me XBox/Metro for PC's is going to be a stable operating system for
 adults who do silly things like write. and subsequently lose, their doctoral thesis because the system crash somehow managed to corrupt external drive backups as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me that you have moved beyond your failed experiment of tring to merge world of warcraft and smartphone technology at the expense of millions of buseness users who shell out Billions of dollars for a platform on which they can depend on Word,
 Excel. Powerpoint, Access and Project Manager EVERY time, and frankly don't give a rats fart for full screen charms/ aka toys that sort of defeat the whole concept of "windows" because our worlds run on programs, not apps and a editing a 500 page white paper
 on a 5 inch screen ranks up there with pouring alcohol on yourself in the shower and setting yourself on fire as good ideas.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please tell me you have rememberef the over 12-year old set with Windows 10, AND you have made this one stable.&nbsp; Like XP and VISTA were.&nbsp; BTW - the only thing wrong with VISTA was that you put too much under the hood and users with a 30 second attention
 span couldn't deal with it.</p>

While Hyper-V is a great out of box solution because of its tight integration and robust performance, it does have certain limitations and complexities. In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

            You need to change the setting for the outgoing server.&nbsp; This setting must be changed to use the SMTP server owned by which ever ISP you're connected to.&nbsp; The only other way to do this is to find out if your ISP offers a different connection method for
 his sending server for times when folks are not directly connected.&nbsp; You could also get an account wwith a national provider like GMail for use when out of town.&nbsp; All ISPs will block your use of any port 25 SMTP server other than their own. For an explanation
 of this policy, see:<br />

            Hi evanpenland
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should use 0000 as the PIN code. If it doesn't work, use 1111 or 1234.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>
</p><p>My anti virus identified this one as suspicious and when i looked it up in its folder, I noticed that all other files in that folder dates last year (I only bought my laptop this year, brand new) except this one which dates 6/03/15. the day where I started
 receiving the explorer.exe error message every time I start my laptop. I may be jumping to conclusions but I think it may be related. I tried deleting it but my computer says it can't because the file is open with explorer.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete this file, my laptop has been running fine without it since I got it last January. Please tell me how to delete it</p>

            <p>Thanks everyone but I resolved the issue differently. I tried everything suggested but nothing worked. I was inspired this afternoon to try loading the game on my other hard drive running a preview version of windows 8. installed two patches from the Links
 corner website - v1.5 and 1.7 and it fired up straight away with no problems at all. Once again, many thanks to all. Cheers, Ron.
</p>
<p>ps, I uninstalled XP Mode because I had no further use for it but it was an interesting couple of days.</p>

<h2>            Upgrading to windows 10</h2>
                    Wanted to upgrade my windows 8.1 to 10. I used the setup in windows and after clicking "upgrade" it says "the upgrade path is not supported. relaunch.....". Tried the setup from the main and also inside the "sources" folder. There is no installprep.exe
 and setupprep.exe in the sources folder also. Tried to run both setups in compatibility mode for win 8,7,vista. Also renamed the iso folder and iso file with no space. I can't find anymore fix in the internet, so does anyone know how to fix this?

<p>There are no spaces in the iso filename when downloaded from microsoft.</p>
<p>I might download todays most current issue of the <a href="http://aka.ms/DownloadW10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
media creation tool</a> - use it to create the iso <strong>for use on another computer.</strong></p>
<p>Think with windows 8.1 you can mount the iso by double clicking the iso file in file explorer - then run the Setup.exe in its root to start the upgrade process.</p>
<p>You can also alternatively, with a 3rd party zip program like 7-zip, use it to extract the iso to a temporary folder on your C or D partition and then open that folder in file explorer and run the Setup in its root to start the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being that you've tried to install it once already it may have made hidden folders named $windows~?? which I would delete before making the current iso.</p>

    <title>Keeps asking what browser to ,use when opening a Outlook attachment. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjsaiani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keeps asking what browser to ,use when opening a Outlook attachment.</h2>
                    I have Windows 10. on my desktop and Windows 10 Home on my laptop. On both I have the default browser set to Internet Explorer. I'm using IE instead of Edge because I need the use of some add-ons that cannot work on Edge. My issue is that on both computers
 every time I click a link on a email attachment I get the message in the screenshot below. When I click a link a pop up message ask "How do you want to open this". There is also a check box that says "always use this app". Even though I always check the box
 to always use IE, the message comes up every time. If I set Edge or Fire Fox as the default browser I do not get that message. Anyone know of a solution for this? Thank you very much.

    <title>Official -&#91;DICE&#93;- Servers&#63; Where are they and why do - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Official -&#91;DICE&#93;- Servers&#63; Where are they and why do unnofficial servers look like official dice servers.</h2>
                    
<p>First off, let me start by saying i have been a diehard BF fan since BF2: Modern Combat.&nbsp; I have followed the series since then, up to the current installment BF3.&nbsp; I was very impressed by the game and would play most chances I could get.</p>
<p>My concerns started when DICE offered the 'rent-a-sever' program. It seem ok at first, you could customize your own server with the rules you want. That is all well and good, but it is becoming increasingly hard to find an official DICE server anymore. Any
 favorites i had saved are always being erased/decommisioned and any remaining look like official servers, but they are not.</p>
<p>If I were DICE, I would not allow a customer to display themselves as an official server, when they are not. And I refuse to join a match in which admins will boot you for using certains weapons or for doing to well, or for attacking vehicles on the runway.
 Which, is a legitamate tactic employed bu any modern military. If i see you AA gun is not manned or you have 2 jets sitting on the runway, you better believe I am going to hit you where it hurts. I have no guilt about doing so.</p>
<p>So my question is this, how/where can i find official DICE servers so I can play again with no admins? Are all the DICE servers being handed off to renting customers? If this is the case I am coming to the ends of my rope with this company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My search parameters are: +15 players, Conquest, Any Map, Hardcore, all 3 U.S. Regions.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience,</p>
<p>saintmarc</p>

<p>yeah, the idea of not allowing renters to copy official server titles made way too much sense, and DICE isn't having any of that.....but I do agree with you</p>

<p>I posted this just the other day&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
"Official DICE servers are prefixed with “-[DICE]-” and end with a 5- or 6-digit code. Searching for “-[DICE]-” brings up the optimal results in the server browser, but it still returns some private servers which are using the official moniker.</p>
<p>In order to further verify the authenticity of a DICE-hosted server, it is possible to click through and check that the owner is listed as DICE. Official DICE servers also have the welcome message: “This is an official DICE hosted server. Enjoy your stay"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Dice servers are not being "handed off" to renters, there is a fixed amount of them, and EA/DICE will give up their servers to meet rental demand.&nbsp; they recently got in trouble for this so it isn't (IMO) the issue it once was.&nbsp; for a while there were
 NO DICE servers.</p>
<p>You mentioned Hardcore....now that's a whole nuther can of worms....lol</p>

<p>Thank you, posters for your opinions and advice. </p>
<p>@ parallax: Being able to rent-a-sever is a great idea, but allowing private renters to mock an official server using their name and numbering is, imo, borderline infringement, but I do understand there will be people trying to take advantage of any system
 in play for thier own personal gains.</p>
<p>@ vibroluzor: sorry i did not see your posting, I did do a search for the topic, but I did not see any recent topics about this
</p>
<p>issue. And I do realize the nominclatures fo DICE servers, which is why I could usually spot fakes/knock-offs easily before. I also realize that once the server is selected, I can check the 'owners' profile. If there is an owner, it's a dead give away it
 is a fake. I've even booked marked my favorite official DICE servers, for ease of reconnecting, but DICE is either erasing my links or decommisioning the server itself.</p>
<p>@apocacide: I find it hard to believe that DICE doesn't want hardcore players. If that was the case they would just do away with the hardcore settings altogether. I am, in no way, saying core or hardcore is better, but for me I do not get enjotment out of
 core matches and only am interested in hardcore servers in which I have no risk of being booted, except for TKs.</p>
<p>Again, I thank you all for your input. I am still trying to figure out where all the official servers are located and where this game is going before I put any more money into the franchise. Update: As of 7/31/12: I have the same search parameters and did
 a search for -[DICE]-. Altough there was 4 pages of servers, I checked all candidates following DICE nominclature, and suprise, all servers I checked had an 'owner' gamertag associated with it.</p>
<p>I cannot seem to find anymore Official DICE servers for hardcore! Where am I supposed to look?</p>

<p>I did find a bunch of EA servers by searching "P24" last night. I've tried to stay away from them in the past because they always seem to be more laggy than the Dice servers, but I couldn't find 1 single Dice server last night so...</p>

<p>Personally, I don't like the DICE servers either when I do find them since they mix Conquest and Rush. Typically there are always a few EA servers available. Just look for P####### as a server name. They are either retail only or retail and b2k. Normal rules
 and all. They typically fill up well. No crazy rules or stupid rotations. Downside is you cannot favorite them.</p>

<h2>            Login page for guest networks will not load.</h2>
                    When I try to connect to a public/guest network (i.e. Starbucks or hotel wifi) I connect to it, then Microsoft edge pops up and try's to load the login page so I can get internet access, but it just continues to load and stays on a blank screen forever
 and I can never get internet access because I can't login. I know the login page works because I can login on my phone. &nbsp;I tried disabling firewalls and sercurity programs but that didn't work. Any other ideas and suggestions would be really helpful. Thanks

            I have tried different browsers and that didn't work. When I connect to a guest network again I will try to clear the browsers cache to see if that works, but if that doesn't what would you suggest next?

            I've tried everything you suggested and the login page still will not load. To answer your question, windows defender is active and I am also using trend micro security. I've disabled both of those when connecting and still unsussessful.

<h2>            Mic volume level in Windows sound keeps reverting to muted</h2>
                    Windows 8.1 on Dell inspirion 7000 series. after latest Windows update on 7/20/15 my Mic volume keeps getting set to mute every few seconds/minutes(very random, no set time frame). I have set it to&nbsp;"do nothing" under Sound&gt;Communication section, but that
 hasn't helped.&nbsp;I have even restored to before the update but&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;still persists!?&nbsp;It is for a USB headset and I have tested 2 different headsets with same results. Both of these headsets work fine on my personal pc. Any ideas on what could be causing
 this? seems like Windows or 3rd party software causing it....

            <p>I had this same problem. I tried all the fixes suggested and they did not work.</p>
<p>I finally ran a Malware check on my computer which found several instances and cleared them.</p>
<p>That cured my problem and the microphone stopped muting itself.</p>
<p>I used the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I've also tried the above suggestions to no avail. There weren't any recent updates between the time it was working properly to the time it started muting itself randomly. I've also had the Audio Device management tool open and watched as it would randomly
 mute itself. &nbsp;This is beyond frustrating. I was in the middle of an online conference when it started, this issue has caused me undue anxiety as I've had to reschedule my conference with no idea when I will get this resolved.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Are you using the built-in mic or an external? If you already set your preferred mic to default and still having the same issue, check the connector and make sure it doesn't have any physical damage.

            <p>Absolute rubbish advice. The issue is not hardware related. It is reported by so many ppl and all versions of Windows (from 7 up to 10), and none of Microsoft moderator has no clue and not further advice than to "unmute" and eventually to update drivers.
 The fact that reply which I see most of the time is down to the stupid level of; "is you PC turned on ?" is beyond comprehension.</p>

            Scoured the web to find a solution for this. Nothing I was trying was working. It happened to a customer's Windows 10 machine. I used ProcMon to see if I can see anything for when this Mic volume gets muted. I just saw audiodg.exe changing registry values
 related to caudio, AudioProcessingObjects, etc. This is normal because audiodg.exe is just the audio engine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A couple solutions I found online suggested trying a simple malwarebytes scan. What else could cause the audio engine to spontaneously modify the mic registries?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Boom, that fixed the issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If anyone fixes it this way and wants to compare scan results, let me know. :D

<p>Tried you're malwarebytes scan and while I removed some malware, it didn't address the auto-muting Mic issue.</p>

<p>Like many, I'm using a USB headset with Mic</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Tyqa</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your headset might not be working due to compatibility issues, outdated drivers, or faulty hard wares. I would like to know if you have tried plugging in a different headphones/headset/speaker and still get the same issue. If no, then I recommend contacting
 the manufacturer of the device. </p>

<p>Hello grizzer98, I have had a similar problem with a game of mine. Try deleting the game, clear your systems cache by going to System Settings &gt; Storage &gt; Clear System Cache, then re-download your game. After doing so, reset your Xbox360. This has worked
 for me, so I hope it works for you to! :)</p>

            Hi Philip.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Philip, on Community, we are just users like yourself, helping each other out . . .
<br />
<br />It sounds like the feature 1809 update has not gone well . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />If available, this is the best option
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            In addition to the rest of the steps I gave which show every possible method to access the Repair modes, go into UEFI/BIOS setup to see if the hard drive is detected at all (under Storage, usually by Serial or Model Number).  If not then reseat or change it's cable to try to get it to show up.  If it will not then replace it.  
<br />
<br />If it's detected then Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models:

            Hi Phillip, If the other options did not work and you are only left with the Windows Reset option,  then yes, that would remove all 3rd party applications, which would then need to be re-installed . .. 
<br />
<br />Did you not have the Revert to previous build option after that update or a restore point to revert to?       
        </p>
