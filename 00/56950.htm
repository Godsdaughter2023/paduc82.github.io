<h2>            An x86 app not working in win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an app that worked in both XP and 8.1.&nbsp; But, when upgrading to 10, it got weird on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The app is a graphic editing tool called XHeader.exe.&nbsp; For the most part, the interface looks fine in Win 10.&nbsp; But, the most important part, the actual graphic
 editing window, no longer has its typical rectangular shape.&nbsp; Instead of a nice rectangular window, it appears as just a strip (a rectangle with a full width, but a height of just a fraction of an inch).&nbsp; I've tried every button and command that I could find
 in the app to see if there was any way to change the shape of the editing window.&nbsp; But, the app was obviously&nbsp; designed to have a static editing-window shape with no capability for changing its shape.&nbsp; Since this was caused by something in Win 10, are there
 any tools in Win 10 that could help one tweak the display behavior of an app, or maybe a mode designated for x86 apps only?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<h2>            Screen Projection</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 11.&nbsp; Recently I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Prior to the upgrade I was able to project my computer screen to my Samsung HDTV using Netgear Push2TV without a problem&nbsp; Since the upgrade, I am able to wirelessly connect to the TV as indicated
 by the computer.&nbsp; However, the screen remains black.&nbsp; But, I noticed my white arrow curser will appear on the screen, when I move the curser to the far right,&nbsp;which indicates that&nbsp;my projection mode&nbsp;setting is on extended screen.&nbsp; When I attempt to switch
 screen projection mode, I am automatically disconnected from the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;I then need to restart&nbsp;the connection, and the same thing happens.&nbsp; How can I fix this?&nbsp;

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to
 disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if you are able to boot to the desktop.
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> The issue could be due to some Software/update causing the issue. I would
 suggest you to press the <strong><span>Shift key and hold the power button</span></strong> so that it will go to the
<strong><span>recovery options</span></strong>, Select safe mode and boot to the desktop.</span><span> If you are able to boot to the desktop,
 then I would suggest you to upgrade the drivers for display card. As Windows 10 is the new operating the drivers for Windows 10 might not be available. I would suggest you to install in compatibility mode.<br />

            <p>Since asking the question, I have learned that the black screen is actually the computer screen extended.&nbsp; So the computer was able to connect with Push2 TV, but only functions in the extended screen mode.&nbsp; If I drag my work over to the far right I can continue
 to work.&nbsp; So I am assuming the glitch in Windows 10 and Netgear is the ability to switch projection modes not necessarily connecting with Netgear.</p>

            I wouldn't make that assumption, because, according to the latest information on Netgear's site this product hasn't been tested for compatibility with Windows 10. I would suggest that you make sure that you have the latest firmware updates installed from
 the Netgear's site and keep checking there for confirmation on Windows 10 compatibility.&nbsp;

    <title>Does Windows 10 Pro have a built is Self Destruct Cycle&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yountmg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows 10 Pro have a built is Self Destruct Cycle&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro has crashed on me twice and it looked like I was headed for a 4th installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors messages that Windows 10 Pro generates appear to be cyclic, repeatable and even predictable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got lucky and read something on the internet about fast boot and hibernate. This post did not relate to the to my error so that is why I say I was lucky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 hibernate makes a copy of memory and stores it as a pre-load fetch file for Fast Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast boot loads the pre-load file which enables Windows to start up really fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means is that Windows 10 is not shutting down nor is it starting &nbsp;up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how Microsoft solves the error propagation problem inherit to the fast boot/hibernation process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled fast boot and hibernate and most of my errors disappeared.</p>
<p>
I think this could be an explanation for all the various error messages I keep getting.<br />
<br />
1. Windows update does not work because it often requires a reboot and hibernate doesn't do than.<br />
2. Power shut down error messages are invalid because hibernate is not really powering down.<br />
3. Power start error messages are also invalid because you are not really powering up.&nbsp;<br />
4. Third party software error messages are also invalid, because fast boot/hibernate may not be compatible with them?<br />
5. Registry memory leaks may also be invalid, since applications can not release the registry properly because you are not doing a powering up or power down.<br />
6. Data archives may not be properly flushed or reloaded because you are not doing an actual shutdown so they become corrupted after windows updater downloads them?<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>The possibility also exists for whatever reason that the motherboard does not support fast boot which apparently comes enabled by default during installation. &nbsp;My motherboard supports fast boot, but does it need a bios update? &nbsp;How did Microsoft solve the
 possible error propagation problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that fast boot and hibernate are not necessary when booting from a SSD.<br />
note: its also not really recommended, just because its adds unnecessary wear and tear to the SSD.<br />
</p>
I can not really tell any difference when booting up, except a lot of my supposedly harmless error messages have disappeared.<br />
<p>
</p><p>I am still getting error messages however, but they are installation and fixable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have broken the crash cycle? </p>
<p>I hope. T.B.D.</p>
<p>

            <p>Good news, two days error free since I disabled fast boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that my earlier assumptions about memory failures and internet errors were probably incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling fast boot and hibernate worked wonders. &nbsp;The errors I was getting just vanished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made an inquiry if a bios update would fix fast boot, but in all honesty I don't think fast boot is really necessary because I am using a SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why the errors accumulate and multiply like rabbits when using fast boot, but it becomes a major problem when event viewer fills up with a lot of false errors, possibly hiding the real problems and/or attributing to real failures that lead
 to other real problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that many of these bogus errors were Windows 8 system errors. &nbsp;I would have expected these Windows 8 errors to have been fixed with the Windows 10 release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since software and hardware interact and everyone has different hardware, I am not certain that this happens on every Windows 10 System or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started using Windows 10 again and so far I have not had any problems, but its takes time to properly check out the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still looking for a fix for Windows Update, I am checking event viewer ever time I boot up and manually register the store packages as they come in? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Joysanders,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming back to these forums. There are a few couple of steps you can try to get this resolved. You can try r<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">emoving
 your profile from the console</a>, and then re-signing in. If this doesn't work, have you tried uninstalling the game? If not, give it a shot and then re-install it using the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To report this issue, it would be best to use the insider hub :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your console, install the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Insider Hub</a> app (if you don’t already have it). </li><li>Hold down the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on the controller. </li><li>On the power menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Report a problem</strong>. </li><li>Describe the problem in detail, including when it happened, if you saw any specific error codes or messages, and if you were using any specific games, software, hardware, or accessories when you encountered the problem.

<br />
<br />Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />Try to do following steps:
<br />
<br />Go to  Windows Settings &gt; All Settings &gt;  System &gt; Apps and features &gt; find Camera &gt; choose Advanced Options &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />If this procedure does not work then we'll try to do something else.

            Try to do 2 procedure
<br />
<br />First: Change Folder Permissions
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer and right-click on Pictures folder.
<br />Open Give access to and select a Specific people option.
<br />Add yourself to the access list.
<br />Perform the same steps to change permissions for Videos folder and Camera Roll folders.
<br />
<br />and if does not work then Update Camera drivers
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Now expand Imaging devices section and right-click on webcam's entry.
<br />Select the Update Driver Software option.
<br />Click Browse my computer for software driver option on the pop-up window.
<br />Select Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer option.
<br />Make sure that the Show compatible hardware check box is marked. If not, then mark it.
<br />Select USB Video Device and click Next.
<br />The system should automatically update camera drivers. Once done, reboot the system.
<br />
<br />If that did not help, try to reinstall Imaging device drivers. For this purpose, open Device Manager -&gt; Imaging Devices as explained above, but instead of Update button, click Uninstall. Once done, reboot the system and navigate to Device Manager again. Here, you should do the following:
<br />
<br />Open Actions tab at the top of the window.
<br />Select Scan for hardware changes.
<br />Now the system should automatically detect missing driver and download its latest version automatically.

<h2>            Display color calibration resets on resolution change</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Win7 x64: color calibration resets on resolution change&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've bought a benq xl2420t monitor, which is somewhat notorious for its poor, greenish initial color calibration. I've downloaded a specific .ICC profile and applied it through windows color management's default settings. Now that's where the problem arises:
 the profile works fine and remains persistent during even during reboot. But it reverts to defaults after switching resolutions, or more specifically enabling and disabling the monitor's strobe mode (regular mode is regarded by windows as 1080p@120hz resolution,
 strobe is 1080p@121hz). This quickly becomes very frustrating, as most fullscreen games utilize the strobed resolution by default, which means that the color calibration resets when I switch back to unstrobed. To reapply the calibration, I need to relaunch
 the windows color profiling tool every time and click the "reload calibration" button. Is there a workaround to this?</div>
<div>I'm usting a self-built desktop, with nvidia gtx780 and a benq xl2420t monitor. The strobe mode is provided by a simple utility called Strobelight.</div>

            I have an XL 2410T but it does not have lightboost&nbsp; which started with 3D vision 2.<br />
I would have thought that lightboost was only used with 3D vision games, except when<br />
enabled to reduce LCD motion blur ( why I'd like a newer version BenQ ).<br />
<br />
You may do better asking about this at the BenQ or TFT Central forums, but in addition to<br />
going over the tutorials linked by Amit -<br />
<br />
- Are you saying that when you change resolutions from native to something lower and then<br />
change back to the native res that the settings in the&nbsp; monitor OSD are changed, or that there is<br />
a visible change in the colour that indicates the calibration has changed back to default from the<br />
ICC profile ?<br />
Was the ICC profile installed&nbsp; while the monitor was in it's native resolution, as suggested by MS ?<br />
<br />
- I use an ICC profile, but don't dare play with the Windows Colour settings setup for fear of changing or disabling the ICC profile.
<br />
I did originally start calibration with Windows colour settings, but haven't&nbsp; run through<br />
it since installing the ICC profile. I have tweaked the monitors OSD settings again just after installing<br />
the ICC profile though.<br />
If I wanted to change the ICC profile I'd&nbsp; just R/click on the ICC profile and then click on<i> install</i>.<br />
Which is how I think (from memory) I installed the profile at the start.<br />
<br />
There is a small software that is supposed to lock the ICC profile. I may only be useful with games though.&nbsp; I've downloaded it, but haven't bothered trying it -<br />
<a href="http://goebish.free.fr/cpk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CPKeeper (Color Profile Keeper)</a>
<br />
<br />
I'm not using the XL2410 on my Nvidia machine and don't recall what their similar setting is called,
<br />
but I also avoid ticking the box in the AMD control centre Desktop color options that says -
<i><br />
'Reactivate AMD color controls'</i> .<br />
<br />
Assuming that you have setup the ICC profile correctly&nbsp; I would wonder if there is a problem with
<br />
the monitor ? <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists I would also suggest you to start the Audio service and set it to Automatic:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Go to the Start screen.</p>
<p>b. Type “<strong>Services.msc</strong>” without quotes and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Right click on Audio<strong>&nbsp;service</strong> and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Set the <strong>Startup type</strong> as <strong>Automatic</strong> and then click
<strong>Start</strong>under <strong>Service status</strong>.</p>
<p>e. Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I suggest you to set the speaker as the default audio device and check.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “<strong>Windows Key + C</strong>” to open a “Charms Bar” <br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to settings and type control panel and select sound.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Playback tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is Speakers. Make sure that your audio settings are configured as expected. Follow these steps:<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Properties, click the Advanced tab, and make sure that the Default Format is set to the value that you expect. When you finish, close this window to return to the previous window.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Configure, and then make sure the configurations are set correctly.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click Set Default.<br />
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK to save your settings and to close the Sound dialog box,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Please post back if the issue persists and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Add icon to taskbar via group policy without removing or adding any programs to taskbar or start menu.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to add a program to everyone in my company's taskbar and it seems like the best (only) way to do this is through the "Start Layout" group policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have two problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The program (.lnk file) is not pinning at all. I've added the local location to the .xml file and it just refuses to pin. I've taken templates from Microsoft's own knowledgebase and just replace the location with my program's location. No dice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't want to mess with people's start menu (some users have it set up a certain way and would freak out if it were to be messed up) however, every time I enable the gpo it will delete all icons on the start menu and reapply the default icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had any experience with this and could be any help? Is this even possible anymore? I know it was really easy on Windows 7... but apparently it has to be complicated now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10 Pro 1803 btw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joey&nbsp;</p>

                    nearly 8 weeks after Creators Update release and still not available to my laptop (check for updates says up-to-date).&nbsp;&nbsp;I know about manually updating but since I heard MS blocked some devices due to issues with the update, I am leery about manually overriding
 Windows Update.&nbsp; how long will it take before Creators Update&nbsp;shows up in my Windows Update?&nbsp; (currently running Pro Anniversary Update 32-bit (yeah, it's an old laptop...))

But if you haven't received the update and are still waiting ... I’ll show you an easy way to install the update now without a lengthily wait before it is your turn (Microsoft will not make the update to everyone at the same time). So I'll show you how to get Windows Update to do its job now and download and install the Creators Update on April 5th or anytime thereafter.">

<p>thanks for the list of compatible computers.&nbsp; my laptop is an HP purchased before Aug&nbsp;2013 and HP says they are not testing it for Creators Update.&nbsp; Windows Update successfully updated&nbsp;the laptop&nbsp;to Anniversary so&nbsp;i'm hopeful&nbsp;Creators will work, but maybe
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in any event, seems like my choices are to wait for Windows Update to offer 1703 (I
<em>do</em> have the Windows Update message that&nbsp;it is on the way, and i can get it early (manual) if i want to.)&nbsp;or do manual upgrade.&nbsp; not sure Creators is compelling enough, nor am i brave enough, for that.</p>
<p>

            That's good to know.&nbsp; Since my desktop did receive Creators Update,&nbsp;I will just&nbsp;wait a bit longer to see what happens with the laptop.&nbsp; Hopefully 1703 will arrive before the next update in the fall--if not,&nbsp;I will definitely submit feedback!&nbsp;:)

<p>yay, I got Creators Update!&nbsp; it arrived amazingly close to release under the Business update cycle, I have no idea if that is coincidental (I checked and my laptop updates are on "Current" cycle, not Business cycle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway, it installed fine and appears to be working great.&nbsp; now my laptop and desktop are on the same version and the OCD part of me is happy.</p>

            8007#### codes are associated Windows updates.
<br />
<br />This code appears when Windows is installing "stuff", not just store apps.  It appears to be reporting a problem creating folders during the update/install.  
<br />
<br />That fits with your problem. The store automagically applies updates for us without notification, so when you are trying to log in to an app it is trying to update and failing.
<br />
<br />Since you have the problem in more than one app, it is probably best if you reset the whole store environment.
<br />

<br />2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10

<br />
<br />..0. Restart the computer
<br />  1. Win Store Trouble Shooter
<br />  2. Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
<br />  3. Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
<br />  4. Reg hack for Connection errors
<br />  5. Re-Register the Store
<br />
<br />Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
<br />
<br />Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
<br />
<br />#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
<br />Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
<br />
<br />#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a> 
<br />

<br />
<br />Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
<br />
<br />Use the built in Trouble shooter
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
<br />Scroll down to the bottom 
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
<br /><a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-w...</a> 
<br />
<br />Run as Admin.
<br />
<br />Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
<br />
<br />#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
<br />the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
<br />Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows...</a>

<br />Create a System restore point. (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402753...</a> )
<br />
<br />Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions in this page: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058...</a> - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
<br />
<br />The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.

<br />This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
<br />
<br />
<br />After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
<br />. – in start menu search for Windows Update
<br />. - click on “Check for Updates”
<br />. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

<h2>            Random Xbox Live Suspension</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I got back from a 10 day trip and was playing xbox for a few hours, I didn't try to purchase anything on the xbox store or really do anything except play a couple games I have installed on my xbox one x. After a few hours I got an email saying my account was having action taken against it out of nowhere, I clicked on the link in the email and apparently my account is having action taken against it because of "Marketplace Fraud" I have no idea what this means but all my games were either paid for by my credit card or with Microsoft gift cards. I tried calling support and also tried chat support but they aren't even able to give me an actual explanation or reason why this happened, what a joke! Now I'm stuck with a 7 day suspension for no real reason with no kind of actual explanation. If Microsoft wants to just ban or suspend their customers with no explanation then I hope they enjoy losing customers!</p>

    <title>How can I view ALL files in the current directory when in a save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;greg&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I view ALL files in the current directory when in a save dialog&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Like the subject says, I'd like the "Open..." , "Save..." and "Save As..." standard Windows dialog boxes to, by default, show
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>all</strong></span> files in the dialog box, not just the ones that correspond with the current "Save as type."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially the same concept as looking for "All Files (*.*)" in an "Open..." dialog box. But without having to select that from the document type dropdown selector in the dialog box to the right of the filename. Set the default filetype to be "*.*" throughout
 all file dialog boxes, system-wide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there's no option (and no workaround) to see <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>all</strong></span> the files in a directory when you're in a "Save..." or "Save As..." dialog box, you're limited to the specific types of files your current program can save or save as.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: If you're in Microsoft Word and you want to save your document as a .docx, your file dialog changes the view so that you see only .docx files and the folder/directory structure. I'd like it to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOT</strong></span> do this, and always show all the files in the directory, regardless of file extension or file type.
</p>
<p>This would allow the user to:</p>
<ul>
<li>More easily recognize the folder they're saving into, by seeing the other familiar files located in the same directory</li><li>View file naming conventions and revisions or other file information directly in the "Save..." or "Save As..." dialog boxes, without having to leave the program, look at the same directory in Windows Explorer, and then enter the program again</li><li>Easily click-copy the name of a differing file and then "Save As" with the same filename but a different extension (For example, save an Excel document as .xlsx, and then export a .csv version of the same file with the same naming convention)</li></ul>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;If you select the menu SAVE or SAVE AS TYPE</p>
<p>If there is a selection there to show ALL, then you can show all. But not all save or save as dialog boxes gives you this option. It has always been this way. If you select a folder to save a file, then wouldn't a person already know what is in that folder
 or the types of files they saved in that folder?</p>
<p>And that is a menu to SAVE or SAVE as TYPE, so why would it list all types of files you can SAVE or SAVE as if the file can not be saved in that format or file extension. Then people would be saving a JPG file as a TXT file and the file would be useless,
 unless they new better and could just change the file extension back to the correct file extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for OPEN, most always the program used to browse to open a file will have specific files that you can only open or run, therefore it would not list files that it could not open or run as that makes sense and also makes it easier and faster to just select
 a compatible file.</p>

<p>Yep. Totally agree; not all "Save..." or "Save As..." dialog boxes give you this option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also know that it has "always been this way" on Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; - however -</p>
<p>That doesn't make it correct. Lets see if Microsoft can fix this annoyance.<br />
<br />
The program wouldn't be able to actually save a .TXT file as a .JPG, that would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>Same with open. Obviously a program like Adobe Photoshop won't actually open a .xlsx file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, inside the file dialog box, when you're viewing the directory, you'd be able to SEE all of the files, for the reasons outlined in the original post.</p>

<p>That doesn't make it correct. Lets see if Microsoft can fix this annoyance.<br />
<br />
The program wouldn't be able to actually save a .TXT file as a .JPG, that would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>Same with open. Obviously a program like Adobe Photoshop won't actually open a .xlsx file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, inside the file dialog box, when you're viewing the directory, you'd be able to SEE all of the files, for the reasons outlined in the original post.</p>

<p>That was an example if it would allow you to view all files and allow you to save a jpg as txt. I did not say that was possible</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X Fan sounds way louder than usual</h2>
                    My Xbox One X fan sounds like a jet about to take off when I'm&nbsp;playing games, it sounds silent when I'm&nbsp;just sitting on Xbox home or watching Twitch or Netflix, but soon as a start up a game it gets loud sometimes it even causes my&nbsp;Xbox to turn off on
 its own while I'm in a middle of a game which is very frustrating, My Xbox One X should not be&nbsp;overheating since its not hot to the touch and its at a well-ventilated area, do anyone else have or had this issue? and if you did do you have any possible&nbsp;solutions
 or should I just send my&nbsp;Xbox to Microsoft&nbsp;to repair.

</blockquote>
<p>If you play a Xbox One X enhanced game it's normal for the fan to be louder than when on Xbox Home or watching video apps like Netflix or Twitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the console turning off is not. Can you check if your console is directly connected to a wall outlet, or if you use a power strip? Can you connect the console directly to the wall outlet? If possible, also try a different wall outlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the console is turning off then this is usually due to overheating (the console does not need to feel hot or the air coming out of it as the overheating occurs between the heatsink and the chipset), The fan will always speed up if the system detects that
 the hardware is getting too hot.</p>

</p><p>You could try the troubleshooting article for the console unexpectedly turning off, other than that if it keeps happening then you would need to register it for repair.</p>

<p>While it's completely normal to hear the fan on the One X, it's not normal for it to be extremely loud, sounding like a jet engine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge this could be caused by the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Console airflow restricted, either due to location or console is vertical without the stand, therefore blocking ventilation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulty temperature sensor. Machine believes it is overheating so ramps up the fans. Machine goes off to prevent damage. Maybe a false positive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seen some videos of this fault on YouTube. Pretty sure the comment I read was the replacement worked fine.</p>

            Ok I moved it and it has not shut off sense but the Xbox One X Fan noise is not constant and is still loud maybe not as loud as a jet engine like I describe before but still loud way louder than my Xbox One S and OG Xbox One, it would have a fan burst
 when I'm&nbsp;playing which is loud and annoying and the fan noise would never be at a constant noise level while I'm&nbsp;playing a game.

<p>Your Xbox has certain speeds for exactly the temperature it is at.&nbsp; If you have a disc game in the friction does apply more than digital games but in my experience I've seen this happen due to damage to one of the fan blades or something obstructing the
 fan when its heavily used. Short of sending in your console for maintenance &nbsp;there is no troubleshooting if it is a hardware issue. Visit our

<p>
</p><p>Looking at all these non technical replies im shaking my head. If your xbox is jet engine loud its most likely defective. Usually a loud console will come with bad thermal paste application or dried up thermal paste from the factory. Usually if the console
 is new Id recommend returning it for a replacement but since its a been a while, the best thing to do is open the console up and apply a fresh amount of the highest quality thernal paste you can find. Get someone to do it for you or watch some YouTube videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are currently two games with known issues with the Xbox One X. Call of Duty Modern Warfare and Borderlands 3. If you're playing one of these games, it seems that there is a bug in the game that causes the console to use "too much" processing power
 and shutting the console down. Since the console "assumes" the shutdown was due to overheating, you get that message after restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activision/Inifinity Ward and 2K/Gearbox are aware of that issue and are working on a patch that fixes that issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also be aware that other games that are Xbox One X Enhanced use more computing power as other games which produces more heat, and this will cause the fans to run faster than when you're just watching video streams. So if the fan is running faster/louder
 than when watching a video, this is also quite normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a fan "sounds like a jet about to take off", it's quite a subjective comparison. Yes, the fan will sound louder when the console is "working harder" with a game, but unless it sounds like a broken fan rattling in it's bearings, it's normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The console has built in temperature sensors that shut the console off if the fan is failing and the console runs too hot (with the exception of the two games mentioned above). That way the console protects itself from overheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still think the fan sounds defective, you will have to sign up your console for repair/replacement at

            <p><span>Hi delorisf,<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>What is the exact error message that you get?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to stop and re-start the volume shadow service.<br />
a. Click on Start, type services and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate the service "Volume Shadow Copy" and right click and click "Stop".<br />
c. .Once the service is stopped, then locate the service "Volume Shadow Copy" and right click and click "Start".</span></p>
<p><span>d. Close Services windows.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;Note:</strong> If you stop and start the service your restore points will be lost.</span></p>

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Manage-services-in-Windows-Vista-from-Windows-Vista-Inside-Out</a><br />
<b><br />
Method 2:</b></span></p>
<p><span>You can try to run a SFC scan to check for any corrupted files and try to start the
<br />
swprv and VSS services.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to run the SFC scan:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus software and firewall on the computer and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
Disable antivirus software<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Make sure you enable the antivirus software &nbsp;and firewall after the test.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You can also run a Checkdisk to see if there are any disk errors which might be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link:</span></p>

 Turning UAC off.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;resulting installation leaves me with a program that will run fine in&nbsp;hidden administrator but not nromal administrator.&nbsp; Even though the install ation was done as normal anministrator.</p>

<p>Thank you for your assistance ITKnowledge24.&nbsp; Your post helped me find parts of the program that I would never know that existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It turns out that my problem was in two parts.&nbsp; First what killed the software in the first place is an unrelated print dirver.&nbsp; (go figure)&nbsp; The install errors&nbsp;were caused because I downloaded the most recient version from the manufacturer's website.&nbsp;
 When I reinstalled using the old version the install was error free.&nbsp; The software started to run correctly when the print driver was deleted.&nbsp; It seems that windows security was only a red herring.</p>

    <title>CALL OF DUTY AUTO AIM BOTS FOUND CAUSED BY RAPID FIRE CONTROLLERS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nato gradeshots  say:</h3>
<h2>            CALL OF DUTY AUTO AIM BOTS FOUND CAUSED BY RAPID FIRE CONTROLLERS</h2>
                    
<p>It doesn't just speed up the fire rate, the actually real unseen problem is the auto aim feature when you hold the left trigger, this allows the person to play on a 10 look sensitivity and perfectly auto aim and lock on too the target with just a hold of
 the trigger. With out it you would have to constantly click the left trigger to get the auto aim affect. I dont know if anyone ever notice; clicking the left trigger rappidly creates an auto aim feature increase your hit marker accuracy. So with a rapid fire
 left trigger your aim capablity is much greater than one could achieve with fast finger clicks.</p>
<p>Rapid fire is an auto aim bot, because of the high rate of the left aim function, allowing the player to player to play with a 10 look sensitivity and get a hit marker with the frist shot, this places anyone on a lower sensitivity and those not clicking
 the left trigger at all, or with real finger pushes; at a big disadvantage.</p>
<p>Remember make sure your not just holding that left trigger theres is an auto aim function on it, so clicking the left trigger as quickly as possible for it allows the player a more acurate shot,, this has to be done without &nbsp;breaking your aim down your sight
 though. Try it, bet you thank me, this work for all COD series, bet your game increase significatly. however if your playing someone with a modded controller that has rapid fire, remember you &nbsp;will be stomped because of it though.</p>
<p>Code of conduct states you are not able to use any consoles or equipment not certified through Xbox, and as to this date on the official Xbox website, there is no market offers they have that sells any controllers with a rapid fire function. So any controller
 claiming to have a rapid fire functionality, is consider to be a mod or hacking the Xbox system, This should be banned and monitored, for it's chasing away legit newcomers from playing these games, because for a an extra 30 dollars and the will to cheat, the
 player makes the game a fustrating encountare. However this is not only hard to prove, but it would cost extra loss revenue, however Xbox should realize, that these people have money to spend; so more than like they will just go out and buy an entirely new
 Xbox and a new game. So in retro spec it actually would generate even more sells for the Corporation. And this is easy to monitor any controller with more than 40 button pushs per second is a mod and that controller has been hacked, for really who can push
 a button more than 40 times a sec. And the actually standard for rapid fire controllers is 233 button pushes a sec; so yeah the average no cheater is at a big disadvantage.</p>
<p>Auto aim bot is a person using a rapid fire controller to expliot the left trigger in game auto aim function. Cant no one push a button 233 times a second, this aint that hard to detect. Non cheater start a voice and call Xbox on this, for United we can
 stop them but apart we stand no chance.</p>
<p>Sincerly,</p>
<p>PS. XBOX I COULD WRITE THE CODE TO DETECT THIS FEATURES EXPOLITS, AND I KNOW I'M NOT CLOSE TO AS SMART AS YOUR TECHNICIANS. SO PLEASE HELP US NON CHEATERS, IT SHOULD GENARATE MORE INCOME FOR THE CORP. ANYWAY, IF YOU BAN THEM FOR A REAL EXPLIOT THEY WILL
 BUY ANOTHER XBOX AND SPEND MORE MONEY,</p>

<p>SORRY JUST BECAUSE SOME INTERNET COMPANY CLAIMS TO HAVE AN OFFICAIL XBOX RAPID FIRE CONTROLLER DOESNT MAKE IT TRUE. THERE IS NO CONTROLLER WITH THIS FUNCTION AVAILABE ON THE OFFICIAL XBOX WEBSITE, CHECK THE XBOX WEBSITE NO RAPID FIRE, AND ANYTHING THAT CANT
 BE BOUGHT ON THEIR WEBSITE IS CONSIDERED UN-OFFICIAL. JUST BECAUSE SOME WEBSITE SAYS THEIR CONTROLLER ARE LEGIT IT'S NOT ACURATE, ONCE THEY OPEN THEM CONTROLLERS AND INSERT THAT CHIP TO ALLOW THE RAPID FIRE FUNCTIONALITY; THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS HACKED
 AND CONSIDERED A MOD, AND NOT ALLOWED ONLINE. </p>
<p>AND REMEMBER THE CONTROLLER CAN LOOK JUST LIKE THE ONES XBOX SELLS HOWEVER ONCE THAT CONTROLLER IS OPENED AND THAT CHIP IS INSERTED BY THAT COMPANY CLAIMING IT'S A OFFICIAL CONTROLLER THAT CONTROLLER IS HACKED. AND WHAT THEY FORGET TO TELL YOU WAS IT WAS
 AN OFFICIAL CONTROLLER TILL THEY HACKED IT, THAN IT BECAME A MOD, AND ACCORDING TO THE CODE OF CONDUCT ANY ATTEMPT TO ALTER EQUIPMENT, REVERSE ENGINEER, OR MODIFY XBOX PARTS CAN RESULT IN THE SUSPENSION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>

<p>[/quote] how dumb are you? i proved you wrong. read the post, watch the video clips yourself. 2 of the clips were clearly the pc version and the other video which is an old video from the 360 showed a well known glitch that has been fixed and once again&nbsp;there
 are no mods&nbsp;for black ops online on the xbox 360.&nbsp;what more is there to prove?</p>

<p>I downloaded motogp 15, &nbsp;after every practice, qualifying and warmup, the game freezes and has to restart itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can anyone please help or recommend who to contact.</p>

<p>Hey again everyone,</p>
<p>I'm truly sorry to hear about the freezing issues being experienced. As I previously posted in this thread, we suggest, if you haven't already,&nbsp;trying out these troubleshooting steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/downloadable-content/uninstall-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall</a>&nbsp;MotoGP 15 from your Xbox One console.
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power Cycle your Xbox One console</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;holding the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;button on the front of the console for approximately 10 seconds. The console will power down.
</li><li>Once your console is completely off, unplug&nbsp;the console from the power source and wait about three minutes.
</li><li>After three minutes has passed, plug all the cords back in and turn on your console.
</li><li>Sign into your account and download/install MotoGP 15 to your console and try playing it again.
</li></ul>
<p>If the troubleshooting steps above don't seem to make a difference and you're still getting the freezing issues, I would then strongly recommend contacting MotoGP 15's developer,&nbsp;<a href="http://milestone.it/contacts/support/?lang=en&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Milestone
 srl</a>.&nbsp;Those are the proper folks to get in touch with for further assistance regarding MotoGP 15. Hope this helps, thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            External Drive won&#39;t work on 10, worked on 7</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My external drive won't come on, it shows the number but no box telling how much free space and how much used, I talked to&nbsp;Acer and they couldn't help. Also talked to the external drive people at StarTech, no help there. When I go " Device and Drives
 " and DiskMgmt the letter is there if the drive is tuned on, when the drive is on it shows a green bar going across the top then I either get a warning message, one says:: f:\ is not accessible the request could not be performed because of an I/O device error..&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The other says:: Location not available f:\ is not assessable the parameter is incorrect..&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea what it all means, all I know it worked on windows 7 but not 10. Please put answer in an easy to understand format for an old guy to understand.. Do
 I need to drop 10 and go back to 7??? </p>

            <p>&nbsp; Tried that, didn't work so I went back to Windows 7 and it works just fine. Windows 10 must not like external drives as I tried everything, external disk company, Computer Company, no one, and I mean no one could help and that includes a computer guy.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now that I'm back on Windows 7 everything works great..&nbsp; Thanks for trying. Till I'm sure everything will work on 10 I'm staying on 7 for now. Don't get me wrong, I liked 10, it just wouldn't run some things like external drives.
