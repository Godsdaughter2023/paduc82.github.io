<h2>            Windows XP to Windows 7 - old PC setting to New PC</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am planning on buying a new PC for the parents for Christmas. The one I am going to get has Windows 7 already pre-installed. On the PC they currently use they have Windows XP so I know I need to back up files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is since Windows 7 was probably not installed on this new PC using a custom install will I be able to use the windows tool to backup the old files and setting from the old PC (onto an external drive) and then use the tool to put them on the
 new PC?

            Windows Easy Transfer will backup your personal files, settings, emails and contacts. Once you have done a clean install of Windows 7 on your computer launch Windows Easy Transfer in Windows 7 (Click Start, type: Windows Easy Transfer), follow the on screen
 wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.<br />
<br />
Additional resources:<br />
Upgrading from Windows XP?<br />
<br />
Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.<br />
<br />
Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).<br />
<br />
More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.<br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.<br />

    <title>Why are Xbox One controllers so poorly built&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kushkaki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are Xbox One controllers so poorly built&#63;</h2>
                    Without fault my last 4 Xbox one controllers no longer work via cable, and each has their own variety of buttons/bumpers not working or stuck. I just warrantied my last one, but I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this? Is the build quality degrading
 or am i just getting bad controllers? My most recent controller I've had for less than a month before it fell off my bed onto my carpet and the cable doesn't work, but then a few days later my thumbstick popped out? Are third party controllers more solid?

<p>I haven't had any issues with my controllers (I use the Xbox One Elite controllers) the only issues i have is the LB on my oldest one has popped out of place, and needs repairing, but I believe that is done to miss use/ my brother miss treating it, since
 that is the controller he uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your controller fell off your bed onto the carpet, was the cable plugged in? If so, it could have damaged the connection port on the controller where the cable plugs in, or the cable itself, have you inspected that port, and the connection on the cable
 that plugs into the controller for damage?</p>
<p>Have you tried another cable with that controller?</p>

<p>I have seven of them (for three Xbox One S consoles), which are all around two years old. They’ve been dropped and banged into things plenty of times. The worst one of them ever suffered was a stuck RB button, which was an easy fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Razer Wildcat Xbox controller which I love and is quite robust, but I might be inclined to caution against you spending that much on a controller when your history with them is so poor.</p>

<p>Got to admit i don't think the xbox one controllers are anywhere near as robust (in my experience) as xbox 360 controllers for accidental damage e.g. dropping on floor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first xbox one s controller broke after 92 days (2 days out of warranty conveniently) for no apparent reason as it had ever been dropped or damaged, luckily there are place online that you can buy replacement boards for the controllers to fit yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new controller is okay now after 12 months but its nice new play and charge kit fails to work after less than 3 months of use (cable issue) luckily any micro usb charges it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i would say is the thumbstick sensors in the xbox one controllers last far far longer than any other previous controller i have used, after 12 months the sticks are still solid and no ghosting where as my xbox 360 controller would have these sensors
 replaced every few months.</p>

            I think you are very unlucky, i have more then 10 controllers the only one that left me is the 2013 Day One but after thousands of hour of service! Surely if you want a much more durable controller i recommend you the Elite Controller.

<p>Yes I also made a very long discussion post. About this same quality of controllers being made for the Xbox and quality is very poor especially for the cost of controllers!</p>
<p>We all need to keep discussions of this nature going so it's not swept under the rug by other topics</p>

            I've not had any issues like this.&nbsp; I've had 2 controllers that have had audio jack issues sadly.&nbsp; Which is a shame as I use my headset almost daily.&nbsp; But never any issues with build quality.

            i honestly agree with you.. this company is soo disgusting when it comes down to quality and terms of service as well and the poor customer service that is issued when it comes to fixing hardware enforcement team and complaints.. around my area.. these
 xbox ambassadors are kissing the chiefs ****... lmao forever will they, they are getting rewarded anywhere they go. either way ive noticed it too alot ive bought lots of new controllers that were brand new didnt wanna connect to my xbox or had delay of game
 pressing.. or the controller just didnt work at all and it was just a bust lmao.. ive told the company about it they wont do anything.. dont buy the next gen console go to playstation.. some people dont mistreat products until product give a reason to be mistreated
 like me.. i dont got patience.. as many others will beg to differ with this because everyone is different however with me if i buy something for 70 dollars and or if anything 300 dollars like a new xbox one console i want them to la

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p><br />
I understand that you are getting error “Windows could not start the Superfetch service on local computer” in Windows vista</p>
<p><br />
You may try taking permission of the registry key &amp; check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Important</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry in Windows:<br />

<p><br />
a. Type ‘regedit’ in the start search box, and then click OK.</p>
<p><br />
Locate the following registry key: </p>
<p><br />
HKLM\system\CurrentControlSet\services\sysmin</p>
<p><br />
b. Follow the steps from below:</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;Right click on the Folder select Properties.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Security tab. <br />
3.&nbsp;Choose Edit button (if prompted to click continue, please click on continue).<br />
4.&nbsp;Select Add type in ‘Everyone’ (without quotes).<br />
5.&nbsp;Click on Check names.<br />
6.&nbsp;Click Ok.<br />
7.&nbsp;Under Group or user name select everyone.<br />
8.&nbsp;Under Permissions for system check allow full control.</p>

            Unfortunately the solution falls at the first hirdle. I don't appear to have the registry key HKLM\system\CurrentControlSet\services\sysmin. Maybe this is the missing file the error message refers to. Is there a way to recover this?

    <title>TPM chip locked out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave b - opt  say:</h3>
<h2>            TPM chip locked out</h2>
                    <p>Something went wrong with a TPM chip on one of our laptops. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop asked for the Bitlocker recovery key (which it accepted) but didn't let us into the Azure connected Windows account with the PIN we created. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We logged in under the Local Admin account and turned Bitlocker off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the TPM chip is locked. We can't enable it from tpm.msc as it says;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a45d194-8008-4ca5-8429-a2b534db77a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a45d194-8008-4ca5-8429-a2b534db77a8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been like this for 24 hours now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've clear the TPM chip in the BIOS</p>
<p>I've also flashed the BIOS</p>
<p>I've reset Windows using the 'Recovery' console in the settings.</p>
<p>I even tried enabling Bitlocker without a TPM chip from gpedit.msc and we're getting the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can we do? How do we clear the TPM chip since we are the owners?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Stephanie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to solve it. I left the computer on for around 48 hours (without letting it go to standby) and then done the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Cleared TPM in the BIOS again</p>
<p>2. Ran 'Clear-Tpm' in Powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yes they could if you have a debit/credit card on there.&nbsp; I suggest you contact support ASAP so that they can investigate and put your stolen account into lock down.&nbsp;

<p>Just a FYI to you:&nbsp; There are many ways to lose access to an account, either by handing your Live ID to a third party, being phished or socially engineered but you CAN NOT be hacked.</p>

<p>So if you can not be hacked at all you must be saying there is a way for people to guess your passwords cause I was hac....eh hmm......the victim of unauthorized use (hacked) and have never given my password or inputted my password anywhere other than the
 sign in page here. There are also many other entries to forums with similar stories...let me guess FIFA 12 shows up as last game played 2 or 3 achievements locked then DLC purchased with existing MS points or CC abuse to buy more MS points???? Look around,
 there are alot of us on here.</p>

<p>Having a strong password is always a good idea, but it's only part of good security protection.&nbsp; There are as I've stated before many ways to lose access to an account.&nbsp;Examples of which may&nbsp;include:<br />
<br />
Giving your LIVE ID out to someone you don't know, or even someone you do.&nbsp; <strong>
NEVER</strong> give your LIVE ID to anyone!<br />
Falling for a Phishing scam usually sent via an email. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/online-privacy/phishing-symptoms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/online-privacy/phishing-symptoms.aspx</a><br />
Social engineering<br />
Computer virus or key logger on your computer<br />
Logging in with your Windows ID on an unsecured computer, or another computer that is not yours and failing to log out.<br />
Falling for scams that promise to provide free points.<br />
Signing up to suspect&nbsp;external sites using the same email address and password you use Windows LIVE/Xbox LIVE.<br />
<br />
<strong>Don't sign up</strong> for&nbsp;other gaming forums with your Windows LIVE ID email and password combination, use a different one!&nbsp; Many forums don't use online security, if the site was compromised the hackers will go to Xbox.com or hotmail.com and try
 to log in with the details they stole from that site.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is the one I'm sure you're thinking of and that would be either EA or Microsoft have actually&nbsp;already been hacked, and when I mean 'hacked' I mean in the traditional sense of a hack.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure you're thinking that 'Evil corrupt&nbsp;MS'
 or Evil corrupt EA are somehow&nbsp;keeping such security breach a secret,&nbsp; I seriously doubt this is the case.&nbsp; After the&nbsp;PR disaster that Sony suffered, all the major&nbsp;online services should now how have&nbsp;updated their security.&nbsp; Everyone's account details should
 now be&nbsp;in encrypted form.<br />
<br />
Encryption technology makes it much harder&nbsp;for traditional hackers to&nbsp;discern any useful information&nbsp;from their&nbsp;nefarious practices.&nbsp;It would take so long to break in to the data of just one account&nbsp;that the whole thing becomes counter productive.&nbsp; Why hack
 a whole system, when it's far easier to phish for it instead?</p>

            Did you ever get a fix for this issue?&nbsp; One of my users here at work is having the exact same problem.&nbsp; We have tried multiple fixes with no success.&nbsp; Calling APD support has not helped.

<p>I am having the exact same issue with one of our users. Firefox works fine, IE works fine from another computer, I have scanned for Malware, deleted all cookies, cache, etc. Reset Security settings to defaults, Even Reset Internet Explorer's settings to
 their default condition (Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Reset button) Same issue. Running IE 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADP looked at it with the end user and couldn't get it to work and said "You must be infected with something talk to your IT person" that's me, but I am not seeing any issues. All other websites seem to work okay.</p>

            Having same problem. No virus or malware problem on PC. Took PC&nbsp;from IE7 from IE8 to see if that would help. No such luck. Already took the obvious steps of deleting history, temp files, et cetera. ADP Support no help.

<p>I'm having the same problem. Logged on as a different user and the same thing happened. Rebooted, flushed DNS etc. Talked to ADP and all they said was to get rid of the Google tool bar. which i did with no effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried Firefox, gave it a static IP but same thing happened.</p>
<p>One interesting thing, if you put in a wrong password the ADP site will tell you that you entered it wrong. It's only when you put in the correct password does the redirection occur.</p>

            I found this after I had done a system restore and the system restored fixed it.&nbsp; I called ADP and they were no help, said I probably have a virus or need to delete temp files. Didn't have a virus and had already tried deleting temp files.

 all of your steps above.&nbsp; The support tech knew exactly what I was talking about and told me to do this.&nbsp; Go to C:\program files\search toolbar then run the uninstall.exe in this search toolbar folder.&nbsp; Restart your browser and try again, it actually worked

    <title>2 accounts on 1 email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorestcreature7  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 accounts on 1 email</h2>
                    
<p>so i recently got my live account stolen. when it was taken from me i wasnt sure what happened i just knew that i wasnt logging in on my xbox. so i went to xbox.com and tried to log in to my live id and it said it was invalid. so i tried seeing what would
 happen if i made a new account with that email. so now i have a new account. i checked my email address and it showed that my original gamer tag's email was changed by the thief. so i then called xbox for a UA investigation. they finished the investigation
 and released my account back to me had me change my password. did that and with joy went to go recover my gamer tag. when the account was finished recovering it came up as my current gamer tag that im posting with. so &nbsp;i call xbox back up and they say for
 me to change the email for my new gamer tag and i do that. but now my old gamer tag is not associated with my old email anymore. they said they checked the gamer tag and shows my old email linked to it but then they try and look up the email to see what gamer
 tag is associated with it and shows invalid live id. so now they cant manually change the email on there and they said to give it 48-72 hours, which i get its just really annoying, in which case if the problem doesnt resolve itself that someone will call me
 in about 72 hours. heres the kicker. they told me that its possible that because of this little mix up that my account might go back to investigations again. this is just gonna take forever. i just want to play. im sure its a tech thing thats gotta be handled
 by the system or manually by someone on the microsoft payroll but any ideas?? anyone else out there have the same issue?</p>

<p>When your account was returned to you, it should still be under the WLID the "thief' switched it to. You need to log in with that WLID and then change it to a new WLID, preferably not the same one it used to be.

<p>If someone stole your account, they most likely changed the WLID. When you tried to use your old WLID (which is now not connected to a GT) it asked you to create one. After the investigation, they should have provided you information on how to log into your
 account. </p>

<p>I've had a similar thing happen with me. &nbsp;About a week ago I tried to log into my account on xbox.com and instead of logging in, it created a brand new account for me So it looks like I have might have two accounts on one email address (I'm posting with
 an alternate account because I can't access the forums with either my original account or the newly generated account...they crash.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if my original account's email was swtiched or not, because today I received an email addressed to the original gamertag . My account is under investigation now, but it sucks it might take a while, because i've got two games preordered coming
 out soon and I won't be able to play them until I get my account back.</p>
<p>When I tried to recover my original gamer tag on my xbox, it just downloaded info for the new one.</p>

<h2>            I cant move Minecraft Windows 10 to a different computer</h2>
                    I got a copy of Minecraft Windows 10 Edition free with my purchase of Minecraft and I installed it on a computer I no longer have access to. I got the game through a code, so it was redeemed on the other computer as well. Now I want to install Windows
 10 Edition on my new computer but the microsoft store says I need to buy the game, even though I should already own it. How can I transfer my copy to my new computer?

<p>I just don't understand it. &nbsp;Sometimes while I'm in a call it will zoom in so the top of my head is at the top of the frame and the camera will cut me off at just below my neckline. &nbsp;While other times it cuts me off almost down by my stomach.</p>

<p>I sit the same way both times and have tried to figure this out but I just can't seem to get it. &nbsp;While it was zoomed in to my second described setting out of nowhere it zoomed up real close how I like it.</p>

<p>I want it to frame me up as how I first described it (top of head to just under my neckline) but only sometimes does it cooperate. &nbsp;As of now it's being stubborn that's why I'm posting this, to see if anyone else is getting different zoom powers randomly.</p>

<p>I've probably worded this horrible and I apologize, I'm tired.</p>

<p>Normally I sit on a chair with the Kinect about 3 feet away from me, sitting maybe 2 and a half feet off the ground. I'm comfortably in-picture at all time standing sitting and whatever. &nbsp;The camera zoom is just so inconsistent.</p>
<p>I've been on multiple calls and sometimes it zooms only a little bit and shows my whole upper torso while other times it zooms very close to just view my head and barely part of my shoulders, while other times it's in-between those two levels.</p>
<p>All these zoom levels have happened while I was sitting in my chair just moving my head, sitting in my chair moving my arms and even sitting or laying in my bed a couple feet behind my chair. &nbsp;It just seems like sometimes it zooms to a level I like (up real
 close) and other times it just zooms just a hair past what it looks like with zoom off. &nbsp;Tracking works fine by the way, it's just the zoom that's inconsistent.</p>
<p>Also, nothing in my room changes, lighting is all the same, same objects in the background, etc. &nbsp;I've ended calls and re-initiated them, I've restarted the Xbox and nothing... &nbsp;I've fooled around with this for an hour last night trying to figure this out,
 I was changing what lights I had on to swapping out to different colored shirts I had on. &nbsp;Nothing made the camera zoom in. &nbsp;Then out of nowhere, it zoomed in all the way, then out of nowhere about 30 minutes later it zoomed back out. &nbsp;Haven't been able to
 keep it zoomed in, it's just very unpredictable in how it zooms, hopefully this gets a little more tweaked and perfected, or at least a setting to set a general zoom level. &nbsp;Or maybe there are just ghosts in my room that the Kinect is picking up??</p>

            <p>That is fairly odd behaviour for the sensor. &nbsp;However, perhaps the issue is that you're sitting a little too close to the sensor and that's why it zooms in so close to you. &nbsp;Are you able to sit a little further back to test it out?</p>

<p>I have the same problem, i always sit around 6-8feet away from kinect, sometimes it zooms in &nbsp;more sometimes less. I think it depends on who i am talking on the other end, and if its a laptop or iphone, because when i skype with my parents its a little wider,
 while skyping with my sister it zooms in more, very strange!</p>

<p>I've tried sitting farther back and I get the same results. &nbsp;Sometimes it barely zooms in while other times it zooms up nice and close.</p>
<p>Can you describe what the proper zoom level should be like when there is just a single person sitting in frame not moving around and just talking.</p>

<p>Sorry to resurrect this thread but I've been looking all over the web for an answer. I sit about 8feet from the kinect which is set about 5feet from the ground on top of the tv. whenever I skype my bro on his windows laptop the auto zoom works fine but when
 I skype my mum on her apple laptop the auto zoom barely works at all. &nbsp;Is there a known issue with Skype zoom on the XBOne connecting to skype on apple or is there a setting at her end that isn't "ticked". as far as I know shes running uptodate version. It
 doesn't help the zoom level if I move closer but it does track me.</p>
<p>Any help's appreciated.</p>

<p>I do not have an answer but iterate the question. I just installed my XBox One and loaded, limited and ran Skype. I figured out how to turn the Zoom off and on, but there does not seem to be a way to zoom. It is either auto zoom or no zoom. However, as I
 was sitting on my coach about 7 ft from the sensor, the image zoomed in nicely to my torso and then backed off to a wide view again. I would have preferred the former. It is nice to have the sensor move as required when others enter the room or I move around.
 But is there a way to force a zoom level?</p>
<p>Additionally, can the self image that resides in the bottom right be moved to another corner?
</p>
<p>If these are future enhancements, would love to know that. If these can be done now through settings, thank you!</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />There are several reasons why you are receiving this specific error code. It may be caused by a software conflict, a corrupted file or even by a program that is continuously running in the background.
<br />
<br />To isolate the issue, we recommend that you run the Windows Update Troubleshooter. This tool will be able to determine the root cause of the issue and may be able to resolve the issue.

            Hi Sameer,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi Sameer, your system is very much out of date (3 years), version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the PC it works differently that on the Xbox. There isn't the same sharing feature for any account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worth trying though, you should be able to sign in on to the Windows 10 Store as your account (Main account that owns the game) to then allow it to be downloaded. This might let someone else play it on their account, but it might only work if the account
 signed in to the PC is yours.</p>

            I would second IRB above. Use the account owning the game on PC. But understand this will give your son access to your MS account.

            <p>Mr. Patil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;However, you are mistaken. &nbsp;The version of Windows 10 that I downloaded (Windows 10 Pro) does not / did not allow the use of Internet Explorer 10 or 11. &nbsp;Additionally, I was told that if I right clicked on Edge, there would be an
 option to run / use Internet Explorer; that option was also not available. &nbsp;I am very computer savvy, and would consider myself an expert in knowledge, skill, and ability with Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if I cannot clear the SSL state, then the operating system is useless to me. &nbsp;Why did Microsoft leave this option out of Edge? &nbsp;I cannot comprehend why an important option like SSL state was left out of the new OS.</p>

            <p>Just search for "Internet Explorer" in the start menu to launch IE 11 - its not in the start menu or in the All apps by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From within Edge (you need to actually open the browser,&nbsp;not available from the launch icon) &nbsp;click the three little dots ... in the top right and on that menu about 2/3rds of the way down is "Open with Internet Explorer"</p>

            I already reverted back to Windows 8.1, and have no intention of ever using Windows 10 again. &nbsp;I am at a complete loss of understanding as to why Microsoft failed to include this option with Edge, and instead requires the use of a second program to achieve
 the desired results. &nbsp;You guys really fell asleep when developing this one.&nbsp;

<h2>            Feel as if I&#39;ve been completed screwed over by Microsoft help department</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have never posted here before but feel like I have to share this experience as it doesn't seem fair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I've had the Windows 7 SP1 update ready on my laptop for about 2 years. However, every time I tried to install it, it kept saying update failed, error 8024200D. As it wasn't really bothering me I just left it. But about a month ago I was offered
 a job working from home. For this, I needed Internet Explorer 10 or 11, but because I didn't have the SP1 update, I couldn't install either of them. There started a week long struggle to try and fix the failed update error. I tried EVERYTHING: system readiness
 tool, FixIt tool, Run as Administrator, downloading and installing the update from the internet, command prompts, system checks, clean boots, renaming system32 folders and files, and more, nothing worked, and obviously it was incredibly time consuming as after
 each thing I tried I had to then sit and wait for a good half an hour while it tried to install the update, having no idea whether or not it would work until right at the very end, when it said Update Failed yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I went onto the Microsoft Help site and told them my predicament. Without hesitation the woman I was speaking to asked for remote access to my computer, which I accepted,. She then downloaded a .iso of Windows 7 with the SP1 already installed, told me
 to write it to a disc, install it, and then enter the product key on the underside of my laptop to reactivate Windows. After a few failed attempts to write it to a disc, I finally managed to do this. I spent hours backing up my files, and installed the new
 Windows 7.1 on my laptop, entered the product key when prompted, and all was well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, 3 days later I had a popup saying that my product key is invalid. So, back onto the Microsoft Help website I went. Told them everything that had happened. They informed me that (conveniently enough) there was no record of my previous conversation,
 despite me giving them the woman's name and the time of the chat. The guy then said that the reason it was invalid was because my product key was an OEM code licensed to the laptop manufacturer (as Windows was already installed when I purchased the laptop,
 something I made quite clear to the first woman) but because the new version of Windows isn't the same one that came installed I now need a new product key. After an hour of debating this with him, his supervisor offered me a "special deal" of a new product
 key for £27. I told him no way as I had not even asked for the first woman to download and install a new Windows, and if I'd have known it was going to cost me £27 I would have told her not to bother and would've just used a different computer for work or
 something. However, even though none of this was my fault, he refused to give me a new product key without paying the £27. He said if I don't get a new product key after 30 days my Windows will be invalid and I won't be able to install updates etc. Ironic,
 I feel, as it was Window's inability to install a vital update that prompted this entire debacle. Anyway, he then said the only other thing I can do is contact my manufacturer (Toshiba) and ask them for a recovery disk so I can put Windows back to the way
 it was. But when I contacted Toshiba they said my laptop is too old and they don't support recovery for it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, then, I wasted hours and hours over a period of two weeks messing around only to be left with a laptop running a non-genuine copy of Windows, all thanks to the clearly incorrect decision of a Microsoft employee, and now seemingly there is nothing
 I can do about it other than buy a new product key, which out of principle, I absolutely refuse to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or can enlighten me on my customer rights? Have I been unfairly treated here? Or is there some sort of small print that makes this all my fault?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gaz</p>

            <p>I have seen, heard and read too many tales like this.&nbsp; The big lesson here is that allowing anyone to remotely work on your computer is a risky proposition.&nbsp; Do not allow anyone to work on your Windows computer unless you have very good reason to trust them.
 Best if you can look them in the eye and you have reports of trustworthiness from people you respect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft in recent years has allowed technicians with less than the competence they should have to work on customer computers under the Microsoft name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had one client whom Microsoft technician remotely&nbsp;rendered her nearly new computer completely useless -- A door stop.&nbsp; Calls to Microsoft to complain were useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that there are some issues with some brands and models that required some special software to be loaded prior to the SP1 update.&nbsp; I believe it was a type of HP computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have re-installed Windows 7, installed all the drivers you need, installed every update that Windows can offer using the including other Microsoft software option, loaded your STABLE programs (e.g. Office), do a defrag,
 clear out temporary directories and trash......</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recommend a step you will seldom ever see.&nbsp; It is called System Image.&nbsp; The program is part of Win7.&nbsp; You are going to need about 4 blank DVDs.&nbsp; I strongly recommend you
 do not use the most common type -- DVD -R's.&nbsp; Instead use DVD +R's.&nbsp; Start globe, All programs, maintenance, backup and restore, create a system image.&nbsp; It could be up to an hour to complete this.&nbsp; When done also create the System Repair disk suggested --
 you only need a conventional blank CD for this.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The System image you create here will permit you in the future to re-build your drive in about 20 minutes to precisely its
 current condition.&nbsp; It is a really great piece of insurance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The true beauty of the image is that you will never have to use a Win7 install disk or activation code again.&nbsp; You can re-build
 your system in much quicker time.&nbsp; The time will depend on how much time has elapsed since you made the image, how many apps you have to install, and how much data you have to load.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When you need to rebuild your system, you start your computer on the System Repair disk, find your way to the option to restore
 from an image, and restore.&nbsp; This will literally replace every thing there is on the hard drive with an exact copy of your hard drive at the time the image was done.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply. You're right, I should have created a system image. To be honest the only reason I didn't was because I thought I had one from Toshiba when I purchased this laptop; Imagine my delight when I delved into an old drawer
 and found recovery disks for every laptop I and everyone else in my family has ever had, except for this one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be a lot more careful about remote assistance in the future. The only silver lining is that the laptop is quite old anyway and I am probably due a new one. I was pissed off with Microsoft already for making Silverlight unavailable on Chrome, meaning
 I have to watch SkyGo and Bt Sport on the painfully awful Internet Explorer, and after this whole debacle I think I'll just get a Mac or a Chromebook.</p>
<p>

            <p>99% of complaints of slow IE are resolved with the use of a good disinfectant and resetting IE.</p>

</p><p>I use IE exclusively and almost all my clients do as well.&nbsp; If your machine is clean and well maintained, it works as well as the others.&nbsp; The big difference I find is that systems that use IE exclusively are substantially less likely to become infected.</p>

    <title>Fifa 14 wish list. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ha cha chaaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fifa 14 wish list.</h2>
                    
<p>While I have never been particularly good at it, I am a bit of a 'Fifa veteran' having owned several of the incarnations since the first one with David Platt on the box cover (Sega Mega Drive).</p>
<p>Now, I realise that Fifa 13 is already in the out tray from a programming point of view, but here is my wish list for the next one.</p>
<p>1/ Remove POV cut scenes like Goal kicks (especially), Free Kicks and Corners. &nbsp;Just keep the matchplay camera going. &nbsp;That will cut out the rediculous goal hanging at goal kicks for a start.</p>
<p>2/ Get rid of the 'Team Momentum' 'on rails' experience. It is frankly unfair in online play for the CPU to allow the opponent to 'catch up'. &nbsp;I used to blame this on LAG, but I have found on many occasions (especially in Fifa 12) that after taking a two
 goal lead, all of a sudden I can no longer control my players and the opponent is 'allowed' to score two goals back and then, as if by magic I can control my players again.</p>
<p>3/ Go back to the FIFA 09 penalty kick system. It was the fairest stab at pens in any version to date.</p>
<p>4/ Ensure that teams are not allowed to play with clashing kits.</p>
<p>I know Customers are rarely listened to...I remember the PS2 Fifa 08 online play debacle... &nbsp;but heck, I have probably kept the EA bosses in cocktails and cigars for many years...</p>

<p>Would love to see more depth to the management side of things as the 360 lacks some up to date football manager games. &nbsp;Would also like to see some challenges that are interesting and also have some depth i.e take over a team and get them to the premier
 league within x amount of years, but I would like to see this done with a fixed skill level, as far too many of Fifa's achievements are easy to boost on amatuer &nbsp;(not to say I havent done it).</p>

<h2>            Issues with weather channel app on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: the weather channel app for PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to update the weather channel and the update went through the windows store because I have windows 10. Now it tells me that I own this program, but when I try to install it, it always comes up with an error code "0x80073CF6" and suggests I try again.
 The same thing happens over and over.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To turn off automatic ripping in Windows Media Player</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. &nbsp;In Windows Media Player, on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Rip Music tab.
<br />
2. &nbsp;Make sure that the Rip CD when inserted check box is cleared, and then click the OK button.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If audio CDs still automatically rip when they are inserted into the CD drive, you must configure additional
 properties for your CD drive to turn off the feature by completing the following procedure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To turn off automatic ripping for the CD drive</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, and then click My Computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Right-click the CD drive that you use, and then click Properties. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Properties dialog box for the CD drive, click the AutoPlay tab. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. In the list of content types at the top of the dialog box, click Music CD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. In the Actions area, do one of the following:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Click the Select an action to perform option, and then specify the action you want Windows to perform
 when it detects a music CD in the CD drive by clicking that action in the list. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>-or-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Click the Prompt me each time to choose an action option. Windows will then ask you what you want to
 do each time it detects a music CD in the CD drive. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that will give you more information about this:

            Hi Steven, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />Is this for the entire computer USB system or just one device?
<br />
<br />If for one device you would need to update its driver though I would also do all the below.
<br />
<br />If the entire system please do these (and would not hurt anyway):
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - on right side run "Hardware &amp; Devices". (may not help).
<br />
<br />The check with the system/motherboard maker's support, their online docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and any USB drivers (some have those in the chipset and others are separate).
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Then perform these to remove corruption.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />=======
<br />
<br />If needed :
<br />

    <title>date and time missing from taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdyoung2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            date and time missing from taskbar</h2>
                    For some reason I can't see the date and time on the taskbar in Windows 10. I know the date is there &nbsp;because when I hover over where it should be it shows in the tooltip. I thought the font and background might be set to the same color but that doesn't
 seem to be it. I'm not using the small icons on the taskbar. One suggestion I found says to right-click on the taskbar for properties but there isn't an empty spot to right-click on. I must be missing an easy solution but I can't find the correct setting.
 Can someone help?
