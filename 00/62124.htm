<h2>            Purchase tied to the wrong account</h2>
                    When I purchased Minecraft for Win32, I also received a code for the Win10 version. Unfortunately, I downloaded and installed the Win10 version to a test account that I use only an a test computer (for insider builds), not my son's account that he regularly
 uses on his laptop. Is there any way to fix this?

<h2>            locked out of windows 10</h2>
                    A friend has downloaded window 10--Now he is locked out because it ask for a password which he does not have. I also have windows 10 for two days now and have issues that I have posted but no reasonable answer. My friend is dead in the water he live way
 out of town. Advise he gets is go to this ot that online but can't go online to do all the thiings bucause locked out. Neither he no I are puter guru's so advice about safe mode "might work" don't get it.---Best thing at this point is perhaps go buy a refurbished
 computer with windows 7. That is my advise to anyone.--At this point there is a junk computer because of windows 10 or either a $100 fix at the computer shop--Any suggestions???

            This appears to be a MicroSoft issue and<strong> NOT</strong> an actual user issue.&nbsp; I have all of my passwords stored in a password keeper.&nbsp; I am absolutely typing in the correct password and still it insists I have entered the wrong password.&nbsp; I have
 used this very password to login just this morning without issue. The only difference is that instead of my PC locking on it's own due to inactivity timeout, actually locked the screen with CTRL + ALT+ DEL and selected Lock because I was heading out and didn't
 want to leave my computer open unattended.&nbsp; This is BS.&nbsp; There is clearly a glitch with the Windows 10 lock screen password function.

<h2>            Clean Install &#38; Partitioning Hard Drive in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi - I have ordered Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Edition.&nbsp; I am wanting to wipe my hard drive clean when I install this upgrade.&nbsp; First of all, I was wondering if that is possible installing Windows 7 from an Upgrade Edition.&nbsp; Second of all, I was wondering
 if the upgrade software will automatically partition my hard drive upon install or if that is even necessary.&nbsp; My hard drive is currently partitioned simply because it automatically was that way when I bought it.&nbsp; Thank for any help!

            Yes you have to leave the older verision of Windows on their, but then Windows 7 will give you the option of doing a clean install, which will then allow you to remove vista or xp. &nbsp;But in order for Windows to verify the upgrade it has to originally detect
 vista or xp, then you can choose to do a clean install and make a new partition (if you want). &nbsp;Or it will give you the option to just write over vista; which personally for me that option scares me. &nbsp;I plan on doing a clean install and going from 32bit to
 64bit. &nbsp;I actuall wiped everything on my HD and put a fresh copy of vista on just so it does the verification when I upgrade tomorrow to windows 7.

            You cannot install a Windows 7 Upgrade edition on a hard drive that does not have a qualifying Windows operating system (i.e. Windows XP or Vista)&nbsp;actually installed.&nbsp; Installation of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive would require a
<strong><em>Full License</em></strong> edition of Windows 7.

<h2>            Cheaters if one of them is xbox ambassador or from enforcement team&#63;</h2>
                    İ was playing fifa 18, I played against a player who has been lagging the game during the whole game play and scored at the 2-5 sec periodic screen freezes. I have reported that guy for cheating due to network traffic manipulation. And, I checked his profile
 and it turned out to be a member of xbox ambassadors group.So, I didnt have any trust to enforcement team but it appears that ambassadors will not like what i am gonna write down now but that the true feelings. Ambassadors seem to have priviledge to cheat
 on the games which has been neglected by enforcement team. Cheating seems to be not a part of code of conduct, the enforcement team punish victims of cheaters since they used&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed - Profanity)</strong> against them.and hurt the feelings of
 those thieves. So, after the incident i mentioned above, i do not trust xbox ambassadors or enforcement team since they do not provide a safe fun and entertaining platform to customers but to the thieves including themselves... İt is extremely shameful business
 conduct... So, what shall regular gamers do against these thieves???

            Ambassadors are regular games who volunteer their time to help the community. We don't have any special privileges. The enforcement team does take cheating seriously and you should absolutely file a complaint on anyone you see who you think is violating
 the rules. The enforcement team will investigate it and take the appropriate action.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there SixRaccoon40003</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ambassadors are volunteers so there is no special circumstances for anyone that break Code Of Conduct which would be cheating
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/codeofconduct</a>&nbsp;which you can see is against CoC and the enforcement team take it very serious and take the time to investigate the situation. If you find anyone who cheats please do report them for the enforcement
 team to investigate.</p>

            Thanks for your replies.. ambasaddors are volunteer who were supposed to be good example for community, right? So, if some of u dont comply with CoC, how can I trust CoC or enforcement team? İf cheating is taking seriously, how come there are many cheaters
 out there in fifa 18 games (note that based on my observations, most of them from eastern europe, e.g., poland, russia, checz republic) and i typically report them but no results since if i dont block them i play against them next day and same cheats and i
 lose without able to play the game. So, i ask how come i do not experience safe fun entertaining platform, am I not a customer for xbox? I question how come i spend money to xbox. You know I could spend it to ps4 instead, it could be more fun. Honestly, i
 lost my trust to xbox and its enforcement team (i know they dont care) they make the CoC just a piece of paper and they do not follow what it is written for providing a good experience to regular gamers or users.

            It can take time for the enforcement team to investigate issues. So even if you don't see issues handled immediately, it doesn't mean they aren't being handle. Ultimately when it comes to things like cheating, it is up to the game's developers to patch
 their games to stop things like that from happening in the first place. Once newer versions of games are released, the developers tend to not support the old ones. So even though the enforcement team do take care of issues like that, people can still create
 new accounts and continue to carry on unfortunately. Sony has a similar code of conduct and you would still find the same types of issues through their service as well unfortunately.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there to u too,</p>
<p>i just shared my experience with one of the xbox ambassador (i have reported that guy), observations, questions coming to my mine and raised my concerns. i raised my concerns, if that bothered you, i can not help you on that. İ dont think i tainted all of
 you with same brush as you said. İ just shared what i experienced yesterday/other day. And, you said "looking past your immaturity...", So what do you mean by that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look for answers and ask some questions and start some discussion,&nbsp; to find answers. So, whether you like or not I have some rights to ask questions, learn&nbsp; or raise concerns, right? Such discussions also can help ppl, who experienced such things if there
 is any, to speak out and find answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that i report such ppl whomever they are, i also block them not to see them ever again. İ just can hope your enforcement team do their job and conduct actions based on CoC since everyone deserve a safe, entertaining, fun experience with this platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my question about my Cortana problem, I have been recommended to perform a clean boot. I did&nbsp;a clean boot and my problem got better. Microsoft Edge, store and settings work, but the thing is, I cannot open any of them at the same time, or the error pops
 up and everything crashes. Also, let's say I opened edge. Once I close edge, I have to either hit edge, store, or settings again, so that the error pops up, and then I can successfully open edge, store or settings, if that makes sense.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge/Store/Settings (Working) -&gt; Error -&gt; Edge/Store/Settings (Working) -&gt; Error -&gt; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I cannot open a new window or create a InPrivate window or else Edge crashes.</p>

<p>Hi thanks for the info but neither worked. &nbsp;Troubleshooter "could'nt identify problem", &nbsp;Typed WRSreset, etc. &nbsp;Nothing happened, box just keeps popping up. &nbsp; I've been getting this message when I click on menu, Cortana or Edge -- "Explorer.exe Class not
 registered". &nbsp;Any other suggestions? &nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions but non of them worked with WSReset.exe&nbsp; or App Trouble shooter or running SFC. What finally worked was System Restore about 1 week back.</p>
<p>One problem is even though Store is working when i try to buy Windows 10 Pro from Settings--&gt;System-About it goes in store but nothing happens, i am holding off buying Windows 10 pro as i do not want to waste by $99 to find out it is not working.</p>

<h2>            A &#38;quot&#59;Future Soldier&#38;quot&#59; Review</h2>
                    
<p>--I just typed it up blindly, so expect a bunch of errors. It's also a bit out of order/uninformative in some aspects because I had no plan.--</p>
<p>From my blog. Here's a link:&nbsp;<a href="http://47reviews.blogspot.com/2012/05/game-review-tom-clancys-ghost-recon.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://47reviews.blogspot.com/2012/05/game-review-tom-clancys-ghost-recon.html</a></p>



<p><span>.<br />
I initially remember seeing this way back at E3 2011 and thought it looked pretty interesting, but didn't have any plans on buying it when I realized Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3 were already coming out in the fall. Using their heads, Ubisoft decided
 to delay the game until now.</span></p>
<p><span>.</span></p>
<div>Future Soldier takes place -- shockingly -- in the future. As there is a lot of new equipment as well as modern, this game has a very half realistic, half fantasy feel to it, and it's really rather a good thing. As soon as I started playing, I felt as
 though this game was like Gears of War with a military skin, and I still sort of do feel that way. To me though, that isn't an insult at all, because Future Soldier manages to play very well -- almost like a Gears of War mixed with SOCOM, with added elements
 from games like Battlefield (Squad spawning).</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>The graphics in this game are hit and miss, depending on what you're looking at. Generally speaking, they look pretty impressive -- especially when you're up against a wall with an LMG trying to mow you down. From a distance or really close though, the
 textures are pretty bad. But the graphics really aren't that important... the game play is.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>When playing the campaign, definitely do it on co-op. Actually, when doing ANYTHING in this game, do it with people that will talk. Communication is important in most online games, but it's really essential in Future Soldier. In campaign, the A.I. will
 generally get the job done, but they take awhile to do it. What I like to do is play with people you know, look down your sights, and synchronize a shot in slow motion to take enemies out. It's simple, effective, and fun. The campaign is also a bit of a challenge,
 as the A.I. will try flanking you... so don't take your sweet time, because you'll find yourself dead on the ground. Probably the best thing about campaign (co-op or not), is that on most missions, you can choose to have an all-out firefight, or go through
 as stealthily as possible -- it's really up to you.&nbsp;</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>The online multi-player is what I was most interested in, and I figure what most people wanted to play. Why wouldn't you when there are 20 MILLION weapon customization options? I didn't play the beta, but some people in videos on YouTube said it was pretty
 enjoyable and likened it to "SOCOM before it sucked." That comment alone basically made me decide to give it a try. While the controls took a bit of getting used to after playing Battlefield and Modern Warfare, I eventually got used to them, and really started
 enjoying myself after just a couple matches. One thing I have found though is... if you don't have many friends to play with, I really suggest you pass on this game. Considering most people don't use headsets or are in parties when playing, you'll just get
 extremely frustrated with their idiotic decisions. Unlike a game like Call of Duty, you need friends to play Future Soldier.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>As I said early on, Future Soldier feels quite a bit like Gears of War, which isn't a bad thing in most every aspect, besides when trying to escape enemies. At least once or twice a match I'll find myself getting shot at, decide I have to run away, and
 die because I either: Get stuck on a wall, can't run, or hop over an obstacle when I don't want to. As annoying as this can be at times, it still isn't enough to ruin the game, because the cover system for the most part is very effective.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>As much as I enjoy this game, it's certainly not without its problems. Here's a list I've noticed already:</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>1.) As mentioned, the cover/running system can feel "sticky" or wonky at the worst possible times.</div>
<div>2.) When in a squad of any number with friends, it's not too rare to find yourselves in different squads and/or teams.</div>
<div>3.) Head shots are way too frequent -- I've gotten one-shot killed from across the map with the AK-74U too many times to count already.</div>
<div>4.) Some games after completion don't show up on your stats at all.</div>
<div>5.) You can't actively see anybody's rank, and the number of stats are limited.</div>
<div>6.) Some pretty serious lag issues online... the game either has virtually no lag, or is laggy to the point of being unplayable.</div>
<div>7.) Some guns (ACR and M14) seem way more powerful than anything else in the game early on, and grenades should be nerfed a tad as well. While capturing an objective, an enemy can simply lob a grenade and either kill you or knock you out of being able
 to capture it.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>There are a few other issues I have with it, but even with those flaws, Future Soldier remains very entertaining, as working as a team can be very rewarding. I enjoy the sometimes long-lasting duels or all-out firefights, as well as the seemingly endless
 customization for your weapons. If you have a small group of friends and are looking for a new LIVE game to play, you should choose Future Soldier. With a patch or two, this could be the best shooter in recent memory. Somehow, someway, it finds itself to be
 a unique and incredibly fun alternative to the likes of Battlefield or Modern Warfare.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>4.5/5</div>

<p>My quick review.</p>
<p>.</p>
<div>Installed the game and started playing this last night. Tried to get a 4 player co-op going with friends and BAM...........ONLINE PASS (called uplay passport). I could not frickin believe it. I watched the forums all day and no one mentioned this at all.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gtpla.net%2fforum%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fthumbsdown.gif" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gtpla.net%2fforum%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fouch.gif" />First negative
 punch to this game and Ubisoft. It does allow me to play the multiplayer but I can only level up to level 5. Which is usually a couple games. So this means if you buy it used or rent it, you cant play the 4 player co-op campaign or the 4 player co-op Guerrilla
 (horde) mode. Even if you do purchase the game you are forced to only play with friends. I thought games quit doing that 5 years ago.</div>
<div>&nbsp;.<br />
Sooo I started with the campaign solo. First thing I noticed was the massive step backward with the graphics. While I always prefer gameplay over graphics, I have adapted to the Ghost Recon stunning graphics. GRAW2 was one of the most beautiful games for a
 long time. Well those days are long gone. The graphics that were in the beta are the exact same graphics in the multiplayer AND the campaign. I knew they would have to tone down the campaign to get the 4 player co-op but dang its a bit rough to be honest.
 Graphics are even lower than RSV. This feels like a massive step backward in almost every way. Its almost like they hired a different team to work on this. A few changes here and there would have been fine but wow this is a dramatic change.</div>
<div>.<br />
I made it through several levels. Campaign has been fairly fun. Your 3 AI team mates are very intelligent. They take commands very well, stay in cover, and dont run out to alert the enemy. The sync shot is awesome. Its identical to RSV2 where you "tag" the
 enemies then give the command to attack. Works very well and would probably be even more fun with real life co-op partners. Its much faster paced than the other GR games but thats ok. Some of the load times can be a bit long. Not as long as Max Payne 3 but
 still some are up to about 2 minutes later in the game.</div>
<div>.<br />
After playing some of the campaign I jumped into multiplayer for 1 round. It was the same mill map from the beta. Looks and plays identical to the beta. So if you were expecting changes, the changes are not noticable at all. Luckily the server worked right
 away for my 1st game. Thats about all the feedback I can provide thanks to the online pass. Oh they also removed the popular 16 player terrorist hunt mode. One of the most popular modes in all the GR series. Its basially a 16 player co-op horde mode. Gone.</div>

<p>Great review OrdealByFire!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your lag issues. I didn't have any last night. We had 1 host migration from a rage quitter but that was it.</p>
<p>I know that GRFS uses P2P matchmaking for MP so maybe you got a bad host.</p>
<p>Speaking of MP, I love the maps! I was reading yesterday how the maps were small. What game was this player playing? The maps that are small have multiple routes and have many ambush areas. I did play the beta so I knew the guns and what attachments works
 best for each gun. You could see who the COD players were last night. They'll soon learn that the run n gun way of playing isn't going to last.</p>
<p>Guerrella Mode is the Best! I had such a blast on this mode, I can't wait to get back into it. I was playing with friends last night but noticed that you can set the match type to "Open", "Private" or "Friends". Do you happen to know how the Open setting
 works?</p>

<p>I've enjoyed a bit of everything so far but my campaign keeps glitching in the 3rd mission - right when everyone is supposed to get into position in front of a door, the marksman is stuck in a prone position trying to force his way through a wall. I either
 just watch him keep trying or I get into position with the other 2 guys and nothing happens because the marksman won't move up. :(</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I've tried reloading the checkpoint but it's a no go... just have to restart the whole level and hope for the best.</p>

<p>@OP.... great review, my sentiments to a T. &nbsp;Only point of difference in my opinion... the fewer stats aren't a bad thing. &nbsp;Too many people stat padding ruined games like COD. &nbsp;I think this game was implemented perfectly in that regard. &nbsp;Just wished more
 people would mic up in team chat.</p>
<p>We should start a respect movement... no party chat in this game unless you have a full team. Remember MW2 when it made you drop out of party chat? &nbsp;I truly believe a feature like that would open this game up... and draw a bunch of new gamers in.</p>

<p>Happend to me as well. Reload the last check point and Run to the door (hold A). Since the enemies are not in the area before the door, you'll be safe.</p>
<p>The other ghosts will run with you and not go prone.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments by the way. I've played the game a bit more today, and I'm sort of surprised it's really only averaging about an 80/100 on Metacritic. But that's what SOCOM II got as I recall, and that's my favorite game of all-time, so...</p>

<p>The more I play this game, the more frustrated I get. The amount of headshots is beyond excessive. I've gotten "sniped" by SMGs in one bullet FAR too often. I'm pretty sure any shot to the upper-half of a guy's body is a headshot in this game...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Search Box Stops Working</h2>
                    <p>My PC went into a BSOD Video_Schedular_Internal_Error; after I restarted the system, the search box randomly stops working.
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Typing something in the 'ask me anything' box the first time after a reboot it works fine but any further subsequent attempts (only happens after the search box had been closed) result in a blank list</span>.
 My Windows 10 runs on an SSD so I have disabled Windows Search service. I already tried: restarting Cortana, restarting windows explorer, restarting the system, enable windows search service, registering Windows apps using PowerShell but failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks a little something like this:</p>

            Just noticed our machines have same issue. Typing something in 'ask me anything' first time after a reboot it works fine but subsequent attempts result in a blank list. It must be an issue on MS side. I've not had any BSOD, it just suddenly stopped working!

            <p>Agreed. Have two PCs. Not insider builds, both Surface products. Search in the start menu works one time, the next attempt has no results in the start menu. Restart the Cortana service and then&nbsp;I get one more search. Next one fails to show results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I read this, must be a backend issue.</p>

            <p>Just enabled developer mode and installed bash. I didn't have any BSOD's and am having the exact same issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the troubleshooting guides I tried helped. Restarting or&nbsp;Reinstalling Cortana via PowerShell lets me do a single search before the problem returns.&nbsp;I have also tried restarting the search service and making sure it starts up automatically with no
 luck. </p>

</p><p>Your PC might have been distracted during startup and forgot to start Windows Search. Going into Services and setting startup parameters and finally restarting Windows Search will hopefully get your taskbar search working again. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit<strong> Windows</strong> key and <strong>R</strong> simultaneously on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> window.</li><li>Type <strong>services.msc</strong> into the Run field.</li><li>Click<strong> OK</strong>. The Services window will open.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Windows Search</strong>. It's located near the bottom of the list.</li><li>Click<strong> Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the<strong> dropdown menu</strong> next to <strong>Startup type</strong>.</li><li>Click<strong> Automatic (Delayed Start)</strong> or <strong>Automat</strong><strong>ic</strong> depending on your preference.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Click<strong> OK</strong>.</li><li>Right-click<strong> Windows Search</strong> again.</li><li>Click <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 OPERATING SYSTEM GONE - PC BACK TO WINDOWS 7</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Windows 10 Operating System has completely disappeared from my desktop PC and it now has Windows 7 OS, which was the original version on my PC.&nbsp; Yesterday my PC was suddenly disconnected from the internet.&nbsp; When I ran diagnostics, the response indicated
 that there was an issue with the modem.&nbsp; After many attempts to correct the problem with no success, I contacted my ISP.&nbsp; They were absolutely no help and wanted to come out to check for outside wiring issues, which I did not agree to.&nbsp; I continued to work
 on the issue, literally for hours.&nbsp; I finally noticed something on one of the logs that referenced something about Google&nbsp;and I remembered that that something had popped up about Google just before I was disconnected from the internet.&nbsp; Because I&nbsp;worked on
 the internet issue off and on for&nbsp;about 12&nbsp;hours,&nbsp; I don't even remember now, what the message was or what I changed, but I suddenly had an internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started a system scan with Windows Defender around 4 a.m this morning.&nbsp; When I woke up at 9
 and&nbsp;checked to make sure&nbsp;I was still&nbsp;connected, the internet was still working fine; but Windows 10 is no longer on my PC.&nbsp; Everything appears to be Windows 7.&nbsp; How do I get Windows 10 back?&nbsp;Sorry for the length of this; but I thought I should provide some
 background to what led up to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Janeane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking time to reply to my question.&nbsp; I'm not sure what version of Windows 10 I had.&nbsp; Do you mean Windows 10 Pro or something like that?&nbsp; It was the free upgrade that was offered to me shortly after I purchased my desktop PC.&nbsp; It originally came
 with Windows 7 installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, it seems like there was another upgrade or something&nbsp;at some point later, around the first anniversary of Windows 10??&nbsp; I have my PC set up to do automatic updates and I think I read something that said if
 a PC was set to install automatic updates, the anniversary update would automatically be installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You asked about the result of system scan with Windows Defender?&nbsp; Are you asking if there was a message about an error or a virus?&nbsp; If not, will you please clarify?&nbsp; I ran a quick scan; but there weren't any error messages, viruses or threats referenced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your last question about error messages, I hate to say this; but I honestly don't remember.&nbsp; With the exception of about 3 hours,&nbsp;I had worked on connectivity issues on Saturday from around 1 o'clock in the afternoon until 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning.&nbsp;
 During that time, I ran diagnostics and disconnected the power from the modem,&nbsp; and disconnected the cable from the modem numerous times.&nbsp; During the time that I&nbsp;was trying to reconnect to the internet, I received error messages referencing something to do
 with DNS and I also received messages about the Ethernet cable; but all of those messages occurred before I was able to reconnect to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is relevant or not, so I'm going to mention it.&nbsp; Just before I was disconnected from the internet, a message popped up briefly saying something about the security of Google.&nbsp; Then I was disconnected.&nbsp; Several weeks prior to this weekend,&nbsp;I
 had started using Google Chrome as my browser because Microsoft&nbsp;Edge had started having some issues that I was unable to resolve.&nbsp; It didn't matter if I was playing a game on Facebook or trying to open a link or a file, I kept getting messages saying whatever
 game I was trying to play wasn't responding or whatever file or link or website&nbsp;I was trying to open, it wasn't responding.&nbsp; And I would get error messages about compatibility issues with the browser.&nbsp;Trying to search for anything using&nbsp;Microsoft Edge was
 really slow.&nbsp; Back to the message about Google.&nbsp; During the time I was reading through error logs and other information on my PC Saturday night, I came across something that referenced Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the connectivity issue and Windows 10 disappearing and
 everything that I looked at and read this past weekend, I can't even tell you where I saw something about Google; but whatever it was, it prompted me to do something on the PC, like checking or unchecking a box somewhere -- I honestly can't remember right
 now.&nbsp; Whatever I did allowed me to reconnect to the internet.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's not possible you could have rolled back to Windows 7 from Windows 10 unless you initiated this via Factory Recovery, or were within the rollback period after initial Upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Something else must have happened.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's me again. &nbsp;A couple of things I didn't mention previously:</p>
<p>Even though Windows 10 seemed to be gone from my PC, when I clicked on security, Windows Defender was present. However, the appearance of everything on my PC looked like Windows 7... one example is when I clicked on programs, the display didn't have tiles
 with the names of the programs. &nbsp; Also, I checked to see Windows Defender was there and Internet Essentials was there. &nbsp;It was like bits and pieces of both operating systems were on my computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On to yesterday: &nbsp;</p>
<p>In my previous posts, I don't think that I mentioned that I had attempted to use the Windows 10 update assistant on Sunday evening. &nbsp;If I remember correctly, each time I clicked on the link to the assistant, nothing happened. Yesterday morning, I decided
 to try the link again. &nbsp;When I clicked on it that time, I don't remember exactly the sequence of what appeared; but when I left for work, I was very hopeful that Windows 10 was going to be updated when I got back home from work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Windows 10 has been installed. &nbsp;I was so excited, but I haven't been able to access anything online. &nbsp;Even though my computer says I am connected to the internet, each time I click on Windows Edge or any online shortcut, I get an error message
 saying that the page can't be reached. &nbsp;Depending on what test I run, I'm basically getting the same messages that I was this past weekend. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some questions that I hope might help to determine what the real problem. &nbsp;I noticed that there still seem to be some remnants of Windows 7 on my PC. &nbsp;I thought these would automatically be deleted when the update for Windows 10 ran. &nbsp;I say there
 are remnants, because depending on what test I ran or what I was looking at, the display had different appearances. &nbsp;At one point, I was looking at the old screen where you can uninstall programs and still in that list I could see Windows Internet Essentials
 instead of WD; but when I was looking at something in settings, some of the tiles were displayed. &nbsp;I apologize if what I am saying seems vague, but after running so many diagnostics over the last several days, everything is running together. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Is it possible that if there truly are remnants of Windows 7 on my PC that it would cause Windows 10 to not run properly and cause the connectivity issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;There are other programs that I did not uninstall because I thought I had read that those that weren't compatible would be deleted. &nbsp;If there are still programs on my PC that aren't compatible, would they cause connectivity issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;If the answers to 1 and 2 are that those would not cause the connectivity issues, can you tell me if there is a list of steps that I can take to systematically try to identify the problem? &nbsp; I'm pretty sure that I'm not going about this in the right
 order or maybe not even the correct approach. &nbsp; If there is a systematic list of steps, if you could direct me to where I can find it, I'm going to try to access it while I'm at work so I can print it and take it home -- since I still unable to access the
 internet&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking time to try to help me.</p>

<p>Greg, I've attached the screen shot your requested.&nbsp; I'm hoping you'll see something on this that will help until I can do the Clean Install Windows 10 as recommended.&nbsp;I'm not sure how long that usually takes, but I think it will take enough time that I
 may need to wait until the weekend when I have more uninterrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also included the list of programs.&nbsp; See that it shows Windows Essentials in the list of programs instead of Windows Defender.; but I know that WD is on my PC because I can see it when I click on start/settings/updates and security.&nbsp; Maybe it's always
 been like think and I'm just thinking it's different because of&nbsp;all of the issues I've been having recently.&nbsp; Whatever the case may be, thank you again for taking time to respond to my questions.&nbsp; And a big thank you for your patience.&nbsp;
</p>

                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking into getting a Skype Number for my account. My hope is to have conference calls with family members that want to use a phone and don't have access to a computer along with people using the app with the video capability on the same call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if you can mix someone dialing in via a Skype phone number with people using the Skype app over a computer or mobile device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Thank you both. What I need to know is if someone calls with the Skype Number, can I also add people to that same call such as people using the Skype app? I need to have my brother on via the Skype app and a family member via the Skype Number, within the
 same call.

<h2>            Windows10 File Explorer automatically search not navigating.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>New corporate laptop and it comes with Windows 10 Enterprise.</p>
<p>That is ok but have noticed a little issue that surely must be simple to correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open File Explorer (Win+E), go to a folder that has hundreds of sub-folders.</p>
<p>Click in the right pane and select a folder. Type "t" to navigate to the first sub-folder starting with "t".</p>
<p>Instead of navigating, a search for "t" is started.</p>
<p>I don't want a search I want a navigation.</p>
<p>How to stop this Automatic Searching?</p>
<p>If I want a search I will do that in the seraph field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a few things already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>View&nbsp;Options, Change Folder and search options.</p>
<p>The option "Don't use the index when..." on or off does not affect the behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win+R, msconfig</p>
<p>Services</p>
<p>uncheck Windows search</p>
<p>no affect to the behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to correct this annoying behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This feature is intended. This was created to help users search for any files on a specific folder if there are too many items to look for. What we can suggest you to do is to directly search the folder name on the Cortana search box. This way, you'll be
 directly be brought to the folder itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if there's anything else you need.</p>

<p>Hi Ian</p>
<p>thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this does not help.</p>
<p>I don't want to use Cotana or whatever it is called.</p>
<p>I often don't remember exactly what the folder is called but will recognise it when I see it and I know it starts with a "t" (for example) and I want the File Explorer to quickly navigate to the first folder starting with "t" and then I can scroll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing "t" into cotana does not help.</p>
<p>There must be a tick box or registry "0" that will stop this behaviour?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have a look around and come back with the solution.</p>
<p>Also, send a message to your development team and ask them to rethink this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, Dean. Here's what we can suggest you to do. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key </strong>on your keyboard, and then type <strong>regedit
</strong>then right-click and then <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search</em> (change value data as
<strong>1</strong>).</li><li>Navigate to <em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; SOFTWARE &gt;Microsoft &gt;Windows &gt; CurrentVersion &gt;Search</em>.</li><li>Change the <strong>BingSearchEnabled </strong>value from <strong>1 </strong>to
<strong>0</strong>. Make sure all of the <strong>Cortana </strong><strong>flags </strong>
are set to <strong>0 </strong>instead of <strong>1</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to hack up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Ian</p>
<p>This looks promising but I cant quite follow your instructions because:</p>
<p>(2) I dont know which item in&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search to change?<br />
I see seven items under the Windows Search folder:</p>
<p>(Default) - (Value not set)<br />
Allow Cortana - (0)</p>
<p>AllowSearchToUseLocation&nbsp;- (0)</p>
<p>ConnectedSearchPrivacy&nbsp;- (3)</p>
<p>ConnectedSearchUseWeb&nbsp;- (0)</p>
<p>ConnectedSearchUseWebOverMeteredConnections&nbsp;- (0)</p>
<p>DisableWebSearch&nbsp;- (1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so which one do I change?<br />
</p>
<p>and by "(change value data as 1)" do you mean change to a 1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(4) I dont see any item for Bing (I hope that is a good thing as I dont want Bing :)) and all Cortana items are 0 already (except for the MUID one?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

            Hi Dean,<br />
<br />
Entering any letter in the search box of the File Explorer will search for any file or folder that contain that letter. If you wish to navigate the files on your folder, we recommend pressing the first letter of the file or folder you wish to navigate without
 entering it on the search box. It will highlight the file and folder that starts with that letter.<br />
<br />
Update us on the outcome so we can provide further assistance.

<p>Sorry Martin but did you read my first post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am NOT entering any thing into the search box, I am selecting a file/folder in the main panel (not the search) but Windows is automatically entering the letter I type into the search box.</p>
<p>This behaviour is what I am trying to stop.</p>
<p>I am trying to do what you suggest and what I am trying to get back, but Windows (the new Enterprise version we have here at work) does the bad behaviour (by design as per reply above!) when I dont want it to :(</p>

<p>whats worse is i thought it was a old issue i had where i had to delete my profile. so i deleted and now i can't get it back! so can't even play offline. come on microsoft. it's pathetic. you will lose me as a customer.</p>

<p>Same here. It lets me log on for a couple of minutes when I first turn on the xbox and then it boots me off and won't let me back on. 2 days in a row.
</p>
<p>The cynical person in me thinks they want everyone with a 360 to buy the ONE because for some reason you can still connect to live on that.</p>

<p>Omg i thought there was something wrong with MY xbox 360. So its happening to everyone? I just deleted my profile and cannot get it back, due to the fact that XBL cannot connect. GRRR! So annoying!</p>
<p>Hope Microsoft fix this soon. I was so worried it was just my xbox 360 that was broken or something... glad its not.</p>

            <p>Hi Branden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help resolve your concern, kindly disable your antivirus or firewall and then uninstall the program. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To turn off all firewalls.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off</strong>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Open your web browser and visit a website you trust and see if you can connect to it.</li><li>To turn on all firewalls you might have installed, at the command prompt, type
<strong>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on</strong>, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you find the firewall software is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to check and see if updated software is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes antivirus or malware-prevention software might prevent you from getting connected. You can see if the connection issue is caused by antivirus and malware-prevention software by turning it off temporarily and then trying to visit a website you trust.
 If you find it is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to see if updated software is available.</p>
<p>The steps to turn off antivirus or malware-prevention software depend on the software you’re using. Check the documentation for your software to learn how to turn it off. Make sure you turn it back on as soon as possible. Not having antivirus or malware-prevention
 software turned on makes your PC more vulnerable to hackers, worms, or viruses. If you’re not sure what antivirus or malware-prevention software program you have installed, Windows might be able to tell you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To find out what antivirus or malware-prevention software is installed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>System and security</strong>, and then select
<strong>Review your computer’s status and resolve issues</strong>.</li><li>Select the down arrow next to <strong>Security</strong>.
<p>If Windows can detect your antivirus software, it's listed under <strong>Virus protection</strong>. For malware-prevention software, look under
<strong>Spyware and unwanted software protection</strong>.</p>
</li><li>If the antivirus or malware-prevention software is on, check the documentation for that software to learn how to turn it off.
</li></ol>
<p>Make sure you turn your antivirus or malware-prevention software back on as soon as you can to make sure your PC is better protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
