<h2>            How do I move an Outlook 2013 Calendar to another owner&#63;</h2>
                    I help another member in my organization by creating a Calendar and sharing it.&nbsp; I've set this person as the owner, but the Calendar is still associated with my account.&nbsp; This is leading to confusion when calendar requests and replies are addressed from
 my account.&nbsp; How do I fix this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Help please!

            I've not seen any definite news articles to suggest that. Then again, I've not seen any news articles confirming that Nokia has ceased production of any model.<br />
<br />
However, I do think that the 1200 was rapidly replaced with the 1208/1209, which <i>
is</i> in production AFAIK, so this would indeed suggest that the 1200 no longer is.

<p>Interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know where to find detailed instructions for the functions of the 1208 (preferably in PDF)?&nbsp; I have just taken delivery of one and the 'How to get the most.......' guide is pretty useless.&nbsp; I can't seem to find anything in the Support section

            The official guide for the 1208 is woefully inadequate. Hardly any of the phone's (not very numerous) functions are covered in the 30-or-so page guide.

<h2>            Data labels in some powerpoint charts get replaced by brackets</h2>
                    <p>Hello --</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using PPTX 2013. I have several instances where charts I have created in 2013 get "corrupted" after being viewed by a client with 2007 or 2010 versions of PPTX.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data labels get replaced by empty square brackets (like this: [ ] )...but this is where it gets odd: it is not all charts in a deck full of charts; AND sometimes (not always) I can still see the data values and do not see the brackets, but my client
 only sees the empty square brackets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many things to fix the brackets, including re-selecting the data cells, and also copying the data to new cells and then pointing the label values to those new cells. I think manually typing the values into the labels (as text) works, but really
 defeats the purpose of having a chart that can be updated easily from a datasheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else run into this issue? It has happened in several different reports with different clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for any insight (or commiseration) I may get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Animation and Video Editing</h2>
                    After I do some video editing, music editing and animation editing, Windows play back is broken up to using all the available memory.&nbsp; The transition breaks is only in milliseconds (or is it microseconds) but it is noticeable enough by the ear and eyes.&nbsp;
 This is a memory allocation problem or assignment of multi core&nbsp;on multi core cpu.&nbsp; On the Duo computer (running WIndows 10)&nbsp;although slower, the final product is near perfect.&nbsp; When I open another memory intensive application such as the internet is becomes
 more pronounce...Not on the DUO or even single core computer.&nbsp; Browsing the internet is labor intensive for any computer system which include graphics, moving graphics, form memory, sound, video (which is different from graphics or sound alone), and etc...&nbsp;
 Any thoughts...I think it is assignment of priority of the threads and also dedication of the cores.&nbsp; I think it is just a first come first serve event which is single track process ve

<h2>            User gets &#39;You need permission to access this site&#39; when logging in, but already has permission</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have one user account that cannot login to our SharePoint 365 site. Every time they login, it says 'You need permissions to access this site', and offers the chance to request permission. If you do this, then accept the access request, the user still
 gets the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding the user to other groups with more permissions, and giving access directly, but it always gives the same error. If I use the Check Permissions menu, it confirms that the user does have permission already. I have deleted the user out of
 all groups, and deleted the user from 365, but it still gets the same error once added back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users are all working fine on the same site using the same permission groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found two example of this error on this forum, but both tail off after 5 or 6 replies with no solution given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</p><p>If it is a classic site, please click site settings&gt; Site permissions&gt; Click in the default "&lt;site name&gt; member" permission group and add the user then wait for some time.</p>

            Hello Gary,
<br />
<br />This issue will require more investigation for which the O365 support has the required resources and permissions. This might be a bug with the user. 
<br />Logs from that user have to be compared with logs of a user, where everything works as expected. For that Tenant Name and email addresses will be required. 
<br />Also, if this is a bug with the user, the O365 support team can run some internal tools, which could solve the problem.
<br />So I advice you to open a ticket, by simply logging in as an admin, clicking on admin, support. Describe the issue and you will be contacted asap. 
<br />
<br />In case of questions, don't hesitate to ask.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Manuela       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a classic site</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the default Visitors group for access</p>
<p>
</p><p>The permissions the user has are read access given by the&nbsp;<span>"&lt;site name&gt; visitor" group and also now direct read permission to the user.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved onto a new project and left this with our web team. The advise was basically to delete the account using powershell, leave it for a while, then recreate it. I did do this, but was unable to test if it had worked as I no longer had the login details
 of the user who was having issues. I had done this already, but deleted using the GUI rather than powershell, and it didn't make any difference, so I didn't hold much hope that it would make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will ask the web team what they did next with this user. I presume they just created a new account using a different email address to dodge the problem as I haven't heard back from them about it since last year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>if you modify their contact number to delete the country code it rectifies the issues however you can't call them from outside the country of their origin.</p>

<p>Hy, I have recently been doing a cleanup on my micro sd card an have come across a very large file in the directory: &nbsp;&nbsp; microsd/private/101ffc31/glxmdstn. &nbsp;The file "glxmdstn" is of an unknown file format. The computer doesn't recognize it and it isn't visible
 in my phone's file browser. The file is 140 MB large. I want to delete it but I don't know what purpose does it have. Does anyone know if it's safe to delete it? Maybe it's obsolete data? Yes and it says that the file has been created on december 2008. Thats
 before I got the phone and even before the new micro sd card.</p>

<h3> pjw01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with inbox searches in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2016 installed on my personal Win10 computer. &nbsp;It is set up with an Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the inbox, click on the search current mailbox field and select "from" in the Refine area of the ribbon, I get the following in the search field:</p>
<p>
</p><p>from:"Sender Name"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type in an email address for Sender Name, I get incorrect search results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I change the search syntax to parentheses (which is the same as appears in my work computer which has Outlook 2016 on Win7 connected to an exchange server):</p>
<p>
</p><p>from:(Sender Name)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get correct search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are the quotation marks appearing? &nbsp;How do I fix this so I get the correct search results? &nbsp;Can I set my home Outlook so that inserts parentheses instead of quotes? &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note I also get quotes when I select subject in the refine area.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 not supporting html-format email</h2>
                    
<p>Following a server migration, Outlook no longer displays html content in the received email. Old server was running older version of SBS2003. New server has latest version of SBS2003. Outlook accounts are set up with HTML as mail format. Some use Word some
 do not for email editor. All users have been affected.</p>
<p>Below is a message I received from a sender that I formerly received in full HTML-content and is typical of other emails that used to show up as HTML-content. Now all I receive is plain-text with HTML link.</p>
<br />
<p><em>If you are reading this message, your email reader does not support HTML-format emails. Unfortunately, Airfarewatchdog does not send out a text-only newsletter at this time.<br />

<p>I believe this is because of your sender's misconfiguration or your antivirus. Looks like HTML part was just cut.</p>
<p>Try to export these messages to EML format and open EML files in notepad, for instance. There you'll see if these messages contain HTML parts or not.</p>
<p>You can export messages to EML with this free utility:<br />

    <title>Word Bullets misbehaving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jondangler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Bullets misbehaving</h2>
                    I am trying to get the normal, round bullets to generate when I use the bullets. But when I click on the bullets for them, all I get is empty squares. I can get the bullet to show up with Option + 8 but that doesn't do any tabbing and they don't automatically
 generate. I've researched about maybe I have duplicate fonts and I need to remove them. I need a safe way to delete the duplicate fonts without deleting all of the fonts. The mac this is on is in our marketing department and the user needs all of his fonts.
 I tried going to all the duplicates and trying to automatically resolve them, but that looks like it just disabled them and didn't fix the problem. The normal, round bullets seem to be all that is affected as the other types of bullets work fine. Just a heads
 up, I know a good bit about Windows OS and very little about mac. Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi Jon:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find you can resolve this issue by simply resetting the Bullets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Square Boxes indicate that the font the user has specified for their bullets available on their machine does not contain the specified bullet character. &nbsp;This could be because the document they are using came from a different machine.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>As a first try, in the Word menu bar, go to Format&gt;Bullets and Numbering.</li><li>Click the Bulleted tab.</li><li>Click in each of the samples on the Bulleted tab, and watch the <strong>Reset</strong> button in the bottom left corner of the dialog.</li><li>If the <strong>Reset</strong> button enables, click it.</li></ol>
<p>That resets the first 8 bullets formats in the document to the hard-coded defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now create a bulleted list and use Format&gt;Bullets and Numbering to apply the Round Bullets sample.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That "reloads" the Bullets button. &nbsp;The Bullets button simply applies whichever bullets template was most recently used on that workstation. By applying the round bullets, you reset it to apply those next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user does not like the round bullets it supplies, they are free to use Format&gt;Bullets and Numbering&gt;Customise to change them. &nbsp;What they really should do is customise the List Bullet STYLE and use that to apply bullets whenever they want them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: this is NOT an IT issue. &nbsp;This is a "user" issue. &nbsp;The desperate desire of your user to avoid learning to use their tools of trade does NOT make this an IT support issue! &nbsp;The user is at liberty to define their bullets the way they want them.
 &nbsp;If they define them using an unavailable character in an unavailable font, they will indeed get square boxes. &nbsp;Then again, square boxes (the character!) is one of the available bullet characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may wish to open the Word help and leave them on the page that says "<strong>Text, Lists, and Bullets</strong>". &nbsp;They need to know that stuff, it's part of operating Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            We found the problem to be a default setting in Adobe Illustrator that included auto CMYK conversions. Stupid computer!<br />
<br />
Once more question:<br />
When our client converts these powerpoint templates to pdfs the background images come out fuzzy. but not when we convert to pdfs. Any idea why they might be having that problem?<br />

<h2>            Office 2013 Won&#39;t Activate &#40;FIRST TIME&#41;&#58; says license key used maximum number of times</h2>
                    <p>I've purchased my son a brand new Acer laptop with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I purchased a brand new Microsoft Office (Home &amp; Student 2013), which arrived as expected (a box, with a card inside; the card has the URL "office.com/setup" and the 25-character Product Key). The box was wrapped in clear plastic, and I had to cut it off
 with a knife; so, no, it hadn't been opened or tampered with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We went to that URL and downloaded Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We launched (rather, the installation process completed and automatically launched a demo in...) PowerPoint, which then asked us to activate it. When we did, it says this has been already activated the maximum number of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how else to say this: we received it new; we haven't installed it on anything until now; it won't let us activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We checked to make sure the installation is complete. Yes, it appears to be.</p>
<p>We closed everything and tried with Word, and are getting the same message (and Word won't activate).</p>

            ANSWER (for anyone else...): Use the 2nd option -- to activate by phone -- so you can respond to a robocomputer "This is installed on only 1 computer" ... involving a very, very, very, very, very long set of characters you will type in (shoot me) and then
 have read to you (shoot me again). I wasn't typing fast enough and it hung up on me the first time. I still have no idea why I got this error and had to go through all of that, but it is now resolved.

            <p>You got luck.y!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been a bunch of people who bought Office 2016/365 OEM directly from the builder who had a similar problem.&nbsp; Brand new computer, product key still in sealed package, when they try to activate they get the same message you got. But, when they phone
 in to MS and EVENTUALLY talk to someone who knows anything they are told that the key has already been used by a totally different email account!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS wouldn't do anything about the problem. Some people eventually got DELL to issue replacement product keys, but the last I'd heard many others were still left hanging. This problem wasn't limited to one builder, it happened to at least 3, so I personally
 think the problem was caused at the MS end of the process. </p>

</p><p>It is not Microsoft's fault. It is the vendors' fault. They should not install Office 2013 without obtaining the email address and password to the customer's Microsoft Account. The 25 character 'Redemption Key' can only be used once and by using an email
 address which does not belong to the customer they cannot access the Office Account. The only way that Microsoft can help is if the vendor used a Microsoft Account. It the Vendor used a Microsoft Account to setup office then Microsoft can change the email
 address, but if the vendor used some other email address Microsoft cannot do anything to assist other then send the person back to the vendor.</p>

            <p>It sounds like you need to 'reset' the system -- some link has gotten screwed up.</p>
<p>Try a power cycle first (press Power button until you get the slide-down screen.&nbsp; Slide down, see the 'Goodbye'.&nbsp; Wait about 15 to 20 secs, then power on again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't fix it, then maybe a hard reset -- Settings/About, reset your phone button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If THAT doesn't fix it, then it's time to take it back to your supplier.</p>

<h2>            Alarm didn&#39;t work. Lumia 820 WP8.1</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I noticed one day that I was not able to change the ringtone volume with the +/- buttons. I didn't think much about it as this has happened sometimes, but only when I've been in a game or listening to music and then the buttons change the music volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now I was not playing anything and still it just changed the volume of the music and not the ringtone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I went to sleep and woke up in the morning 2 hours late from work. The alarm was on the screen waiting for me to press snooze or skip but there was no sound whatsover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone was on the whole time and the alarm was set properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rebooted the phone and then it let me change the ringtone volume once again. And the alarm sounded when I tested it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think someone should look into this matter as this kind of stuff makes the alarm not reliable and I speculate that I would not have heard the ringtone if someone would have called me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lumia phones used to have one single setting for all sound, but the 8.1 update adds two separate sound settings, both of which are controlled from the same keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ringer and notifications</li><li>Media and apps</li></ul>
<p>The first time you press the volume up or down keys, a bar appears at the very top of the screen showing you which of those two settings you are acting on, andwhen you continue to press the keys the change is made to that volume setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you tap that bar, it drops down to show adjustments for both sound settings:</p>

<p>Yes, I understand that. But that's not the problem in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Alarm should activate/make sound even when the Ringer + Notifications is turned to zero. You can test it if you don't believe me. And I didn't even have the phone on silent anyways, there was no icon for the "vibration only" etc on the screen so if should
 have been just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alarm did "activate" but there was no sound. When I got to my phone in the morning, the "Snooze" and "Dismiss" dialogue was open on the screen, like the alarm had been going on for hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The abnormal behaviour yesterday with the volume button made me think there might be some sort of connection... as volume... sound etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, to underline the facts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone was not on silent</p>
<p>Phone didn't react to volume settings the way it usually does</p>
<p>Alarm was on&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alarm was activated on morning at the time is was supposed to</p>
<p>Alarm didn't make any sound so I didn't wake up</p>

            The alarm keeps on ringing until you press snooze or dismiss. This dialogue was still on the screen 2 hours after the alarm went off. So it was ringing nonstop but just without the sound.<br />
<br />
I've heard the alarm just fine for the past 1.5 years. Just like my wife who sleeps next to me. Neither of us heard anything.<br />
<br />
I did the test after I had rebooted the phone so the reboot fixed the problem. But that doesn't change the thing that something did go wrong and it didn't work as it was supposed to. Like I said, the phone was working abnormally as I was not able to even change
 the ringer + notifications volume with the buttons. This also was fixed by the reboot.

<p>I didn't have problem whit alarm, but once whit incomming call. Media volume was set to mute, but ringer to 07. I was listening to music and on headphones media volume was set to 28. I was walking around the city as usual and when I pulled out My phone to
 fast forward Dj set I noticed that I had incomming call some time ago. No ringer and no vibration or sound from phones speaker or headphones. Even music wasnt stoped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im on Lumia 635, but looks like there is OS problems whit sound. Have You upgraded to 8.1 lately or 8.1 DP?</p>

            This happened to me this morning. Alarm appears on the screen but no sound. Late for work, great! The phone was on, the sound was up but no sound from the alarm. Even when choosing an alarm sound, none of them played.<br />
<br />
Its clearly an issue with 8.1 since I updated I have had to send my phone of for 'repairs' because the screen stopped working. It was absolutely fine before the update. Now the alarm doesn't work, 8.1 clearly wasn't ready so I look forward to more unusable
 facilities. Yay!

<p>OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened again. I noticed that every time I tried to change the ringer volume it just changed the app and audio volume. No biggie I thought as I checked the settings and ringer + notifications were still on their normal settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I wake up an&nbsp;hour&nbsp;late. The same thing as described in my first post. Alarm was still "on" and "ringin" on the screen, but no sound what so ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even took some photos this time to proof it so I won't get those "are you sure the phone was on?" "maybe the phone was on mute?"-responses trying to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But seriously. WHY ISN'T THIS BEING LOOKED INTO? THIS IS A SERIOUS FLAW AND A BUG ON THE SYSTEM and should be corrected ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: And these problems started after installing the 8.1. Didn't happen once with 8</p>

<p>I can confirm the alarm on WP8.1 (latest dev preview) is buggy.</p>
<p>I have 2 recurrent alarms set for a few weeks now. One at 7 AM and one at 8 AM set to ring on week days. I never hear the alarm at 7 AM. Either it doesn't ring at all or it rings only briefly (certainly it doesn't ring until I hit snooze or dismiss). The
 alarm at 8 AM works as expected.</p>
<p>Luckily I don't have a fixed hour to show up at work.</p>

<p>I set up a gmail account within my Hotmail Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>I want to dissociate this gmail account from my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>How do I do it.</p>
<p>I will connect to my gmail account directly and no longer need to access it from within the Hotmail.</p>

<p>Hi Sonny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove or delete an email account that is connected to your Hotmail account at any time, so it will no longer be connected to your Microsoft account. Please take note that you are only deleting the connection between your Hotmail account and your
 other email account. The emails from your other account will still be saved on your Hotmail account. To know how to delete your other account from your Hotmail account, follow the steps found in this

<h2>            Totally not fair&#33;</h2>
                    Why is Zune offering a 3 month free subscription for Windows 7 phone buyers from AT&amp;T and not Verizon?? I made sure to be one of the first buyers for Verizon Trophy but this is offered for AT&amp;T

            Don't you know It's all just marketing?&nbsp; Is the AT&amp;T promotion enough to make you switch from Verizon? Go ask Verizon why they aren't offering a similar promotion....I'm pretty sure Microsoft would honor it if Verizon worked out a similar promotion for
 their customers.<br />
