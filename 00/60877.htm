<h2>            Headphones cannot be set to default device</h2>
                    When headphones are plugged in, sound continues coming out of the speakers but also through the headphones. I've been trying to get sound to just come through the headphones, but so far I haven't found a solution. I tried deleting the &nbsp;IDT High Definition
 Audio CODEC, but it simply reinstalled upon rebooting. Everything is also updated. I think the main issue is that I can't set the headphones as the default device, but I'm not sure. Any help would be welcome!!!&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>This happens when you have the external speakers set to default. We need to set the headphones as default.<br />
Perform the task mentioned below to set headphones as default:<br />
1. Go to <b>Start </b>and click on <b>control Panel.<br />
</b>2. Click in <b>Sound</b>, then a new window will open up.<br />
3. In the new windows click on the tab<b> "Playback"</b> and right click in the window and click on
<b>Show Disabled devices</b>.<br />
4. Now check if headphones are listed there and right click on it and choose enable.<br />
5. Highlight that headphones and click on <b>"Set as Default</b>".</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the link and check.</span></p>

<h2>            More Issues than TIME Magazine</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, after having used Windows since Win 95, NEVER have I had such issues with one OS. Honestly, at this point I will pay money to go back to Windows 7, despite no support for it, you generally don't need support for something that isn't broken.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so Windows 10 free upgrade from Win 7. Desktop. I would provide specs, but as you'll read this isn't physically possible at this point.&nbsp; From memory, Asus mobo, GeForce 1050ti GPU, quad core i7000's. SATA HD - 500gb, 16 gb RAM. It was built in originally
 in 2012 with Win 7 Professional. I have upgraded parts since. <br />
<br />
Haven't used my PC in about 4 months, moved houses and didn't have the room until recently. Boot my desktop for the first time in a while, surprise! Windows 10 has a boot issue (for the 6th or 7th time since 'upgrading') Nothing unusual, my standard experience
 for Win 10 so far. It would boot until the blue Windows logo and black screen with spinning wheel, the monitor would flash off once then back to blue windows logo with spinning wheel and go to a blank black screen with no further progression. Google a couple
 of solutions, and here we are 3 days later and the issues have progressed further not gotten better.<br />
<br />
After multiple searches, of various search terms, across multiple devices and browsers, I've tried basically all of these options and ones that are not mentioned in this article. https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-wont-boot/. I boot every time with no
 USB drives in, excluding keyboard and mouse and two vacant USB hubs.<br />
</p>
<p>All Win 10 Self-repair attempts through recovery mode haven't worked:-</p>
<p>System Restore - didn't solve anything <br />
Start up repair - didn't solve anything<br />
Reset this PC - error failed <br />
System image - recovery non-existent image/not possible <br />
UEFI Firmware settings - not an option <br />
<br />
Start Up Settings - two options work Safe mode with and without networking</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode with Networking was the only way to partially run my PC, and it no longer recognized the WiFi card I have Installed AND that appears in the hardware list in Device Management - Windows confirms the driver is up-to-date (but also doesn't exist)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Safe mode - Have updated every single driver possible - windows says they're all up to date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Have uninstalled GPU driver - hasn't changed anything GPU still appears in hardware list</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now since this, my computer now boots, but makes me go into the BIOS settings EVERY boot, progresses no further without having to Press F1 to enter set up. Have to exit out of bios to get to anything remotely Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Can successfully boot with command prompt. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From this I have tried Method 2 as per this article <br />
http://forums.techdiscussion.in/showthread.php/4421-How-to-fix-MBR-issues-on-Windows-10-Technical-Preview-Installation-Solved<br />
and changed the letters of my drives around D for DVD drv and C for the main SATA HD etc.<br />
<br />
To no avail. Now when after i exit out of my BIOS simply i receive "bootmgr missing please press crtl+alt+del"<br />
</p>
<p>Currently am trying to get a clean install iso file from Windows Media Creation tool and preform a clean install. This is the only option I can see going forward.
<br />
<br />
But my question is, how did it get here? Based on everything I've done have I done something wrong? Is there anywhere I can go from here WITHOUT doing a clean install from a USB? Why am I experiencing SO many boot issues with Windows 10, I know sometimes it's
 not the OS' fault, but this is consistent with Windows 10 as compared to previous Windows where I had almost no boot issues.

            I laughed out so loud when I read your title - thats good one. :D
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<p>Thanks Andre :D Glad I could make you laugh at the very least! <br />
<br />
This will take me sometime to download/mount. So i won't be able to say yes or no to whether or not this solved my problem, but I am going to go down this path you recommend and see where it goes.
</p>
<p><br />
In your personal experience though, am I correct in saying Windows 10 has caused a lot of boot issues compared to previous Windows or am I being unfair?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your speedy reply to my somewhat of an Essay sized question/explanation!

            I have been volunteering on the forums for a while now, especially since Windows 10 was launched and I must say, its probably the most "disruptive" release. Trying to put it as nicely as I can.

<p>Interesting ... because I have had the opposite experience. Up to and including Windows 7 SP1, my life with Windows resembled Carly Simon:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive</em><br />
<em>Thought that's just how much it cost to survive in this world</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After my debacle with SP1 I got fed up with myself, and decided 'I haven't got time for the pain.' I decided, finally, to start from the beginning and learn how to use a computer the right way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began with the equivalent of Dick and Jane: <em>See the mouse. Mouse, mouse, mouse</em>. Eventually I graduated to the internet, where I laid myself at the feet of the experts, the pros, the people who&nbsp;<em>really</em> understand this stuff. I got a real
 education, not only in how to operate a computer correctly, but <em>wisely,</em> and I also received an education in how the technology industry works, which was just as important and elucidating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have not had serious trouble with Windows. That's not to say that I haven't had problems -&nbsp;<em>everyone</em> has problems with computers - but I haven't had a problem that I wasn't able to solve with the skills I learned over the years. There
 have been times when my 'experiments' with my computer sent it on a 'bad trip' (if you remember the 60's, you know what that means) but when that happens I simply restore yesterday's image backup and in a few minutes my computer has traveled back in time and
 it's like nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't mean that I&nbsp;<em>like</em> everything Microsoft has done to Windows 10. Far from it; I think that much of Windows 10 is simply
<em>stupid</em> and showcases Microsoft's arrogance and greed, to say nothing of the high esteem &lt;cough, cough&gt; that Microsoft holds for its customers.&nbsp;<em>But</em> ... it all works properly. I have not seen a blue screen error since Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, all you've told us is that your computer won't boot. A computer can fail to boot for lots of reasons, but we have no context to use for a diagnosis. Was it static electricity? Is it malware? Did you make an unwise change to your configuration
 settings? No one can tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your post sounds like you've tried this, then that, then this ... hoping to find something that works. Trust me, that's not the way to solve a problem. BTDT. The real way to solve a problem is to first
<em>understand</em> it. Only then can you formulate a strategy to solve it (or a work-around, which is one of my favorite words.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without further details, all you will receive is generic advice and perhaps a lucky guess. Here's my generic advice, hope it's lucky:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- If the manufacturers of the computer's hardware don't support their hardware on Windows 10, there's no guarantee that the hardware will work properly, or at all, on Windows 10. It might or it might not. If it works today, it may not work after the next
 update. Once the hardware manufacturer drops support, you're basically on your own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- A clean install on supported hardware always succeeds. Regardless of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- You have the best chance at trouble-free computing if you only install software applications (formerly known as 'programs') that are supported on Windows 10. Of course, you&nbsp;<em>can</em> use unsupported software, and it may work very well for a very long
 time, but without support from the developer it's only a matter of time before it starts causing problems that are unpredictable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4- If you backup your computer every day - which can be quick, easy and automatic - you're never more than 24 hours away from a functioning computer. System Restore is not a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5- <em>The best gift you can give yourself - as far as computing is concerned - is an education in how to use a computer correctly and
</em>wisely<em>. Knowledge is power, as always, but in a world where neither Apple nor Google nor Microsoft give two cr*ps about what's in your and my best interest, knowledge is the only power we have.</em></p>

            How long have you had this system? Notice the BIOS date goes back to 2011. Its possible the system might not officially support Windows 10.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Ready Boost is a Windows feature to increase random read access speed to the hard drive that can speed up your computer. It has been introduced in Windows
 Vista and was significantly improved in Windows 10. For instance, in Windows 10 it is possible to use all the flash drives that are connected to your computer for Ready Boost at once.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Ready Boost in Windows 10 allows you to use your flash memory devices to speed up your computer. You can adjust how much space on your flash memory device

<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Software requirements:</span></strong>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To use Ready Boost in Windows 10 make sure that SuperFetch is enabled. Ready Boost won't work if the SuperFetch service is stopped or disabled.</span></p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hardware requirements:</span></strong>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To use Ready Boost you need a USB flash drive or flash memory card with the following capabilities:</span></p>

<h2>            Wifi connection problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started having problems connecting to WiFi's (yes, all WiFi's)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I switch between WiFi's (like go to school or something) The WiFi just says "No Internet, secured" and stays like that. The only way I can connect to the WiFi is to restart the computer which is annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Troubleshooting</li><li>Update driver</li></ul>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Two stages to try to resolve the issue :
<br />
<br />1. Correct corruption :
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />2. Troubleshoot the WiFi :
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Help - scroll down to "Connectivity" &lt;-- read this
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/wi...</a>

<br />  
<br />Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? The router can be the issue even if other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. 
<br />
<br />Try actually updating your driver :
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point :  Start - type in --&gt; Restore                   find at top and click on it - then Create
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel, RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.
<br /><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.
<br />
<br />You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.
<br />
<br />After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).

            Could you try using Network reset when that happens to see if it helps?
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet  &gt; Status
<br />Scroll to the very bottom
<br />Click Network reset
<br />
<br />Try browsing again.
<br />
<br />Which troubleshooter did you try?
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />It probably has something to do with leasing an IP address to your computer when you hop onto the schools network. The Network reset should help fix that, but you can also manually do it:
<br />
<br /> Press Windows key + X
<br /> Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br /> At the command prompt, enter the following command, the hit Enter
<br /> ipconfig/release
<br /> then
<br /> ipconfig/renew
<br /> then
<br /> ipconfig/flushdns
<br /> exit the command prompt

                    <span>Hi,<br />
I wanted to boot my pc but when the windows loader (horizontal scroll bar thing) starts i loads for 1 second and then it shows a blue screen with errors. I can't see what is written on the error message because it only shows up for less than a half a second
 and then the pc reboots.&nbsp;<br />
I tried using repair but it will not load either. The pc doesn't do anything when a highlight that option and press enter.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have not recently installed software or hardware. I did a few days ago unistall some programs but they were not windows programs. Just adobe software. But when i had uninstalled those i rebooted a few times and everything worked normally.</span>

Thanks a lot The C. . The program you said worked and my pc booted from the cd!!! I repaired it and everything works again!!
<br />

<br />
Thanks again! <br />

            <p>I noticed that Windows 10 is heavier than Windows 7 as well. The OS seems to take more time to open windows and apps which gives the feeling of slowness on my i5 2500k 3.3Ghz, 16GB&nbsp; 1333 Mhz DDR3, 7200RPM 1TB SATA III&nbsp;6GB/s hard drive, and AMD HD 6870 1GB
 GDDR5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are your specs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when first booting up the OS have to wait 3 mins before I can see if clicking Start to respond.&nbsp; My machine is not slow, its CPU is from 2011 and&nbsp;compared to newer i5 processor is about 10% slower. Therefore running current games or Windows should
 not be an issue. But it is with 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This OS is still same as beta. They pushed its release too soon. </p>

            <p>Hi, I was experiencing a very slow OS as well, but after opening up Windows Update and installing two updates that were available and a few reboots it began working really smooth (booting time went from 3 minutes to 20 seconds). Verify if you have pending
 updates and reboot a few times.</p>

            <p>I don't have Avast, but Kaspersky Intenet Security. My laptop did't run too slow, but it was evident by the way the fan was working full time that the processor was being pushed quite hard. Sure enough, a sustained 40% utilisation was being recorded in task
 manager and it was down to the Kaspersky software. The solution was to remove the old version which immediately resolved the CPU utilisation issue. The next step was to download the latest version - which was a minor version revision but nevertheless updated
 for use on Windows 10 - from the software vendors website. This updated version was installed and after the immediate database signature update, worked fine with no further excessive CPU utilisation issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that other anti-virus vendors have released updated versions of their software as well. Avast certainly does now seem to have released a Windows 10 compatible version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://blog.avast.com/2015/06/03/latest-versions-of-avast-compatible-with-windows-10/</p>
<p>
In answer to OPs original issue, it might be worth checking in Task Manager to see whether anything is causing excessive CPU utilisation.<br /></p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2012</h2>
                    We are using Live Mail 2012 and have Spectrum (old Time Warner/Roadrunner) email. I received an email today From: Google, Subject: Security Alert for your linked Google Account - which I cannot open. Not coincidentally, at the same time the email was received,
 I changed my GMail password on another email address, on another computer. &nbsp;The Spectrum email address was set-up in GMail for secondary notifications. I now CANNOT open this one email (from Google) OR create a new email in Live Mail. I can receive email though.
 &nbsp;I tried deleting the Google email in Live Mail and it doesn't take. I've called Spectrum, Google and Microsoft. The first two point fingers, Microsoft stopped servicing Live Mail in January. Any suggestions? Thank you, supportive public!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We like to clarify some points in your post to better assist you. Can you answer a few questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to access Gmail using the webmail but not in Windows Live Mail (WLM)?</li><li>Are both Gmail and Spectrum under your WLM account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend to reconfigure WLM account by removing and adding it back. You can refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14054/windows-live-mail-add-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to remove and add an account in WLM. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us on the results.</p>

<p>obviously if you used windows live mail you liked buttons for sight of the fuller controls..</p>
<p>my suggestion go back to useing the browsers to access the sites of your email providers..at least until they either bring back access to the essential apps or create a new emailling service that matches the button option types..unfortunatly till then they
 say its on the end list of no more suport for those apps that came with the essentials,,another method maybe look up firedog and concerns about windows live photogallery issue to find his reply ,,,i got the win photo gallery back because of his help even on
 the win 10 might help</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bullet 1: We use Live Mail for Spectrum (TimeWarner, Roadrunner) mail only. In all honesty, I don't know how to access my Gmail through Live Mail. That said, GMail is working just fine not using Live Mail. We're only experiencing issue with Spectrum email
 in Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bullet 2: No, only Spectrum is under Live Mail. I access GMail through the internet. That also said, I can access and send Spectrum emails through the internet. To me, Live Mail is definitely the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just a reminder of another point. Everything was working fine in Live Mail until &nbsp;we received the Google "Alert" email in Spectrum, in Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>We appreciate that you have clarified some points about your issue. Have you tried to click on the link that I sent you to reconfigure your Windows Live Mail account? If not yet, here is the link again:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14054/windows-live-mail-add-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WLM</a>. Try to remove your Spectrum account then add it again to see if that will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still the same after re-configuring your WLM account, it will be helpful if you will send us a screenshot of the said "Google Alert" email that you got on your Spectrum account. You may remove any personal or sensitive information on the
 screenshot.</p>
<p>

                    I just installed a Dell XPS 8500 Desktop with Windows 7. I connected my Canon MP700 that was working with my old computer. When I try to print I just get a dialogue box with "collecting printer status" and nothing prints. My document shows a printing error
 in the print queue. I downloaded and installed the 64 bit Windows 7 print driver for my MP700.

<h2>            Partage de jeu et DLC  XBOXONE</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour, je vous explique: A la maison il y a 2 XBOXONE, la mienne et celle de mon fils. Nous avons installé le jeu BF4 (à partir d'un DVD) sur les 2 consoles et on joue tous les 2 à ce jeu en se prêtant le DVD. Par contre j'ai téléchargé le DLC China rising
 sur ma console qui est la console principale. Sur la console principale, on trouve les 2 comptes. S'il se connecte avec son compte sur la console principale il a accès à China rising. Par contre lorsqu'il se connecte sur sa console il n'a pas accès à China
 rising. Il faut payer pour le télécharger. Je pensais qu'un profil pouvait avoir accès à un jeu et aux extensions( DLC) sur toutes les consoles à partir du moment où il se connectait sur son compte ?<br />
Comment faire pour qu'il puisse profiter de l'extension China rising sur sa console sans le repayer une seconde fois ?</p>

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p>To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File
 Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions from the KB article to run SFC scan.</p>
<p><b>How to repair the operating system and how to restore the operating system configuration to an earlier point in time in Windows Vista</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212/</a></b></p>
<p>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are facing the issue with any other third party .dll files then I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the software and drivers from the manufacturer website.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The concern you have encountered with Wi-Fi may be due to a corrupted file or a misconfigured setting. To turn on your Wi-Fi on your laptop, you can press Fn key on your keyboard and press the WiFi signal on the F keys. You may see airplane mode is disabled
 message on your device. If issue persists, power down the computer then unplug your cables.<br />
<br />
If you require any further information, feel free to let us know.<br />

 about a just in time debugger and that I should enable it. I just want it to go away so that I can play my game. The thing is&nbsp;I uninstalled&nbsp;visual studio a couple days ago because I switched to civil and now have no need for it. I don't know what to do now.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Howaine,<br />
<br />
<br />
Removing the Visual Studio app should stop the <strong>Just-in-Time debugger</strong> dialog box you're receiving.<br />
<br />
That being said, how did you uninstall the Visual Studio?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, here's how you can disable the dialog box:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Control Panel</strong> by searching for it in the <strong>Cortana
</strong>search box.<br />
</li><li>Click<strong> Network and Internet</strong> &gt; <strong>Internet Options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Go to the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.<br />
</li><li>Scroll down and check the following boxes:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>Disable script debugging (Other)</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;5. Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Michelle thanks for the speedy response. Unfortunately the problem still remains and the 2 boxes u recommended checking were already checked. As for if Visual studio was uninstalled yess it was done through the control panel&nbsp;<strong>Programs&gt;uninstall
 a program.&nbsp;</strong>so i can assure you it was done correctly. And not just sending an icon to the recycle bin. The game loads up and then im am greeted with this<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3bbbb9f8-9adc-4aae-a28d-c5ac7839692b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3bbbb9f8-9adc-4aae-a28d-c5ac7839692b" /></a></p>
<p>After clicking debug i am met with this<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ce268b3-0172-4d8a-9207-1b9b5588eeec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ce268b3-0172-4d8a-9207-1b9b5588eeec" /></a>I
 hope this additional information would help you to resolve the problem...also would a restart help?</p>

<p>Hello Howaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just-In-Time debugging may still be enabled even if Visual Studio is no longer installed on your computer. When Visual Studio is not installed, you cannot disable Just-In-Time debugging from the Visual Studio
<strong>Options</strong> dialog box. In that case, you can disable Just-In-Time debugging by editing the Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To disable Just-In-Time debugging by editing the registry, refer to the steps below:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>1. On the <em><strong>Start </strong></em>menu, search for and run <strong><em>regedit.exe.</em></strong></p>
<p>2. In the Registry Editor window, locate and delete the follow registry entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\DbgManagedDebugger</em></p>
</li></ul>
<p>3. If your computer is running a 64-bit operating system, delete the following registry entries also:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger</em></li><li><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\.NETFramework\DbgManagedDebugger</em></li></ul>
<p>4. Take care not to accidentally delete or change any other registry keys.</p>
<p>5. Close the Registry Editor window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: <em>The method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</a></strong>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> skittlz15  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Deleted folders. The ONLY one I didn&#39;t mean to delete is the only one that&#39;s not in the recycle bin.</h2>
                    I had a bunch of folders on an external hard drive. I made DVDs with the data so I could delete the folders. When I deleted the folders, I by accidentally deleted a folder I didn't mean to delete. As anyone would do I figured it would be in the recycle
 bin and I could just restore it, but it wasn't there. The 6 folders I had intended to delete were all in the Recycle Bin, but the one I had mistakenly deleted wasn't there.
<br />
<br />
I thought it might be because the folder was too big for the recycle bin and was thus permanently deleted. However, of all the folders I had just deleted it wasn't even the largest. I tried to run the program recuva, but all it could find was other files deleted
 in the past, not the ones contained within the mysteriously absent folder.<br />
<br />
SO...WHY do the other, larger folders I deleted at THE EXACT SAME TIME from THE EXACT SAME LOCATION appear in the recycle bin, while this one specific folder does not. I really don't understand why it has just vanished, as I have NEVER deleted something without
 it showing up in the recycle bin. The only time this might happen I get a prompt telling me "This folder is too big for the recycle bin. Would you like to permanently delete it?" No such prompt appeared.<br />
<br />
WHERE DID THIS FOLDER GO??????<br />

<div>1: Is it possible you accidently dragged the folder into one of the other 
folders before you deleted them? Open each folder on the page that held the 
missing folder and see if it has become a subfolder of another. If not there, 
restore the deleted folders and check them for a subfolder.</div>

            1. It didn't end up in one of the other folders. That was one of the first things I checked.<br />
<br />
2. Despite the fact that I create a restore point every month or so, I am being told there are no restore points that I can use for a system restore. Now in addition to my folder having just disappeared I have this annoying and unpleasant problem to try and
 contend with. I even tried testing this today by making a new system restore point, and that didn't show up as a potential restore point either. Never had this problem with earlier versions of Windows. Now I am very irritated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying to help I guess. <br />

            Thanks. I don't know why you're assuming I don't backup files though. These folders were less than 2 days old and I was making physical data backups when this happened. I merely highlighted one wrong item and the delete function chose to act in a way I
 have never seen in all my years years of PC computing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for taking the time to review my issue. This was fairly important data, so I may do a little more research before giving up, but again I appreciate the quick replies.<br />

<h2>            How can one determine a partition&#39;s contents</h2>
                    I installed a second OS onto my laptop. During the installation process, the Os showed multiple disk partitions. Under disk management I noticed the several partitions but most have no name. How does one determine the actual contents of each partition?
 There are eight partitions but there should only be four (Win7, Recovery, Linux, Linux restore).

            <p>Won't work if all storage manager shows is the size, an asterisk, and "unallocated.</p>
<p>My solution was to allocate each partition, assign a drive letter, and hope for the best. Once that was done, I merged the partitions into the primary partition which in turn whacked ALL data on the partition. None of the oddballs was shown as being empty.
 On the surface that makes some sense, but when the partition shows "*; Unallocated; Capacity = 1.9GB; Free Space = 890MB" something is definitely not kosher. I guess Windows isn't such a great **** operating system afterall. Or am I missing something?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Safety Scanner Partially Removed Java CVE-2013-2423</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the Microsoft Safety Scanner version 1.0.3001.0 and it detected the malware JAVA/CVE-2013-2423 and indicated that it was partially removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted all Java programs from my Win 7 Pro x64 system and ran the program again with the same results, only partial removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted all restore points and backups and ran the scan again with the same results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scanner indicated three files were infected. But, it doesn't tell you which files they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way to determine what to delete from the system. When you click on "View detailed results of the scan" all you get is a pop-up with two columns: Malware and Scan results. The malware column only indicates: Exploit: Java/CVE-2013-2423. The scan
 results indicates: Partially removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pop-up box also indicates: To view manual steps, click the name of the viruses, spyware, or potentially unwanted software. When I click on the name of the virus, I get a webpage about the virus and it indicates to remove the programs, which I did after
 the first scan, but the Safety Scanner still indicates it's presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Microsoft should modify this program to give the full path to the infected files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time that I've run the Microsoft Safety Scanner. My internet security software is ESET Smart Security 7. I also run Windows Defender and SUPERAntiSpyware Pro, but none of these programs detected this threat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>This issue has been resolved. Although I had just upgraded from ESET Smart Security 6 to 7, I hadn't run a full scan with ESET SS 7 yet. ESET SS 7 detected and removed the threat.</p>

<h2>            Age Of Empires The Age Of Kings Multiplayer Crash</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>I just installed the AOE Age Of Kings on my DELL 7537 PC running Windows 10. The problem here is that the game stops working as soon as I click on the 'Local (LAN) TCP/IP Connection' option in the Multiplayer menu. A dialog box pops up saying Age Of Empires
 II has stopped working and the annoying thing is that it works fine in my friend's Lenovo Yoga 3 PC which also has Windows 10. I've tried reinstalling the game, I've tried running the game in Compatibility Mode, I've tried the 'Run as Administrator' option
 and even turning off the firewall to see if the firewall is blocking the LAN connection or something but nothing worked.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I'm missing on something.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Xbox One dashboard unresponsive or behaving strangely</h2>
                    
<p>Up until recently, my X1 has been great (purchased Sept 10th). However, it seems that the dashboard is now flaking out. When I have the X1 set for Instant-On, it seems like none of the applications will take focus. For instance, if I select a game to play,
 the large Tile will show what I've selected, but it never goes full screen. Addtionally, the interface becomes unresponsive. I have to hit the home button to get my selection halo back. This seems to happen with all apps and games. If I hold down the home
 button on the controller&nbsp;to turn off the machine, the prompt appears, but I an unable to select the console or controller. the tile selection seems to only be active in the background. The only fix I've found when this happens is to pull the plug on the power
 brick and boot the box as if a performing a cold start.</p>
<p>If I set the X1 to energy saver mode, none of this craziness happens, it just takes a while to boot up.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this?</p>

<p>have you tired a hard reboot? this normally fixes most issues. when the console is powered on, hold in power button for about 5 seconds until console shuts off and light on power brick turns orange. also, when you are on your home screen, hold in both triggers
 and hit y button. this refreshes the dashboard</p>

<p>I have similar problems. &nbsp;I never warm boot. &nbsp;(I have the power saving enabled, so it fully reboots.)</p>
<p>Over the last week or so, I have had problems launching apps. &nbsp;I can select the tiles and they react to being clicked, but don't launch their apps. &nbsp;This includes the "sign in" button and "Quit" on the application menu, none of them do anything when clicked.
 &nbsp;After a while of fiddling and trying different things, like explicitly calling up the UI again, eventually it starts working again. &nbsp;Not sure if just waiting a long time does anything.</p>
<p>The LT+RT+Y (ctrl-alt delete, REALLY???) combo is hilarious but only reloads the UI rendering in my case, it does not make it responsive again.</p>

<p>PS: I left out an important detail: &nbsp;The unresponsive state happens right after a cold reboot. &nbsp;Once it becomes responsive, it stays that way unless something happens to an app. &nbsp;For example, once the Amazon Instant Video app locked up and then the UI was
 in the unresponsive state. &nbsp;However, usually it is right after boot, though not 100% of the time either. &nbsp;Reminds me of early windows...</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions Rastan. I would assume that a hard reboot would be similar to pulling the power cord? If not, I'll try depressing the power button for a long duration when I get home this evening. Otherwise, the only way I can get the behavior
 to stop is pulling the power and letting it boot from scratch.</p>

<p>Similar problem here. It started just over this last weekend. It came up with a screen saying announcements and then never cam back. It sat there froze never loading anything. In the end I turned off. Pulled the power and restarted. The following day whilst
 in the dash board the controller became unresponsive. I took batteries out of controller and started the second controller using the usb cable but the dash would not respond. Turned off and rebooted again. Today same thing? Like others have said above it's
 been working fine until this last weekend??</p>

<p>Okay... My oroginal post still stands, but with some additions...</p>
<p>I'm still getting a failure to launch apps and games. This seems to happen regardless of what powder setting I choose. It also seems to happen after the unit has been on for 6+ hours. The ONLY fix I've found is restarting the console. This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I would try dumping your cahce on your network by resetting your modem and router and make sure that your router and are unpluged at the same time.</p>

<p>did you try a hard reboot? that is different than unplugging it. also when you do unplug it, hold in power button for 5 seconds to drain machine. another thing to try is to go into your disc/bluray settings and clear your cache there. xbox recommends doing
 that 3 times. hopefully this fixes something (:</p>
