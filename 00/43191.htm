<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<span>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA BSOD&nbsp;</span>indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.
<br />
Typically the memory address is wrong or the memory address is pointing at freed memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could run the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool to check if there are any errors in your RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Windows Memory Diagnostics</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool, to test the memory. Click the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type Memory, and then click&nbsp;<span>Diagnose your computer's memory problems</span>.‌
 After the test is run, use Event viewer to view the results under the System log. Look for the&nbsp;<em>MemoryDiagnostics-Results</em>&nbsp;entry to view the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have further questions, feel free to reply to this thread.</span></p>

<h2>            Mouse stopped moving</h2>
                    My usb mouse has stopped working with my laptop. You can left and right click and the scroll wheel still works when you position the cursor (via trackpad) correctly but the cursor stays still when you wiggle the mouse so its completely unusable.&nbsp; I tried
 a different usb mouse - same problem - so its definitely the laptop not the mouse.&nbsp; Was working fine for several months until stopped working one day for no reason.&nbsp; Windows 7.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your help.&nbsp; No idea what the problem was but glad its working now</p>

<h2>            Had internet turned off and did the update and shutdown process.</h2>
                    <p>Last night I had my internet off while I was playing a game and forgot to turn it back on when i went to shutdown my laptop to do an update. &nbsp;It seemed like it was able to do the update just fine but this morning when i went to boot it up it gave me a black
 screen for about 10-20 minutes. &nbsp;I had to force shutdown of the laptop and boot it back up when I bring it back up it does the rest of the update but when i finish logging in. I cut my wifi back on and when i go to turn it off again It keeps saying that it
 needs to do a update and restart and never goes away no matter how many times shut it down and bring it back up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i was wondering could that be a problem from me for not having my wifi on when it did the update, and i am hoping that there is a way to fix it.</p>

            Hi Dark Rules, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try to roll your system back in and install the updates again:
<br />
<br />Click on Start - and type "control panel" and click on it
<br />
<br />Once open, search "recovery" and hit enter. When it comes up, click on recovery. 
<br />
<br />On the next page, open "open system restore" 
<br />
<br />They'll be a box that says "click for more restore points" that I would click. Choose a restore point (before this happened), and follow the prompts. 
<br />
<br />** Please note, all your files and photos, etc will be fine. Any applications (ex. candy crush) you've installed since the point you're going back to will be removed. Just a heads up **
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>I am using a Gateway 510 series&nbsp;computer and am having a real problem with the mouse. If I click once, I often bring up multiple windows. Sometime existing open windows will disappear and unselected windows appear. Copying and pasting is almost impossible
 to do. On the control panel I have tried adjusting the click speed up and down with no avail. This is especially&nbsp;annoying on the internet, using both&nbsp;IE8 and Firefox. Can anyone offer possible solutions?</p>

<p>With Black Ops DLC you need to download the DLC for the region of the game. So for example if you have a US disc, you'll need to download with a US account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also remember that they can tell where you are in the world via your IP address, so it is possible that it is blocking you from downloading because you have a Canadian IP but an account from another region.</p>

<p>Yep you need to create an canadian account and purchase Canadian ms points and purchase the dlc that way</p>
<p>It does not need to be gold however to buy USA region locked content like hulu and Netflix it won't work along with us dlc

<p>Canadian Netflix is only available to Canadian accounts</p>

                    I've had this contact for long but it doesn't seem like she deleted or blocked me because I don't see any gray question mark icon or green tick next to her profile pic(which is still there). Why?

<p>I'm not sure what happened but I managed to type again by accessing Skype to another device.</p>
<p>Anyway there wasn't even an empty circle which saying that the contact is online or offline, it just doesn't show it. In addition the messages I recieve comes very late: When I reopened Skype, after a month that I haven't used it, my contacts' messages arrived
 1-2 days after I logged in and they were sent some days after I stopped using Skype.</p>

    <title>Blue screen on reinstall of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bvivers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen on reinstall of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo H215 Desktop that came with Windows 7 preinstalled , but no disks and was never given the option to make backup disks.&nbsp; I jumped at the chance to install Windows 10 a few months back, but could not access Guest documents, so I uninstalled
 it.&nbsp; I moved all the needed guest files and responded to another pop up to install Windows 10.&nbsp; Not sure what I chose the first time, but this time I choose to download the file to install later(it was getting late).&nbsp; Waited for the download to complete and
 was notified it was ready to install.&nbsp; Powered down so I could watch it install the next day. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Powered up the system and a screen came up notifying me that Windows did not close correctly and to start up in diagnostic mode.&nbsp; I tried to select it immediately, but my wireless keyboard is useless until the driver is loaded.&nbsp; After the timeout, a blue
 screen comes up with hex codes and the message that the bios is not compatible.&nbsp; Tried this several times with a USB wired keyboard but could not break the default startup by pressing enter, or select the startup Windows method.&nbsp; I do not have a PS/2 keyboard(MB
 is wired for both)&nbsp; What are my options at this point.&nbsp; Does Microsoft have a support facility in Phoenix, AZ/</p>

            Hi Charles, 
<br />
<br />Any apps, either 3rd party or Store apps that were removed during a Windows 10 Reset will need to be sourced on the Web and re-installed on your PC . . .
<br />
<br />Do you have a list of those apps?
<br />
<br />To re-download any Windows Store apps, go to the Store, look in your Library to find those and you can re-download from there
<br />
<br />To re-download 3rd party applications, you will need to go to the software developers website and re-download from there . ..       
        </p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />I would go ahead and check windows.old. It is inside your C: drive. If the applications are not there, you can try a third party program. 
<br />
<br />Recuva from CCcleaner will restore lost files: <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, you may have to reinstall all programs.

<p>When you reset your PC, your hard drive is erased and a fresh copy of Windows is installed. If you did a 'keep my files' type of reset, apps that you got from Microsoft Store will be reinstalled. Apps that you got elsewhere are not - more on that below.
 Windows will put an HTML file on your desktop that shows you all the non-Microsoft Store apps that you need to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps in that HTML file are taken from the list in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps and features, but that may not, in fact, be everything that you need to re-install. For example, it may not include all your drivers, and it may not include apps that don't
 need to be installed (so-called 'portable apps.')</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have apps that were installed from a disk, you can re-install them from the disk. For apps that were obtained from the internet, visit the developer's website and follow their re-installation instructions. If you're re-installing apps that you paid
 for, you'll need the license key and any other registration information that you used to install them in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with all that, there are still some apps that you may not be able to re-install, e.g., apps from developers that no longer exist, and apps that were pre-installed by the computer manufacturer. The license for the latter sometimes states that they cannot
 be re-installed once removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one more reason that I advise against a reset unless it's truly necessary. There are 'gotchas' that you don't find out about until it's too late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not that Microsoft doesn't&nbsp;<em>want</em> to re-install apps that you got from outside Microsoft Store. Apps from Microsoft's own Microsoft Store are easy to find and easy to re-install because Microsoft keeps track of them in your Microsoft account,
 including your configuration choices and progress (e.g., your progress in a game.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For apps that you got from other places, Microsoft doesn't have a master list it can consult for every app ever released that tells them where to find an installer (if one still exists,) and even if they did, they don't know what configuration options you
 chose during installation. And they certainly don't know your license key for apps you purchased.</p>

            wait for a response from the manufacture as it's an issue on their end with their software....or, go out and buy a new webcam.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. I understand that you get an error message in Photo Gallery informing you that one or more folders are offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you verify if some of the included folders are located at an external drive or Network-attached Storage?
<font>If yes, then kindly open Windows Explorer, then on the left pane, right-click
<strong>Pictures</strong> (under <strong>Libraries</strong>), and then click <strong>
Properties</strong>. Click on the external location, then click <strong>Remove</strong>. After removing the folders, click
<strong>OK</strong>.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Glenda</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Checked out what you suggested, but none of my images are on external drives.... all are stand alone images on my laptop. I do copy my images from this laptop to a stick as a back up from time to time. There is no reason for this to
 have started happening. It worked one night, and the next day it was gone.</p>
<p>The photos actually open, it is only when I attempt to edit them the program displays the message about files being offline.</p>
<p>Any advice would be great.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<strong>Pictures</strong>, then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>(3) Still under <strong>Libraries</strong>, right-click <strong>Videos</strong>, then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Left pane of Photo Gallery so we can see what folders and directories are currently detected by Photo Gallery.</li><li>Error message (if any) when you try to open the folder where the photos are saved.

<p><strong>All I want to know is why my photos need to be offline to edit them. Should I not be able to store photos on my computer and edit them.? (As I used to)&nbsp;Is that not the purpose of gallery? &nbsp;I can put a stick or external drive into my USB and select
 the same pics and edit them, but what an inconvenient way to do it.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi stevod63,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back. The screenshots that were asked by Helene was to check the folders configured to your Photo Gallery and to isolate which of those folders are causing the issue. Also, I apologize if the steps for number 1 screenshot is not that clear.
 The steps are for the Include folder window in your Photo Gallery. You can do this by press
<strong>File</strong> (<strong>ALT + F</strong>) in Photo Gallery then click <strong>
Include folder</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for the screenshots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>Oh boy, what a drama! If I go through explorer I cannot open Gallery. If I click on a photo it will open the picture in gallery and allow me to advance to other pics etc, but it will not allow me to edit. Once I click on the edit tab it comes up with the
 error window saying 'One or more files in gallery is offline and is preventing photo gallery from starting.'</p>
<p>Then you give me this Alt F (File) to do and it doesn't do anything except make the screen flicker a little as you do it! I press the PRTSC button.... nothing.
</p>
<p>Maybe you should tell me what to look for and I'll see if I can find it? I thought I knew a little about computers but these tasks you are all asking me to do make no sense or are totally ambiguous. It is making ME feel totally stupid and frustrated!</p>
<p>Just tell me what I need to look for.</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>We apologize for the confusion. You've mentioned that you were backing up your photos to a USB drive. It is possible that you have opened/edited a photo within the USB, making it appear as one of the included folders on Photo Gallery. If the USB drive
 is removed within your computer, Photo Gallery will give this type of error. To troubleshoot the issue, we advice that you remove the folder using the instructions below:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click the Windows button on your keyboard and type <b>Libraries</b></li><li>Right-click Pictures and choose <b>Properties</b></li><li>Highlight the folders that has a path that leads to a removable device and click
<b>Remove</b></li></ol>
<div>Let us know the results afterwards.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            on the new skype i cant see when contacts log in</h2>
                    hi i have a issue im sure everyone probably has&nbsp; why isnt there a thing still on the new skype where&nbsp; we are notified when contacts log in ? like&nbsp; how it is on skype 7.40 because im missing my fav contacts&nbsp; sometimes without it...&nbsp; &nbsp;i think it should be
 built&nbsp; into the new skype as its&nbsp; a need well for me and maybe others and also i think we need a away status not just available busy or invisible because i have to use busy&nbsp; as&nbsp; this because i dont like being on available always&nbsp; otherwise its good i only
 dislike what i mentioned so hopefully its added eventually thanks.

    <title>unable to install MEISP software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sudarshangogoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to install  MEISP software</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used MEISP (an impedance spectroscopic tool) earlier in Windows 8 environment. But, after upgradation to windows 10 it does not work. When I try to install the program the system prevents it giving error massage as "This file does not have a valid digital
 signature......". I have performed some settings in internet explorer allowing programs to run even from unkown publishers (having invalid digital signature). Still I could not install the software, instead it terminates abnormally. Here is the link from where
 the program can be downloaded :<br />
<em><strong>http://impedance0.tripod.com/</strong></em></p>
<p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for you reply. Your tip has resolved my problem. Fortunately, I have found an alternative&nbsp; approach though it&nbsp;works in the same way as&nbsp;your suggestion, but indirectly. I&nbsp;performed the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. right click on the setup application file</p>
<p>2. select<strong> Troubleshoot compatibility </strong></p>
<p>3. select <strong>Try recommended settings </strong></p>
<p>4. select <strong>Test the program </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Run the program by accepting the warning massage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your one is more robust and does not require to perform the above steps every time I want to use the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you dear Paul. </p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Game Title Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atryeu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Game Title Updates</h2>
                    <p>After that last system update we had for Xbox 360 I have a weird problem. Title Updates for games don't seem to stay on my system if an update for a different game is played on there as well. For example, so many days ago I went to play Borderlands 1 again
 which I had the update for several months ago when I installed the game again but it asked me to download it&nbsp; yet again. Today somebody else in the household played Just Cause 2 for a bit which required an update that I already had on the system as well.&nbsp;
 I just started Borderlands 1 up again and it said I had to update it again.&nbsp; Each time one game has their update downloaded it's like it forces the others off and it has to be redownloaded each time a different game is played.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, not all games are doing this, such as Frozen Free Fall. That has been played a few times through the last week and never asked for an update again yet these other games keeping asking for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what is going on? This started after that last system update (back in June or July I think it was?) like I said and before that I never had any issues like this.&nbsp; My system has plenty of HD space by the way so that's not the issue. There is over
 70GB free and these updates are about 4MB.&nbsp; The issue is that I am on a metered bandwidth connection and having to redownload 4MB over and over each time a different game is played will start to add up...</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;atryeu1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking for answers on this one with no such luck... Have you tried clearing the systems Cache?&nbsp; this seems logical and it may well be a step you have already done so forgive me if you have. Steps are below</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Select "Settings" and then&nbsp;<strong>"System Settings.</strong>"</strong><span style="color: rgba(96, 96, 96, 1)">&nbsp;You'll see various settings categories.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Select&nbsp;<strong>"Storage.</strong>"</strong><span style="color: rgba(96, 96, 96, 1)">&nbsp;You'll see all of your connected storage devices.</span></p>
<p><strong>Highlight any storage device and press the yellow "Y" button.</strong><span style="color: rgba(96, 96, 96, 1)">&nbsp;This will open the "Device Options" menu. It doesn't matter which storage device you select, as you'll be clearing the entire
 system's cache.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Select "Clear System Cache" and then confirm.</strong><span style="color: rgba(96, 96, 96, 1)">&nbsp;The cache will be deleted, which should only take a few moments.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Other than that I can only suggest contacting Xbox Support and see if they have a solution, I'm guessing there may be others who are having the same issues... I apologise that I can't be any more help than that but this has me stumped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only think that resetting the Cache may Jog the systems stored responses in some way. Btw resting the Cache won't delete any games or content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope I have been able to help somewhat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know how you go<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Harlon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for a delay in response, I'm having the worst time figuring out this new forum system and it took me forever to locate my post again. It was so easy before to find previous posts a user had made...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried clearing the cache already and re-downloaded the updates. If I switched games and then went back to the other it would ask to download the update again though.&nbsp; And again, this is only certain games, not all of them are doing this and they never
 did this before. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have more time to try and figure this out this weekend but I had hoped somebody else might have had a similar issue and knew what was going on.&nbsp; Thank you again for the response.</p>
<p>

<p>It would have been whatever day I wrote about it here... About a week ago now? I haven't gone back to try and play either game again since I posted. I haven't had much time to play over the last few days but I'll have some free time this weekend to bring
 the games up and see if it's still doing it. It was after I cleared the cache like I said. I had tried that before posting here.<br />

<p>Hi CMroz,</p>
<p>

            Thanks. I'm not sure that's the issue in this case. I'm happy with my username and it's displayed correctly on the Windows login screen, my email, and everywhere else - I even use the correct name to log into OneDrive. For some reason though my user folder
 (automatically created and not editable to my knowledge) has shortened my username and added "_000". I'm not sure why, but this is the only place my username appears this way.

<p>The PC is listed &amp; I am the admin. I can even get OneDrive to work briefly, but as soon as I make changes to a file (and it attempts to sync) I run into this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated to the Windows October update hoping it would fix the issue. Now the problem has changed slightly. Doing a reset via the command line gets OneDrive working after restarting. After trying to sync a file though nothing happens. I can also not
 edit the files (for example I am unable to delete files, etc). When I click "open folder" through the app I now get this message. I am also still running into the login loop while trying to troubleshoot the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So updating has actually created another problem to overcome...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does OneDrive support give you any suggestions?</p>

    <title>Where do I find the exit codes after chkdsk has run on restart&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where do I find the exit codes after chkdsk has run on restart&#63;</h2>
                    Searching Microsoft gives me tons of information about running chkdsk and the various options and meanings of exit codes. I ran it today on my D drive with the /f option which required a restart. I thought Windows might display a screen or something after
 the restart showing the exit code but no such luck. None of the MS pages I've seen says where to find the exit code. I tried the Event Viewer but no luck. Is there a log file somewhere?
                </div>

            Exit codes are transitory in nature and are typically only available to the next instruction after the chkdsk instruction when it is included in a script or .bat file.&nbsp; The Event ID has nothing to do with the exit code.&nbsp; Chkdsk only has four exit codes
 that are described here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Microsoft Windows XP - Chkdsk"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/chkdsk.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/chkdsk.mspx?mfr=true</a> &gt;<br />
<br />
It only makes sense to use these codes if you are writing a script that checks drives other than the Windows OS drive as the Windows drive is always in use and can only be checked before Windows (and ergo any script) is executed.&nbsp; The information that you retrieved
 from the Application log tells you much more than the exit codes do.&nbsp; If you need to programatically check the result of a power-on Chkdsk operation, you will need a tool such as "<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">psloglist</a>"
 to dump the entry from the log and parse it from there.<br />
