            Hi woomangr<br />
<br />
If you deleted it from Device Manager, just reboot your computer, it "should" come back<br />
If not, you may need to go to another computer and download the program and updates from Toshiba, burn them to a CD then use that CD on your computer to reinstall.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped.<br />

    <title>removed a program using programs and features and it still appears in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            removed a program using programs and features and it still appears in the start most recently used list</h2>
                    <p>after upgrading to the windows 10 anniversary edition I found my old windows freecell game stopped working.<br />
so I removed it using programs and features but there was still an entry in the most recently used program list</p>
<p>
</p><p>right clicking on freecell in the list and selecting more -&gt; don't show in the list&nbsp; doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>clicking on the freecell icon does nothing, the icon is not the correct one for freecell, it's just a blank document icon which lets me know that the freecell program can't be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so how do I remove artifacts from the start menus most recently used list.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my original post "right clicking on freecell in the list and selecting more -&gt; don't show in the list&nbsp; doesn't do anything."</p>
<p>
</p><p>the most recently used program list was broken before the program was removed or during the removal and now that there is no program associated&nbsp;with it "don't show in the list" doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might have been broken since the upgrade to the anniversary windows 10.</p>
<p>I tried reinstalling the program, it created another most recently used freecell and uninstalling again, the new MRU freecell was removed.&nbsp; So I'm thinking the problem isn't in the MSI procedure.&nbsp; Considering Freecell worked fine before the upgrade and didn't
 work after the upgrade I'm not so sure I'm completely surprised it's stuck in this state.&nbsp; Microsoft's attempt to remove it during the upgrade must have failed leaving the MRU list corrupted.</p>

<h2>            Code 43</h2>
                    Hi recently my computer made a high pitched noise and then just shut down. It took time but it rebooted itself but while it was starting I saw this horizontal red lines at the bottom of the screen. They later was gone when it came to the login screen.
 I logged in and Everything and it Went fine. I later saw that my Graphics driver had error 43 when I tried to start a game. It didnt help with a factory reset as I then tested (didnt have any important on my pc and was thinking it may have been a virus). It
 reset and it still didnt help. I tried the DDU and saw that windows basic display adapter showed up and didnt have any problem so I installed the Nvidia drivers and then it sade code 43 again. Any help?

<p>Hi Arvid,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Code 43 </strong>is means that one of the drivers controlling the device notified Windows that the device failed in some manner, in this case, your graphics card driver have failed. As a first troubleshooting step, we suggest that you run the
<strong>Hardware and Device troubleshooter </strong>and see if it resolves the problem or give additional info about the problem. You may download and run the troubleshooter by clicking this
<strong><em><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the troubleshooter does not resolve the issue, you may attempt to update the driver through
<strong>Windows Update</strong>. you may update your driver through <strong>Windows Update
</strong>by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start </strong>button, then select <strong>Settings </strong>
&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>.</li><li>From there, select <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</li><li>If there are updates waiting to be installed, kindly do so and restart your device.</li><li>After restarting, check <strong>Device Manager </strong>if it still shows the error code.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>However, if Windows Update did not find an update for your device, you may update it by going to the device manufacturer's website, and download the latest driver from them, and follow their instructions on how to install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure that the device drivers that are being installed are compatible with your current Windows version and platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, feel free to post back to us.</p>

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>

<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>

<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
Trying to set up message rule, when receiving message from specific domains, move to existing folder.<br />
For example, when a new message from any account from @yourdomain.com is received, move the message to the "yourdomain" folder.<br />
I have tried the "Where the From line contains people" condition, and the "people" list has "yourdomain.com", "@yourdomain.com", "*yourdomain.com" and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Default settings for the condition options.<br />
There are existing emails from that domain in my inbox.&nbsp; When I click Apply Now and select that rule, the rule says it processed OK, but the existing emails from that domain were not moved.&nbsp; About an hour after that test, I received a new message from that
 domain and it was not moved either.<br />
<br />
There are hundreds of accounts from that domain that I receive daily, adding each one explicitly to the "People" list is not an option.<br />
<br />
After reading through the other help messages about rules:&nbsp; this is not about Hotmail, this is Windows Live Mail desktop.&nbsp; The accounts I am using are all POP3.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi <span>
UniqueDisplayNameMike,</span><br />
<br />
We currently don't have the option to make a rules that all domain will go directly to a folder. I will forward the suggestion over to our product team as consideration for a future release.
</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts about the look and features of Windows Live Mail, and for your suggestions
 of new features you think are important to add to the product.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks!<br />

            <p>You're kidding, I hope, otherwise no telling how many emails I have missed from work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't&nbsp;it obvious that the "From" search should be able to&nbsp;include email address&nbsp;AND name, as though they were both visible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How much extra time would it have cost for Microsoft to anticipate someone needing that feature? Now it's going to cost you and your customers MILLIONS of dollars total to change their rules (or like I will do, change email clients back to Thunderbird or
 something). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This omission is&nbsp;even more&nbsp;rediculous&nbsp;than some of the glaring omissions in .NET controls, like when sorting a&nbsp;number field in a grid, the sort should be by number, not by displayed text. Same for Date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your project managers need to browse web sites like StackOverflow.com, and search Bing to collect a comprehensive list of obvious omissions that would make Homer Simpson go "Duhhh".</p>

Filtering by domain does work for new messages. I have just tested with a new rule:<br />

<div><strong>Highlight it with <u>Fuchsia</u> </strong></div>

Belated thanks - However it looks like they never fixed this Rule bug that can find display "From" names (but not actual email addresses or domain names) when rules are applied to existing folders.<br />
<br />
I just had to add an email rule for another "From" domain, and the manual rules run still doesn't find a single existing email from that domain (too many "From" display names to update manually from this domain - Plus, the same person from the same email address
 often uses different display names when sent from different computers).<br />
<br />
<b>An easier manual workaround: </b>Now the manual "Find Message" <b>can</b> find hidden addresses and domain names, so a mass-move of the manually-found emails is a relatively painless workaround compared to entering all the display names from a given domain
 into a rule. Seems like I the same problem with manual search before, but at least now it works with hidden addresses.<br />
<br />
<b>EDIT:</b> I have Live Mail 2009 Build 14.0.8089.0726, but the web page you referenced says the last Live Mail 2009 build is 14.0.8117.0416 - I wonder if the rule bug has been fixed in the latest build? I guess Microsoft Updates doesn't keep Windows Live
 Mail updated for XP anymore, even when an XP program has a new build.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it will just screw up all my existing settings and emails if I try to reinstall WLM manually using the last build, since Microsoft Update apparently isn't updating WLM, but it still sends me updates for various other Windows XP issues.<br />
<br />
<b>I swear, I spend more time trying to find workarounds for Microsoft bugs than I do for my own bugs.
</b>That actually got me <b>fired </b>once and called out on the carpet more times than I can remember for having a project run severely late because I had to search Google for every bug I encountered in Visual Studio .NET controls, performance issues, etc.
<br />
<br />
It also makes me look like an idiot when the manager is looking over my shoulder - I heard one of them calling me a "Google Hound" behind my back, and several people laughing about it - According to the Network manager, I was flagged on his internet usage manager's
 report that got distributed to like 10 managers because I had to search Google so much - but he said he was flagged on the report for the same reason, just not the same issues - GRRRRRRRR!!!<br />
<br />
PS - I'm unemployed now, but after my experience with AJAX in VS 2010, where MS just did a "file dump" of AJAX files &amp; JQuery into ASP.NET with absolutely no debug support, still no 2-way client/server state support (just one-way via ViewState), and very inaccurate
 design rendering support compared to WinForms, which is only made 10x worse with AJAX-happy developers I had to fix bugs for, I'm actually HAPPY I got away from that project - Shoot me in the head if I ever take another ASP.NET development job. From now on
 it's WinForms and SQL Server all the way - Even if I'm unemployed till I have to go on friggin Social Security.<br />

<br />
The one you have was released in July 2009, and it was&nbsp;updated several times after that. The installer for last version for XP is
<a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive3/en/wlsetup-all.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://g.live.com/1rewlive3/en/wlsetup-all.exe</a>&nbsp;dating from May 2010.<br />
<br />
Only once was an update to the Windows Live suite released via Microsoft Update, and it was a disaster. It's otherwise always been a 'hunt for it yourself' process. Windows Live Mail 2009 was never updated by Microsoft Update.<br />

            <p>Absolutely agree.</p>
<p>Almost 4 years has passed and they did absolutely NOTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WLM got even worse than Outlook Express, and filtering feature is still in its rudimentary state.</p>
<p>I don't know, how headless should be the programmer who ignored e-mail address part in the contact name string. And unlike address, the name can be changed by anyone anytime! So, naturally this filter does not work and should not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, there are obvious bugs with security certificates. You can not just accept the main company certificate for secure connection. It should be explicitly linked to the domain, even when the company shares one certificate between all its domains. They
 live no option other then disabling secure connection.</p>
<p>Nobody has such bugs, but Microsoft.</p>

            <font>Nothing will ever be fixed in WLMail, but sorting
      incoming mail to another folder is simple using a message rule.
      Just for the sake of argument, you want to sort mail from Gmail to
      a user created folder. Assuming you have a POP3 account and not
      IMAP.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      First, create a local folder to be used as the folder of
      destination and then create the rule.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Where the from line contains people<br />
      Move it to the Specified Folder and Stop processing more rules <br />
      Click on Contains People and Add the domain.&nbsp; Ex: gmail.com&nbsp; <br />
      Click on Specified Folder and select the one you want.<br />
      Name the rule.<br />

    <title>Restarted computer in safe mode, stick in airplane mode and cant sign - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restarted computer in safe mode, stick in airplane mode and cant sign onto Windows</h2>
                    I was troubleshooting an issue in Windows 10.1 and somehow when i was rebooting airplane mode got turned on and it won't turn off.&nbsp; At the windows log in screen i usually enter a PIN and it is asking for a password.&nbsp; i tried the Admin password and my windows
 password and neither is working. I presume its because i have no wireless connection.&nbsp; I can't use any funtions in safe mode for example command prompt as it is requiring the password.&nbsp; Anyone know how to overcome this issue?

            There is no label "start up settings" only "start up repair".&nbsp; I can not use any option in safe mode as it is asking for a password and neither my admin password nor Microsoft password is working. So unfortunately that will not work

            Hi thank for attempting t help but there is no "pin icon" It is only providing me with a password login and that does not exist.&nbsp; I went into the admin settings and no password is set up.&nbsp; I tried all the passwords that it could have been and they do not
 work.&nbsp; Previously it was always a PIN but when I restarted the computer the password option was the only option at login.&nbsp; Thus as I mentioned before, without a password, I can not get into my computer, I can not access the command prompt nor can I create
 a previous start point or anything else.&nbsp; My computer also does not have a "radio" button only an "airplane mode" button, so the combination of the keys you sent on the link will not work.&nbsp; I did attempt with the airplane mode button but that did not work
 as I can only be in start up mode and the log in screen.&nbsp; In addition, I can not use work around 2 as I can not access the command prompt.&nbsp; ON my front screen in the bottom left corner there is a square

            I appreciate your attempt, but I do not think you guys are reading about the issues I am having.&nbsp; I can not use your airplane mode solution as I can not log into my computer.&nbsp; In addition, I know my Microsoft account password as I have multiple computers
 using it and it is not working on this computer.&nbsp; Then I thought it must be a local password I created 2 years ago, but I got into the bios and there is no admin password.&nbsp;
<strong>Again if Airplane mode is turned off, I cannot access Microsoft online, thus why the password is not working.&nbsp; It was always a pin before and that option no longer exists. &nbsp;</strong>

<p>I agree with this. At my company we have refused to go to the new version due to it not supporting multiple chat windows.</p>
<p>Today however I was forced into updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started about an hour ago when I was just logged out from Skype and a message appeared that a new version was available. Same message I have seen several times before. I refused and pressed cancel and tried to login again, but got logged out right away.
 Tried a couple of times with the same result and the same message about update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to be able to login was to update to the new version that is crippled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do Microsoft do this? I understand if you want everyone to use the new version, but please do not remove one of the most important functions, to be able to have one chat window per person.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You should all stop wasting time asking MS to keep Skype functionality. They will not do it. The whole purpose of their "redesign" was to make Skype into a UWP application, those applications are single window by design so they can run on tablets and folded
 laptops, much like iOS apps. They don't care if they lose a 1000 desktop users if they get 100 UWP users, because long term those 100 are future 30% cash cows for the Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They care as much about desktop users as the farmer does for the dirt under his fingernails. Its their way or the highway, so until they decide to kick us out completely use Classic 7.x version, there are downloads available on the net, install and refuse
 any attempts to upgrade. Also invest some time in exploring alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a shame though, Skype has managed to become staple of our digital communications, its a sad ending for a great product.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Reduced image size in gallery view when computer scaling is set to anything but 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(20, 23, 26, 1)">Starting around 12/20, we noticed an issue where the gallery images in Skype for Business are much smaller if the computer scaling is set to 150%. We are running the 1711 release of click-to-run Office
 365 ProPlus on Windows 10. We've seen the issue in 1607 and 1703 Windows 10. You do need to log out and back in for the scaling changes to affect office, so keep that in mind. Check out the attached screenshots for comparison.</span></p>

Hello Bobby,<br />
<br />
What is exact 1711 release of click-to-run Office 365 ProPlus?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is it version 1711 (Build 8730.2165)?<br />
<br />
There are lots of bug fixes in the insider build, you can also try with insider build 1712 (8827.2082) or 1801 (8828.2010) to replicate this issue.-<br />
<br />

<h2>            Adding a speaker setup....suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have my 360 hooked to my TV with an HDMI cable, but the built-in speakers on the TV are terrible.&nbsp; What kind of inputs would I need on a sound system for it to work with my XBOX while the HDMI cable is plugged in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking of buying this:</p>

<p>It's hard to tell from the info given on the link, but it doesn't look like those speakers would support an A/V receiver, though that's the route I'd go if you're looking for a 5.1/7.1 setup.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Like Spaz said, the best route for a 5.1/7.1 surround sound setup would be something that connects to a home audio receiver. I would look into Infinity home audio speakers.
 I have some similar to these in the link below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)"><a href="http://www.harmanaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Infinity speakers</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">The ones I have I bought about five years ago and they came with a 10 year warranty from Circuit City(now closed). But I was playing last night for the first time in a while
 with them turned up some(I have a two year old in an apartment). And they still sound awesome and they can still shake a room and most likely the one above or below. And this is all hooked up to a entry level Sony audio receiver. I couldn't get a link to work,
 but the model is a Sony STR-DG500 and it is priced around $120 nowadays. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">I don't know what your budget is but between these two pieces of equipment and some good wiring. I would suggest getting Monster Cable audio wire(very durable also). You will
 be spending around $750, but I would bet a receiver like the Sony updated now with some HDMI inputs/outputs is most likely around the price($200) I paid for that Sony four years ago.<br />

 same equipment(speakers and wiring) for over 5 years. So, I think that is a pretty good deal for the amount of money I have paid for them. With electronics(TV or Audio) it is all about the return on your investment. BTW I don't see you giving any suggestion
 on what the OP should buy.</span></span></span>

<p>He wants to buy the logitech speakers if you read in the OP post secondly he asked how to connect the speakers and i show him the dongle foe it . He diden`t asked " i have a certain amount of money and want to buy a system that would be better than my 2
 tv set channel " if he did asked i would give him several choices for is budget , so i think that i din`t over read is post ... he asked a strait answer and &nbsp;i gave him one period .

<p>Defeintely go the seperates route. I wouldn't even consider an HTiB system. The main thing is to get the best speakers you can afford. They will have the most (by far) to do with how your setup ultimately sounds. Besides, you will probably have the speakers
 longer than any other piece of equipment (unless you really cheap out on them). The general rule is to spend at least half of your total budget on the speakers. If all you're getting will be speakers &amp; a receiver, I would say spend a minimum of 3/4 on the
 speakers (if not more). The receiver is easily replaced with something better &amp; more up to date at a later time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone mentioned Infinity speakers. I used to own top of the line Infinity studio monitors. They were nothing but trouble, constantly blowing drivers. I replaced them with Infinity towers suited more for the home (rather than for the studio)... They were
 okay, but I was never particularly happy with their sound, and their powered sub was horrible. I now have a smaller (bookshelf sized) Polk Audio setup that blows the big Infinitys away (especially the sub). All that said, I think if I were to replace the Polks,
 I would go with JBL speakers next time around. Why? Because the vast majority of movie &amp; music production studios do their mastering through JBL speakers. So if you want the sound in your home to match what the sound engineers intended as closely as possible,
 it makes sense to listen on the same speakers they were using when they &nbsp;created the sound. Sure, there are better, more expensive speakers than JBL, but nothing will match the sound heard in the studio better than what was actually used in the studio.</p>

<h2>            XBOX LIve Refunds&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Over the past couple years, I have been buying full 12-month live cards for my account. I am aware on the card it says non-refundable, but I was wondering if Xbox would refund it after it's been put on the account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The May update killed my Xbox, and Microsoft has shown no initiative to fix it for me, thus I want to get rid of anything, and it would be nice if Microsoft did one nice thing to a long-time customer. I feel ripped off for spending $60 on your service, then
 your own mistake preventing me from making use of that money.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Does this happen to all your contacts or just a&nbsp;particular one? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it happens to all contacts, it is probably due to the outdated Skype version that you have installed. It is not anymore working properly as it should. We can only check this by upgrading the application.

<h2>            Pixelation when switching from HDMI to DP</h2>
                    Recently, I found out that to use AMD's freesync featue you needed to get a displayport cable. So I got one, however, when I switched from HDMI to DP the screen seemed to get pixelated, maybe even sharpened. I checked the resoultion and It's still at 2560
 x 1080. The display is fine when I go back to HDMI so it seems to be the cable. My graphics card is an AMD RX 480 and my monitor is an LG Ultrawide 29", Any advice?

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern regarding the display pixel when using a display port can be caused by a change on its settings or an outdated software/driver. As an initial step to isolate your concern, we suggest that you update your display driver. To do this follow the
 steps provided on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Also, download the latest driver and software for your device to maximize the
 feature. Contact the device manufacturer or check their support site to get the latest version. Once you're done check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

    <title>File History &#34;Restore&#34; is absymally slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmoya  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History &#34;Restore&#34; is absymally slow</h2>
                    <p>So I did a reinstall of&nbsp;Windows 10 in an effort to clean up. I thought I could use File History to restore my Documents, Pictures, and Music. However, the Restore seems to take an unacceptable amount of time. Estimated time is over 2 days. I left it running
 overnight hoping the estimate was inaccurate, but nope. It's barely done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have several gigs of files and I would expect it would take a couple of hours, but a couple of days??? Had I simply copied the files (to the same drive) before reinstalling windows and then copied them back I know FOR A&nbsp; FACT that it would take just
 an hour if even that. I made a huge mistake by expecting File History to simply work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why is File History so abysmally, excruciatingly, unacceptably slow? It is UNUSABLE. I desperately need to figure out how to get this speeded up as I have to go back to work and cannot afford to be offline for 2+ days because File History takes that
 long to restore files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Don't ask what the destination drive is. It is a NAS. Copying files to it and copying them back has always been super fast. Even gigs upon gigs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The issue is not with my network. The issue is some inefficiency in how File History transfers each and every target file.&nbsp;There is a latency possibly due to an inefficient API call, opening closing a connection etc. for each and every little tiny 512
 byte file that should transfer in milliseconds but takes 1+ seconds (those seconds add up).&nbsp;Who knows. &nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>I'd do it locally, because I transferred 191 GB from my File History over USB and it took many hours, but certainly not days.
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>191gb shouldn't take "many hours" over USB. Anyway, my NAS does not have USB. So I am stuck. Had I known File Restore was so horrendously written I would have just copied my files to the NAS manually and copied them back after reinstall. I simpli was not
 expecting File Restore to be so horribly bad. Right now, 80.4gb is estimating to take "More than 1 day" according to the progress window of File Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Issue seems to be latency in between files. Each file seems to be opening some connection or something like that. But copying files (even 100,000's of files) using Windows Explorer from the same NAS doesn't show this problem. The Problem is 100% badly
 written File Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[EDIT] Hooked up the NAS directly. I suspected the NAS would automatically switch ethernet cable to crossover and am glad it does. Started Restore again. Seems faster, but still ludicrously slow compared to what it should be. File Restore is simply incredibly
 inefficient it seems. Really should have just zipped up my files manually before reinstalling Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lesson learned. File Restore is really only good for restoring a few files here and there. Anything else and be prepared to let it run for hours upon hours if not days! (ridiculous).</p>

            <p>Ugh. What used to take just a couple of hours of my day in the past, has turned into a multi-day affair because of File Restore. I cannot believe this is considered production ready software. Time Machine on OS X isn't this bad. The Classic Backup in Windows
 7 wasn't this awful either. In fact, it was pretty great. Everywhere I turn in Windows 10 I hit a shockingly badly written wall of bugs or simply badly thought out and implemented software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am literally pulling my hair out here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why Windows 7? Why not OS X? Actually, I toughed it out with Windows 8 for the last few years,&nbsp;not 7.&nbsp;For me, personally, I think I'm about to jump ship.&nbsp;OS X upgrades are free&nbsp;too and, in terms of quality, they put Windows 10 to shame. As&nbsp;a Visual Studio
 developer I'm kinda bound to Windows. I had high hopes for Win10, but I just... can't... anymore. I'll deal with Win VM's&nbsp;with&nbsp;OS X as my primary OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm sitting here looking at&nbsp;just how badly written File Restore is, it makes me wonder just what's next in terms of surprises.</p>

Also, your comment doesn't exactly help&nbsp;since going back to Windows 7 isn't going to help me solve this problem with File Restore right now and it will leave all my data inaccessible since Windows 7 doesn't recognize File Restore backups. Nor will it solve
 it for any user that- god forbid- has to use File Restore in the future to restore gigs of data rather than a stray file here or there.

<h2>            8.1 rt Network Driver missing.</h2>
                    I recently got a Microsoft surface rt for really cheap. I just need a new computer and do not expect a lot out of it but its better than my 9 year old hp dv6. anyways I seem to be missing the network adapter driver so I cant use the internet. I have tried
 several things but with no luck. I have been downloading onto a s/d card and then trying to open on the surface. any links or info would be great. luckily if I cant get this to work I can return it for my full refund of 45 bucks.&nbsp; Thanks in advanced.

<p>Hi Travis,. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's quite odd. Using a working computer, try downloading the recommended drivers from this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. If the issue persists, use the reset option to reinstall Windows. The recovery image should include the missing driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Thanks I have tried that link before but there isn' an option for Windows 8.1rt. I have also tried the restore option twice and that has not worked either.

<p>You can not download and install drivers for the RT from any source except Windows Update. &nbsp;The driver link given is not for the Surface RT operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you see in the device manager for network adapters?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore partition on the device may be bad.</p>

            Nothing for network adapters. I have to go to action, add legacy hardware and scroll down to network adapters. I am unsure of what adapter I should be looking for. The only improvement I got was getting an Ethernet setting. And I can't seem to get my Samsung
 driver to work properly to try usb teather. I extract the file and open it on the desktop with no luck.

<p>We are talking about a Surface RT, that is what you said.</p>
<p>Network adapter should be two Bluetooth devices and a Marvell avastar wireless controller.</p>
<p>There is no Ethernet on the RT</p>
<p>Maybe that is why you got it really cheap.</p>

            Yeah i dont know why there is an eathernet option..... i got it off of ebay from a pawn show. The good news is i was refunded 100% and told to keep it. The Bluetooth radio has a code 43. And I don' see the Marvell device. But thanks for giving me an idea.
 My wife has a surface 3 if it' the same device is there a way to copy the driver from the surface 3?

<p>The surface rt has an entirely different operating system that the surface 3.</p>
<p>Have you tried a reset. This is done from a restore partition on the RT.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Tommy,
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's try clean booting the system to remove 3rd party software and see if that clears up the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to
<strong>clear the Load Startup Items check box</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to <strong>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then
<strong>click Disable All</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong> OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Did you get the same error message?<br />
<br />
If this <strong>does</strong> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Key and Microsoft Account link</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Pro key which i got from upgrading from a Windows 7 Pro, i upgraded last year and everything went well, however after changing some hardware and reinstalling, i had to log in with my MS account in order to get windows to be activated,
 i do not recall when exactly i linked my MS account with the windows 10 key, but i don't like to use that account at all as a windows user, and i would like those two to be unlinked and rather have me introduce the key manually, any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance!</p>

            My exact question is "can i unlink my ms account from my windows 10 key?", that is in order to avoid having to log in to my ms account to activate windows after reinstalling,&nbsp; i do know how to create a local account, but thanks anyway, if you have any
 info on the actual question i'll appreciate it.-<br />

<p>There is no actual unlinking method available, the digital license linked to your Microsoft Account is actually an in addition to option, which makes it convenient to reactivate; especially when using the Activation Troubleshooter or transferring a retail
 license to another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The license itself is registered to the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can always switch the Microsoft Account to a Local Account from within Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your info

<p>So if i understood correctly, there's no actual link, but just the fact that i logged in once to make the activation? so as soon as i delete that account from windows the link will be no more?</p>
<p>is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is correct that leads me to another question, i recently changed my motherboard, and processor, and after a clean reinstall directly to windows 10&nbsp; I had activation problems, so i contacted Microsoft via telephone and the representative told me
<strong>"the only </strong><strong>way to have windows activated in the current situation i was in (which is reinstalling after a hardware change) is via having a MS account in windows as my key was linked to that account, and he adviced me against deleting
 that account from "windows", as it would cause the product to be deactivated once again"</strong>.-</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, after i reinstalled i created a local account and had trouble activating windows 10, after which i called support and they, via remote desktop, created with my help, a windows account (an online ms account) and from that account he was able
 to activate windows, afterwards he adviced me that i should not delete that account and from then on i would always had to use the ms account to activate windows.- Is this as he told me? or once windows is activated i can delete that account? can i as you
 said reinstall and never use the ms account to activate windows? if that is possible, should i use the windows 7 key when prompted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for my english, i can clarify anything that may be misundertood, and thanks for your help so far Andre.-</p>

            <p>You can't draw tables with it, it's not a full featured text processor. You'll need MS Word, Excel or an alternative.</p>

            <p>Word pad is nothing more than a text editor and printer.</p>
<p>When you say draw tables what do you mean?</p>
