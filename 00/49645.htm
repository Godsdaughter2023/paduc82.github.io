<h2>            Word Document requires an admin okay.</h2>
                    Every time I try to open my word document on my Windows 7 computer, it asks me "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer?" How do I get rid of this?<br />

            <p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions in order to understand the issue better.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Do you get this prompt when you try to open all the applications?</li><li>Are you referring to Microsoft Office Word or WordPad document?</li><li>Which antivirus program are you using?</li><li>Are you using Administrator or Standard user account?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may get this prompt if <strong>User Account Control (UAC)</strong> is set to
<strong>Always Notify</strong><span>. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: </p>
<p>User Account Control (UAC) notifies you before changes are made to your computer that require administrator-level permission. The default UAC setting notifies you when programs try to make changes to your computer, but you can change how often UAC notifies
 you. It might be that you have your computer to “Always notify”.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Always Notify:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll be notified before programs make changes to your computer or to Windows settings that require administrator permissions. This is the most secure setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the settings in User Account Control follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start</strong> button and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>UAC</strong> and then click <strong>Change User Account Control settings</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>For further reference check the article mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What are User Account Control settings?</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-User-Account-Control-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/What-are-User-Account-Control-settings</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UAC Turn Off Disclaimer:</span></strong></p>
<p>User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We don't
 recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Follow the steps mentioned below if you are using Microsoft Office word and check if it helps;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Win7&nbsp; 32bit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Win7&nbsp; 64bit</strong></p>
<p><strong>C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winword</strong>.<strong>exe</strong> and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong> tab; under <strong>Privilege</strong> group check the option
<strong>Run this program as administrator</strong> and click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer this Microsoft article and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I run an application once with a full administrator access token?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-do-i-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-token" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-do-i-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-token</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p>100Mbps is probably the maximum speed of the Ethernet device on your (presumably) old XP machine. More modern Ethernet devices will cope with 10 times that speed but it would be irrelevant as far as your internet speed is concerned. Even 100Mbps&nbsp;is almost
 certainly faster than your "modem's" connection to your ISP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you had a faster Ethernet device in your PC, your modem may limit wired connection speed to 100Mbps anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, what you have described in your question is not a problem unless you have not given us the full story.</p>

            <p>My speed test has been 6.53 mbps and 73 mbps up till mid afternoon yesterday!&nbsp; Like I said both machines are hooked to the same modem.&nbsp; I did a complete reformat Monday and got done yesterday morning, and my problem happened mid afternoon!&nbsp; (the reason I
 did the reformat was because I had many broken files in the registery, per the Avast support tect)&nbsp; What do you think about doing a hard reset on the modem it is a 7500 Westell aprx 5 or 6 years old, I had it when Verizon was my ISP and Frontier is my ISP
 now!&nbsp; I have unplugged the modem swaped the ethernet cables around on the back of the modem.&nbsp; Is there anyway that I can do a reformat and hopefully reset something before I would have to go on the internet?</p>
<p>The XP computer is working fine, with the exception of not getting on the net!</p>
<p>Do you want me to copy any of the logs that show problems with the ISP address etc.?</p>
<p>Appreciate you!</p>

<p>Can I take it then that this is your real problem and not the fact that the PC says it is connected at 100Mbps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 100Mbps&nbsp;speed describes only the PC's connection speed&nbsp;to what you refer to as a modem. The fact that your PC is connected to the modem does not mean that the modem (or your PC)&nbsp;is connected to the internet. The internet connection is the responsibility
 of your "modem", not your PC. Internet speed tests are not relalted in any way to hardware connection speeds (except that they cannot exceed the hardware connection speed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First things to do are...</p>
<p>Let us know the brand and model of what you describe as a modem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are both your PCs lacking an internet connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the lights on your modem, do they indicate that it is properly connected to the internet? What did your ISP have to say about this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then please do this...</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Click Run</li><li>Type <strong>cmd</strong> and hit enter</li><li>In the resultant black window type <strong>ipconfig</strong> and let us know what values are shown for the Local Area Connection's IPv4 Address, Subnet Mask and Default Gateway</li></ul>

            1. Does it (the NIC) appear in device manager. If its there, does it say its working?<br />
<br />
2. Are the LED's on the NIC on XP flashing or doing anything / something?<br />

            <p>OK. That ipconfig result looks better and is in keeping with what I would expect when compared with your Win7 PC. On the face of it you should have internet connection. Why the ipconfig results are different from the first time&nbsp;I cannot say. If the results
 of ipconfig continue to vary as above, it would imply a fault with your Ethernet device (network card) or possibly a cable fault. Does the XP machine work if connected to a proven port such as the one in use on your Win7 PC? Try the cable currently in use
 on your Win7 PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you define what you mean by "can't get on the internet"? What are you doing that leads you to this conclusion and what is the result when you do it? Please give verbatim error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start another command prompt, check ipconfig is giving sensible results and then type
<strong>ping www.google.com</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ping 4.2.2.2</strong> and finally
<strong>ping 192.168.1.1</strong></p>
<p>Do you get any replies?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you installed a firewall? If you have, temporarily disable it and try to browse to a web site such as google. What is the result?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you installed the correct network card driver?</p>

    <title>What can I do to have 3 different profiles use the same Desktop on one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> purefctv2  say:</h3>
<h2>            What can I do to have 3 different profiles use the same Desktop on one computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use 3 different profiles, all with unique Microsoft IDs, on one laptop. I have set the file locations for user profile folders&nbsp;for all 3 profiles to the same physical location. For example, Downloads are no longer in the C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\...\Downloads
 location, it is at E:\Downloads</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this for most other folders as well (Documents, My Documents, My Pictures, My Video, Favorites ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done this for Desktop. I'm having issues I believe because I've done this for Desktop. While there is no issue with my 3 profiles accessing the E:\Desktop folder, nor when accessing the "Desktop" folder via File Explorer ... I AM experiencing
 issues with THE Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention I use both the laptop display (Display 1, primary display) and an external display via the HDMI port (Display 2, secondary display). I have these set so my desktop is extended onto both displays where D1 is below D2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two basic issues. </p>
<ul>
<li>Even though I arrange the icons onto D1 for all 3 profiles, at some point some icons are moved to D2. The same icons appear to always be moved, however it appears WHAT is relocated depends on whether I've been playing games or not ... and/or what the Display
 settings are for the Desktop.</li><li>I primarily use Edge for my browser and play Age of Empires Castle Siege . I also use Office, Acrobat, Calculator, Skype, File Explorer A LOT. So far, it appears EVERYTHING except Edge and AOE stays where I place them on the two displays while Edge and
 AOE crash or minimize when I switch between profiles. And the behavior is not exactly the same between the profiles ... meaning AOE in 2 profiles tends to re-snap to D2 while Edge snaps to D1, and for 1 profile it's the opposite.</li></ul>
<p>I should also mention I updated a display driver recently, am having an issue rolling back in order to eliminate it as the reason for my state problems here, but have not yet succeeded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I SOL though because my 3 profiles are fighting each other for the same Desktop file location?</p>

            <p>I've now changed my three profiles so their Desktop is stored in a separate folder location, I still have these issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, if I log out of the profiles before logging into another one, I don't have the issues - but that defeats the purpose of using the multiple profiles.&nbsp; Once I log into and keep active at least two of the profiles, I begin to have the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Especially now that I've moved the Desktop locations in each profile to different physical locations, and I know for more reasons than one that regardless of how I had them set up the Recycle Bin at a minimum only had each Profile's deleted items in it,
 I think my display driver issue could be a contributing factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm moving very slow on this because I have three issues and it's difficult to identify which action I take solves or causes an issue.</p>
<p>- Desktop icons not staying where I place them even though Auto Arrange Icons is not selected, and I have now segregated my 3 profiles' Desktops</p>
<p>- Loss of a critical manual System Restore Point when I'm only using 1.5GB of the allocated 33GB, inhibiting my ability to simply roll my system back to before I started the changes</p>
<p>- No ability to roll back the driver I updated (Roll Back Driver icon is greyed out), I will need to delete and update the driver one version at a time and waits days to determine if one or more issues are resolved.</p>

            The rollback option is only available for 10 days. So, you will have to manually downgrade to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1709 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1709
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi JD, 
<br />
<br />If the recovery option is gone, I’d try a sys restore. 
<br />
<br />Click on Start - and type "control panel" and click on it
<br />
<br />Once open, search "recovery" and hit enter. When it comes up, click on recovery. 
<br />
<br />On the next page, open "open system restore" 
<br />
<br />They'll be a box that says "click for more restore points" that I would click. Choose a restore point before the 1803 update, and follow the prompts. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>That command is part of Version 1803, but any time after the default 10 day limit, the c:\Windows.Old folder can be deleted. If it is deleted, then the new DISM command won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, Version 1803 actually includes 4 new DISM commands.&nbsp; So I suggest that anyone who upgrades to 1803 takes advantage of one of them to EXTEND the 10 day limit to something more practical, like 30 or 60 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the 4 commands:</p>

</p>
<p>The following new DISM commands have been added to manage feature updates.&nbsp; Open a CMD window using Run As Admin.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>TRIGGER UPDATE BACKOUT<br />
<br />
DISM /Online /Initiate-OSUninstall <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Initiates a OS uninstall to take the computer back to the previous installation of windows.<br />

</p><p>BLOCK BACKOUT OPTION<br />
<br />
DISM /Online /Remove-OSUninstall <br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISPLAY # DAYS BACKOUT STILL AVAILABLE<br />
<br />
DISM /Online /Get-OSUninstallWindow <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Displays the number of days after upgrade during which uninstall can be performed.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>SET NEW # DAYS BACKOUT IS AVAILABLE<br />

<p>You have two choices to get back to v.1709: the easy way and the hard way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easy way: Restore a backup made before you were upgraded. You'll go back in time as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hard way: Backup your personal data and do a clean install of Windows 10 and all your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best choice (in my opinion) is to upgrade your database application to a version that's supported on Windows 10.</p>

            And what do I have to do if i already roll back from 1803 to 1709 and now I want to upgrade (or roll back) from 1709 to 1803 ? Is it better to stay with 1709 ? When I roll back the first time it was because 1803 seems to have some bugs with my realtek
 audio driver but now i hope it's fixed and maybe it's better to return with the last version (1803) ??

<p>Don't manually "upgrade" / update to 1803.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You should check with Realtek to find out if they have a driver update to fix the issue BEFORE trying to update to 1803 again.&nbsp; You could also keep track of updates to 1803 to see if they mention an explicit fix for the problem you had. MS has already released
 5 updates for 1803. Keep an eye on this page to review updates as they come out:</p>

<p>A client of mine with a Acer Swift 1 (type 113-31) laptop complained about complete machine freezes (even the mouse cursor got stuck). After some research I found that the Microsoft Photos App was causing the freezes. If even one picture is placed in the
 Pictures folder or on Onedrive and catalogued the machine completely gets stuck and only a power-off and reboot will get it going again. Try opening the Photos app with pictures in the Pictures folder and you will see the machine freeze or crash within a minute.
 Remove all pictures and all is good and the app works fine.<br />
Since the Photos app is scanning for photos and creating collections and albums in the background it will freeze up your machine at some point, even when not using the Photos app (mostly within the hour).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;<span>Acer Swift 1 also has a Pentium N4200 CPU (4GB RAM, 120GB SATA SSD) and runs Windows 10-1803 x64 home with the latest firmware installed. My guess is that the Photos app is using a CPU instruction that the N4200 CPU cannot handle or gets the CPU
 to crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've tried resetting and re-installing the app but the freezes keep happening. I tested with a local account and a Microsoft account.&nbsp;</span><span>Upgrading to Windows version 1810 did not solve this either (wasn't really expecting it). Turned off
 all the configurable options such as 'hardware accelerated video encoding' but nothing helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My advise is NOT to place any pictures in the Photos App scan-path and remove all folders in the 'Sources' section.</span></p>
<p><span>OR remove the Photos App entirely from the system (admin powershell:&nbsp;<span>Get-AppxPackage -allusers *photos* | Remove-AppxPackage &nbsp;&nbsp; (dont'forget to remove the shortcuts as well)).</span><br />
<br />
Microsoft Photo App team: take note and please fix this...</span></p>

            Hello 
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you. 
<br />
<br />How to import Chrome passwords in Microsoft Edge along with bookmarks and history. 
<br />
<br />1- Close the Chrome browser and open Microsoft Edge. Click on the three points in the top menu to display the menu 
<br />2- In the expanded menu select the option "Configuration". 
<br />3- Click inside the option "Import favorites and other information" in "Import from another browser". 
<br />4- Now we only have to choose the browser, in this case, Google Chrome, and click on Import in order to have our data synchronized in Microsoft Edge.
<br />5- If you want to import from a file select the button shown below. 
<br />
<br />You can follow the steps below, to export from Google Chrome 
<br />
<br />By default, this function is disabled for security reasons. 
<br />To activate it, you will have to paste or type chrome: // flags / # password-import-export in the address bar. In the drop-down menu, you must select Enabled. 
<br />
<br />After closing and re-opening Chrome, when going to chrome: // settings / passwords you will see the Export and Import passwords buttons appear. In particular, you will get a CSV file compatible with most password and browser managers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this information is helpful. Let me know the results once you have tried these methods. I will be happy to help you more. 
<br />
<br />Greetings.

<p>
</p><p>Are you talking about a 7-Zip file (.7z extension) or the program 7-Zip? Because these are two different things. Also, if it's a file, and someone really downloaded it on your computer without you knowing about it, and you don't need it, why don't you simply
 delete it?</p>

 the system but was unsuccessful, so the tablet sat unused for years. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently tackled the problem again and was able to get past the blue screen by removing all the partitions and clean installing Win 10 again. Further research revealed that Microsoft no longer supports this processor in Win 10 so I need to reinstall the
 original Win 8.1. I have a mounted USB to install Win 8.1 but I am blocked at the WPK. I now understand that the original WPK is resident in the registry and in the BIOS for devices bought with Windows pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used a program called ProduKey to find the embedded WPKs to return the following results for the two tablets:</p>

</p><p>Windows (BIOS OEM Key)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.&nbsp; &lt; <em>Multiple Product Keys removed by VM</em> &gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have added the A., B. etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My interpretation is that installing Win 10 on the Win 10 tablet produced 'A' which wrote over the original Win 8.1 OEM WPK ('B.').</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of the Win 8.1 tablet the equivalent WPKs of 'C.' and 'D' are the same. So the registry and the BIOS records of the WPK are the same because there was no upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believed that <span>&nbsp;</span>'B.' was the WPK I was searching for to install Win 8.1 back on the Win 10 tablet but it wasn't accepted. Neither were any of the other WPKs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>In Windows 10 you can use a command in PowerShell (Admin)</p>
<p><strong>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey</strong> and press return. This should give the embedded key. It may work in Windows 8.1 also so you can test it on the Windows 8.1 device, but you will open a Command Prompt (Admin).</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the responses.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have been admonished for including Window Product Keys which don't work!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I rang Microsoft about this issue and a company called Neosmart Technologies sent me an email with a program which produced the identical key to ProduKey (the one which didn't work).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I explained my experience:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"</span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I have another identical tablet which has the original Win 8.1 still untouched. As an experiment I ran the 'ProduKey' for the second tablet. The key from the registry was identical because
 Win 8.1 had been left unchanged in that tablet . I entered the key which the program returned for the second tablet into the first tablet but that was rejected also.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">The tablet with Win 10 installed has no drivers, so no internet. So the Win 8.1 ISO program must have a built-in checking system. It does not accept the key from the second tablet, so it must check something in the first tablet's
 hardware. I wonder what all this security is protecting against. You obviously want to prevent someone using software without paying. I get that. But in this case the computer manufacturer must have already paid for the right to install Win 8.1, a cost which
 has been passed on to the purchaser. So this cost is built into the hardware / Win 8.1 combination. The owner of the hardware has already paid for the right to use Win 8.1. I cannot see how requiring the original key is necessary. How can Microsoft be cheated
 under these circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Your security system is so effective it blocks even legitimate users."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I have written doesn't match with the need to hide Win Product keys. If a Win key can be stolen, then when I entered the OEM BIOS key from the second tablet into the first it should have
<span>&nbsp;</span>worked. Either the keys returned by the program are incorrect or the system used to check it is faulty.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Bill</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You seem to be blaming the victim. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I installed Win 10 the second time I was not asked for a key. I think I the USB I used must have been made when the Win 10 system was free. But the device has no touch-screen, no sound and no wireless because there are
 no drivers available for Win 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With respect<span>&nbsp; </span>to Windows 10 and the clover tail atom processor devices, neither Acer or Microsoft come out particularly well. It is not just that the devices using this processor are not supported by Microsoft
 after Win 8.1. My second device is using Win 8.1 and is operating satisfactorily. It is just that neither party went to any trouble to inform those owning such devices that they would not be supported in Win 10 and on no account should they upgrade to the
 new operating system. I'm sure there are thousands like me who made the same mistake.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I search for Win 10 drivers for the Acer Iconia W3-810 on the internet, I reach an Acer page which gives me two options for OS - Win 8 and Win 8.1. Nowhere on their site do they offer a warning about not upgrading. What
 could Microsoft have done which they didn't do? Well computing devices are not like cars for which the registration systems allow direct contact with individual owners. But computer users use the internet and that offers one way to contact the affected users.
 Microsoft could have had a page listing all the affected devices with a warning not to upgrade to Win 10. With Microsoft's heft, such a warning would appear pretty high in a Google search. This would have been picked up and discussed by other technical websites.
 So when I searched for something relating to my device I would have got the message not to upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But the issue I raise about Windows Product Keys (WPKs) is independent of whether I installed Win 10 or not. I could have had a blue screen problem under the original Win 8.1.&nbsp;</span>The only thing I got from the Win 10 installation
 was the ability to run the program which gave me what I am told is the original WPK. It is just that it doesn't work with the Win 8.1 installation USB and I am confused as to why that is so.</p>

<p>The only other possibility I can think of is that the Acer install may have been for Windows 8.1 Single Language, does it show that anywhere on the device running Windows 8.1. A licence is different for Windows 8.1 Single language (I believe) than Windows
 8.1. Where did you get your Windows 8.1 install media from? do you know which it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have thought Acer would provide the install media, unless you can create it using the second device that is still running Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>I'm merging your posts together and moving them to the hardware and drivers forum for Windows, but your system clearly has multiple issue. You may want to consider a format/reinstall of the OS to start over.</p>
<p>Your Update issue belongs in the Windows update forum.</p>
<p>Your Blackberry issue belongs in the hardware/drivers forum.</p>
<p>Your MSE install issue is likely to be related to whatever is causing the other issues:</p>

            <p>Steve, thanks for the redirection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a response from Kosh Vorlon here that has disappeared.&nbsp; I was in the process of working through its suggestions, had to get back to my client work, and now the posting is gone.&nbsp; Can you restore it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has happened to my principal laptop.&nbsp; It's absolutely loaded with critical stuff - yes, it's backed up nightly, and full image taken periodically.&nbsp; But there is a LOT of newly-installed work (new SQL and Dynamics GP instance, 3rd party software installed
 into them, with days of configuration to get fully functional - in preparation for a project delivery in 1.5 weeks).&nbsp; To start clean would be unbelievably painful.&nbsp; And yes, after this, I'll cut a full image weekly.</p>

                    I have a belkin wireless router that has a firewall built in. &nbsp;I use windows7 and have windows firewall enabled. I have always heard that it's best to run one firewall program on my computer. &nbsp;Does that also include the one on the belkin? Or should i be
 running the routers firewall and windows firewall at the same time?&nbsp;

            You should run only one software firewall.<br />
At the same time it is highly recommended to have a hardware firewall too, i.e. in the form of a router.<br />

No.&nbsp; The BIOS is not your issue.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You changed the operating system from Home to Professional?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What you should likely do - if all you are worried about is getting files of the system - is to by an external drive adapter, connect the drive to it and access the drive via USB on another computer to locate and copy off the files.<br />

            Do the following at your own risk (however, it worked for me).<br />
<br />
1) Go to File Explorer for C: drive<br />
2) Search for "DownloadedPuzzles" (don't type " and it isn't case sensitive)<br />
3) Your list of puzzle collections should be there.<br />
4) Delete the collections you are finished with.

<h2>            Call of Duty&#58; Black Ops</h2>
                    
<p>has there been any update as to the backwards compatibility of the original black ops? They've delayed it twice now. Is it just issues with licensing or is it something more? Any info would be nice</p>

<p>Heya InductedTree91,</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Call of Duty: Black Ops will not receive a release date for the Xbox One backwards compatibility. It will be released when it has become available to users. Stay tuned to news.xbox.com and Major Nelson's blog (www.majornelson.com) for
 more up-to-date information. </p>

            Hi Marcel, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here on Community each day. . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            WL Mail.exe - bad image</h2>
                    <p>When trying to access a link in a windows live mail message. I get a box containing the following message "C:\ProgramFile\WindowsLive\Installer\WLSRes.dll is either not designed to run in Windows or it contains an error. etc" I have not made any changes
 to the computer or installed new software since the last occasion it worked properly.&nbsp; I am not sure if it is relevant but the electricity supply failed yesterday evening while the computer was on but not running any program. Help would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>It has been suggested to me that this is a better forum to seek help and hopefully you will be able to see the thread detailing the problem and the steps that I have taken so far to solve my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>It looks as if something did happen to corrupt some of your files. With any luck,&nbsp;a repair will sort it out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close down all running programs</li><li>Open <em>Programs and Features </em>in Control Panel</li><li>Find Windows Live Essentials, click on it and&nbsp;then&nbsp;on <b>Uninstall/Change.</b></li><li>In the window that opens, select <b>Repair all Windows Live programs.</b></li><li>When it's finished, restart&nbsp;the computer, launch WLMail and test.</li></ol>
