            I cannot install KB2871389 and have exactly the same screen appearing with the troubleshooter. A few further details may help someone identify the problem.
<div>The target machine is a Dell Desktop purchased Jan 2013 that came preinstalled with Windows 8. Subsequently installed Windows 8.1 Preview (Build 9431) and have Auto Update selected. Norton 360 security is also running.</div>
<div>If I try to install KB2871389 the message appears:</div>

            Also note that i go to install both updates and it hangs at 9% completion saying 22.9MB have been completed, 1 minute later it throws me errors.
<div><br />
<div>Please don't advise me to try troubleshooters or install them manually or run the DISM tool as all of them have failed. I've tried a diagnostic startup, it said it couldn't fix my computers problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I refreshed my PC about a month ago and am not looking to do it again. Shouldn't be this hard to get an update.</div>

            The same problem with KB2871389.&nbsp; When i install it (manually or automatically via Windows update), the result is the same. The installation is sucessfully completed but when I restart Windows, it freezes during shutting down. From this time my computer
 freezes randomly and the only one possibility is to restore Windows to previous point or format whole system.<br />

Anybody with&nbsp;a solution?

            Well I ended up getting a free download through my school of 8.1, the install was flawless, no hiccups or errors. Microsoft should provide a way for existing windows 8 users to get a free 8.1 product key, because that's all I needed for it to work, it
 bypassed all the windows updates and installed cleanly. Clearly a problem on Microsoft's end.

<h2>            Surface RT does see my 5 Ghz network &#40;home&#41; but does not see my 2.4 Ghz network &#40;home&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect my Surface RT to the 5 Ghz network but it does not see my 2.4 Ghz network (which I want to use as this network is extended with a wifi-repeater). All my other devices (windows phone, samsung tablet, windows PC) do see and connect to the 2.4
 Ghz network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make this 2.4 network also visible and connectable for my Surface RT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the latest driver I have is Marvell 14.62.17215.91. If I choose update driver it says that I have the most recent one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me out!!</p>

this forum</a>&nbsp;makes mention of an issue affecting the original Surface RT's ability to find wireless networks that was fixed in subsequent updates, are you up-to-date with your patches? The same forum also mentions issues connecting to wireless networks operating

I can startup Minecraft with my account just fine on the xbox. My son (an xbox live child account)&nbsp;can start and play minecraft if the xbox is in offline mode. But as soon as we put the xbox online or click "Sign In"&nbsp;on the minecraft market place the game crashes to the xbox dashboard.</p><p>Everything is up to date. Have deleted the app and reinstalled on xbox. Have done a system reset on the xbox. Have deleted local saves. It may have something to do with minecraft handling of child accounts. It was fine until the last update.</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You might be able to complete the rip by turning on error correction.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;In Windows Media Player</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Click on
<b>Tools</b></span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;Click
<b>Options</b> </span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;Choose
<b>Devices</b>, click the <b>CD burner</b></span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;Choose&gt;
<b>Advanced</b>, and set the error correction to <b>On</b>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>There are two ways to change rip settings while in the Player Library. You can insert a CD into your CD drive and
<strong>click Rip settings</strong>, or you can <strong>click the Rip Music tab</strong> in the
<strong>Options dialog</strong> box. The Rip Music tab in the Options dialog box offers additional options that aren't available on the Rip settings menu.</span></p>
<p><span>To rip music from a CD, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>For best results, make sure that you are connected to the Internet before you begin.<br />
Note that you can rip a CD when your computer isn't connected to the Internet. However, the Player won't be able to identify the name of the CD, the artist who created it, or the names of the songs until you go online.</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Insert an audio CD into the CD drive.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;(Optional) if you want to select a different format for the files created during ripping, in the Player Library, click the
<b>Rip settings</b> menu, and then click <b>Format</b> or <b>
Audio Quality</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;<strong>Click the Rip CD button</strong> in Now Playing mode or Rip CD in the Player Library to begin ripping.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;For more information visit the following link:-</span></p>

<br />
1. Have you tried updating device driver on your computer?<br />

            We appreciate your quick response. Since you mentioned that you already tried to create a new user, scannow and memcheck, then we suggest you perform a clean boot to help eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or
 when you run a program in Windows 10. Click the link below to guide you on how to perform a clean boot:<br />

            Not sure this is the issue as the error your are receiving appears to be before the Creators Update but the error seems similar to errors reported&nbsp;in the Creators Update when Malwarebytes is installed.
<p>
</p><p>If Malwarebytes is installed try the work-around in the following link (disable the Office apps from being protected in MB3) until the issue is fixed with Malwarebytes:</p>

                    <p>My Windows 10 system crashed and was forced to reinstall windows keeping all my personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the resinstall, I can connect to network but it does not connect to internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried both ethernet connection and wi-fi, the results are the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect to the same wi-fi network using a different windows 10 computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched and tried ALL of the potential workarounds: reboot, reset PC, reset network, enable/disable wireless adapter, uninstall/reinstall drivers, going to CMD and typing all kinds of netsh commands, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my windows stack or show side by side&#63;</h2>
                    Had the problem prior to the 10 update, but it wasn't really noticed till this month. Basically I click either option and the windows shrink and move to the upper left corner. The cascade option works fine. I thought it was because I had my taskbar locked
 on the left--why I don't know why I thought it was this--I've since moved it but the same thing happens. Can anyone help?

            <p>I have the same issue, I have only two (desktop)&nbsp;windows open completely (maximized).&nbsp; On three different computers with windows 10,&nbsp;all three computers stack or side by side the maximized (desktop) windows like&nbsp;there are three windows open not two (desktop)
 windows.&nbsp; Two windows of the (Desktop) windows and the background of the desktop.&nbsp; This is done by right clicking the task bar&nbsp; and picking show windows stacked or show windows side by side I have wasted so much time on trying to find the correction.&nbsp; I didn't
 do it in windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter how many windows you stack or do side by side there is always a desktop theme/background as part of the stacked windows and just a portion of the desktop.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8aa6bf7f-5642-481f-b0e1-78f433b1db0f" /></p>

            <p>I had no problem with the desired functionality as described in my post below in Windows XP, 7 and 8, but I have the same problem as described above in Windows 10 on multiple platforms. Microsoft needs to fix this with an Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The functionality of displaying multiple non-minimized Windows at the same time on the display evenly and taking up the full display, and with the ability to work in any one of the displayed windows without disrupting the display is a very basic function.
 There are way too many threads on this one same issue which has many subsets (Snap Feature, Drag and Display, Touch Screen Functionality, Short-cut key functionality, ...).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be separate threads for each separate issue, as the cross chatter becomes way to confusing in a single thread. Posters need to search the Community before creating a thread, and pick the applicable thread for input.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My focus is to be able to right click on the task bar (after having minimized those windows that are open that I do not want to display), and then select either "show windows side by side" or "show windows stacked", and have the non-minimized windows display
 as selected, evenly and taking up the full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to address this functionality head on with an update to the Windows 10 OS, and not with work arounds.</p>

            <p>Here goes Microsoft again, making GUESSES as to what might be wrong with no real evidence that the suggestion has anything to do with the problem. (What do "Games" have to do with any of this at all???).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue of Windows not displaying properly when selecting "Show Windows Side by Side" or "Show Windows Stacked" after right clicking on the Task Bar (to display non-minimized windows), has been a problem on way too many platforms (see all the various threads
 on this issue)&nbsp;to be an issue with Display Drivers, as opposed to Microsoft Code. Microsoft needs to fix their code, AFTER determining what the actual problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By-the-by, I have updated the graphic drivers to the latest drivers on both of my platforms, and this issue still persists.</p>

            It looks like there is still no reply, except for the unhelpful MS one that had nothing to do with the problem.&nbsp; I always used the "right click/show windows stacked" until I upgraded to W10.&nbsp; The option still shows when right clicking on the taskbar, but
 it doesn't work properly except for Cascade Windows.&nbsp; I was hoping there had been a better reply and solution, but I guess I'll have to continue resizing each window manually every time I need more than one window viewable.

            Yes, after all the Microsoft updates since this post was&nbsp;started&nbsp;(which have created numerous other problems (see other threads)), still no fix for this basic functionality of showing Windows side-by-side or stacked.

            Hi  LUVSITE, 
<br />
<br />Open the Control Panel - Language 
<br />
<br />Click Options on the right hand side of your current language 
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />In options if the appropriate language does not appear, click 'Add input Method' 
<br />
<br />Add the appropriate language if necessary 
<br />Move the appropriate language to the top, if necessary 
<br />
<br />Make that the default language 
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT - delete any language(s) not required 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            This happens because your keyboard layout is changed to UK from US where @ symbol appears where " symbol is there.
<br />
<br />Step 1. Windows Key+I to invoke Settings &gt; Time &amp; Language &gt; Region &amp; Language &gt; Add English (US) or any other appropriate language.
<br />Remove English (UK) or any other language which you didn't need (Note - This is optional. If you don't want to remove, then go to Step 2)
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Step 2. This step may be needed if step 1 doesn't work or you don't want to remove languages in step 1
<br />While you are in Region &amp; Language, click Additional date, time &amp; regional settings &gt; Click change input methods &gt; Advanced Settings
<br />Under Override for default input methods, choose US(English) or appropriate language.
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />(Note, here you will also find Switching Input Methods under Advanced Settings &gt; Change language Bar hot keys. Here you have hot keys for changing language which must have been pressed inadvertently. This hot key can be used to switch languages)

            Wow, nice monitor! <br />
<br />
&nbsp;When we talk about our video displays on our computers, I find that they are often referred to as Video subsystems.&nbsp; This is because there is more going into making them work than just the display.&nbsp; Before anything gets to the monitor it first has to be processed
 by the video card.&nbsp; The better the information Windows has to work with the better you display can work.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;First, I try to make sure that the operating system has the correct and latest driver for the video card.&nbsp; Then I try to make sure that Windows knows (has the driver for) exactly what kind of monitor it is dealing with.&nbsp; Once that is done you can make sure
 that the Monitor's setup includes the refresh rate that your new hardware will support.&nbsp; The default 60mHz is probably much lower than your display can actually handle.&nbsp; Too low a refresh rate translates to flicker.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The second possibility that occurs to me is the fact that in your effort to push your new display to its maximum resolution, you may have met the limits imposed by the video card which is providing the data to be displayed.&nbsp; 1600X900 is going to take a big
 bite of graphic memory.&nbsp; I would look first to the graphics display adapter to see if it is up to the job of handling 1400X900 but not 1600X900.&nbsp; Then you have to decide whether the computer deserves a better video card or does your next computer include a
 better card.<br />
<br />
When I grow up I hope to have a monitor like that.<br />

Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like 3 days ago i started to get this error with Rundll32. I been searching for a solution of different groups and communities but i can't get no way to fix it, without fall on things that am afraid to change or modify.&nbsp; How i was saying: i been reading
 some topics of this "problem", so i just take the moment to follow some methods.
<br />
<br />
Here is the problem (i don't have the IMG on english so i just put the report, sorry).</p>

</p><p>Hola</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hace unos 3 días mi PC ha estado presentando cierto tipo de error u/o problema con respecto a Rundll32. He estado buscando una solución para con el tema, pero lamentablemente no he podido dar con algo fehaciente. Por ello recurro a la Comunidad Microsoft
 en busca de una ayuda por parte de lo que yo considero confiable. Como dije hace un momento: he estado buscando soluciones, y en el proceso he dado con un tópico aquí. Un joven que presentaba el mismo problema, pero el fondo del asunto no daba el mismo resultado
 que en mi caso, yo no poseo problemas con Zet.dll tal parece que es otra cosa.</p>

-&gt; Why not? Since your problem started 3 days ago, setting Windows back by 4 days would probably solve the problem.</p>
<p>

-&gt; You need to click the Start globe, then Help, then look for help on System Restore. This will tell you in detail what System Restore does and how it works.</p>

            <p>I guess you don't understand me. Literally, <strong>there's no restore point to the past</strong>. It seems that has been eliminated, i don't really know. Windows just let me Create a restore point on the actual system status, and i guess that is not a solution
 for the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to restore the system it says <strong>Any restore point was not created in the system unit team</strong>. And i know that if i try create a new one it will be a Restore Point to the actual moment: 11/02/2015.</p>

            <blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You stumbled over a subtlety of the English language. In your previous statement<br />
<em>It seems that there's no point to make a System Restore.</em></p>
<p>the phrase "there is no point" means "it is useless" or "there is no benefit". What you really wanted to say was</p>
<p><em>It seems there is no restore point that I could use</em>.</p>
<p>This is why a Spanish language forum might be better for you.</p>
<p>If you are lucky then the problem is caused by an inappropriate registry entry. You could try this method to undo the damage:</p>
<p>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu that looks like this one:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode<br />
3. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
4. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu that looks like this one:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7<br />
6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
7. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32\config<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcopy *.* Q:\MyRegBack\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; RegBack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir<br />
8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after your problem became apparent?<br />
9. If they were made before the problem became apparent then you can type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y software&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y System&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y Sam ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)<br />
10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.<br />

    <title>Lock screen problem Win 10 home. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john stuart preston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock screen problem Win 10 home.</h2>
                    How can&nbsp;I prevent lock screen after sleep on Windows 10 home system. I have managed to stop lock screen on start up but still get the stupid lock screen after my machine comes on again when I open the lid. This is very annoying and is driving me mad trying
 to find a solution. Why do Microsoft make things very hard to solve. I had no problem with Windows 7. I thought Windows 10 was an improvement and supposed to be easier to use than previous systems. Well I for one don't think so.

            Which version of Windows 10 is installed?
What is the make and model of your computer?
Is Windows Hello enabled? 

If Windows Hello is enabled, the option to not prompt for sign in again will be disabled.

You will need to remove Windows Hello first, in order to disable Require sign in.

            <p><span>Hi Thanigaivelan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-What happen when you try to undo the system restore? Do you receive any error message/code?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can occur if Kaspersky internet security installation files are missing/corrupted or third-party application conflict.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I would suggest you to place the computer in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If issue persist, you may uninstall and reinstall Kaspersky application on the computer and check if it helps. Refer:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall, change or repair a program</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/uninstall-change-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-8/uninstall-change-program</a></span></p>
<p><span>Some errors might occur when deleting Kaspersky Lab products via Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add\Remove Programs (Add/Remove Programs). As a result the application may not uninstall correctly
 or remnants of the application may remain in the system. In order to fully remove the installed Kaspersky Lab product, use the kavremover utility (<strong><em>the utility deletes all activation data and you will need to activate an installed product copy once
 again</em></strong>). For removal toll see: <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/common/service.aspx?el=1464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.kaspersky.com/common/service.aspx?el=1464</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further assistance you may also contact Kaspersky Support Forums:
<a href="http://forum.kaspersky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.kaspersky.com/</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the status of the issue. If you need further assistance, please post back. We will be glad to help you.

 In making an informed consumer decision, I read horror stories of 360 buyers having purchased a "new" XBOX 360, and find that when signing it onto LIVE for the 1st time, that their console has been previously banned from XBOX LIVE... where someone ELSE purchased
 it, opened it carefully, tampered with firmware etc. and got &nbsp;the console banned from LIVE, then returned the console as unopened and it gets reshelved as Never Before Opened.</span><br />

 DID malfunction by scratching the discs independently of actions of affected Users. Those Users ended up getting fair and just compensation; in both cases, the issue affected the entire operation of the system, it was something the user was not in control
 of or able to prevent even by treating their system with the utmost care.</span><br />

 out to those users that had no 360 for months and couldn't afford the service charge/shipping costs Microsoft ORIGINALLY charged users before enough people had the same problem that wasn't their fault that Microsoft retroactively repaid Users who WERE able
 to pay to repair immediately after the first recorded instances... let alone afford to purchase a new console.</span><br />

 enough people spoke up and, suddenly - (in the EU disc scratchings of 2007's case, ONE DAY before a news exposé aired, they fixey-fix and make nice. Free ship, box and repair. &nbsp;Good for the customers (that haven't made a mess of their 360s with a hammer, that

<span>No warning on Skyrim..."WARNING: 360 owners with _______ Specs on their system may experience a catastrophic event that will disable the system entirely, and if your system is outside of warranty, will require payment- based Repair to fix. This sounds
 more and more like the first few RRoD stories I remember hearing, from before MS stepped up to save loyal fans that were beside themselves with frustrated indignation. Then I thought how xbox.com/support said the C000 0013 EC had something to do with LIVE.
 How I wasn't even connected to the internet when Skyrim did its poop ejection into my 360. Now, if I follow everything according to the Official Support Page AND speak to half of support's staff on the west coast over the phone, if there was knowledge of what
 would happen to me prior to the release by MS and no warning was issued on Skyrim, it is MS's responsibility to make it right.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I still wondered... what happened?! The only way to get the answer I sought was to root and dig and ask until I find someone who cares enough about me as a long-term, repeat customer.</span><br />

 to me. I'm a veteran of OIF and I decided to make Skyrim the ONE game I made sure I could afford on release date the whole 2011 year BECAUSE of the release date, and make a day of somber remembrance merrier).</span><br />

<span>Here's where it starts to suck for me, and a great many others. Twitter's mad with tweets. When prompted to run an update prior to playing and as a requirement to play Skyrim, I readily accepted. After downloading , the system restarts to apply the update.

 Halfway through the console freezes, and eventually displays an error message stating " The update could not be read from the disc. Please reinsert the disc and try again. If this problem persists, visit www.xbox.com/support. Error code 3151 351F B800 0F00

Shouldn't mine be superior in capabilities? I find a version of the opposite is the case; a cheaper, older, LESSER? version had firmware installed that supported LIVE's newest update AND Skyrim gameplay, while my more expensive Elite console dd not?!<br />
<br />
I could be getting achievements in Skyrim if I just hadn't screwed myself over by foolishly purchasing a console that seemed superior in every conceivable way than the Pro? BALDERDASH!<br />
<br />
And of course, there's no way of knowing this beforehand.<br />
<br />
No warning on Skyrim..."WARNING: 360 owners with _______ Specs on their system may experience a catastrophic event that will disable the system entirely, and if your system is outside of warranty, will require payment- based Repair to fix. This sounds more
 and more like the first few RRoD stories I remember hearing, from before MS stepped up to save loyal fans that were beside themselves with frustrated indignation. Then I thought how xbox.com/support said the C000 0013 EC had something to do with LIVE. How
 I wasn't even connected to the internet when Skyrim did its poop ejection into my 360. Now, if I follow everything according to the Official Support Page AND speak to half of support's staff on the west coast over the phone, if there was knowledge of what
 would happen to me prior to the release by MS and no warning was issued on Skyrim, it is MS's responsibility to make it right.<br />
<br />
I still wondered... what happened?! The only way to get the answer I sought was to root and dig and ask until I find someone who cares enough about me as a long-term, repeat customer.<br />
<br />
I can tell that Mary empathizes and may even feel bad for me and want to fix the issue but doesn't know how. So I ask to speak with HER supervisor, when I get put in touch with Nicole, ID# 26314. HMM. an ID# with only 5 digits.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm speaking with someone with SIGNIFICANTLY higher tenure in a Sequentially numbered heirarchy.<br />
<br />
So she gets the full-detail account (then, only 20% of what I'm putting down now.)<br />
<br />
That on Veteran's Day 2011, I bought a new copy of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (my #1 anticipated game of 2011, and more, a transcendental gaming experience that would culminate on a once-in-a-lifetime numeric date that happens to have special significance
 to me. I'm a veteran of OIF and I decided to make Skyrim the ONE game I made sure I could afford on release date the whole 2011 year BECAUSE of the release date, and make a day of somber remembrance merrier).<br />
<br />
Here's where it starts to suck for me, and a great many others. Twitter's mad with tweets. When prompted to run an update prior to playing and as a requirement to play Skyrim, I readily accepted. After downloading , the system restarts to apply the update.
 Halfway through the console freezes, and eventually displays an error message stating " The update could not be read from the disc. Please reinsert the disc and try again. If this problem persists, visit www.xbox.com/support. Error code 3151 351F B800 0F00
 C000 0013.<br />
<br />
After checking my NEW disc for visible defects, I reinserted it, and got the same error screen as before (code ending in C000 0013). To xbox.com/support I go, where I find a match on &nbsp;a search for the error code, and have 5 troubleshooting options.<br />
<br />
I can't install from Xbox LIVE(Option 1), because now when I start my console, whether or not my HDD, ethernet cable (since 360 has been disabled game money goes to internet, Don't you SEE? Microsoft... sigh...) Skyrim game disc (Option 2) FAT32 Flashdrive
 w/ unzipped update saved to root directory(Option 3) , or the CD I burned the same update onto (Option 4) are connected/in the system or not, the same "Installing Update" screen, followed by the C000 0013 error code screen, are all that are displayed.<br />
<br />
No dashboard access since previous to Skyrim being put in the disc tray. &nbsp;I have tried every possible combination of one or all of the five fixes listed above, and get the same result unilaterally. The 5th troubleshooting option:a 5-question FAQ.Nothing of
 use there. &nbsp;I found a link to "Troubleshoot console software update problems" where the 5 options THERE led to zer0 progress: I'd repeatedly tried to reinstall the update &nbsp;(Option 1), I own an XBOX 360 Elite w/ 90 GB of free space on the HDD (more than enough
 room, Option 2), I can't clear my cache if I can't access anything but the above "Installing Update" and C000 0013 Error screens(Option 3), and Options 4&amp;5 were Options 3 &amp; 4 from the above page (flashdrive or burn update to CD/DVD).<br />
<br />
Both tried and failed. &nbsp;I hit the support forums, key C000 0013 , Skyrim Update fail... &nbsp;you get the point. &nbsp;EVERY Person I found with the error code I have was associated with this update from 3 sources I've found: FIFA 12, XBOX LIVE's auto update... and Skyrim.
 &nbsp;In the case of those 2 of the 3 game sources, those NOT on XBOX LIVE (Like me) were equally affected from the download/install/application of this latest update as those 360 users who had either gotten the update through LIVE, or those who got it from the
 game disc itself WHILE HAVING LIVE.<br />
<br />
Which wouldn't be strange, except that the error associated with this C000 0013 code is (to my knowledge, as obtained directly from xbox.com/support): The update could not be downloaded from Xbox LIVE. Try the following Try installing the update again. &nbsp;"Note
 You can also update your console software by copying the update to a USB flash drive or CD. See Troubleshoot console software update problems." HMMMMMM. A loop within a loop.<br />
<br />
Extensive googling has turned up two unnofficial fixes I have also tried with no changed result. I will include here to keep them from being suggested to me. &nbsp;Restarting the console while holding down the Sync button, no change. &nbsp;Unplugging the power source
 from console while system is on and disc tray open, then gently closing the tray halfway and replugging/ restarting console had no effect. &nbsp;Another proposed fix I won't be able to try is to perform the update roll back function (highlight the hard drive under
 memory, then press LB RB X LB RB X) can't access screen where I can highlight ANYTHING. Whatinthe... someone, fix this. Make this right.</p>

<p>So your problem is that on updating you have a C000-0013 Error repeating Update Loop.</p>
<p>Holding the Sync button has worked for every person I have spoken too in Stopping the Loop.</p>
<p>Then you will be able to access the Main Dashboard and do the clear cache. </p>
<p>(Both the Sync and the Clear Cache Do roll back Updates - Sync does Console updates and Cache does game updates.)</p>
<p>IF the Console is still doing the Update error, Rollback the update then power the console off, remove the Hard drive, and use a USB drive as your Main storage source, see if the C000-0013 still comes up.</p>
<p>If you are still having this Update problem - you might need to have your console serviced.
</p>
<p>Thank you DC for sorting it - :)</p>

<p>I got a question about the disc drive. Did it start whining real bad and stopped reading discs properly after you tried to play Skyrim? I'm wondering out of curiosity cuz mine I think if I remember correctly started doing that before but my Skyrim disc updated
 my Xbox 360 Elite (I think) and it mess up installing once but after that it went through correctly.

                    <p>Hello, I have used skype infrequently for several years.</p>
<p>Some days, my account was hijacked. Someone wrote a massage: "hello, could you please owe me 10 000 rubles for a few days" in russian and sent it to my all friends from my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to recover the account I noticed that the person who stole my account reset the password reminder and user account email to a
<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, which is not mine.</span></p>
<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, which is not mine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through all off the automated recovery processes available from Microsoft to be told each time that my answers were inadequate or i didnt have response from microsoft/skype at all.<br />
</p>
<p>As the thief has changed the email address, the email option doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No telephone support is available.</p>

<h2>            Files getting deleted automatically in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows 10 </p>
<p>So far everything was fine except the headphones not working properly which wasnt that big of an issue.</p>
<p>When i booted my laptop today i found that some of my files in the E drive have automatically been deleted. Since this deleted was over 20GB in size so this is an big issue for me. Size of the partition shows files are still there. But they are not visible.
 Not even under hidden items. I have run full system scan and no viruses were found.</p>
<p>What should i do ?</p>
<p>Should i roll back to win 8.1 ? Will my files be available then ?</p>

            <p>Before doing anything check Windows Explorer to see all the drives in the computer. Sometimes the letter designation changes depending on what is connected. It might not always be drive E if it is an external drive. What is drive E--an external drive or
 a partition on the main hard drive? Open Disk Management to see a visual of all the drives and partitions. You should say if the missing files are encrypted or usually hidden and also mention your model computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are the only user, you&nbsp;might want&nbsp;to&nbsp;have explorer set to show all the Hidden&nbsp;files except the System Files.

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered the same problem, very shortly after a trend micro update I was no longer able to boot into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got into Safe Mode and examined the logs, but disabling everything that I could think of didn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I reset Windows and started again. Thank god for OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be curious to know how you ever sorted this out?</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I ran into the same problem. The first time this happened, I was able to restore to a restore point before the Trend update. I reported the issue to Trend as a bug through their feedback system in the AV client, hoping they'd fix it.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The latest Windows Update ambushed me restore point wise, so after the latest reboot I had to boot in safe mode and uninstall Trend using the diagnostic toolkit included with their AV:</div>
<div>
<p><a href="https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1105809.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1105809.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>My machine boots just fine now. I figured I'd run Windows Defender for a while, while waiting for a response from Trend Micro. However, WD refused to run because it&nbsp;falsely detected another AV so I tried the uninstall tool at&nbsp;the bottom of this support article:
<a href="https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1105809.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1105809.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>WD still reported that another AV was detected. I started a full system scan, and for some reason WD now reports&nbsp;that real time protection is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Feel free to also report the issue to Trend, as the consequences are horrible. I was hoping they'd get back to me rather quick&nbsp;after a "hey, your update consistently breaks my computer" kind of bug report.</div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem - after an update of Trend Micro OfficeScan the computer would not boot (BSOD APC_INDEX_MISMATCH). I found out that if I disabled virtualization in BIOS on my computer it would work with Trend OfficeScan still installed so that is
 where I'm at now. Our company policy do not allow us to uninstall Trend (and doing it only results in an automatick reinstall).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping that Trend will fix this as I do need my virtualization to run Hyper-V on my computer.</p>
