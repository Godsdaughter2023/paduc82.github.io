<h2>            Adding Indexing External &#40;Ethernet&#41; drive in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have read all the postings ad help files on indexing external network drives and none of them works in Windows 10.&nbsp; Anyone had experience with setting up indexing in Win10?&nbsp; I can't even get it to accept a network drive letter or IP address.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 battery completely dead, out of warranty, what should I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 battery completely dead, out of warranty, what should I do</h2>
                    <p>Surface pro 3 (512gb i7 core), bought 2 years ago. The battery suddenly becomes unchargeable two months ago. Right now the battery is completely dead. The surface cannot turn on without plugging in. Moreover, I cannot update the firmware through Windows
 update, because it asks for "40%" battery level. The customer service charges $699 for replacement.&nbsp; I am not sure what I can do about this. Any alternative approach to fix the battery? Very disappointed, like $1500 for 2 years.</p>

<div>Yes, that is too much money to spend for a refurb with a 90 day warranty. No one</div>
<div>replaces Surface batteries, unfortunately. It is only worth that kind of $$$&nbsp; if</div>
<div>you can get upgraded to a refurb Surface Pro 2017. Some of the physical retail</div>
<div>Microsoft Stores in the US are doing that (you may need to speak to a manager).</div>
<div>But $600-700 for a refurb SP3 is not a good value IMO.</div>

<p>Hi Barb - although the battery on my Surface Pro III has not died, it now only lasts about 2 1/2 hours.&nbsp; I purchased it August 2014.&nbsp; I normally keep it plugged in.&nbsp; Does the battery have a "memory" and should I let it mostly discharge?&nbsp; Any thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Carl</p>

            <div>You can certainly try to let it completely run down completely and then fully</div>
<div>charge - three full cycles of this. But I doubt this will provide much</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>powercfg /batteryreport </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>it should show usage and capacity changes over time.</div>

            <p>Having the same issues.&nbsp; I selecting Run as Administrator works for me as well.&nbsp; Another thing I noticed that may or may not be related.&nbsp; When I initially upgraded Windows continued to use the old password that I'd used for signing into windows and returning
 from sleep mode, however at some point it inexplicably and without warning started requiring me to use my Microsoft password to sign in/return from sleep.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation. &nbsp;Whenever I try to open my Corel PaintShop Pro X4 software by double clicking the desktop icon for it, &nbsp;I get a popup that says</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The folder listed below is used to save your user-created resource files. &nbsp;Currently the folder is not accessible. &nbsp;See the Installer document, found on the CD, for more information about configuring User Data Folders (My PSP Files). ......."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I right-click the icon and select "Run as Administrator" It brings up the User Account control window and asks if I want to allow this program to make changes. After selecting yes, it opens just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Now here's the important part.</strong></span> Shortly after upgrading to Windows 10 and before inexplicable switch from requiring my old Windows sign-in password to requiring my Microsoft password, I had tried
 to open it by double-clicking the icon on my desktop and it opened just fine.</p>

            <p>Same here, it repeatedly returns to "read only."</p>
<p>I thought I had fixed it by going to sharing and/or security and then telling it that my own computer has rights to read and write but that doesn't work for everything, some files and folders absolutely refuse to remove read only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that my networking is all jacked up now. &nbsp;Some programs cannot access my files on the other computer even though I can go to windows explorer and navigate the folders just fine.</p>

<h3> ar1ana  say:</h3>
<h2>            New internal laptop hard drive wont boot</h2>
                    My laptops (Inspiron 6000) internal hard drive stoped working, I bought a brand new hard drive wich was compatable with my laptop, or so they said and am having trouble making it all come together to work. After reading some web pages it seems like i have
 to start from scratch and reinstall just about everything back on it. Right from the start after putting in the HD and turning it on i got an error that said "No boot sector on internal hard drive". What do i need to do from here. I got both OS(windows Xp
 MC 05) and drive CDs but i dont want to start doing all that and later find out i had to do something else before like formatting/partition. If some one can give me a step by step or direct me to a step by step site that would be great. I need a running laptop
 in time for taxes

            first of all those cd's that you've recieved when you bought the hard drive aren't needed. what you need is Windows Operating system install discs.<br />
the thing is. when you buy a hard drive it is blank.&nbsp;and if you don't have installation discs to install from that hard drive is just going to be a big empty thumb drive.<br />
<br />
when you bought that inspiron 6000 laptop did it come with "recovery discs" or where you instructed to "make your own recovery discs"<br />
because without them your laptop is a dead weight. well if you can somehow source a set of discs heres the process:<br />
<br />
<br />
boot up your laptop and watch the screen for any messages which say something along the lines of "boot / setup /&nbsp;bios" generally its the F12 key for Dell's if you hit F12 repeatedly it will bring up a boot menu where you can choose to boot up from the recovery
 discs. if F12 doesn't do anything then try F2 which brings up a BIOS configuration screen where you can go to the boot section and tell the laptop to boot from cd/dvd drive. when you save and exit it will restart the computer and instead of trying to read
 the blank hard drive it will read the recovery discs / windows install disc.<br />
<br />
from there its just a matter of following the prompts and agreeing to all the licensing terms.<br />
<br />
keep in mind that if you do not use recovery discs and choose to use a friends windows install disc you'll find that many devices within the laptop won't function because windows doesn't not come with the requried drivers to operate the devices. if you use
 a windows disc you will have to go to the dell website and find the rest of the driver software to operate your laptop. nevertheless if you simply need it to do taxes you should get by without a fully functional laptop.<br />
<br />
good luck

            You say you have both the Windows XP installation disc and the motherboard drivers disc - good, because you will need both.<br />
<br />
When you install a new hard drive the first thing you&nbsp;do is install XP by inserting the XP installation CD in the CD/DVD drive and booting from it.<br />
<br />
Windows Setup will format the hard disc as part of the installation.<br />
<br />
Once XP is installed, you then need to put the motherboard driver CD in the CD/DVD drive and install the drivers - starting with the chipset driver. You can install the rest of the drivers in any order.

            Well i&nbsp; started up the laptop,inserted the Installation CD and hit F12 to boot from CD/DVD and got a quick "Setup is inspecting your computers hardware configuration" and then i got a black screen. Its now been about 10 minutes and its still frozen on
 that black screen. :-(

            OK, do you know how to access the laptop's BIOS at boot time - you often get told along the bottom of the screen when it boots - it is usually one of the "F" keys.<br />
<br />
Go into the BIOS and check that the hard drive is being recognised. If it is, you will see it listed, usually on the first BIOS screen.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you said that your laptop's original hard drive stopped working - how did you know that?

            I see the HD listed on the F2 function under "Device info: Primary Hard drive = 137 GB HDD"<br />
My original HD (Seagate Momentus 5400.2 80GB) stopped working after i would get alot of error msgs and blue screens. It would restart itself a lot. One day i was working on something and i herd a clicking sound inside the laptop and it just suddently turned
 off. I cant remember exacly wich error message and code i would get but when it first started happening i wrote it down and did a research of it and pretty much everyone was saying my HD gave out. I had my laptop not working after that for a while, i finaly
 decided to just go ahead and buy a new, bigger HD (WD Scorpio Blue PATA 320GB) and see if i could restore it, but so far im not having any luck with this. This is the HD that was recomended to me when i took my own HD into the computer store to match it up.
 Do i need to format it first? im also wondering why if its a 320GB it only shows 137GB.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>I also ran a diagnostic with the Utilities and drivers CD on the new HD and im testing the HD part of the test, what i find interesting is that on the test it shows "Device: SATA Disk S/N= WD-WXF0AB931282" wich ofcourse is my new Western Digital HD, except
 it isnt suppost to be a SATA because i was given a PATA and it also has it on the box as a PATA. Would this have anything to do wit my problems? How would i know wich HD version (pata or sata) i really need or wich i used to run on before?. Im no computer
 wiz here so i trusted the tech guys at the computer store on giving me the right one</em>

            Let's deal with the SATA/PATA thing first. The two different types of HD have different power and data cables - typically the data cable for the PATA is a flat multicore cable, whilst that for the SATA is a narrow cable that doesn't show any cores.<br />
<br />
If you were able to connect the power cable &amp; data cable from your laptop to the HD you bought, then you have the right one.<br />
<br />
Now to the 137Gb. If your motherboard BIOS is dated before 2002, it can have an upper limit on HD capacity it recognises of 137Gb. This doesn't mean that you cannot use the larger capacity when using XP (SP1 or later versions), just that the capacity is not
 visible until the Operating System (OS) is loaded.<br />
<br />
What version of XP is the installation disc you have? If it is not SP1 or later, there is a specific way in which you would have to install XP.<br />
<br />
As I said previously, the HD is formatted as part of the XP installation process -so we need to be able to get into that process.<br />

            i actualy didnt connect any cables at all so i dont understand what power, data or multicore cables you mean. The Hard drive just has a row of pins on the bottom, that once connecting the adapter all i do is slip it all the way inside the side of the laptop
 where the old one used to be.<br />
<br />
As to the installation disc, its the "Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Version 2005 with Update Rollup 2"<br />
<br />
i honestly think its the wrong HD

            Well i called Seagate to confirm what type of old HD i had installed on my laptop before and unfortunatly it was a PATA, so it seems i AM using the correct type. I was almost hoping that it was wrong since it would have solved my problem just by switching
 types...Now im back to square one.

            As you were able to connect up the HD we know it was the right type.<br />
<br />
As it is recognised in your pc's BIOS we know it is functioning.<br />
<br />
As it was only recognised as having 137Gb capacity we know that your pc's BIOS is pre-2002 and that to use the whole 320Gb HD capacity you will need to install Windows XP - or update your BIOS, if an update is available.<br />
<br />
We now know that your version of XP is sufficiently recent for you not to have to worry about the 137Gb BIOS limit when you install XP.<br />
<br />
Some more questions:<br />
1. Do you have any Recovery discs? - they either came with you pc originally or you were asked to make them.<br />
2. If you don't have recovery disks, do you have a CD containing the Dell motherboard Drivers and Utilities?<br />

            no recovery Cds, but i do have the Drivers and Utilities.<br />
<br />
i gave up on the previous HD i purchased and went to exchange it last night. Im now goin to start again with another brand new, same everything except lower GB (250GB) and see how that goes. If i have the same problem then im guessing it has to do with my laptop.

            Can you can determine if the other party is using a headset to hear you or are they using their computers built in mic?
<br />
<br />Can you isolate the problem by calling another contact to determine if problem is your setup or person you are calling?
<br />
<br />In Skype for Mac, click the Skype menu then click Audio &amp; video settings

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Skype Classic.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the forseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns out that Mike's Tech Shop, an authorized Apple dealer in Manhattan, is the cause.&nbsp; MTS broke the screen on my desk top computer, unsuccessfully tried to blame me, then fixed it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with the microphone having been moved to the bottom in my 2017 model, they mistakenly covered that mike with the adhesive.&nbsp; This caused my voice to come across muffled to those I call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed all your suggestions and, by process of elimination, found the cause.&nbsp; I have AppleCare and they will uncover the mike.<br />

<h2>            Windows10 randomly refuses to safely eject external disks</h2>
                    <p><br />
Hello there,</p>
<p><br />
More than 11 months ago I expose in these forums some problems in Windows10.</p>
<p>One of them is the denial to safely eject external disks.</p>
<p>Here is what happens: I connect one of my external disks to my pc, then I move/copy/delete/edit/view some files, and later, after closing EVERYTHING, Windows10 refuses to safely eject my disk. It replies, "<em>Windows can't stop your 'Volume' device because
 a program is still using it</em>".</p>
<p>Windows doesn't tell me what program is employing my drive. And I know for sure there is nothing employing it.</p>
<p>That issue happens randomly. I mean, sometimes I can safely eject the disk, and sometimes I cannot.</p>
<p><br />
Today I downloaded from Microsoft the app named "<strong>procexp64.exe</strong>" which showed me what is employing my external disk.
</p>
<p>And, they are Windows processes only!</p>
<p>Let's say my disk's root ID is "M:\"</p>
<p>The Process Explorer found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four "system" processes with open files in M:\$Extend\$RmMetadata\$Txf.........</li><li>Two "explorer" processes with open directory M:\</li></ul>
<p><br />
Hence, Windows doesn't allow me to safely eject my external disk because Windows forgot it was itself the one using my disk!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost 1 year has passed, and the issue still persists.</p>
<p>Annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Toshiba C855D laptop Windows 8 Boot Failure after automatic update</h2>
                    My daughter bought a Toshiba C855D laptop just over 2 weeks ago. &nbsp;I helped her create the backup DVDs. &nbsp;Unfortunately she forgot to take them with her when she returned to her job in another state. &nbsp;Last night her laptop updated and when restarted it displayed:
 &nbsp;"Boot Failure: a proper digital signature was not found. One of the files on the select boot device was rejected by the Secure Boot feature." &nbsp;Does she have any recourse until the recovery discs arrive by mail?

            I am also working on a laptop with windows 8.&nbsp; After a long talk this is what happened.&nbsp; They bought it for Christmas and installed Quicken and have been running it since.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week an update had completed and had to shutdown.&nbsp; The owner let it shut down
 and a few days later turned it on and with a few minutes of being on a Car Parts web site (NAPA), the system locked rebooted with the same issue as icdesigner above.&nbsp; I have read many tech ideas and the one your give is all they say.&nbsp; well that it doesn't
 work for&nbsp;this system.&nbsp;&nbsp;With security on there is&nbsp;black screan with and a Boot failure&nbsp;error that stays on for about a minute then system shuts down.&nbsp; With the the security off it boots to a blue&nbsp;screen&nbsp;that stays on with RCOVERY at the top.&nbsp; The digital signiture
 of this file couldn't be verified. Error code 0xc0000428.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it goes on to say to use the&nbsp;disc that came with the system to fix it. Wel

<h2>            Where&#39;s My Perry starts with a black screen in windows 10</h2>
                    I bought the game "Where's My Perry" and installed it on my Windows 10 tablet in December. Upon launch it only shows a black&nbsp;screen. I find if I rotate my screen sideways (tall profile) it will load but the picture will be distorted. The Windows Store
 reviews show that others are having the same problem with Windows 10. I've reached out to the publisher in January but have not received a response.

</p><p><span><span>Hi Bob, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize that it must be difficult for you when things are not working as it should. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you download this game from the store?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Have you installed all pending updates on the pc?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Is the issue specific to this game?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may update the Display driver from the Device Manager and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. Right click on the video driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also suggest you to install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several
 programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>

            <p>as an added note, if I start the game in portrait mode, it will get past the black screen and load but&nbsp;tapping is way off by about an inch or two and the graphics are distorted. If I rotate it back to landscape mode, the screen may or may not correct itself

    <title>Windows 7 cursor refreshing&#47;loading a lot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessicka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 cursor refreshing&#47;loading a lot</h2>
                    Windows 7 - the cursor is always loading for a split second like something is going on in the background. If i enable sounds I can hear that click sound like internet explorer. I have been trying to resolve this for weeks.<br />
<br />
What i've done so far and what you should know:<br />
<br />
Reformatted 4 times, always have the problem<br />
Did every virus/malware scan, performance etc on the planet, nothing comes up ever. No one on sites like Help2Go found anything<br />
Disabled everything on start up still getting it<br />
Alienware Tech took control and couldn't find a problem<br />
<br />
I swear it's something running though like a legit process that shouldn't be even though i disabled everything. It's frustrating because no one knows or can help and every scan comes up clean, reformat problem remains, even installing windows 7 on another machine
 produced the problem. I'm unsure what it is. Anyone who can help, please reply. <br />
<br />
I think it's some legit thing that is deep in the background doing this. Unless it's a Windows 7 but they need to patch.<br />
<br />
Lately my connection has felt slower too, unsure if this is related. I don't know how to optimize my connection

            Hi Jessicka,<br />
<br />
It's always recommended to have the compatible drivers and softwares installed in the computer. Make sure all the device drivers are updated. Reformating hard drive multiple times may hamper the hard drive in some way or the other. This is not an issue since
 this happens on all the computers, even mine. The computer does need some time when you perform certain activites on it like enabling sound, clicking and opening applications. When the sound was disabled you obviously would not hear any sound whatsoever on
 the computer, enabling it would obviously let you hear the click sound so as to make you aware that the sound is enabled. However, if you feel that there is some software(legit process) that is hidden in the background and causing the issue to occur, you may
 boot your computer in safe mode and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>To boot into safe mode, follow the below steps: </strong><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.<br />
Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do one of the following:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details:<br />
<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a>
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that this is normal and would occur even in safe mode. Restart your computer in normal mode and put your computer in Clean Boot state.<br />
<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may go ahead and disable or uninstall the same.<br />
<strong><br />
Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
The above steps would put the computer in clean boot state. You may check now if that makes the boot up faster or not.
<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>After you’ve finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
You can have your computer play a sound when certain events occur on your computer. (An event can be an action that you perform, such as logging on to your computer, or an action that your computer performs, such as alerting you when you receive new e‑mail.)
 Windows comes with several sound schemes (a collection of related sounds) for common events. Additionally, some desktop themes have their own sound schemes.<br />
<br />
For more information on sound schemes access the following link : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-computer-sounds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-computer-sounds</a> <br />
<br />
With regards to your connection getting slower, are you referring to the computer connection or the Internet connection?<br />

            Hi, thanks for the reply<br />
<br />
I should have added when I mentioned getting help from HELP2go's site, that I did all the above. I don't remember the problem happening in safemode. I'm not running any desktop themes, I'm not one of those types. I'm a gamer, so I really like bare minimum running.
 The boot is actually fast. Nothing is really slow it's more about the cursor appearing for a second but quite often (something I didn't experience with XP) and then the clicking sound (which I already disabled.) Even now as&nbsp; I type this message I see my icon
 move for a second, and the click and it lags my text for a moment. Also I should mention that even when the browser is closed (Firefox, I don't use IE) I get the click but the icon on the cursor cycling like it's "loading" something that happens and quite
 often... it's odd.&nbsp; It's not playing these sounds during any events of any kind. It just happens.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As for connection - I meant that when I ran a scan on pcpitstop and 2 other sites I can't remember... it said I should optimize my connection for faster surfing and it has been feeling slower than when I run my XP system. I can't stress enough that this machine
 is clean of all malware etc. Nothing is ever found with all the top apps used to determine if that was a problem.
<br />
<br />
I did do the clean boot before, but maybe I missed something. Do you know (because I can't find any info in any search) if adope photoshop cs4 has some issues with Windows 7? After looking through all the settings in preferences but finding nothing, I am wondering
 if photoshop is some how trying to make an online connection with adobe or something?&nbsp; I bought photoshop recently from Adobe so it's safe yet when I run the eset nod 32 scan it detects a part of photoshop as malware, deletes it and then photoshop stops working
 and I have to reinstall the cds again.&nbsp; Also if I disable the entry - Adope CS4 Service Manager, Photoshop won't start anymore, even if I re-enable it. I had to contact Adobe to get it enabled again. So I wonder if that service, which I can't disable without
 losing photoshop's ability to work, is causing this and is some causing a conflict with Windows 7?&nbsp; That's really all I can think of. Though when I did disable it, I still got the click and loading oddness. I'm unsure what to think or what to do at this point.

<h2>            &#91;W10&#93; Hydro Thunder Hurricane - Cannot Access Full Version</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently acquired the trial version of Hydro Thunder Hurricane on my Windows 10 PC. I liked the game, so I credited my account with a Microsoft gift card and purchased the $9.99 game from the Microsoft store. I did not open the game and click "Purchase
 full version," I directly opened the store app and purchased the game from there. When I opened the game again, the full version was not unlocked. The "purchase full version" button was still there, and I could not open any of the full features. I uninstalled
 the game and reinstalled it with no luck. I still have the trial version.</p>
<p>My billing statement from Microsoft says I successfully purchased the game. How can I access the full version? The only other action I took is that I chose to sign into the app with my Microsoft account using a local user account vs using the Microsoft user
 account.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. I really want to get this problem solved.</p>

<p>I have this issue as well. Support even refunded me to re-purchase and attempt to just download the paid version with no success. It seems to be a bug with the game so hopefully it will get patched soon.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro no longer activated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack butterfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro no longer activated</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>So to sum things up, I had an old Windows 7 Pro PC, that I removed the hard drive from, and used it in my new PC.</p>
<p>Over time I have had hardware and software upgrades. Naturally I opted to get the free upgrade of Windows 10 Pro from my Genuine Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>However recently I changed my motherboard, processor, and ram. Upon booting my PC there has been a permanent mark stating 'Activate Windows, Go to Settings to activate Windows' and its really annoying me as it just sits there over all my applications and
 games. I had this issue previously, but thankfully the Windows 7 Pro product key was printed on the case of the OLD Windows 7 PC that I salvaged, which I no longer have. So I now technically have no Product key, even though I am meant to have a product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I either 'reactivate windows' or make this Watermark go away permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I actually go to my Windows 10 Settings, to activate, I click troubleshoot, and I am treated with this message.<br />
"Troubleshooting has completed. We can't activate your copy of windows. Make sure you're connected to the internet and try again. If you're connected to the internet and continue seeing this message, contact your system administrator for more information"</p>
<p>Which is then followed by a link to 'learn more'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This link basically states that I have now got a 'Digital License' since my free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, however it neglects to state where I can find this information.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate some help, as it has been quite a number of months now, and this watermark is ruining my experience with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<p>If the Windows 7 Pro key was attached to the case of the old PC then it may have been an OEM licence. When you changed the motherboard then your OEM licence is no longer valid for the new hardware under Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you want to try however you may be able to activate using Chat Support. It&nbsp;should at least confirm the status of your licence.</p>

            <p>Hi Lovesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Ashes Cricket 2009 does not start and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What happens when you try to launch the game?</li><li>Do you receive any error message?</li><li>What is the complete and exact error message?</li><li>Are you able to play any other game?</li><li>Is the issue specific to Ashes Cricket 2009?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>As per the <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-in&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=ashes%2Bcricket%2B2009%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Compatibility Center</a></strong>, there is no information available for Ashes Cricket 2009 about its compatibility with Windows 8.1. While you revert with answers to questions asked, I would suggest you to perform the following steps considering any third
 party software conflict. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Start the computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, kindly revert with more information for further research and assistance.

<h2>            There Is a Strange Folder in My System Protection Options&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Under&nbsp;the System Protection tab in System Properties, which gives you System Restore options,&nbsp;there is a system volume that looks like it has a clsid number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is outside of the usual partitions. Is this normal? It does not appear in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The machine is quarantined and will not be visiting the internet anymore, so I can't give you the screenshot. But this is the name of the folder:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>\\?\Volume{d331125c-e4fe-11e1-b1eb-806e6f6e6963}\&nbsp;&nbsp;Below&nbsp; this are partitions C: and E:, which I created on the disk during a recent clean install. The new internal drive
 is a WD Scorpion 320 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, Windows would not start, and gave me a hardware error. I took the bottom off the laptop, reseated the memory, hard drive, and DVD-RW, blew it out, and tightened everything up. It is now working correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I also had a malware issue with Rimecud!inf, DelfInject.gen!BE, and DelfInject.gen!AF, which is the reason I am asking this question. Could this folder be a remnant of malware? I wiped the drive four times.</p>

    <title>HDMI audio output static during video playback - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HDMI audio output static during video playback</h2>
                    When using my Win7 laptop HDMI output jack to play movies on a HDTV,&nbsp;I get a blast of audio static and garbled digital distortion every 4-5 minutes.&nbsp; It lasts about 30 seconds then goes away.&nbsp; It does this continuously throughout the movie.&nbsp; I tested this
 using DVD and Netflix Movie watcher and it happens with both.&nbsp; Interestingly it does not appear to happen with MP3 audio playback.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Lon.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I suggest you to uninstall the sound card drivers and then download and install the drivers for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s
 website.</span></p>
<p><span>First create a manual restore point before uninstalling the drivers, so that if something goes wrong you can roll back.</span></p>

</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, set your HDMI as default.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:<br />
</span><span>1.&nbsp;Right click on the volume icon in the system tray.<br />
</span><span>2.&nbsp;Click on playback devices.<br />
</span><span>3.&nbsp;Click on HDMI Output and click on set default.</span></p>
