<h2>            Windows 10 tech preview installation failed at 70&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Ultimate Dell XPS M1710 machine.</p>
<p>Downloaded the 10043 build, it asked to remove a program, and I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation went all the way to 70% (on the circle on Black background) then it just stopped for 8 hours.</p>
<p>So, I rebooted, and then it said Restoring Previous Version of Windows. And since then, it has been pretty bad. The Restore point didn't work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, without Win10, I don't have access to all the resources to report problems, and ask questions. So that is why I am here.</p>
<p>So, should I try it again? And if so, any changes I should consider?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Cyrus</p>

            <p>Current build is 10049.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When it restored the previous version was it 10041 or Win 7 or something else?&nbsp; Did it work?</p>
<p>What program did you remove?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in Windows 7 go to the Windows Insider site and download the ISO for 10014 (there is not an ISO for 11049 yet) and think about dual booting.&nbsp; To Dual boot repartition your hard drive freeing some space, I would say 60-80GB, then format it as a
 PRIMARY Partition and load Win 10 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use EaseUS Partition Master.&nbsp; There is a free version that works well for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you are back into Win 10 go to Settings, Update and recovery and update.&nbsp; You may have to update more than once.&nbsp; Then you should see the Update to 10049.&nbsp; This update can take over 2 hours.</p>

<h2>            6233 - conflict with Orange Home Screen and Active standby Icons.</h2>
                    HI,<br />
<br />
I don't use the Orange Home Screen on my Orange 6233. I prefer to use Active Standby, with the Shortcut Bar and Calendar as options.<br />
<br />
When I turn the 6233 off and back on it defaults to putting the Orange home screen back on! And then I can't use the Active Standby buttons. i have to turn Orange Home Screen off again.<br />
<br />
However, even the Active Standby doesn't work properly. The Calendar doesnt appear and if I scroll into that box, I can't scroll out of it and can't scroll dates, as there is nothing there.<br />
<br />
I am still on firmware V3.7 Will upgrading to v4.52 help fix these problems, or is this more of an Orange issue here in the UK?<br />
<br />

            Exactly the same problem here. Which is the most important discovered so far. Just got a 6233 from Orange yesterday with firmware v3.7 and has exactly the same behaviour.<br />
<br />
An also big problem is that sms tone notification as Standard is very weak (and rather gentle/discrete in its acoustics, probably as a result of the hi-fi sound, unfortunately not needed for this feature! I have a 6230 currently which is much better - it does
 get noticed), and that the phone sometimes doesn't go to screen with clock (stays in the background). I guess one can dowload a louder more alarming Standard alert or process the current one using a PC (sounds a bit geeky!).<br />
<br />
Also in the Go To menu, bottom left of screen, the option of Answer Phone keeps coming back when I switch off+on, but not a huge problem in practise of course. Also, the 3G icon goes from active to inactive, but I've never used 3G with Orange before so don't
 know if it's the coverage.<br />
<br />
And finally, even worse, the signal keeps fluctuating (compared with 6230 which was much more stable when I was at home) and sometimes goes completely off, not just a visual thing but you actually have no reception. This happened about 3 times within a period
 of 3 hours when testing yesterday, quite bad, and lasts for 1-2 mins!<br />
<br />
And a small warning: in Nokia Suite, when transfering contacts, if one has more than one mobile (or home/office/fax etc) numbers stored, only the first one is transfered, rest are ignored! I then uses the Oxygen (third party) software which worked fine (exept
 it doesn't create the groups, as there are no groups set up in 6233). Further warning, on this issue, there are a lot more fields now available in 6233 so careful when moving to another phone afterwards as some may not be mapped. There is probably an intelligent
 software which can map them, at least to e.g. MS Outlook fields one by one.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much, S.

No it isn't fixed in the Orange UK version of 4.52 according to some posts on here.<br />
<br />
The low tone bug has been called a "safety feature" by Nokia, I don't believe their spin on what is an obvious and really annoying bug.

            You've discovered one of the truly great annoying things about modern mobile operators. 90% of the stuff they do with phones cause the handsets to be unstable and or to work less well than they were originally intended by the manufacturer. Operator intrusiveness
 is also one of the reasons that handsets go faulty. I know, cos I worked in sales with one of these companies, and for a certain period, whenever new handsets were released, nearly whole stocks would go bad because of modifications put on the phones by networks.
 Modifications which, by the way, customers neither want or need. <br />
<br />
The low tone on the 6233 is another typically Nokia specific gaffe. Nokia apparently believes that with every innovation, they must take one step backward in some other area, and regress the development of their handsets... It might be corporate guilt at being
 so successful.<br />

            Well, after a few weeks of trying to figure out what to do about all these software conflicts, I've finally decided;<br />
<br />
Luckily, I took Carphone Warehouse's phone insurance policy when I took the contract. I've had the phone a little over 6 weeks now, so in 6 weeks (three months into my contract), I can ditch it and take another phone. So that's what I'm going to do.<br />
<br />
Love the phone for calls and texting etc. But very **bleep** at Nokia/Orange for screwing up a perfectly good phone with conflicting software.<br />
<br />
Maybe just go back to one of the Orange SPV phones. My SPV 500 was a good phone. The 600 looks cool too.<br />

            My 6233 was exchanged but not without hardship by Phones4u, but surprise surprise it had the same faults as before with some additional ones, how lucky am I?<br />
6 times out of 10 when switching on it would say, ''phone restricted'' enter code'' so I had to switch off and back on again and it would be OK, also most of the time when sending a text it would say ''no message centre no defined'' again I had to switch off
 and back on again to remedy the situation all this on top of the mysterious re appearing orange home screen, ringtones and message alerts resetting back to default after switching off and on again, with these to faults and the ones listed at the beginning
 I could never get the phone set up how I preferred because of the need to continually reboot and have to change everything again, did I mention the phone used to sometimes without any intervention from me save a text message to drafts without warning, oh yeah
 and the almost constant crashing to a white screen for about 10 seconds.<br />
As phones4u made it clear that I was not allowed anymore exchanges, I had to send the handset away to be repaired, I done the sensible thing and sold it on ebay......£170 touch.<br />
The moral of my story is:<br />
1. Never buy an Orange contract/handset through anyone other than Orange.<br />
2. Never buy a newly released Nokia handset, let some other person have the faults, wait at least 6 months and reconsider.<br />
3. Stick with Sony Ericsson.

<p>Many thanks for responding, Jim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was (and am) on the latest update, 15.40 (171108).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is, the problem has not happened again in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had the problem, I think the most recent thing I had done in Word was to change the font of the style Comment Text.&nbsp; I had tried restarting Word to clear the problem without success, but since then I have also restarted the MacBook.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post again if the problem recurs. Thanks again for taking trouble over this.</p>

<h2>            This document cannot be registered.</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I've searched the forums. The closest match to my problem is here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/this-document-could-not-be-registered/9f241662-ac4c-4de4-9bbf-02165f27fa31" title="original post by SteelerFan_WillowGrove">
"this document could not be registered"</a>&nbsp;and that post has only its title &nbsp;in common with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, some stats:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan Public Beta 3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft® Word for Mac Version 15.12.3 (150724)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I realize I'm running on a beta OS. I'm not complaining or demanding a fix, although a solution would be welcome; I'm simply interested in understanding the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open a single document—any document—I get the error message in the title of this post. The OS isn't opening multiple documents, as is the case with the poster referenced above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my documents have short titles—twenty to thirty alpha-only characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found articles in the forums that suggest re-registering Word, but they all speak to Windows users and suggest ducking around in the Windows Registry. That doesn't apply to me, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a code monkey, but I do some ad hoc IT work for my small company, so I do know my way around the Mac Library folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights or suggestions would be welcome, even if the answer is "Wait for Apple to work the bugs out of El Capitan."</p>

Thanks for reading and for your responses.<br />

    <title>Activation key does not work for Office for Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a.canton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation key does not work for Office for Mac 2011</h2>
                    <p>I've had Office for Mac 2011 for a lot of years and have put it on each new Mac I get... (we get a new one every year or so.) We use Migration Assistant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To day I ran Migration Assistant and Office 2011 came over but when I click on Word it puts up a screen asking for the product key. I entered it and it said it would not activate and sent me to a phone number where you end up putting in a ton of numbers
 and then it too says it can't activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go on the internet and find a phone number which lands me in India with some guy who hardly speaks English. He wants me to download a 966MB file. Yeah, like I'm really going to do that and lose my job! I don't know for sure that "he" is from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I need is a key to unlock a program that I own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I could re-install from the CD but then I'd have to go through a long process and then do a major service pack install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bet is that MS is trying to get me to buy Office 365. And I'm not against doing that but first I need to get Office installed so I can write the memo saying we should go to Office 365!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not. Libre Office (or Pages) is where I'm going to go and we'll just get our work done with that and not have to go thorough this again. I wasted half a day talking to a guy who didn't know what he didn't know.</p>
<p>

            <p>UPDATE: I called back this evening and got a different guy in India who understood the problem and generated a product key for me which worked to unlock this old version of Office 2011. I think we will move to Office 365 if I can be assured that we won't
 go through an activation 'nightmare' this time next year when we get new computers. (We are Apple developers and so we get a 'deal' on new hardware.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 365 subscription would make financial sense for us... but I wonder if this won't happen next year and not just on one machine but on all 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, Microsoft makes things more difficult than they have to be. And their attitude is way different than Apple. With Apple you are made to feel that you are a customer. With MS you are made to feel like you are a thief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would someone try to steal a six year old piece of software? Apple's attitude is "We're sure they aren't." The Microsoft attitude is "We're sure they are."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, all is well that ends well... and I'll take a look at the 365 subscription... although I have the bad taste in my mouth from the mess I killed most of the day on... and my gut tells me it won't be any different with 365 this time next year when the
 new iMacs are delivered. MS will assume we're crooks and I'll be right back here asking the same questions on how to get authorized.</p>

            <p>I'm glad you got it sorted :-) so just for background information...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with outright purchases users do not "own" the software [Microsoft or any other]. The only time we own the software is if there is a contractual agreement with the developer to transfer ownership lock,stock &amp; barrel, which typically occurs only in the
 case of custom applications costing thousands of dollars. With consumer software the developer retains ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we purchase is a license to <em>use</em> the software, &amp; those licenses typically allow for a certain number of installations. The number of installations is stipulated in the End User License Agreement [EULA] which varies depending on the release version
 as well as the specific edition of that release. Based on your description of the history, my guess is that you exceeded the number of installs allowed for your edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of the problem for Office 2011 &amp; later is caused by using Migration Assistant, because the licensing of the software is associated with the HD on which it is installed. The problem can be avoided if Office 2011 is first Removed from one Mac before installing
 on another. That frees up the previously used install allowance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your frustration, but anti-piracy is a very important factor for Microsoft because it is - first &amp; foremost - a software developer. The same is true for Adobe, FileMaker, VMware, Intuit, Symantec, ad infinitum. I'm not offering any sort of defense
 for the perceived attitude of MS, but Apple, OTOH, is primarily a <em>hardware</em> developer... their software is relatively inexpensive - for the most part supplied free - and runs only on
<em>their</em> Operating System which works only with <em>their</em> computers. The threat of pirating Apple software is virtually non-existent, whereas for others it is a devastating concern :-)

            Do they account For Hard Drives going Belly up? Will be even more so when switch is made totally to SSD.&nbsp;Remember the incident (I am not sure was ever fixed) with HyBrid Drive which used SSD for system info and HD for storage of files and software components
 that don't change. Its seems at least the early SSD days the Dives &nbsp;presented a new Electronic Serial number each time &nbsp;it was started or restarted. Thus they could use up a Life time of installs in a matter of hours.&nbsp;

            <p>Removing MS Office 2011 on a Mac from what I'm told is an difficult task because MS spews their files all over the disk. I don't believe you can just drag the system from the Applications folder to the trash and be rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, installing from the six-year-old CDs (if not scratched) to the new computer is not only a long process but how many updates (Service Packs) would have to be downloaded and applied? I bet more than one, and I'll bet some of them are huge... and on
 a somewhat slow DSL connection it is something one would want to avoid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the day MS wants me to do what is in ITS best interest, but I need to do what is in my best interest. That is part of the difference between MS and Apple. MS thinks "How can we keep people from stealing our software?" while Apple thinks "How
 can we help our customer get their work done?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is no excuse for outsourcing tech support to a country where English is a second language, to say nothing about the fact that these people just read scripts and have no real training. Do you know that you can call Apple Care at 3 AM and get someone
 who speaks almost-perfect English and who either has been trained on the product or who knows whom to refer the call to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking that if our company abandons the old 2011 Office product (which we want to do) and go for the Office 365 (which we can easily afford,) who is to say we won't have the same mess 18 months from now when we get new hardware?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best analogy I can make is that in the USA's justice system we go to great lengths to let a criminal go free then convict and jail an innocent citizen. Microsoft on the other hand is willing to 'imprison' all of it's "citizens" to make sure that no one
 escapes with an unpaid copy of their software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the need and use of licenses, but I think MS needs to reevaluate its process. I lost half a day on my day off trying to get this fixed. How likely am I going to want to go through this again with another MS product? I'm more inclined to dump
 Office and use Libre Office or Apple Pages/Numbers. And since I am one of the senior partners here, I can do that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to do business with MS, but they just make it so hard. Their web site is impossible to find the answers I look for and their people are not very well-trained. I just don't understand that business model. I think the company would do well to talk
 to their customers and not just listen to the 20-something 'kids' they recruit who know software but little else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be willing to asisst you in your issue of not opening your emails. It is possible that this is&nbsp;a browser issue so I suggest that you
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache#Opera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">optimize</a> your browser,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> clear browser's cache and temporary internet files.

            <p>My Question was.</p>
<p>What can I do when the sign in to my windows account (outlook.com) will not open.</p>
<p>I have about 25 times now tried to sign in. Never was the NAME or PW recognized. I verified the identity and got a code, gave in the code and was able to find a new (other) PW. Got the Message that I can now use the new PW. Trying to sign in brings the old
 problem. Name or PW not recognized.</p>
<p>I did ask the Question to the forum and got finally an answer after 3 weeks. The Guy who answered the Question said that he now will lock the Question. He gave me a link and believe it or not the link did bring me to the sign in Window, what means I got
 the run around.</p>
<p>I have to say that it is ti difficult to get answers from Microsoft and I do not understand why I get alarm when I do not sign in with my Microsoft account. I do not want that account and I don't need that account. Why can I not just delete this.</p>
<p>I would like to delete Microsoft because since Windows 8 I do not believe in there professionalism anymore.</p>

<p>First, thanks so much for taking the time to give your suggestions. You are very kind. I will try some of the things you mentioned.</p>
<p>No, I did not develop the website.</p>
<p>I am curious as to why the website works fine when I use Google and Firefox as my browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This next question will show you how "untechnical' I am.</p>
<p>Is it possible that internet explorer is attaching to an old website we used to have?</p>
<p>Thanks again to everybody on this forum!</p>

<h2>            How to you set spin button controls to accept percentage increments&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to use a spin button control in Excel 2010. I can change the minimum and maximum increments, but when I try to use it with a linked cell containing a percentage, it goes from 1% to 100%. I've tried changing the value and the small change from
 1 to .01 and get the invalid property value error. &nbsp;I'm sure it's simple but the online help doesn't go into percentages other than to state that it can be done.

<p>Thanks Alex for the quick and clear reply. My mistake in the first place - I'm running an older version of Office than the one I quoted. Time for me to upgrade rather than update!

<h2>            Contact List keeps merging with hotmail contact list....</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got my HTC Touch phone yesterday and really love it.&nbsp; However, I'm pretty frustrated right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow I updated the phone and all of my contacts from my hotmail account became contacts on my cell phone.&nbsp; They are very old and out-dated and I really don't want them all on my cell phone contacts.&nbsp; After deleting all of them which was no
 quick task....I entered my contacts that I wanted on my cell phone manually.&nbsp; I'm not sure how it happened, but I went back to my contacts on the cell and to my dismay...All of the hotmail contacts have returned to the cellphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Searching for tags in OneNote 2016</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a microsoft Surface pro 4 device with Onenote 2016 on it. On my laptop I used to have, I had a function to search for tags in my Onenote files. In the version of OneNote I have on my surface pro 4 I can't search for tags anymore. The Help function
 for Onenote tells me how to do this but I simply don't have the buttons which I used to have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea? </p>

            <p>Hi Menno,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the "search for tags" function, do you refer to the Find Tags button under the Home &gt; Tags section? Below is an Example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f107b61-8130-4e29-9314-658c06816717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f107b61-8130-4e29-9314-658c06816717" height="88" width="589" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, you could check if the button is under the Home column. If it's not there, you could try to click File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon &gt; select
Choose commands from </span>&gt; Navigate to the <span style="font-weight: bold">Find Tag</span> &gt;
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e81e869-e46d-4c7e-b74c-8dbd4ae56e43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e81e869-e46d-4c7e-b74c-8dbd4ae56e43" height="477" width="587" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the scenario remains or it's not the button I mentioned above, please let us know the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. Which is the button?</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of the scenario.</p>
<p>3. Does the button appear on your laptop now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jared<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

            <p>Hi Jared,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response. The solution you come up with doesn't work. This because the look and options of my OneNote are different then what you show. The screen shot you present is what I'm used to and what I really want to have again. So if you can
 help me out with that I would be thankfull. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a screen shot of how OneNote looks right now at my Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help me out. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a nokia n8, when my N8 had "Anna", it works good. But since I installed "Belle" on my phone the microphone doesn't work very well. When I do a call the peaple I speak don't listen very well (They hear my voice low or like a robot), but when I use
 the handsfree they hear me good. <span>Does anyone</span>&nbsp;<span>else have</span>&nbsp;<span>the same problem o have the solution?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia forum.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to hard reset your N8 with *#7370#. The default security code the phone will ask for is 12345, unless you have changed this code. The reset will clear the phone completely, so make sure you make a backup with Nokia Suite first, but don't backup
 the phone's settings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you've done the reset, place the backup back onto your phone and see if this makes a difference. If it doesn't, reinstall Belle by clicking on the green arrow in Nokia Suite.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If both a hard reset and reinstallation of Belle don't solve the issue, visit a local Care centre where they can check out the device on any software and hardware issues. They'll be able to fix the issue for you if the above
 hasn't worked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can find your nearest Care centre by visiting your local Nokia web page and clicking on the Support tab.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps, let me know how you get on.</span></span></p>

            Yes, I too have the problem. I upgraded to Symbian belle and since I have the problem. Yesterday, I took it to a nearby Nokia care and asked for re-install Nokia Belle after a clean/ Format of the Software and files. They asked me if the problem still
 persists, it has to be sent to Nokia Unit and it would take 10 days. Is it a common problem ???

<p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a similar problem to the original poster, with my N8 under Belle.&nbsp; The person at the receiving end of telephone calls say that it is very difficult to hear, with lots of noise. I also hear a lot of noise when using the sound recorder and the video
 recorder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems appear to have started after updating to Belle. I do not use the mobile &nbsp;as a telephone very often, so I cannot be sure exactly when the noise problems started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a hard reset; this did not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the phone to a shop of the chain that sold me the phone (Telenor, Norway); they sent the phone away for repair to an approved nokia repair centre. Two weeks later I got the phone back. The repair company noted that they had replaced some parts and
 tested the sound quality. I suspect this means they replaced the microphone and/or related parts, but I don't know for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the sound recorder straight away and thought that the quality was much better.</p>
<p>Then I re-loaded my saved settings, software etc from backup (via Nokia PC Suite), and re-installed some apps that were not re-installed by that process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now I have the same problem again. Very poor noise quality on calls, and on the sound recorder and the video recorder. &nbsp;The call quality is so poor that it is barely useable as a telephone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that this has re-appeard after software installation, I'm suspecting it's not a hardware problem. I am reluctant to take the phone to the shop again, as I don't want to be without my phone for another two weeks, and I'm reluctant to have to got through
 the time-consuming process of having to re-install everything afterwards, set-up multiple email accounts again etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody help? Any suggestions would be much appreciated, particularly from a Nokia-person.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Robin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>am truly sorry, but i do feel your pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the following are the rhetoric / cliche / typical / standard "reaction" for all your woes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. try hard reset</p>
<p>2. if doesn't work, take to nokia care point</p>
<p>3. they will repeat pt1; if doesn't work, they'll install a swap code and give it to you after 3 weeks. if they run low on cash, they will charge you a bomb even though you are on warranty, saying you messed it up.</p>
<p>4. the above they'll tell you after your repeated follow-up.</p>
<p>5. telephone nokia care line will not work either. if you are lucky, someone will come online, and will have the same complaint as you have. nothing works there either.</p>
<p>6. after repeated posting in this forum, someone will intervene and ask you for all the details that you have already been giving to several nokia people you've been contacting, like your imei number, product code, exact description of the problem, date
 of purchase etc. etc.</p>
<p>7. they will say they'll get back to you after contacting your local nokia care people.</p>
<p>8. you will post a reminder after 2 weeks.</p>
<p>9. they'll give you a list of numbers for you to contact locally.</p>
<p>10. and then you repeat from pt5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>believe me, i swear, the above is the exact summary of mine and my friends' personal experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>am not here to discourage you. some people who have "fought it over" by dragging nokia to consumer court etc have gotten justice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after going over from pt1 to pt10, if you still have the energy and motivation, you can try the last alternative.</p>

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in another attempt to rectify my microphone problem described already in this thread, I tried to reinstall Belle via Nokia Suite. I made a back up, then began the re-installation process. This begins by making another backup, which goes fine; but the
 next step fails each time with a message like "there was a problem connecting to the device". (I'm not sure of the exact wording in English). &nbsp; It suggests various fairly obvious remedies like reconnecting the device and restarting Nokia Suite, but these make
 no difference; the process fails at the same point each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The physical connection appears to be fine, as I am able to make a backup OK, and indeed the re-installation process itself begins by making another backup, which completes successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do here? Anybody from Nokia??&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

perhaps the firmware did not install properly. It is better to reinstall and ensure your phone battery is fully charged or keep the phone on charge while firmware is getting installed.

            Hi, try searching for system error clock in the "Search discussions" on the right.<br />
<br />
You will find many reports of problems after restoring from backup after an upgrade.<br />
<br />
You may have a application backed up that is messing up the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Try uninstalling some 3rd party apps, if you have any, and reboot the phone to see if it clears the problem.<br />
<br />
You should be able to identify which one is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
PS. If you do identify the issue, please help others by posting your findings back on this forum.<br />
<br />
Have fun.

    <title>Sheet ref in formula for cell in same sheet as formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich007a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sheet ref in formula for cell in same sheet as formula</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>First up, if this isn't already a widely reported issue, I'd be amazed, but it's one of those things where you just can't find the right thing to put into google...</p>
<p>In answering another post, I disovered that if you have a formula in Sheet1 that includes Sheet1! in a reference to a cell on Sheet1, it all goes wrong when you do a sort.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>On Sheet1</p>
<p>In cells A1:A6&nbsp;enter numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
<p>In cell B1 enter&nbsp; =Sheet1!A1</p>
<p>In cell C1 enter =SUM(B1)</p>
<p>Drag B1:C1 down to row 6.</p>
<p>We should now have this in A1:C6:</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6</p>
<p>Select cells A1:C6, Data tab &gt; Sort &gt; Sort by: Column C, Sort on:&nbsp;Values, Order: Largest to Smallest.&nbsp; In Excel 2007, I get this:</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6</p>
<p>and the cells now contain the following formulas:</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;=Sheet1!A6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B1)<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=Sheet1!A5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B2)<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=Sheet1!A4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B3)<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet1!A3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B4)<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet1!A2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B5)<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet1!A1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B6)<br />
</p>
<p>The formulae in column C&nbsp;are as expected, but in column B, the cells are acting like they contained absolute references, i.e. like this before sorting:</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;=$A$1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B1)<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=$A$2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B2)<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B3)<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B4)<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B5)<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=SUM(B6)</p>
<p>Sorting the above by col C produces exactly the same results, i.e. the formulas are now:</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=$A$6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B1)<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=$A$5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B2)<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B3)<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B4)<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B5)<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =$A$1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=SUM(B6)</p>
<p><br />
If you use the normal relative references (before sorting):</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;=A1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B1)<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=A2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B2)<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B3)<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B4)<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B5)<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=SUM(B6)</p>
<p>then when we sort col C ascending we get (after sorting):</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=A1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B1)<br />
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=A2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B2)<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B3)<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B4)<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SUM(B5)<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =A6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=SUM(B6)</p>
<p>as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Question 1]: So, is this something new to Excel 2007?&nbsp; Or has Excel always done this?</strong></p>
<p>(<em>A question you wont be able to answer: I this something I once knew and have since forgotten!?!?</em>) [bonus points available if you can answer that!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, why would you choose to use a Sheet reference like this in your formula?, I hear you ask.&nbsp; I wouldn't choose it, Excel chooses it for you!!!</p>
<p>Example, in Sheet1 cell B1, we need the formula&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet2!A1+A1</p>
<p>BUT, instead of typing it, we'll do this:</p>
<p>1) In Sheet1 B1, type&nbsp;&nbsp; =</p>
<p>2) Activate Sheet2, the formula bar now reads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet2!</p>
<p>3) Click in cell A1 (on the already selected Sheet2), the formula bar now reads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet2!A1</p>
<p>4) Press the + key, the formula bar now reads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet2!A1+</p>
<p>5) Activate Sheet1, the formula bar now reads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet2!A1+Sheet1!</p>
<p>6) Click in cell A1 (on the already selected Sheet1), the formula bar now reads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sheet2!A1+<strong>Sheet1!</strong>A1</p>
<p>Why doesn't it just say&nbsp; =Sheet2!A1+A1&nbsp;&nbsp; ????</p>
<p><strong>[Question 2]: I always thought that Excel was clever enough to remove such sheet references to cells in the same sheet as the formula.&nbsp; Is that something that has changed from 2007?!?</strong></p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>
<p><strong><em>[EDIT: Ok, I see the same behaviour in 2003. So it looks like this is just a nasty trap that Excel sets up, that unless you sort or copy and paste, or move cells around in some way, doesn't have any significant effects.&nbsp;
<u>Is there any valid reason why Excel does this</u>?&nbsp; i.e. is there any reason why MS couldn't get rid of this behaviour in a future version?]</em></strong></p>

    <title>Can I install this on multiple computers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I install this on multiple computers&#63;</h2>
                    I bought&nbsp;a laptop with Windows 8 preinstalled and I updated it to 8.1. My question is will this technical preview be my only free upgrade option or is there going to be a complete version available to me at a later time? I wanted to install this Technical
 Preview on a different computer like you suggested and when its ready to install on my main computer do that. Is that going to work?

            <p>This is not a free upgrade. This is a technical preview. As with the preview versions of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, you can expect that security updates and support will be discontinued when the Release To Manufacturing (RTM, essentially the final build)
 build is made. In addition, you can expect any machines that have the technical preview installed to enter a limited functionality mode. In this mode, the desktop background will be disabled, and the machine will forcibly restart every two hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Details about pricing are not finalized at this point,&nbsp;but, once again, this technical preview is not a free upgrade and&nbsp;will stop working when the&nbsp;RTM build is released.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Guys, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still after assistance for this one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been thinking and last time outlook worked was around one year ago, I was having trouble with it and followed instruction off the net to edit/delete stuff in the registry. I have forgotten what this was but I would suspect this is the cause of the
 issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically outlook does not remember my profile, as soon as I set it up and it is verified it does not 'save' for want of a better expression. It disapears from the list, outlook then tells me it needs to restart to make the changes work, and then I restart
 it and we begin the process again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help. Thunderbird is just not doing it for me. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone can and should have a Microsoft account. It is an email address and a password; it might be your primary email address, or it might be a Hotmail or Outlook.com address. (You can use the Hotmail or Outlook.com address for email, if you choose, but
 you don’t have to – you might only use it to log into other services.) The Microsoft account can be used to log into a Windows computer and it gives you access to online file storage with Skydrive, as well as a host of other services.<br />
<br />
 (either in Outlook or in webmail) and other Office 365 services. It may also be the account that’s associated with your business subscription to Microsoft Office. To change the access to your account, simply follow the steps provided on the article below:<br />
