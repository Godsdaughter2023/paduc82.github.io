    <title>Xbox One and Projector&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One and Projector&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>For many years I have enjoyed gaming on a 100" screen via my projector and Xbox360. I just can't imagine ever gaming on a TV.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a big believer in<strong> not</strong> buying new hardware when it first comes out. I have to problems waiting until all the issues are resolved, or even better - until the next generation comes out (Xbox One Elite?). However, I'm trying to prepare myself
 for the fact that I'm forced to upgrade to Xbox One due to games no longer playing on the Xbox 360.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched the internet up and down to find an answer on how to successfully connect an Xbox One to a projector and audio system (splitting audio and video), but not found a real answer. Most discussions are about making the Kinect work with a projector.
 I have no interest in the Kinect, I just want the Xbox One to work with a projector.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Questions:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>My Xbox and audio equipment is behind me on a shelf. <br />
<strong>Does the Xbox One work behind you if you don't use the Kinect?</strong>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>I have to be able to split audio and video (projector/audio system). <br />
<strong>Is there a way to replace the HDMI cable with a component cable?<br />
&nbsp;</strong> </li><li>When I transferred my gamertag to the Elite, my old Xbox got wiped, and I was no longer able to use it.<br />
<strong>If I transfer to Xbox One will I no longer to use my Xbox 360?</strong> </li></ol>
<p><br />
Any answers will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm using a projector now (I don't have an X1) If I am not mistaken there is an optical out, which is what I would be using to go into my older receiver. I think it's still limited to stereo only though. No 5.1 digital. If your projector doesn't take HDMI
 than your concerns are more than just audio</p>

<p>Thanks IceStorm. My projector has an HDMI in port, but if I use that, the sound would come from from the projector which is horrible. I want only the video to feed into the projector, the audio should feed into my stereo system (for theater sound effect).
 You can see my setup here: <br />

<p><br />
I will look into the HD Fury adapter. Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure that Kinect is not required. Everywhere I went it said that it is required for the Xbox One to function properly?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transfer instructions (via transfer cable) did warn that the hard drive will be wiped on the old console, and that the gamer tag can no longer be used on it. I did a lot of research before I did the transfer. I'm happy to hear that this is not the case
 with the transfer to Xbox One. So I assume you don't need a transfer cable for the Xbox One???</p>

<p>In regards to the video/audio split</p>
<p>Ideal scenario:</p>
<p>You have a newer receiver that accepts multiple HDMI inputs. Using HDMI this will allow the sound to run through the receiver first thus outputting sound there. Sure you'll have to mute the projector sound.</p>
<p>My setup:</p>
<p>An older receiver with optical inputs, but no HDMI. I bypass the receiver for all video using a small HDMI auto switching box ($10 on Amazon). Use the receiver for sound only, usually the optical. Since the HDMI box auto switches, there are no more steps
 to changing the source then if I had a newer receiver. The sound does travel through the HDMI still, but I just mute the projector.</p>
<p>This works great until I want to hook something up that has ONLY HDMI, such as the latest design for the Xbox 360. I would need some sort of contraption that splits the two, which I think are out there.</p>
<p>If your stereo/receiver doesn't accept optical...then you could try this</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>The Kinect is definitely not required for the console to run, I just checked with mine and I remember them saying they were going to get rid of that requirement before launch. The only thing you might want to have Kinect for is facial recognition for signing
 in, voice commands, and the Xbox One's interface was obviously meant to run side by side with Kinect from the way things are laid out.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player &#40;Desktop&#41; Missing after Windows 10 1511 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 N Pro.&nbsp; When I upgraded a few months ago from Windows 7, I had to download and install the Windows 10N feature media pack in order to get Windows Media Player.&nbsp;&nbsp; That worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I allowed Windows to upgrade to the 1511 and although it seemed to go fine, today I noticed that Media Player no longer seems to exist on my system.&nbsp; When I try to search for Media Player, the only one listed is my VLC Media Player (which is OK,
 but I prefer the MS Windows Media Player).&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the upgrade, both Media Player and VLC Media player were listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried re-downloading the Windows 10 media pack for Windows 10N (Windows10-KB3010081-x64.msu) and ran it.&nbsp; It claimed to install just fine but Media Player is still missing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now also tried running SFC /Scannow, but that is indicating that there are no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that "Media Center" is no longer available for Windows 10, but my understanding is that Windows "Media Player" is still available ( and the fact that I've had it installed and working on&nbsp;Windows 10 up until yesterday's 1511 update, sort of supports
 that.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, how can I get Media Player back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Just an update.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the Windows Media Player folder in the Program Files directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1511 update appears to have removed all of the files.&nbsp; The subfolders are still there, but they now are empty too.&nbsp; I backup my system a few times per week, so
 I was able to open up one of my backup sets and compare what I have now with what existed only a few days ago.&nbsp; A few days ago, before the 1511 update,&nbsp; the Windows Media Player folder contained all of the WMP related files.&nbsp; So it's clear that the Windows
 1511 update removed them.&nbsp; It also seems now that the Windows 10N Media Feature pack, although claiming that it installs WMP, is now not doing so, at least not with the 1511 version of Win 10. &nbsp; It may be installing other media related files, but it clearly
 isn't installing WMP like the MS (Windows 10N) web page says it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I know why WMP is missing ... because it *is missing*.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said above, VLC is OK, but it doesn't play MIDI files (which I have a lot of), and it's missing the thumbnail preview that WMP has.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm really hoping to find a way to get WMP reinstalled
 and working on my system.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, searching for Windows Media player does *not* find it.&nbsp; Furthermore, in my "Turn Windows Features On Or Off" section, there is no section named "Media Features".&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that's due to the fact that I'm running Windows 10 Pro N, which doesn't
 natively include the media features.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my original post,&nbsp; when I first upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate (N)&nbsp;to Windows 10 Pro N, I had to download the Windows 10 N Media Feature Pack and install it.&nbsp; That provided me with Windows Media Player.&nbsp;
 However, it seems that the 1511 Windows update has removed it.&nbsp; I tried downloading the feature media pack again and it claims it installed, but as I said in my follow-up message above, WMP is still missing.&nbsp; The Windows Media Player folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Since upgrade to 1511 teh media player is gone. </p>
<p>Reinstall of "media feature pack" doesn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beside the problem with media player, the program "Smart Switch" from SAMSUNG doesn't work either.
</p>
<p>Reinstall of "Smart Switch" ends with "You need to install, or re-install, the Windows Media Feature Pack".</p>
<p>I tryed again to install the feature pack, which ends in "package already installed".<br />

            <p>Hey Folks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated another thread but forgot to update this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a solution that works for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the 1511 Windows update *does* remove the Media Feature Pack if you have it installed.&nbsp; That's because the version that most of us had installed
 for Windows 10 N is no longer compatible with the 1511 release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, MS didn't make that clear.&nbsp; I found the updated Media Feature Pack ( KB3099229_x64.msu ) at the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49919</span></a></p>
<p>If you try installing the original Media Feature Pack for Windows 10 N ( Windows10-KB3010081-x64.msu ) it will appear as if it installed correctly (and will claim that it did so), but in reality, it will have installed
 nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I installed KB3099229_x64.msu, WMP reappeared, and a few other dependent applications of mine started working again too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I read somewhere (on another forum) that supposedly Microsoft has since updated the information on their website regarding the Media Feature Pack, but I haven't confirmed that.&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I now understand, they had the new version of the Feature Pack ready
 for the 1511 release, but things just weren't coordinated enough to get the message out properly.&nbsp; So apparently, many of us 'N' and 'K' users who adopted 1511 early, have had to find out the hard way.&nbsp; I've now since also seen one post on a forum from someone
 who claims&nbsp; 'KB3099229_x64.msu' isn't even&nbsp;working for them.&nbsp; So who really knows what's going on?&nbsp; All I can say is that it worked for me, and a few others that have posted success as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good Luck to All!</p>

            <p>Thanks so much, this helped me after i could find *nothing* at all online. What also annoys me is some of the boiler plate answers from MS support staff. I honestly seems to be the norm around here.</p>

<p>Hey Folks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated another thread but forgot to update this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a solution that works for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that the 1511 Windows update *does* remove the Media Feature Pack if you have it installed.&nbsp; That's because the version that most of us had installed
 for Windows 10 N is no longer compatible with the 1511 release.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, MS didn't make that clear.&nbsp; I found the updated Media Feature Pack ( KB3099229_x64.msu ) at the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49919</span></a></p>
<p>If you try installing the original Media Feature Pack for Windows 10 N ( Windows10-KB3010081-x64.msu ) it will appear as if it installed correctly (and will claim that it did so), but in reality, it will have installed nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I installed KB3099229_x64.msu, WMP reappeared, and a few other dependent applications of mine started working again too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have exactly the same sympoms since upgrading from WIndows 7 to WIndows 10 N Pro - Windows Media Player directories empty and as expected no Media Features to activate.&nbsp; Installed Media Feature Pack KB3010081 but despite successful installation no WMP.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Unfortunately the above link to another Media Feature Pack KB3099229 appears to be broken - does anyone have the latest link?<br />

    <title>MLB.TV app problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loomis360  say:</h3>
<h2>            MLB.TV app problem</h2>
                    
<p>The first problem is on the game scores screen. I never see the team logos. Every scoreboard item just has a white box where the team logo should be. &nbsp;The current score is correct but I have no idea what the teams are.&nbsp;The only way to know which game I want
 is to look for the favorite star in the corner.</p>
<p>Then, when I select the game it starts to go through the motions correctly. I choose the game and which broadcast I want to watch like normal, then it just goes to a black screen. Once or twice I hit the back button and it takes me back to the scoreboard
 screen and the game is playing in the window above the score, but when I click on it to go fullscreen again it just goes back to the black screen.</p>
<p>(note: I just tried it on yesterdays game and it also went to the black screen, but while I was typing this the game eventually started. It took a few minutes, though. I will try that with the live feed tonight. It still is odd that it took so long to start.)</p>
<p>I still have a 360 and have been using the MLB app on that instead, but in the past few weeks that app is giving me an error message that the mlb servers are down. I end up watching the game on my computer at that point, which is usually my least favorite
 option.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I am still not able to actually get to a game in the Xbox One MLB app. I let it sit at the black screen for probably five minutes until it finally kicked itself back to the scoreboard screen. No video was playing in the scoreboard view. When I tried
 to select the game again it asked me to choose a feed and then it just stayed at the scoreboard screen and didn't even try to go to a black screen or anything.</p>

<p>I have the same problem with the stream blacking out multiple times during games.</p>

<p>It is working right now! I believe I even have team logos, although I am afraid to go back to the scoreboard screen to check. Fingers crossed that it continues. I even have popular footage from mlb.com during commercials!</p>
<p>EDIT: Well, it worked for 5 innings and then I got greedy and tried to snap the app and play a game. Now it is doing the same thing it always did before: black screen and no logos on the scoreboard.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem when using Windows 10 Settings, then Accounts, then Family &amp; other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I watched a few videos on YouTube, they were using Windows 10, &nbsp;and they showed using the method you would have used in previous versions of Windows, that is go into the Control Panel (not Windows 10 Settings)&nbsp;and select User Accounts and delete the User
 Account in question.&nbsp; It also deletes the user accounts files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the new Windows 10 method doesn't do what you want it to, try the older Windows methods.</p>

            <p>Just upgraded my wife's laptop to win 10 from win 7. In trying to access emails from the start bar I inadvertently signed up to a Windows account using my name and my own email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my wife's Name as the programme administrator(in Win7 ) is gone and only my name and a request for my password comes up when the laptop is switched on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want, and need to get back to what happened just after I had loaded Win10, namely it switches on with no request for a name or a password!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This impasses situation came about when I was trying to load my 2003 Office programme which Microsoft said was "incompatible" with Win 10(hence my original clicking on the "email" App on the start button screen. However now that I have an unwanted logon
 to Windows Account, I find that I have been able to access my 2003 Word, Excel and Outlook programs........so much for Microsoft saying that OFFICE 2003&nbsp;is incompatible!!!!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feeling is that if I delete this Microsoft Account I should be back to the original situation where my wife's name comes up at switch on and she remains as the "administrator" of&nbsp;the Win10 programme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please advise with some measure of authority that this will work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I was quite happy with my first superficial look at Win 10 after it was loaded. There did not seem to be the same "locked" files that show up throughout Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cut my teeth on Win for Workgroups and then Xp which was simple to use (as a sole user), and could be added to with additional "protections for business use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft appears to have, since then, tried to be all things to everyone through one programme, but in doing so have created an unwieldy, overly complicated prog that is just a step too far!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an engineer there has been an old saying around for decades........it is, if it aint broke, don't fix it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, as a last question, if I wind back to Win 7, would I still qualify for a Win10 free upgrade, if this is the only way to go back to where I was just after loading Win10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustratingly,</p>
<p>George(Georigg).</p>

            <p>from my previous post of 8-16-2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had the same problem when using Windows 10 Settings, then Accounts, then Family &amp; other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I watched a few videos on YouTube, they were using Windows 10, &nbsp;and they showed using the method you would have used in previous versions of Windows, that is go into the Control Panel (not Windows 10 Settings)&nbsp;and select User Accounts and delete the User
 Account in question.&nbsp; It also deletes the user accounts files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So if the new Windows 10 method doesn't do what you want it to, try the older Windows methods.</p>

<p>You do not have to reinstall drivers when updating from SP1 to SP2.</p>
<p>The best place to get drivers is the manufacturer of the computer or&nbsp;its components or the manufacturer of any equipment you have added. There's no great need to update drivers if everything is working.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ernie,<br />
<br />
The idea is to get everyone migrated to the new system. Those who are still using the older version may continue to do so, until they deem it necessary to make that move. However, once the upgrade offer has been accepted, there is no way of reverting.
<br />
<br />

    <title>No sound in windows 10 and No help from Microsoft. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donstewartzs  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound  in windows 10 and No help from Microsoft.</h2>
                    <p>On Aug. 28 Microsoft downloaded one of their windows 10 cumulative updates and I have had no sound since then , despite three Realtek driver updates and an impressive amount of folks saying they cleared their sound problem by going to device manager , deleting
 the sound river there and letting windows reinstall the latest drivers. No matter how many times I try this when windows 10 restarts the sound icon always has the red X on it and my machine does not play Any Sounds!!.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY question that goes with this Rant <em>IS: Is Microsoft going to fix this no sound problem and When? If there is an answer to this please respond. If not continued silence will be greatly appreciated.</em></p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned in the original post about the cumulative update being installed, I suggest you to uninstall that update, restart the device and check if you are able to access sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the rollback option is grayed out, it tells that you do not have older version of drivers being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the below and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Steps to install the pending updates</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Connect to the internet.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key and type <strong>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Also, you can install Windows 8/8.1 drivers in compatibility mode if there are no Windows 10 compatible drivers.

<h2>            Signing in and out - multiple accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work with two accounts and always, when signing out of one, I need to re-enter my username and password for the other. Then I sign out and play the same game in reverse! Is there a way to enable the initial sign in screen to REMEMBER both accounts? It
 says +Account but that means nothing<br />
<br />
All hlep appreciated and thanks in advance</p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible yet to switch between two accounts within the same app without typing in the&nbsp;username and password. Nonetheless, you may use two instances of the Skype app&nbsp;by&nbsp;launching Skype from Microsoft Store (Application version 14) and stand alone
 Skype for Desktop (version 8)&nbsp;instead to manage two accounts at the same time. You can install both the Skype app from the Microsoft Store and the standalone Skype app through this link:
<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may sign in with your main account using the Skype app for Windows 10 and sign in the other on the standalone app using the link above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further inquiries&nbsp;or clarifications. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked with Dell, they list this computer as Windows 7 compatible.&nbsp; Their tech support said the chip drivers control the firewire port and are Windows 7 compliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sure would be easier to provide this information if Windows would let you cut and paste text from the control panel and device manager panels.&nbsp; Microsoft also blocks cut and paste from error message windows -- all these contain important information needed
 to get help solving problems.&nbsp; One wonders what possible reason yuo can't copy the data into a note about the problem.</p>

<p>I tried installing some drivers from Comcast.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to install them in "compatibility mode" I just used the hardware device manager.&nbsp; It did not resolve the problem .&nbsp; This worked from Wndows XP and I didn't need to install anything.&nbsp; I don't
 think this could be called an answer, its more like its broke, so tell them we don't support it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firewire is for some video sources the only method to transfer to/from your computer. In fact, by law all digital cable boxes must provide live firewire output, so what good is that if Windows 7 stopped supporting it?</p>
<p>My cousin has a MacBook, I'll ask to stop by just to make sure the video is still flowing out of the port.&nbsp; Geez, am I going to have switch?</p>

<br />
This question has been here for 3 years with no answer.&nbsp; I see no response from you in this thread for all that time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Your solution was posted in a different thread about a different firewire problem over a year later.&nbsp; How would anybody on this thread know it?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Although your idea might work for this issue, I sold that computer over a year ago.&nbsp; None of my current systems have a firewire port,&nbsp; So I can't verify your idea would solve this particular problem.
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
However, I still have an interest in capturing from that device.&nbsp; So, if I get a firewire port down the road, I'll give your idea a try.&nbsp; If it works for me I'll give you a "helpful" vote at that time.

<h2>            Voice chat - other users can hear my system sounds when using external headset</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When voice chatting using my headset any program or service, others can hear all the sounds my Surface Book 2 makes including music, games and system sounds. They can hear it so clearly it's as if it's coming from their own PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally under microphone options there should be an option called "Acoustic Echo Cancellation" that fixes this issue, but that is missing on the Surface Book 2. The only option is "Noise Cancellation" and that doesn't do anything. If I install the Realtek
 v2.82 driver from Realtek's website then the option for Echo Cancellation comes up and the issue is solved. But Windows Update then keeps trying to overwrite the driver with it's own causing that option to disappear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please fix this!! Annoying!</p>

    <title>App wont open in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertmclean_821  say:</h3>
<h2>            App wont open in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have searched the web and this site and found problems similar to mine but not quite the same.</p>
<p>I am NOT asking about apps from the STORE.&nbsp; Also this is not the problem with opening apps from the start menu as opposed to opening from the task bar etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I am not sure I have selected the correct category.&nbsp; I am&nbsp; not sure what is meant by a Windows 10 app, what I have is a 3rd party app that runs on Windows.&nbsp; It is not supplied with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My situation is this :</p>
<p>Installed my free Windows 10 August 1.</p>
<p>Windows 10 release : I see this information requested by many people responding to questions but I am not sure where to find this, on my Updates screen it gives me this info
</p>
<p>Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081704)</p>
<p>Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074686)</p>
<p>Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074678)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tying to use a program called Chess Openings Wizard.&nbsp; Used it all the time on Windows 7 and earlier versions on XP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I try to launch it from the Start menu, or from File Explorer, the same thing happens.</p>
<p>An icon shows up on the task bar, just like any other app does.&nbsp; But nothing happens after that.</p>
<p>When I hover my mouse over the icon a miniature preview ( not sure what the technical term for this is, thumbnail perhaps ?)</p>
<p>shows up with the opening screen for the app.&nbsp; But I cant get it to show up on the desk top or click on it or do anything with it.&nbsp; The icon just sits there on the task bar doing nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I believe the app is running in the sense that I can click on the TaskView button and see the preview there.&nbsp; But I cant click on it and do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that unlike some other similar posts I have seen my app does not flash momentarily, is not from the Store, and shows this same behaviour no matter where I launch it from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had time to test all my applications yet but so far this is the only one showing this behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Robert.</p>

            <p>Vanessa</p>
<p>thanks for your reply</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; So far as I know the only app affected is "Chess Openings Wizard".&nbsp; I have not had time yet to run every program I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. None of the other apps I have tried yet has this problem.&nbsp; But I have not had time yet to test everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I tried the Windows compatibility trouble shooter, which suggested settings for previous version of Windows, run as administrator, change screen size and colours, all of which I tried and none made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I am not trying to download or install any updates.&nbsp; I listed those updates because they are what my settings say I already have.&nbsp; I have noticed on many replies to problems on forums like this the responders will ask for the version or build of the
 Windows being used.&nbsp;I searched through Settings, but&nbsp;I could not find where my build is listed, all I could find was a list of updates already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later when testing another app I went into its help file and it listed system information.&nbsp; Among the items listed was operating system build which it gave as 10.0.10240 build 10240.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, where&nbsp;would I find my build version in Windows 10 ?&nbsp; I realize I know what it is now, but for any one else reading this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I did try compatibility mode, it made no difference. ( Item 3 in my August 4 post )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone back to Windows 7 some time ago, I actually forgot about this post, I had so many other problems with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it worked right, which it didn't, I really don't like the look and feel of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very happy with Windows XP, I can live with Windows 7, but I found the Windows 10 experience just awful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying though.</p>

            <p>In case anyone cares, I have the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, it has to do with changing monitor configs. It works fine in one, but when I switch to the other (outside office vs. home office) the app is running either minimized or off screen and cant' be returned to the screen. &nbsp;I've tried the &lt;win&gt;&lt;arrow&gt;
 option normally recommended for this sort of thing, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it's some sort of bug, probably with the app, but who knows.</p>

<p><span><span>The usual culprit is some (poorly&nbsp;designed) antivirus software that has deleted or quarantined the Windows Session Manager file:</span></span></p>
<p><span>c:\windows\system32\smss.exe</span></p>
<p><span>I suppose it could have been really infected and quarantined, but that has never been my experience. &nbsp;It is usually just deleted in error.</span></p>
<p><span>What antivirus software are you running and did you just use it prior to this incident?</span></p>
<p><span>You will not boot XP without the file, but you can replace it in just a few minutes by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a genuine bootable XP installation CD or make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD yourself.</span></p>
<p><span>After getting into Recovery Console then we can see if the file is missing and replace it if needed, or do additional troubleshooting if needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD when no XP media is available by following&nbsp;the directions in this link:</p>
<p><strong>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic276527.html</strong></p>
<p>When you get Recovery Console going, return and let me know and receive further instructions.</p>

<p>It would be good to know what AV software is acting up so we can straighten it out or replace it.</p>
<p>The usual culprit for this message is a missing or quarantined:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\smss.exe</p>
<p>That file should not be missing, so if it is - or if it is even even&nbsp;suspicious, use the&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;Console to&nbsp;replace it from the c:\windows\system32\dllcache folder by executing the following commands from the Recovery Console prompt (you should be in the
 C:\WINDOWS) folder after booting RC, right?).</p>
<p>(XP has copies of most of your important system files in c:\windows\system32\dllcache...)</p>
<p>From the RC prompt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cd system32</p>
<p>copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\smss.exe</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should get a&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;copied message. &nbsp;If asked to replace the existing file, respond in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, other files are missing, so first replace the smss.exe and see how that goes with a regular boot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have the problem, boot back into RC and repeat the copying process for these files:</p>
<p><strong>lsasrv.dll</strong></p>
<p><strong>ntdll.dll&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Once booted, I would review your antivirus strategy.</p>

            Hi Jose... I have the above problem with my Dell XPS. I am running Trend Micro AV on my system. I followed all the directions above and on th esubsequent web pages and when i insert the CD with the recovery disc my screen goes directly to the safe mode
 screen. I have selected ALL the available boot options and the screen ALWAYS goes back to the session3initialize failed screen and freezes up.&nbsp; Any further instructions?&nbsp; Thanks you very Much!&nbsp;

<p>You will never fix it unless you boot the XP Recovery Console (or unless you reinstall XP from scratch)</p>
<p>This is not the same as a recovery CD that may have come with your computer.</p>

<p>You do not create a bootable CD by copying the ISO file to it.</p>
<p>Creating a bootable CD is not just copying some files to the CD.</p>
<p>The tutorial refers you to the ImgBurn site where you can download their free, quick and easy software (in case you don't have any CD burning software).</p>
<p>I like ImgBurn because it is easy and plays a happy tune when it is successful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try uninstalling the game and re-install it in&nbsp;compatibitlity mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>a. <strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>setup file (setup.exe for the game)</strong> and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
<br />
b. Now <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Compatibility tab</strong> and <strong>
check the box</strong> which says <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for.<br />
</strong><br />
c. <strong>Select</strong> <strong>Windows XP (Service Pack 3).</strong> Click <strong>
Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
d. Now <strong>right click</strong> the<strong> setup file</strong> and <strong>select Run as Administrator</strong> and
<strong>follow the normal installation procedure</strong>. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check to see if you can use the program now.<br />
<br />
<span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></div>

            <p>Thank you, but ... I did uninstall the old game, reinstalled it, .... long story short
</p>
<p>I was hoping to bring attention to MS to game LOTRO for purpose of them alinging their updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did work before with win7 64bit Dx11. But both game and MS updated, and poof, I could not access the game.&nbsp; I have it now again under compatibility mode with Dx9.&nbsp; But its not utilizing my</p>
<p>graphics.... it was higher quality before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated the DIsplay cards software to latest, but for now I wil be dealing with lower quality.</p>
<p>Observation when many softare updates are released.&nbsp; Not all consequences are knowable, and things fall off the table at times. This time the enjoyment of said game for now.</p>

</div>
I followed the query re&nbsp; Hiding some windows updates that won't update on their own
<div><br />
</div>
<div>that dealt with a similar problem with Vista. I got as far as Step 3 which was to open Windows update and select the relevant faulty updates, but I couldn't find the 'Hide' or 'Do not show again' button. &nbsp;Grateful for info on how to use this feature in

            Regrettably, although I followed to the letter your above links, I am still getting the 8 updates repeatedly offered, even though Update History reports successful installation.
<div>&nbsp; Problem is that Windows thinks the updates&nbsp;were&nbsp;successful, and then on restart finds out they are not there, and (Despite not having received any error codes)I went through the procedure provided in link 2 to repair NET.4 and although some of the steps
 were different in my Windows 7 Pro (there is no Add/Remove Programs in the Control&nbsp;Panel&nbsp;et al.), I seemed to have&nbsp;accomplished&nbsp;the repair, and on reinstalling the updates after restart, I found they were being offered yet again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; I did notice while taking the steps outlined in link 1 that searching the windows directory resulted in file not found when I tried several of the update KB numbers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried &nbsp;MS Fix it 50123 and 50202 as advised but these fix nothing.</div>
<br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Any more ideas?</div>

<p>Tengo una Xbox 360 y quiero actualizarme a la One. El caso es que
 de la Xbox 360 tengo el Kinect&nbsp; y el Volante con los pedales. Mi 
pregunta es:&nbsp; ¿con la One puedo seguir utilizando estos periféricos con 
todas sus funcionalidades o no es compatible?.</p>



<p>¿Los juegos de la 360 son compatibles con la One o no?</p><p><br /></p><p>Un saludo<br /></p>

 support for Windows 10.&nbsp; We have a program that allows us to pass through the web cam to our virtual machines, so that is not an issue.&nbsp; Are there any Windows 7 supported web cams that will work for Windows 10 Hello?

<p>Hi Jared,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as the camera has an illuminated IR sensor, you will be able to use <strong>
Windows Hello</strong>. To be sure, we recommend that you contact the original equipment manufacturer of the webcam that you would want to use. Ask them if their product supports
<strong>Windows Hello</strong>, and if it would work with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance with your concern.</p>
