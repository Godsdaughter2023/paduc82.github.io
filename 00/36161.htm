<h2>            Setting up our account on a pre-owned Xbox One w&#47;Madden bundle</h2>
                    <p>Hi, we just bought a pre-owned Xbox One w/Madden 18 bundle.&nbsp; When we turned on the console the previous owner's profile icon/screen name displays in the upper left side.&nbsp; We were able to successfully set up a new account using our Microsoft credentials; however, when we returned to the console home screen and changed the settings to our newly created profile, we no longer had access to Madden 18.&nbsp; In order to play the game, we changed the console settings back to the original owner's profile.&nbsp; Then, once we were playing Madden, we were able to somehow access the in-game settings and switch profiles to our account without any issue.&nbsp; But, the overall Xbox console is still showing the previous owner's profile.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this makes sense.&nbsp; We need some help as to how to delete the previous owner's account info but still have access to Madden.&nbsp; Any help/feedback is most appreciated.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Digital content like that goes with the accounts so if you delete the previous owners profile from the xbox then you will lose access to the game and if the previous owner has access to that account and downloads it to a different xbox one and makes the new xbox one their home console then you would loose access to the game also. which if you currently do not have access to the game without the original profile being signed in then your console is not set as the home console. </p><p><br /></p><p>so basically since its a digitally purchased game that the license for the game goes with the profile that purchased it then you would need to purchase the game on your profile to have access to it at all times.</p>

<h2>            Windows RT 8.1 compatibility with Samsung Bluetooth Keyboard.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Windows RT 8.1 tablet and I was told by the store I bought it off, that the Samsung Bluetooth Keyboard would work with the tablet but it hasn't. I was wondering why this was.</p>
<p>I've tried connecting it through the Bluetooth settings and even the 'Add a device' settings but nothing on the tablet seems to pick up the signal from the keyboard.
</p>
<p>Is this a brand problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help, that would be great. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>I am unable to install my video drivers because I have an issue with the driver for PCI Express standard Root Port. It reports the error below. I need a fix for this so I can load the drivers. Right now, I have standard video with the card but I can't load

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><strong>Code 12 refers to: </strong>The device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. If you want to use this device, you will need to disable one of the other devices on this system.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Cause for this error: </strong>This error can occur if two devices that are installed on your computer have been assigned the same I/O ports, the same interrupt, or the same Direct Memory Access channel (either by the BIOS, the operating
 system, or both). This error message can also appear if the BIOS did not allocate enough resources to the device.
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">BIOS Disclaimer:</span><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings

<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Recommended resolution: </strong>You can use the Troubleshooting Wizard in Device Manager to determine where the conflict is, and then disable the conflicting device.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disable the conflicting device</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>a. On the device Properties dialog box, click the <strong>General</strong> tab.

<h2>            retrival of digital locker</h2>
                    In 2007 I upgraded from Vista home basic to Vista home premium online and the link was placed in the windows digital locker. I went to retrive the link after my computer&nbsp; crashed to find out that microsoft closed the digital locker. I have since called
 microsoft about retriving the link and have been transferred to 9 different departments of microsoft without any closure. Does anyone have any idea how to retrive the link I need?

<p>Hey there Nikolai!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Been there . </p>
<p>That refund request link should work. </p>
<p><span><span>After
 submitting the request, you’ll be sent an email on whether or not it was approved or denied.
</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>This
</span></span><span><span>followup</span></span><span><span>email
 you will receive is the only means to get in contact with the refund department directly and will be the only means of you disputing the verdict as well.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If and when you get a chance, give it a shot and let us know how that helped. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            OneDrive conflicting with Carbonite</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I've used Carbonite for years with no problem, but since moving to Windows 10 was having real problems with Carbonite getting stuck part way, etc.. Have been told that this is because it conflicts with OneDrive. I wasn't even aware that I was using OneDrive,
 and don't particularly want to do so, as I have no need for document-sharing and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it looks as if OneDrive has been 'kidnapping' all sorts of files and folders and, when I try to copy the item and move it back to a desktop folder, the system just keeps saying 'Copying from OneDrive to OneDrive'&nbsp; How do I stop this happening, and
 how can I save things where I know they can be properly backed-up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            If it's any reassurance I've had my 15+ gb of User folders (Desktop, Documents, pictures, etc) rooted in OneDrive from each one's Properties &gt; Location tab for years and never lost a file.  I do the same thing with Google drive so I have redundancy.  It's also great to be able to pull up a file on my phone or on another PC via the web whenever and wherever I am.   
<br />
<br />But if you don't want to choose Desktop, Documents or Pictures User folders to sync in real time to OneDrive via Folder Protection in the Autosave settings per the tutorial I provided, then yes you can drag or copy any folders you want backed up into the OneDrive folder.  The only drawback is that it now lives in the OneDrive folder instead of Documents, Desktop, etc.  But you can send a shortcut to one of those from right click menu if you want.

    <title>USB Devices Not showing up in Windows Explorer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> princefarrar  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Devices Not showing up in Windows Explorer.</h2>
                    <p>Ever since i bought this new Laptop [Windows 8.1 64 bit] it has only been able to detect certain USB devices, like my mouse, keyboard, my Phone, and "certain Hard disks", not all of them, only certain hard disks. But it REFUSES to to show any of the USB
 Pen drives i've tried using on this laptop. I have tried so many, at first i thought it was the pen drive being faulty, but after having tested over 15 different pen drives, which work on other computers and laptops, i think its safe to say the fault is in
 my Driver Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did go to Device Manager, and my Pendrive [HP v220w 16 Gb], shows us there with a YELLOW exclamation mark right next to it, as you can see in the image below, under other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b23d8a0d-c4e1-4d87-b28c-3b9ea24546da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b23d8a0d-c4e1-4d87-b28c-3b9ea24546da" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked it up and tried to find solutions for it online. I've tried updating the driver software, but it tells me there is no update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f734a7db-c578-4183-b817-e2087b962ec1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f734a7db-c578-4183-b817-e2087b962ec1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried hardware and sound troubleshoot and it doesn't seem to fix this problem it says " v220w doesn't have a driver"
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10b0551f-364a-4878-963c-3ae2f5f4f27a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10b0551f-364a-4878-963c-3ae2f5f4f27a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the driver software, and as soon as i plug it back it, it re installs it,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83993769-a07e-4f9a-baf7-cb0aba21c995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83993769-a07e-4f9a-baf7-cb0aba21c995" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it doesn't show up, and it goes back to where it started, with the yellow mark again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e24e088-db0a-4bc8-9b1e-dd111f4ed698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e24e088-db0a-4bc8-9b1e-dd111f4ed698" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, under the "Universal Serial Bus controllers"&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find "USB Mass storage driver" which everyone else has apparently. Where do i get this driver? And will installing it help this time? Or will it go back to the usual of ignoring my pen drive? :/ i've been trying for so many days now guys, i would
 really love it if i could find a solution to this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Apparantly, clicking on the pen drive with the yellow mark-&gt; update driver software-&gt; select from computer-&gt; list of drivers-&gt; and select disk drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will install the USB Mass storage Driver. Apparently so. Well this is a relief.</p>

<p>I assume you meant to post this in the beta forums.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You can actually access SmartGlass right now even if you aren't in the Xbox Live Beta program. Just download the Windows 8 RTM 90 free version.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Note: The version included in the RTM is not the final version of SmartGlass. </p>

<p>Not very helpful, unfortunately. I have the same question, and I'm wondering why there's no Smartglass for iOS, yet. The web page says it's already on the Xbox Companion, but that's total bull. The Smartglass app is supposed to allow pinch and drag and all
 that. That was supposed to be the whole point of never having a browser on Xbox: the control interface was inadequate, so they came up with Smartglass. How can I "beta test" the IE app if the control interface that was supposedly created for that express purpose
 is not yet available? Isn't that the ENTIRE purpose of a "beta test"? &nbsp;Gimme a break..... &nbsp;I guess you'll have to forgive me for operating in the world of logic and reason.

<p>As far as I know of, the SmartGlass apps will not be available until later this year when Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 are released. &nbsp;I just checked the apps for both the Xbox and my Windows Phone 7 device but there are not any apps relating to SmartGlass,
 only the Xbox Live Companion app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, the beta access does have an option in the 'Console Settings' to allow for SmartGlass under the 'Connected Devices' section. &nbsp;As of right now, it allowed my Companion app to connect with my mobile and xbox.</p>

<p>OK, So I have Smart Glass... Now what. I also picked up Forza Horizon today which is supposed to support Smart Glass, but how do you actually use it. Been fiddling for hours now and nothing... Just general game information... Any ideas?</p>

4. Done! You can now run iTunes normally. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdiscussions.apple.com%2f4.5.6%2fimages%2femoticons%2fhappy.gif" /><br />
<br />
Altho, I dont think Win8 is fully compatible with Itunes. It may install but some people cant sync<br />

<h2>            Wired and wireless network adapters experiencing problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello, :) I recently installed windows 10 on my old Toshiba Satellite A200 - AH9 which was running on Linux &nbsp;"Ubuntu 10.04" Operating System; however, prior to that OS the PC was first running on Windows vista.
</p>
<p>I did the Windows 10 installation by booting from a bootable usb drive which had the "Windows Media Creation Tool" on it. The problem is that I now can't access any wired or wireless networks, and the troubleshooter only indicates that the need to be fixed,
 &nbsp;I also tried getting the updated drivers from the manufacturer's website via another computer and installed it on my Toshiba but they still did not work :'(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, as i am now out of options and I can't develop anything without my windows OS, I would be honored.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers for a specific device needs to be checked if those would be compatible as well with Windows 10. It would be best to contact the manufacturer of the device to have the specific driver for your computer for your network adapters for your issue to be
 resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and if you have other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

The term<br />"memory" is used to refer to the place where the computer holds the<br />program and data it is working with at the moment.

    <title>Failure to Reset PIN and Windows Hello in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jiazhou shen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to Reset PIN and Windows Hello in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The face recognition and PIN confidential&nbsp;in my surface book does not work well so I removed Windows Hello profile and also my PIN in the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to reset them but nothing changes after I add a new PIN or set up Windows Hello. The system accept my input. However, it still offers only the password sign-in option and there is neither PIN added nor face recognition added in the settings tab even
 if I restart my PC. This really drives me crazy. Can&nbsp;anyone help me to solve this problem? Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p><b>Forced gamertag change</b></p>
<p>When a forced gamertag change (name change) is imposed, you are prompted to select a new gamertag the next time that you try to sign in to Xbox LIVE. This step cannot be skipped. You must select a new gamertag before you can sign in.</p>
<p>A forced gamertag change is imposed when a gamertag is determined to be inappropriate by the Xbox LIVE Enforcement Team. Examples of inappropriate gamertags include names that visually resemble, sound like, represent, hint at, abbreviate, or insinuate any
 of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profane words or phrases </li><li>Topics or content of a sexual nature </li><li>Hate speech (including but not limited to racial, ethnic, or religious slurs)
</li><li>Unlawful drugs or controlled substances </li><li>Unlawful activities </li></ul>

<p>Why do you really want to install it on your flash drive? Just put the game in and play the game. You need some storage for your profile etc so putting all the space up for halo is not a good idea. It is not like a pc where you have to install a game, just
 put the game in and select play. I dont know how big the game is but i guess your flash drive is to small. Just keep your storage for other purposes, its only 4GB...</p>

    <title>OG Gamertag Promotion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xbroyal  say:</h3>
<h2>            OG Gamertag Promotion</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, Ive had my eye on the gamertag 'Lugia' for a substantial amount of time at this point, and was very happy to hear about the gamertag deactivation hoping that I could get the account.</p>

<p>2 hours into the promotion the account that previously had the GT Lugia was changed to a default account which I was very happy about, but at that point I still could not claim the gamertag, so I assumed it would have to be released at somepoint during the
 promotion, so during the 24 hour period I slaved at my computer checking availability for the GT, and to my displeasure it never became available, and went unclaimed throughout the promotion.</p>

<p>Knowing that it was still unclaimed but unreleased, I continued to check the GT for the next two days up until now. And now I find that a new account was made specifically to hold the gamertag earlier today while I could not be at my computer. The account
 is a fresh new account that has no activity at all, other than the name change and the adding of 2 friends,&nbsp;presumably the person holding the account.</p>

<p>I find it extremely frustrating that this could have happened, as a loyal gold member since 2008 that should have been able to receive the gamertag that Ive always wanted, and after speaking to multiple support members, I was told to come here for help.
 The account should not have qualified for the loyalty requirements set, but as it was seemingly released after the 24 hours promotion period he would not have had to meet the requirements. However my support member has said that there should have been no reason
 as to why It should not have been released during the promotion, and&nbsp;no reason as to why I shouldn't have been able to claim it.</p>

<p>Anyone help? As I find it extremely frustrating that I slaved away for so long, to have someone sit and hold the gamertag on an inactive account, which ompletely goes against the reason the loyalty requirements were even set in place to start with.</p>

<h2>            My Keyboard&#39;s Media Controls Won&#39;t Work. . .</h2>
                    The media controls on above the keyboard on my studio laptop won't work.&nbsp; They worked perfectly when I bought the computer, my husband used it once and now they won't work at all.&nbsp; He swears he didn't touch them, but I can't figure out what's wrong or
 why they won't work.&nbsp; Is there a way to turn them on or off?&nbsp; I can't find any answers or any problems close to this anywhere.

            Hello BlindLB,<br />
<br />
Thank&nbsp;you for your post.&nbsp; Try shutting down your computer (giving it about 30 seconds) then take out the battery (for another 30 seconds).&nbsp; Then put the battery back in and power up.&nbsp; Please let us know if this did or didn't help you to resolve this issue.<br />

            Hi Debra -

Please see this guide to Microsoft Family Safety features in Windows 10 by my colleague MVP Andre DaCosta:  https://www.groovypost.com/howto/setup-family-safety-windows-10/

If Google Chrome will not cooperate with Family Safety then  you may want to uninstall it and use a compatbile browser until he is of age.  Your acting as Admin of the PC with him as a Standard User will require any changes to have your approval as long as you don't share your password.

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.       
        </p>

    <title>Windows PhotoViewer vs Photo Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulfrocchi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows PhotoViewer vs Photo Gallery</h2>
                    <p>Am going crazy with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photo viewer is seeming to compress the overall blacks on my 'overly' dark images.</p>
<p>Granted these images are clipping in the blacks, but when displayed in both Lightroom and now with Photo Gallery, ONLY the clipped portions are black, black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to post images to social sites, who ALSO will compress the images, the images are just awful.</p>
<p>Attached are screen shots. &nbsp;Same file. &nbsp;One displaying in Gallery, one in Viewer.</p>
<p>(Gallery matches Lightroom and Photoshop in brightness levels)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm just not sure what to trust.</span> &nbsp;Especially if I need to send srgb/jpgs to print services online.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Communities Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be glad to give you the information about the issue you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a slight difference in the rendering of photos because&nbsp; different application like photo viewer and photo gallery use the their own pixel definition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<div>what file format are you using? do you see the same clipping with both jpeg and</div>
<div>png? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>there are so many factors here, but I wouldn't use either Microsoft Photos or</div>
<div>Photo Gallery for critical photographic needs - these are consumer level</div>
<div>products. Lightroom and Photoshop also should let you experiment with monitor</div>
<div>calibration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>as for posting to social sites, yes, most do use compression, some more than</div>
<div>others. not that I'm a pro photographer, but I find that Viewbug offers the</div>
<div>least compression and you can upload large jpgs out of lightroom.</div>
