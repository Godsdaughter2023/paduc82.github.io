<h2>            Windows 10 Home&#58; INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</h2>
                    <p>I had issues with Windows Store so I did a clean reset and at 99% the power got cut off and upon restarting I received&nbsp;INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only ISO I have now is a&nbsp;Windows10_InsiderPreview_x32_EN-GB_10162.iso on another machine (even this one fails to operate on both CD and USB - or maybe I am not smart enough to handle an .iso file) as I keep on getting bootmgr missing so I am in limbo
 with this situation and even on this machine which still pending full Windows 10 download using Media Creation Tool (which also sucks as it keeps restarting from 0% every time the machine goes off due to overheating)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly assist!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have original Windows 7 Home Premium CD and key but it doesn't boot anymore after the upgrade to Windows 10 was made!</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with the startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time. Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE bug check has a value of 0x0000007B. This bug check indicates that the Microsoft Windows operating system has lost access to the system partition during startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Cause</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE bug check frequently occurs because of a boot device failure. During I/O system initialization, the boot device driver might have failed to initialize the boot device (typically a hard disk). File system initialization
 might have failed because it did not recognize the data on the boot device. Also, repartitioning the system partition or installing a new SCSI adapter or disk controller might induce this error.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1. I suggest you to try the&nbsp;steps provided by,&nbsp;in the link below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>wifi adapter has completely disappeared from Network Adapter-Only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            wifi adapter has completely disappeared from Network Adapter-Only broadband adapter showing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help. I am senior who helps other seniors in this small town keep their pc ‘s operating as best I can.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP laptop that was reworked by a shop sometime ago. I updated this pc to Win Anniveresary Issue and then this past Spring to version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week my senior called and said they could no longer get wifi on this pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I have it here at home now and they are right. The pc states that no wifi is available. And in the Settings-Wireless Devices-”We couldn’t find Wireless Devices on this PC.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>And too in “Network Internet-Network Connections” there is only one icon, and it is for Ethernet.</p>
<p>There is no icon for “Wifi.”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Device Manager I find the drive for Ethernet and then 8 WAN Miniport Adapters (IKEV2, IP, IPv6, LZTP, Network Monitor, PPPQE, PPIP, SSTP). What these are and what they all mean I don’t know but they all are
 working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can plug my USB network adapter into a USB port and can connect-see and use wifi with no problem.</p>
<p>I am trying to save our senior $ by not having to buy another USB network adapter and get this pc going on the pc’s wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The F-12 Key has the wifi symbol on it and it is amber I have tried pressing fn + F-12, plus other key combos from Google to turn the wifi icon key blue, but no go so far. Pressing F-12 only turns the Airplane
 mode on and off only. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to install a win 10 adapter driver for the HP 2000 laptop? If so where can I find a driver? I have looked but such seems</p>
<p>hard to find for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you give me some tips or links to try to repair this no wifi icon-no wifi connection available please?</p>

            Its possible the driver was inadvertently uninstalled.
<br />
<br />In Device Manager, did you scan for hardware changes?
<br />
<br />What is the specific make and model of the HP 2000 laptop? HP sometimes have various makes and model of a particular line of computers.
<br />
<br />You could try manually download the wireless adapter driver then manually install. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Also, try resetting the BIOS defaults to see if it helps:

    <title>Win 10 April update--hard drive now constantly filling up with temp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantiannelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 April update--hard drive now constantly filling up with temp files</h2>
                    After the Windows 10 update installed last week, the next day my hard drive was full 100%. After much searching I found 390 gigs of temporary files left behind in the Windows directory. I had to install&nbsp;windirstat.exe to find the files and delete them.
 2 days later, my hard drive filled up again, and this time the files were not visible on windirstat. This time, I was able to identify the temporary files in the Windows temp directory and was able to delete them. This is now the 3rd time I've had to remove
 excessive temp files since the update. What's going on!&nbsp;Help!<br />
<br />
I'm running a Dell&nbsp;XPS 13 – 9343,&nbsp;64-bit&nbsp;win 10. Let me know if you need additional information. The next time it happens I'll take screenshots, but I don't have them now.<br />
<br />

<h3> jgreg7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of user account access and control</h2>
                    
<p>When trying to access other user accounts from the administrator account (any administrator account) on the control panel (control panel&gt;user accounts), the management links do not work, and only the Administrator account is shown. (e.g. When clicking on
 the "Manage other accounts" link - nothing happens).</p>
<p>The following links simply do nothing:<br />
Change your account name<br />
Change your account type<br />
Manage another account</p>
<p>I have tried these links from several accounts including the administrator account, both with a regular boot and safe mode boot.&nbsp; In each case, there was no difference in the outcome.</p>
<p>I have tried using cmd prompt methods o create and promote accounts, and am able to perform the basic account manipulations.&nbsp; I am concerned however, that I am still unable to access the account functions through the control panel&gt;user accounts section,
 and modify other accounts.</p>
<p>How do I access the other user accounts?</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>

<h2>            unsupported printer drivers</h2>
                    I have a Xerox printer N17 that is older and I had been using Xerox global print drivers, but when I upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10, my printer cannot be found any longer.&nbsp; When I try to re-install the global print drivers from Xerox's site, the
 download asks for my IP address or gateway and subnet mask, none of which I know how to find.&nbsp; So I can't download the drivers to enable the Xerox printer.&nbsp; What can I do?&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and try to run the Hardware troubleshooter:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Control panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes in the Control panel
<strong>search</strong> box.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on
<strong>View all</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved, as you have already tried downloading the drivers, you may try to contact Xerox support and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If the problem is during installation and you need to know the IP address of the printer, go to the printer and on using the screen/buttons on the printer select Test Menu &gt; Config Sheet &amp; print the config sheet which should have the IP address/subnet mask
 etc of the printer. This is also available under the Ethernet Menu &gt; IP Address/Subnet Mask/Default Gateway options.</p>

            <p>When I downloaded the drivers from Xerox, my computer still couldn't find my printer (Xerox Docuprint N17 network laser printer).&nbsp; The software from Xerox&nbsp;asked for an IP address.&nbsp; When I printed the config sheet from the printer it did not list an IP address
 or the mask info.&nbsp; It lists info under the headings: general, system menu, tray menu, PCL Menu, parallel menu, and serial menu, but there is no IP address under any of those headings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to summarize, the drivers downloaded from Xerox but my printer is not found.&nbsp; Xerox won't help because they do not support my printer anymore.&nbsp; The global drivers from Xerox had worked for windows 7, and this problem of not finding the printer started
 this week when I went to windows 10.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I followed your instructions, but it did not find any problems.&nbsp; The computer does not realize my printer is attached with the USB cord.&nbsp; And I can't find an IP address for the printer, which was a question from the advanced troubleshooting section.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xerox says they no longer support the Xerox Docuprint N17 Network Laser Printer, which is what they told me when I was&nbsp;using windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I used windows 7,&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;found my printer, and the problem only started when I upgraded this week
 to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer can find and add other printers, like my associate's Brother Laser Printer.&nbsp; But this is a newer model.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice, and if there is anything else I can try, let me know.</p>

            <p>Sorry, didn't realise you were on USB, obviously IP settings are irrelevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take you are saying that if you plug the other printer in via USB it works. I am assuming you have tested to see if your USB ports are working correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the USB ports are working what happens if you click the windows icon and choose settings &gt; devices &gt; Add printer or scanner, does it find anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer isn't even listed as being Windows 8.1 compatible by Xerox and I can't find a separate driver.</p>

            Yes the ports are working, but no it doesn't find&nbsp;the printer when I try to add a printer.&nbsp; The Xerox global print drivers worked for windows 7, though the Xerox N17 didn't have its own drivers then, but with windows 10, the printer can't be found, so
 the drivers won't completely load.&nbsp; I guess my printer is going to have to be replaced.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>No, I can't imagine what part of this month's Windows Updates could affect your store folder. Have you&nbsp;confirmed that the missing folders or messages that were in them are no longer visible in Windows Live Mail?</p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Y to reveal the entire folder tree. Look for your missing folders, possibly several layers deep under
<em>Recovered items </em>or inside another folder.</li><li>Use the <em>Search for a message</em> box to look for one of the messages in&nbsp;a missing folder. Use a search term in the
<em>Subject</em> or <em>From </em>fields for quickest results.</li><li>On Windows 7, you may be able to use the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/previous-versions-files-faq#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Previous versions</a> feature to find older copies of the missing folders.
<ul>
<li>In Windows Live Mail, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. </li><li>On the <em>Advanced</em> tab, click <em>Maintenance</em> and then <em>Store folder</em>.
</li><li>Copy the path shown into the start search box and press <em>Enter</em>. </li><li>Right-click on the folder and select <em>Restore previous versions</em>. <br />
If you can locate a previous version of your store folder, <em>Open </em>it and then locate the missing folders.
<br />
Copy&nbsp;them into a temporary folder on your desktop<br />
Use the <em>File &gt; Import messages</em> function (Alt-F I) in Windows Live Mail to import the temporary folder.</li></ul>
</li></ul>

            <p>Some of this is working for me &amp; I'm learning a lot from you folks and one good bit of information at my Gmail web site (which I'm going to paste here for your benefit).&nbsp; I think that some of the confusion is in slight variations between computers and editions
 of WLM.&nbsp; Some directions go to places that I just can't find.&nbsp; Also, some directions refer to entries that are not always displayed, such as your "<em>Search for a message"
</em>box.&nbsp; I found it but my memory is part of the reason for using folders, so its hard to remember details of stored files.
</p>
<p>Regarding redundant folders and duplicate files:&nbsp; I don't know how or where I may have set up a second account but I seems to have eliminated it.&nbsp; In the case of folders that were obviously from the dupe account; your tip worked:
<em>You can right-click on an account name in the folder pane and select Remove account...
</em></span></p>
<p>My Gmail properties indicates that I have IMAP 4 (5 tabs).</p>

<p>This isn't the answer for my issue whatsoever and I'd appreciate if you unlink my post from it because it is a lie. Norton Internet Security is my Anti-Virus Software and removing it still resulted in this Login Issue. Many Avast users have issues with Windows
 10 and that program. I have fixed many people's computer issues on Windows 10 by removing their Avast Anti-Virus and giving them the Norton Trial that is equivalent to their Avast version and recommending they purchase Norton instead; they're all thankful
 that they did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The catcher is their computers don't have this program installing on their computer running Windows 10 Version 1809. Proof of this is in the fact that I have been working on many computers running Windows 10 Version 1809 (even at a church I volunteer at)
 that don't have this program on them. This program is unremovable by Uninstalling it on the user's end unlike some built-in Windows 10 apps and after its disabled the user with the Login Issue CAN login to their computer just fine until Windows Update installs
 updates and Restarts, then its active again and needs to be disabled again. In the long run this is a major hassle for users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only takes up-to thirty minutes to rollback from Windows 10 Version 1809 back to Windows 10 Version 1803 and if you use the built-in settings and Holding Down the Shift Key well pressing on the Power Icon and it brings up the Advanced Options Menu and
 then going to Troubleshooting and then going to Removing Feature Update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you don't have this program installed on your computer by Windows 10 Version 1809 (you can check in Safe Mode; or if you are lucky on an occasion as I was here when you can actually login to your computer. This Login was a ONE TIME occurrence and that
 is because I quickly forced my computer to the Login Screen and got my password in and hit enter before this program could load. As a result Windows went very slow though and I had to restart the computer and the Login Issue returned.) As you can see with
 the screenshots; I chose to use my computer even with it going slow because it was already a full day of fighting Windows 10 Version 1809 and not being able to login normally and seeing this in Safe Mode. After getting in normally that one time I disabled
 this program to never run and was able to login normally until Windows Update downloaded updates.</p>

<p>This isn't the answer for my issue whatsoever and I'd appreciate if you unlink my post from it because it is a lie. Norton Internet Security is my Anti-Virus Software and removing it still resulted in this Login Issue. Many Avast
 users have issues with Windows 10 and that program. I have fixed many people's computer issues on Windows 10 by removing their Avast Anti-Virus and giving them the Norton Trial that is equivalent to their Avast version and recommending they purchase Norton
 instead; they're all thankful that they did.</p>

 that don't have this program on them. This program is unremovable by Uninstalling it on the user's end unlike some built-in Windows 10 apps and after its disabled the user with the Login Issue CAN login to their computer just fine until Windows Update installs
 updates and Restarts, then its active again and needs to be disabled again. In the long run this is a major hassle for users.</p>

<p>The steps you took won't work for anyone that has the program I have included the screenshots of and that I have confirmed with another computer that doesn't have any Anti-Virus program installed other than the built-in Windows Defender. Thus that further
 proves that it isn't the Anti-Virus program that is the cause of the login issue. And you can't remove Windows Defender either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The evidence is getting more in-depth showing that this is a Microsoft Problem. Removing and reinstalling your Anti-Virus like with the Start Menu &amp; Cortana Aren't Working Error that used to plague Windows 10 when it was first released and users did their
 own work arounds to fix it and one of them was removing their Anti-Virus Programs all proved to be a temporary fix. Knowing that and people that removed Avast and then reinstalled it again after being able to login to their computer after a few weeks were
 met with the same login issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you did ISN'T a fix; it is a temporary fix and the issue WILL come back. You're 100% best solution is what even Microsoft on the phone recommends: ROLLING BACK TO WINDOWS 10 VERSION 1803 and waiting for the next Feature Update; Version 1903 and to fully
 bypass Version 1809. I have been assured by Microsoft Support that this error won't occur in 1903 and that has something to do with the fact that the screenshotted program is gone.</p>

<p>There is no direct phone support for the Tier 3 Specialty Advocacy Team, unfortunately. The only way to get into contact is when you get a situation escalated by Xbox Support &amp; then the Advocacy Team will either contact you by email unless you specifically
 request contact over the phone. Depending on the scenario it usually has an estimation time of 3-5 business days for them to contact an individual through email or phone call.

    <title>Xbox One Melted. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuki asuna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Melted.</h2>
                    
<p>I Purchased an Xbox One Day One Edition on release date.</p>
<p>Since then i have played on my console around 3-4 times.</p>
<p>On the 8th February 2014 i went to play on my console, upon going to enter the disk i noticed that the case has Beveled/Melted and it was Extremely hot.</p>
<p>I Immediately Called Microsoft to let them know what had happened, that i had gone to play on my console, noticed the case, that the console was extreme hot etc and they told me to Disconnect everything immediately and requested some pictures of the console.</p>
<p>I then emailed pictures of my console to the agent and she also agreed that the console had Beveled/Melted that wanted it to be investigated, and told me she'd get back to me the next day.</p>
<p>i received an email the next day from her stating that she was having technical problems and that she couldn't call me back and requested i call them and give them my reference number.</p>
<p>i called, gave the man my reference number and he asked me some questions about, who was playing on it, what happened etc and then checked the photos that i emailed them, again. he agreed that the console had Beveled/Melted and that it needed Replacing and
 Investigating.</p>
<p>He then set up a Replacement for me, and said that under the circumstances i would receive a completely new Xbox One Day One Edition as they needed everything that was connected to my console at the time and that it would take some time to investigate the
 cause.</p>
<p>On the 13th February the Delivery Van collected my Xbox one and took it away.</p>
<p>i then called about a week later asking what was going on with my console as i was told i'd receive a replacement once they received my console (by now they had had my console for 5-6 days) and he said there was no information on what was going on and that
 it hadn't even been checked into the service center yet.</p>
<p>So i said Okay, and left it at that as he said they'd email me with updates of what is going on.</p>
<p>the next day i received an email from someone named "Justin" (Somehow this Email was from Australia, contained the Australian Xbox Support number and everything) Saying that he had taken a look at my console and refused to take a look at my console because
 it has been "Tampered with" and that my console would be sent back to me.</p>
<p>Once i received this email, obviously i was not happy and i called Microsoft about them accusing me of Tampering with my Console, i saved for 6 Months to buy this console and they're accusing me of Tampering with it, why would i do such a thing? I Reported
 it to Microsoft because it was a Serious issue and could have burnt my house down.</p>
<p>They then took a look at the photos i had emailed them previously and also agreed that it had indeed Beveled/Melted and that could be the cause of why it looks like it has been tampered with. he then went to speak to his Supervisor and said that the Supervisor
 will call me back in 5 minutes.</p>
<p>So i waited, and around 10 Minutes later the Supervisor called me back, He said he had taken a look at the photos and that he could see that the console had Beveled/Melted and that he would request a full report from the Repair center to see why they have
 accused me of tampering with the console and that if the report said it had overheated he would do everything he could to have the problem fixed. he then said he'd called tomorrow after getting the report.</p>
<p>So tomorrow came, and i waited for a phone call, and he eventually called and said that it would take a while to get the report and that he would call me back next week. So i said Okay again, and waited for him to call me back.</p>
<p>He never called me back so i then called Microsoft, Gave them the reference number again, explained everything, they looked at the pictures, saw what the problem was, and then when i asked to speak to the Supervisor to see if he had the report i was told
 "I am the supervisor" (First time it was a Man, this time it was a Woman) So i told them about the other Supervisor and that he said he'd get the reports and such, and she said that no one had requested any reports or anything.</p>
<p>By now i was very Angry and she requested that she call me back at 5pm. So again, i agreed and she called back at 5pm stating that there is nothing i can do to fight this and that what the Repair team says goes and there is no going against them. So i argued
 with her again and she said she'd speak to some people and call me back tomorrow, she did just that and said there is nothing she can do and that the only thing i can possibly do is write a letter of complaint to microsoft.</p>
<p>So here i am, with a £420 Melted Xbox One Paperweight sitting on my Desk, all i request is that my console be Replaced with a Non-Melting Console so that i can play my Games, i have received games for my Birthday, Pre-ordered Games (Titanfall, Metal Gear
 Solid etc) and i can't use them at all.</p>
<p>The console turns on and such, however it could have burnt my house down so there is no way i'm even going to attempt to play games on it, even microsoft said it was a fire hazard and yet they send it back to me?</p>
<p>Here are some Pictures of my console along with the letter i received accusing me of Tampering with my console</p>

<p>I believe on the inside of the console, there is a security tape. &nbsp;When it warped, it probably broke that tape as well. &nbsp;That's probably why they said you tampered with it.</p>

<p>But Support won't do anything about it, they said what the repair team says goes and because they said it's been tampered with there is absolutely nothing at all i can do about it.</p>
<p>it has quite clearly beveled/melted and every single person i've spoken to when i've called has even agreed with the pictures and what is going on but none of them can do anything.</p>
<p>i was told to write a letter of complaint to microsoft and that is all i can do.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Make sure&nbsp;your firewall is not blocking it.&nbsp;Can you fax out? Is the&nbsp;Toshiba Modem on<br />
the VHCL list? Maybe check in the Toshiba Forums.<br />

INSTRUCTIONS PER HELP AND SUPPORT<br />
_____________________________________________________________________<br />
Before you begin, make sure that you've attached an analog phone line to<br />
your computer. You can't use a digital phone line to send or receive faxes.<br />
<br />
If your computer has a built-in fax modem, Windows will automatically detect<br />
it during the setup process. You can connect to one local fax modem only,<br />
although you can connect to multiple fax servers or devices on a network. If<br />
you're not sure whether your computer has a built-in fax modem, check the<br />
hardware information that came with your computer. If you have an external<br />
fax modem, follow the manufacturer's instructions for attaching it to your<br />
computer. Make sure that the modem is turned on before taking these steps.<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start button , click All Programs, and then click Windows Fax<br />
and Scan.<br />
<br />
2. To use Fax view, at the bottom of the left pane, click Fax.<br />
<br />
3. If you're connecting to a fax device for the first time, click New Fax<br />
on the toolbar, and then, in the Fax Setup Wizard, follow the instructions<br />
for connecting to a fax modem.<br />
<br />
If you've already connected to one or more fax servers or devices on a<br />
network and want to connect to a modem, click Tools, click Fax Accounts, and<br />
then click Add. In the Fax Setup Wizard, complete the steps for connecting to<br />
a fax modem.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are trying to print in Edge Browser use CTRL + P or click the little 3 dots in<br />
the top right corner (under the "X" then - Print.<br />
<br />
As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

    <title>Surface Book 2 WiFi Connection Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 WiFi Connection Issues</h2>
                    <p>I am new to the "Surface Book 2 world" and have had it for about a month now.&nbsp; I did not think I was having an issue with my WiFi connection and download speeds until I started using iTunes.&nbsp; When trying to download my content from the cloud to my iTunes
 library (on an external drive), I consistently receive errors stating the download cannot be completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I attempted to switch from my 5 GHz network to my 2.4 GHz network to see if there was any noticeable change.&nbsp; That is when I discovered I cannot even connect to my 2.4 GHz network.&nbsp; Each network has a different SSID.&nbsp; My wireless network has MAC filtering
 enabled so that only certain devices can connect.&nbsp; The Linksys EA9500 has the latest firmware installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation I have with my 5 GHz network is it's speed.&nbsp; Its seems to be downloading my iTunes content very slowly.&nbsp; And maybe that is why I keep getting the errors from iTunes...maybe it is timing out or just taking too long?</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to go back and find out the exact iTunes error code I am getting.&nbsp; I can only remember error 32XX (I can't recall the last two digits).</li><li>I need to do a speed test on the download on my 5 GHZ network.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any recommendations on what I can do to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Improve my download speeds for the 5 GHz network.</li><li>Get the Surface Book 2 to actually connect to the 2.4 GHz network.</li></ol>
<p>Thank you.</p>
