<h2>            Slow DirectAccess IPHTTPS</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>We have one machine that is slow to connect to the network via DA (DirectAccess).</p>
<p>It's a Precision 6700.</p>
<p>Anyway, we have about 20 users per day connecting via DirectAccess and they are not experiencing any issues.</p>
<p>Now, I understand the IPHTTPS protocol is the slowest (but most secure) way of connecting, but when other machines don't have issues, I don't think the protocol is the problem.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling the 6to4 and Teredo protocol on this client machine to see if that speeds anything up, no luck.</p>
<p>It takes the machine about 10-20 minutes to fully connect to DA, but sometimes I have to teamviewer on and manually Disconnect and connect just to get the NFS shares to fully load. &nbsp;So we'll be able to get into the drive and typically another folder, but
 subfolders from there on are inaccessible until I do the disconnect and reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange...But everything looks fine in the DA report I can spin up from Settings. &nbsp;*Shrugs*</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas, I'd be glad to hear them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Black screen with cursor after updates</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with some Windows update from a couple weeks ago (this started around the 11th I believe). After Windows installs the updates, I get a black screen with a cursor upon logging in. Nothing works at all - if I hit CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to launch
 Task Manager, it shows briefly (but doesn't fully load) before disappearing again. I am able to boot into Safe Mode just fine, but have not figured out specifically what update is causing this, and the only way I can get back is to do a system restore to a
 time before the updates were installed. I have tried uninstalling the graphics driver, tried updating it, etc. and nothing works.</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is your other symptoms are the significant ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. assuming the crashes are occurring at the same time that you are seeing your blank screen, my surprise would be that there was no retry for the first crash of explorer.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>if I hit CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to launch Task Manager, it shows briefly (but doesn't fully load) before disappearing again.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Usually when you don't have an explorer.exe running you would need to press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to get the prompt to allow you to start Task Manager.&nbsp; Being able to the use that more direct keyboard shortcut I think may mean that explorer.exe was partially functioning
 then, so maybe it did retry after all but was left running in a degraded state?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW someone else recently reported this same symptom--TM showing briefly--but without including any other diagnostics and I have been so fixated on "phantom monitor" issues that I didn't consider something like this happening.&nbsp; Thanks for these details to
 steer me away from that scenario hypothesis here.</p>

<p>Crashes in module unknown&nbsp;can mean stack corruption or interference by malware.&nbsp; Strange that both programs are crashing at the same location.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure but I think that means you have a driver problem with an inessential device.&nbsp; This might actually be the real problem.&nbsp; E.g. if you avoided this perhaps explorer.exe would not be crashing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using your safe boot to eliminate things in your start up before trying a normal boot.</p>

            <p>After reading over the KB articles for all the general (non-security) updates, and keeping in mind when this first started happening, I took a gamble at which update was causing the problem and it seems that paid off.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's this one: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2955164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB2955164)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I chose that particular one rather than the (lengthy) trial-and-error method (install updates one by one until it breaks) is because that one mentioned fixing a couple of video-related issues (even though neither issue relates to anything
 I actually use). If I don't install that one, everything boots up and works normally. I'll hold off on installing that one for now since everything else is working as expected without it.</p>

            <p>Reading through this I recognize I had the same problems a very short while back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really don't recall how I fixed it but suspect it was reinstalling the most current Intel graphics driver from a clean boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft had updated that driver in my Lenovo&nbsp;G series with the HD3000 intel, &nbsp;and I reinstalled it because I would see page loads with a topmost pic messed up..&nbsp; kind of a wide gray line across and&nbsp;toward top of the first main&nbsp;pic on some pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyhow somewhere along the line either that reinstall in&nbsp;a clean boot&nbsp; of the intel driver, or something else I did&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed what seems to be your exact problem..&nbsp;those problems&nbsp;&nbsp;didn't last long here.</p>

            I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling and updating the graphics driver both in Safe Mode (after the update is installed) and in regular mode (before the update is installed) and that doesn't seem to have any effect on the issue. The only way I've been able
 to avoid this issue at the moment is to not install the KB2955164 update. For now I've told Windows to hide that update so it won't keep getting installed, but I'd still like to know exactly what's causing this.<br />

<p>I think the most effective tack to take would be diagnosing your safe mode differences.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. you can use msinfo32.exe for both cases.&nbsp; All its output is capturable, sortable and customizable to an extent which should make such comparison relatively straightforward
 if not simple.&nbsp; On a related tack you could try customizing your normal boot to approximate the conditions that you have in your safe mode boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would also like to see you find a better workaround and diagnosis of the problem state.&nbsp; Did you try using Ctrl-Alt-Delete (instead of Ctrl-Shift-Esc) then?&nbsp; Try using a Low resolution video boot option?&nbsp; Etc.</p>

            <p>Having the same problem after a Windows update; shut down for update on Thursday and upon boot up, The start routine is normal but after logging in, there is a blank (black) page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to open Task Manager and do a few things, like surf the Web, but cannot find iexplorer.exe in the lists. Upon opening and closing task manager a few times, iexplorer.exe shows up in the list: chain analysis "iexplorer.exe(PID:4352)Thread:6808 and
 again iexplorer.exe(PID:4352)Thread:2772. cannot restart the process through the available choices available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a malware check and this one showed up Artemis!(with a series of numbers). Another malware that is frequently identified though removed often is Linkey adware. the Malware analyser crashed upon the "fixing" stage having identified many such malwares
 in my system, unfortunately I am unable to restart the program to see if the problem was punctual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My anti virus provider has not been able to fix or resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I am wary to connect to my sharepoint sites as I am worried some of these malwares and Trojans may intercept my kb inputs.</p>

<p>who never understood, or wanted to understand<span> </span><span>error messages, and couldn't bother doing&nbsp; a search for a translation of</span></p>
<p><span>the arcane error code ?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I reckon the <em>'if you need it'</em> part is on target.</span><span> Most Windows Home users don't .</span> Error message pops up</p>
<p>and eyes gloss over. Close message and worry about it later, After the machine crashes, it's off to the local tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- Or,</span><span> is the error message generated by a malware ?</span></p>
<p><span>Whatever the case, I don't see those messages as sarcastic, just an attempt from MS (if it's them) to sound cool, and appeal to the masses.
</span></p>
<p><span>If these are new error messages from MS</span><span> I wonder if they are just in Win10 Home,</span><span> or in 'Business' versions such as</span></p>
<p><span>Win10 Pro as well ?</span></p>

<p>Hello Boss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been chasing this around the net for a few days now, trying different fixes, none of which have worked. A few created other problems, which sidetracked me for a few days. One of them made my start menu disappear. Got it back, intact, after a lot more
 searching for fixes. I'm not very tech savvy. I know just enough to get myself in a lot of trouble. But I never let that stop me be4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I too noted that this seems to go back a ways. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I run antivirus and antimalware and scan frequently. Don't think it's a gremlin, just... well, it's windows 10. Might have something to do with the windows firewall, which I've turned off long ago, since the one with my antivirus is adequate. But I reset
 the windows service to manual so I can start and stop it at will and nothing will download regardless of the firewall status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this error message is new and no, it's not only in 10 Home. I'm using 10 Pro. But I think it's an early version, 10240, and I turned off the updates a long time ago. Every time I got things working somewhat tolerably, some updates would be
 installed and everything was changed. So, no, I don't think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there are apparently no plans for a windows 11 and so on, I wonder if MS is planning on starting up a subscription service. If you want the latest updates to keep your OS current, then you'll just pay a small monthly fee. Multiplied by a few hundred
 million users all over the world. Could be very lucrative if enough people went for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'll keep digging and maybe I'll figure it out. I want to start playing some Xbox games on my PC and, if I'm lucky, get it streaming to my smart TV. Or not. I should probably just break down a buy a couple of game consoles. But where's the challenge
 in that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd really like is an updated version of XP Pro that would run on the newest SATA computers. IMHO, that was probably the best platform MS has ever come up with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anon.</p>

<p><em>"I wonder if MS is planning on starting up a subscription service."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>No. The licensing system is not much different to previous Windows and they will still make many billions flogging Windows on new machines.</p>
<p>The new business model is more a forever BETA system of continual tweaking, coupled with new 'features' delivered twice a year in</p>
<p>a version/feature update. It is these new 'features' that will directly or indirectly provide an income stream beyond selling operating systems</p>
<p>( A link to the Store is such an important Windows function that it cannot be removed ? ), but subscription</p>
<p>to the OS is not in that plan... in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[I've avoided MS's Store, and have nothing helpful regarding your problem below, but ... ]</p>
<p>I realise that Pro has the ability to put off updates, but believe this is meant as a more secure way to prevent the machine rebooting to install an update while someone is in the middle of doing an important business function (as if home users 'business'
 does not count).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people are rebelling and trying to prevent a new version update beyond the one they think is not broken.</p>
<p>Problem is.<em>.. every </em>version update has broken someone's Windows (hundreds of thousands; millions ? ), and all version updates seem to require some custom settings to be re-done at the least.</p>
<p>However, from what I've seen on these forums 1709&nbsp; seems to have some changes to Win10 that were the final straw for those with</p>
<p>older laptops (graphics especially) that were not fully compatible with Win10 when the user was seduced by the 'free' Win10 offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- However, while the version updates have a lot of bolatware, and are tedious, they also have important changes and fixes.
</p>
<p>If I were to skip a version update, I would be inclined to only skip only one version update a year.
</p>
<p>In with the dross, I have found useful or beneficial changes in all four version updates I've installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always make a clone of my current Win10 before a version update. I haven't had any issues with any of them, but not going to risk it.</p>
<p>I also try to remember to run Windows Updates manually for the regular Security and Cumulative updates before starting a big download,</p>
<p>as the updates loading in the background have slowed my download a couple of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- After some adjustment I got to like Win7. It was stable as. My Win10 is an upgrade from Win7 installed in Jan 2010.</p>
<p>This install was cloned to two more machines with entirely different hardware (new keys from OEM disk) over the years,</p>
<p>and then to Win10 during the freebee. Both machines (built '12 &amp; '14) run Win10 without a hitch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one feature in XP&nbsp; I used heaps, and miss dearly. The ability to disable
<em>'align icons to a grid' .</em> MS removed this with Win7, but</p>
<p>there was a registry fix (a bit sloppy because you could accidentally 'hide' a folder, etc. behind another, but MS took even that from us on Win10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>At least we can still free arrange icons on the desktop. If not - <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5e0dda5-6fd0-40b6-9c03-50aebb8ed04f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5e0dda5-6fd0-40b6-9c03-50aebb8ed04f" /></a> ... Back to Win7<em>.</em></p>
<p>Photographers were the largest group that hated this because they could no longer cluster 'unrelated' images, but I just liked</p>
<p>to be able to sort folders/file into groups and leave spaces wherever suited, that mean something to<em> me</em> .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>250 'auto arrange' options will never make up for loosing the ability to free arrange<em>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Games run as well on Win10 as they did on Win7. Not the best endorsement for 'the best gaming Windows ever', but 10's OK.</p>
<p>Of just on 200 games, I have only one or two that no longer work on Win10 . </p>
<p>Should be some good stuff happening when DX12 actually becomes a thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Multiplied by a few hundred million users all over the world"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe they were shooting for a Billion in year one with the 'free' offer. They want everyone on the same page.
</p>
<p>Also the reason behind the mandatory update regime. In addition to allowing millions of aging machines to be labelled as being
</p>
<p>suitable for 'upgrade', their heavy handed tactics in 'distributing' the 'upgrade' caused the scandal surrounding 'divine' upgrades,&nbsp;</p>
<p>which caused a whole lot of misery and woe.<br />

<p>Hey Boss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're evidently very well informed and far more, very far, knowledgeable regarding the technology we're dealing with.&nbsp; I come from the school of "<em>rough carpentry</em>" and pretty much apply those principles to everything. I'm sort of an intellectual
 dilettante. I know a little about a lot but I don't really know a lot about anything? Autodidact with a GED. Square peg, round hole?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The little gif you have in there pretty much tells the story with me; about updates. I wanted to stop it from running until and unless I wanted it. I kept disabling the update service and windows kept restarting it. I went into the task scheduler and disabled
 it there. Windows kept turning it back on. Went into the UpdateOrchestrator and disabled everything! Windows kept restarting it. Finally got so pissed I went and found a way to DELETE the update service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I may have to reinstall the OS to get back to square one. Don't want to have to reinstall all my apps: Bryce, Corel Draw, Paint.net, AcidPro, blah, blah. There's a lot of them. I'm not worried about my files cause I've got everything backed up on 2 Toshiba
 Canvio external hard drives. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you go about "<em>cloning</em>" your system? I've looked into different software and whatnot but most of it seems like Greek to me. Back with my old ATA PC, when I was running XP Pro, I just stuck in a second hard drive, installed XP on it and copied
 everything to it; I think. That was a long time ago but, whatever I did, it worked just fine. I ended up with 2 identical drives, either of which I could boot to by selecting one or the other at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, not really sure what I'll do at this point. I'd like to restore some of the functions I've unwittingly disabled and I even ran a powershell command to that end but all that did was cause my start menu to vanish. I'll do some more searching for fixes
 regarding certain functions and see what I come up with. </p>
<p>I'm kind of determined to do it the hard way; to work around the absence of updates and find alternate ways of getting things to look and run the way I want them. Sooner or later someone will come out with ResourceHacker for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time it's actually kinda "<em>fun</em>"; in a warped sort of masochistic way!

<p>- Win10 is far more dictatorial than Win7 or earlier. They have also reduced the Users control and customisation further with Win10<br />
While I have accepted the inevitability of mandatory updates, I still prefer doing the updates in my own time, particularly the version updates.
<br />
I hate to leave the machine when I go to shut down and get a message - 'Windows is updating' . Don't want to come back later to find Windows is stuffed (hasn't happened, so... Paranoid ? ), and don't want to discover something bad now.&nbsp; I want to be outa here
 !<br />
<br />
<br />
- Cloning your OS is easy enough. It takes less time than doing a clean Windows install; copying your user folder and<br />
redoing your custom settings. With a clone you don't have to reinstall software\games installed on another drive because you<br />
still have all the Registry keys they may require that would be lost in a clean install.<br />
Why a clone is better than simply copying Windows to another drive I don't know, but I assume some things go missing from<br />
Windows core if you copy.<br />
<br />
- You do want to be careful to select the correct partition, if you are using a HDD with several partitions when you do the setup.<br />
You need a 'free space' equal to, or larger than your current C:\ drive.<br />
I use <em>AOEMI&nbsp; Partition Assistant</em> ( they use the term Migrate ), but Macrium Reflect is probably more popular.<br />
Both have free and pay versions, but the free version is adequate for cloning.<br />
<br />
The instruction for AOEMI are not great, but you can backtrack at any point in the cloning procedure if you feel you have done<br />
something wrong. Your setup only gets set in stone after you click Apply and start the reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.disk-partition.com/free-partition-manager.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Free Partition Manager - AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I limit the amount of software I install to the default location - Program Files (x86) - to browsers, AV and a few other things, so this<br />
keeps my C:\ partition fairly lean and the cloning process is fairly quick. I have my OS on an SSD and clone to an old HDD.<br />
All other software/games and music get installed on another partition or HDD. <br />
I also keep external backups of everything I have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Thanks for the encouraging words mate... I don't really have deep technical knowledge, but hanging out here the past eight years has been educational. I have heaps of Bookmarks, some notes (should have a lot more), and have a large game collection for
 referencing too&nbsp; .<br />
Still probably pass on some urban myths now and then though.&nbsp; '<em>Server stumble</em>'&nbsp; ;D .<br />

<p>I've decided to repeat what I did with my old Gateway PC, which is running XP Pro and which I still have in a box and plan to set back up after I finish remodeling my living room.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ordered a second hard drive from Lenovo and I'm going to stick it in my ThinkStation P300. Then I'll do a clean install of windows 10 on it and copy all the other stuff from the existing drive over to the new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I'm not real thrilled with Lenovo. I won't be buying another machine from them any time soon. Ideally, I'd like to find someone who really knows what they're doing and have them build the computer of my dreams; whatever that might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have 2 bootable drives between which I can freely share files by simply using the "copy to" command from the right-click context menu. If it works the same way it did with the Gateway, when I turn on my PC I'll be asked which drive I want before windows
 can open. I'll let the new drive download and run the updates I've avoided and then I can pick and choose. Then I'll have a functioning store connection and should be able to download the Xbox app and the digital games I'm interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way, no matter what might go wrong with the new drive, I still have all my original apps running on the old drive, plus the files I've got backed up on the externals. Basically I'll be able to do whatever I want with the new drive. Even if I cause a
 complete disaster with it, I could just reformat it and start over. As long as I don't lose any of the apps from the old drive I'll be OK. The old drive sort of becomes my backup for the new one, which, hopefully, I'll get set up to look and behave the way
 I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that stuff about "partitions" and whatnot just gives me a headache. I've got hard drive with x amount of space on it and this is what I'm going to put on it, wherever it goes. If I want to play around any more I'll just ad a 3rd drive and do whatever.
 A one terabyte drive just isn't that expensive these days. Even a pauper such as I can afford a couple of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New drive will be here in a couple of days. Meanwhile, on a whim, I bought a very inexpensive classic Atari game emulator, which comes with over 80 games and will even accept original Atari cartridges. I have one such cartridge, which is one of my favourite
 games; Road Rash. I'm getting ready to set it up and see if it actually works! A while back, when I had a little extra funding, I splurged on a 65" smart TV. I'm wondering what it will be like for gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anon, CI</p>

<br />
- Build your own, or at least select the components from a site such as Newegg and have them put it together for you.<br />
Cruse through Neweggs components, then read reviews for those components you think suit your needs and budget.<br />
You will end up with a better machine for less money, and learn some things that may be useful when troubleshooting an issue later.<br />
Don't put too much stock in negative newegg review on some products. People tend to post negative reviews for things that are</p>
<p>their fault ( graphics card too long for small case, etc. ), and DOA which can happen with any product/brand.</p>
<p>Assembly is not not all that tricky. Just use due diligence and you'll be fine. The internet is chock full of tutorials if you need<br />
help with some of the unhelpful instructions<br />
( An image in conjunction with well written instructions is not as common as should be. Too many mfg's think a picture is worth a thousand<br />
words, and don't include meaningful written instruction).<br />
Hardly any tools are necessary. Philips Head screwdriver is about the only essential item. Small needle nose pliers or tweezers can<br />
be useful for connecting front panel wires to the motherboard (one of the more tricky operations because you have so many<br />
close set pins ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>"All that stuff about "partitions" and whatnot just gives me a headache."</em><br />
<br />
Aw comeon! Your tougher than that... Take an aspirin and all will become clear. ;)
<br />
You don't <em>need</em> Partitions, but they can be very useful, and creating and managing Partitions is not that tricky.<br />
Windows Disk Management does basic partitioning well enough for general HDD setup .<br />
The main thing to remember is you need to make the partition for C:\ first (if you were using a large HDD for everything), so</p>
<p>Windows is on the faster part of the platter.<br />
As with doing a clone, you can retreat, or redo the partition when you find your 100GB partition came out at, eg-&nbsp; 91 or 110GB.<br />
(something to do with, a term I can't remember atm, regarding size of HDD data blocks not always being equal to multiples of 1024 MB )<br />
<br />
You don't need to partition to keep C:\ lean though. A 128GB SSD for the OS and whatever else fits is good. A drive of this capacity will
</p>
<p>still clone fairly quickly, and Windows is so much quicker running from an SSD.<br />
I make my clones on an HDD. Partly because they are supposed to be able to&nbsp; handle more writes than SSD, and because I have
</p>
<p>some older small capacity HDD's handy, but when I test a new Win10 clone on the HDD I am reminded of how many idle minutes
</p>
<p>there are when runnnig Windows on a HDD</p>
<p>- I Install software/games on a 2TB HDD. Some software may benefit from being the SSD (browsers, AV's ),
</p>
<p>but most software and games only benefit from slightly quicker load times, so HDD is good.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<em>"65" smart TV...&nbsp; I'm wondering what it will be like for gaming."</em><br />
<br />
How did you go with the emulator ? Retro gamer only ? Have you been to...<br />
<a href="http://www.gog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gog.com/</a>
<br />
<br />
Is your TV UHD ? If so, you would need some serious power to run modern high spec games. 1440p monitor is the upper end<br />
for most machines when running modern high spec games such as Fallout 4 &amp; GTA5 using all max settings. You need the best you<br />
can get to run games like these @ UHD resolution.<br />
Racing games are really good on big screen. Using a good wheel with modern racing games is a whole lot of fun on big screen.<br />
The DIRT series looks great even at 1080p on large screen, and I imagine the extreme skiing game, Steep would look amazing<br />
on large screen as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TV's as a PC gaming monitor have had issues with screen scaling, and test size, but Win10 does have some benefits in
</p>
<p>this regard. I don't know anything about 'smart' TV's but they are probably better in regard to scaling as well.</p>
<p>- Some TV's still have pretty bad&nbsp; input lag, which causes lag in mouse/keyboard/controller response times.

<p>C'mon Boss. To many items to choose from without adequate knowledge as to the function of those items. I want to tell an expert what I want and have that person at least give me a list of the parts I need. I wouldn't then mind doing the assembly. I just
 don't have the tech savvy to pick all the components myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose, if I wanted to spend a lot of time doing research on each component I might be able to figure out which specific item would be right for the things I do with my PC. I just don't have the time or patience for it at this point. I'm 70 and I'd like
 to spend more time using the machine than building it. Don't have a lot of time to spare, or a lot of disposable income either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at Newegg. Maybe I'll go back and look again at some of the kits they offer. Still, I want to be sure what I end up with will work the way I want it to, out of the box. That's one of the problems I had with Lenovo. I spent hours on the phone
 when I ordered, explaining exactly what I needed. I was assured the machine would be ready to go, plug and play. Or not. I bought 2 monitors because I really like working with an image on one screen and all the clutter of the tool bars on another. When the
 machine arrived I was not able to connect the 2 monitors with the hardware provided. I had to go out to Best Buy and pick up some adapters to use my new system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emulator is really cool! It actually accepts original Atari game cartridges and controllers! It's an Atari console modernised. It plays the Atari games and it's about 1/3 the size of the original console. Plus it has a ton of the old games loaded on
 it; including my boy Sonic. The smart TV wouldn't display the old Atari graphics. I have a smaller flat screen that I hooked up and it works great. Plenty big enough for the games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the partitions and such; just not into it. I'll just build my machine with 3 or 4 drives installed, do some kind of raid setup with them and be done with it. Maybe.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista:
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Try to create a new user account and check if it helps.<br />

            No, it means you need to purchase another license.

            1 computer=1 license
<br />If you plan to transfer the license, here are the steps:
<br />
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/2577-sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/2577-sh</a>... 
<br />
<br />Uninstall the keyhttps://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/ 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="http://www.support.microsoft.com/contactus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.microsoft.com/contactus</a> through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

<p>Hi guys!</p>

<p>Well, the subject pretty much says it all... I will live in China for a few months. Can I bring my xbox and play on Xbox Live? Or is it blocked?</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Delete AutoRun Entry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djohne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete AutoRun Entry</h2>
                    <p>I recently suffered from a virus &amp; malware attack on my PC (running Win7 Home Premium 64-bit). I scanned my system repeatedly using various programs (including McAfee, AVG Rescue CD, ClamWin Portable and Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool, TDSSkller
 and RogueKiller). Multiple issues were detected and dealt with. Scans are now coming up clean, however I have a residual issue that I need help resolving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using AutoRuns, on the Logon tab, I have a rogue entry in the <strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
</strong>section, as follows:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Autorun Entry: <em>Google Update</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description: <em>(blank)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Publisher: <em>(blank)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Image Path: <em>File not found: C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Google\Desktop\Install\{3ed9215f-6814-b963-e1b1-58884a16cbc4}\❤≸⋙\Ⱒ☠⍨\‮ﯹ๛\{3ed9215f-6814-b963-e1b1-58884a16cbc4}\GoogleUpdate.exe</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timestamp: <em>(blank)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(NB The path wasn't quite as above, it also included a few Unicode characters that don't display here)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file in question was one of the viruses (subsequently deleted, hence the File Not Found). The path itself took a bit of deleting but I eventually managed it using the DelinvFile.exe program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I cannot get rid of the entry itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I delete it in AutoRuns it seems to go, but it reappears as soon as I refresh AutoRuns. If I choose 'Jump to Entry...' the Registry Editor opens and displays the Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run location, but then
 an Error message appears saying "Error Displaying Value : Cannot display Google Update: Error reading the value's contents".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are four entries in Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run, namely:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Default)<br />
AdobeBridge<br />
ISUSPM Startup<br />
Sidebar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is as though there is a 'hidden' entry that AutoRuns can detect but not delete and which Regedit cannot see. I didn't think that was possible, but that is how it seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it relates to a 'File not found' I don't believe it is a danger, but I'd like to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run ccleaner but it did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions please...</p>

<h2>            Youtube app on xbox 360 wont show other channels&#38;&#35;39&#59; uploads</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've been having an issue with youtube on my xbox 360 for 2 days now. &nbsp;About a week ago I bought an xbox 360 from gamestop and youtube worked fine on it. &nbsp;But two days ago it started to not show the videos on other peoples channels. &nbsp;For example, if
 I search markiplier and go to his channel on my xbox 360, his overview video is black and there are no videos in the upload section. &nbsp;(BTW I don't have my youtube account on my computer connected to youtube on my xbox 360.) Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>I've tried everything I can think of. &nbsp;My safe filtering is off. &nbsp;I deleted and re-installed youtube. &nbsp;I cleared the hard drive cache. &nbsp;Any one know how to fix this?</p>
<p>Help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If people threatn to hack you dont worry about. i get threats every game i go into on MW2, because i will go 77 kills and under 20 deaths, their not going to do anything, and if they do host boot you then change your IP and block communications and file

<h2>            Blue Screen On Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit</h2>
                    <br />
<p><span>Hello everybody,<br />
<br />
I have a problem with my computer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I am using a Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit on my computer which I have built by myself. When the computer powered ON, it will boot the Windows normally. Then when I start surfing the internet or playing MP3 file, the computer will suddenly freeze and BSoD (The
 Blue Screen of Death) will appear with one of these errors: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</span></p>
<p><span>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</span></p>
<p><span>BAD_POOL_HEADER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><span>IRQL_GT_ZERO_AT_SYSTEM_SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I checked with all my PC’s Hardware’s manufacturers. And there was nothing to worry about it.</p>
<p>And for the software’s, I am using Windows 7 Compatibility Center to see if that software is compatible with my computer or not.</p>
<p><br />
Also I have tested the RAM memories by using memtest86 and the result was CLEAR.<br />
<br />
Note: I was using Windows XP 64 bit, and it was OK with my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are all dump files and System Information File of my computer. I hope that will help you in your investigation process.</p>

            Hi sualsalmi,<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot <strong>BSOD</strong> problems, boot your computer in <strong>Safe Mode with networking
</strong>and<strong> Clean Boot :<br />
<br />
Here is how you do it :</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<span><span><br />
To use a Safe mode with networking option, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose Safe mode with networking in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
For more information on Safe mode with Networking&nbsp; see : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a>
</span></span><br />
<br />
You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup , and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab , click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart .<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I would be very careful buying a machine with no OS on it.</p>
<p>People do wipe their&nbsp;machines because of&nbsp;their information on it&nbsp;but you would expect them to reinstall the Operating System back to Factory Settings (new condition) to sell it.</p>

<p>"As laptops get smaller and PDA-style mobile phones get larger, a loose coalition of companies, including Microsoft and Intel, have been pushing a new category of mobile computing product, called the Ultramobile PC, or UMPC. The first generation of these
 handheld PCs, including the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/Samsung_Q1_Ultramobile_PC/4505-3126_7-31781057.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Samsung Q1</a> and the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/Sony_VAIO_UX50/4505-3126_7-31958097.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sony VAIO UX50</a>, fell short of the mark, offering limited battery life, outdated components, and awkward user interfaces. While upcoming pocket-size systems, such as the
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-12760_7-9675597-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OQO Model 02</a> and the
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/8301-12760_7-9673222-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VAIO UX Premium</a>, show promise, Asus has taken a different track with the R2H Ultra-Mobile PC, using a larger, brick-size design to house a generous 7-inch touch screen. The middling
 Celeron M performance and the lack of a slide-out keyboard will turn off many users, but at $999, it's the cheapest UMPC we've seen, and it's the one that's best suited for viewing media files.
</p>
<p>Measuring 9.2 inches wide, 5.2 inches deep, and 1.1 inches thick, the Asus R2H is at the upper end of the UMPC category. It's not nearly as pocket-size as the Sony VAIO UX50, and it will fit in only the largest of jacket pockets. Weighing 2.4 pounds (3.1
 pounds with the AC adapter), it's actually heavier than the <a href="http://www.cnet.com/Fujitsu_LifeBook_P1610_Core_Solo_1_2GHz_1GB_RAM_80GB_HDD/4505-3121_7-32136367.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fujitsu LifeBook P1610</a> ultraportable laptop. Compared to other UMPCs, it feels unreasonably heavy and bulky, but taken as a portable Web-surfing, media-playing box, it's easy to tote around in a shoulder bag or a backpack.
</p>
<p>The 7-inch LCD offers an unusual 800x480 <a href="http://www.answers.com/native%20resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
native resolution</a>. Images and text appear nice and crisp at the default setting, but screen real estate is severely limited. There's an included application that lets you easily set a higher extrapolated resolution--something you would never do on a standard
 laptop. With it, you can set the resolution at 800x600 or 1,024x600, which makes for a less cramped Web-surfing experience but also loses some sharpness and image quality. The 800x600 setting offers the best compromise in terms of image quality and viewing

<p>Lacking the slide-out keyboard of the Sony VAIO UX or the OQO, the R2H's biggest hurdle is with inputting information. You have a variety of interface options, none of which are sufficient on their own. Most basic screen navigation can be accomplished through
 a thumb stick to the right of the display. It acts as a mouse, moving the cursor around the screen. To the left of the display are two mouse buttons, easily clicked with your left thumb. The thumb stick takes a little getting used to, but anyone who has used
 a pencil-eraser-style laptop nub (I'm looking at you, ThinkPad owners) should get the hang of it in short order. Below the mouse buttons on the left side is a four-way rocker control, used to navigate around large documents. With the screen's low native resolution,
 that will include pretty much any Web page or office document. On the right side, below the thumb stick, are page-up and page-down buttons, good for fast scrolling."

            I have a similar problem.&nbsp; However, after trying the "Explorer" option I get the error message<br />
<br />
"Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item".<br />
<br />
This is in the admin profile.&nbsp; I can't install any of the above either as I can't access anything on my laptop, there's just a blank screen.

            There is generally malicious software afoot.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You need to get your desktop working, then you can resolve your potential malware issue.<br />
<br />
From your background image, press CTRL-ALT-DEL and open Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Look at the Processes tab and if the explorer.exe process is not running, launch it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Click File, New Task and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%windir%\explorer.exe<br />
<br />
Click OK and see if you get your desktop back.<br />
<br />
If explorer.exe is already running, it is likely the object of the affliction and may need to be replaced (not hard).<br />
<br />
If explorer.exe is running, using Task Manger, End the explorer.exe process and launch a new one as indicated above.<br />
<br />
Report back for what to do next

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>when I try to download my Profile to my Xbox 360, I get an error that I can not download it right now. The error Code is&nbsp;801540A9.</p>
<p>But this error does not disappear, so I am not able to use my savegames,&nbsp;achievement, the Xbox live gold or all the games I bought online.</p>
<p>So please, Xbox support team, is there any solution to fix this?</p>
<p>I tried to clear Xbox cache and all that stuff, but it did not help. I think there is some problem with my account...</p>

<h2>            BUG&#58; Can&#39;t recover Skype account and can&#39;t delete UNKNOWN Skype contacts from my Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I have about 100 contacts linked to my Microsoft account (as shown on people.live.com) who aren't mine and I can't figure out a way to delete them. My whole Windows 10 calendar is filled with random birthdays of people I have no clue who they are. It looks
 like they are Skype contacts, but when I try to recover the Skype account linked with my Microsoft account, Skype denies it and tells me they can't verify it's me. I've tried contacting both Microsoft &amp; Skype via phone and no one understands the issue. I've
 been told my Microsoft account isn't linked with any Skype account, but it clearly is, as you can see in this cropped screenshot (I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE PEOPLE):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb0458ca-c558-4840-a526-1a2ff5819a46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb0458ca-c558-4840-a526-1a2ff5819a46" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know ANY of these people. I've been told I have to "recover" my Skype, but I've tried MULTIPLE times and Skype always denies that I own the account. I'm guessing the Skype account was hacked. I don't even care about recovering my old Skype account,
 but I don't want random people's birthdays on my Windows 10 Calendar, for example!</p>

            I've already tried. Skype won't do anything because they don't think it's my account even though it's tied to my Microsoft account. I don't see why this can't be fixed by Microsoft as it's obviously an issue with the Microsoft account and not Skype.<br />
<br />
Can someone from Microsoft please help? I don't want to have to create a new Microsoft account, but I don't want to see 100+ unknown people in my contact list that I can't remove.

<h2>            windows 10 High CPU Usage</h2>
                    guys im having some serious problem with my pc. a day or two ago i started noticing my pc is way slower than usual. Then i opened task manager and cpu usage was hanging around 70-100%. Also another weird thing is when i open task manager again the cpu
 usage lowers all the way down and when i close it, it moves back up again. Before those 2 days i had e3400 which worked fine and after That i bought q8400. it worked great in beginning. I Keep checking what's using the CPU upto 100% but everything is just
 0-1% usage.

<h2>            Surface RT couldn&#39;t complete the updates undoing changes loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>This morning I tried to run updates and after almost two hours the Surface RT restarted and now all it shows is "We couldn't complete the updates undoing changes don't turn off your computer"&nbsp;&nbsp; - What should I do?&nbsp; it has been doing the same for over 2hrs
 now.</p>
<p>thank you. </p>
