<h2>            VBA to copy 1st sheet of all workbooks with formats and values, but no formulas into new workbooks</h2>
                    <p>This is probably an easy one, because I think I just need one code added. The code below copies everything perfectly to the new location, but it brings over the formulas; I do not want the formulas I want to copy the formating then the values.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 inbox weird issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that cannot move more than one email at a time.&nbsp; If she selects two or more emails an error pops up "Cannot move the items unknown error" however a few seconds after the error box comes up the first email selected gets moved to the folder.
 The others deselect and don't get moved. This happens only with the Inbox all other folders work correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried to fix the issue</p>
<p><span>I tried installing another profile for the user. &nbsp;Her old and new profile give the same error message.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>If the user accesses the&nbsp;web portal the error does not happen.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I sincerely apologize for not being able to answer your concern in a timely manner. In addition to what
JMH3143 posted above, we’d like you to provide us the answers to the following questions that I have enumerated below. These will help us to investigate your concern:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Which email application are you using? Are you&nbsp;accessing your account&nbsp;through Web browser&nbsp;or an email client?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>What is the complete error message?</span></li><li><span>Which programs are you referring to?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>For a workaround, try to copy the emails and paste it in the Microsoft Office Word document. Also, try to update your JavaScript software in your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

</p><p>I bought my phone about 12 months ago and now it is out of warranty. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise I find that people with lesser models than mine (820, 720, 625, 520 etc.) have already received the Black Update but my phone has not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still stuck on Build ID: 3047.0000.1326.10144</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it because my phone is out of warranty and I am no longer "licensed" by Microsoft to receive anymore updates or what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to get some of the features of the Black Update by registering my phone as a "Developer Phone" and yet for some reason I am still isolated when it comes to receiving the complete Black Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone has some answers out there as to how to tackle the rot that is Microsoft and Nokia in this respect because frankly it is reaching a point where I will prefer to say "Sayonara" to my Lumia and switch over to the iPhone 6 when it launches.</p>

    <title>Where is the update log for Windows Phone 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where is the update log for Windows Phone 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As the initial version of Windows Phone 8 seemed very "unfinished", I was glad to see that an update was released today. I just installed it, and the phone said I could go to
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowsphone.com</a> to se the update log. I feel really stupid, because I am not able to find this update log anywhere. I have found the update logs for Windows Phone 7, but not for Windows Phone 8. Where is it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            It's probably not up yet. Can't find it either. Maybe waiting until it's for all devices. Also, the message may have said to visit windowsphone.com to see how to install updates.<br />
<br />
What the update contains may be found in Settings&gt;phone update.<br />

<p>Once again, this is one thing that shows how uncomplete the whole system is. Why releasing an upgrade without publishing the release notes, when they know that the phone will inform the users of that release notes is to be found at a certain website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't remember the exact text that was shown, but it was not about "how to install". That would be even worse, as the information was given after the update had been succesfully installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Settings &gt; phone update only shows if the phone is updated and settings to how updates should be downloaded.</p>

            <p>Soooo frustrating you can be Microsoft! You do some cool things, create nice products and then you completely confuse your followers (some of whom, myself included, want to give you some love)&nbsp;with something daft everyday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I wake up to my new phone telling me about new OS&nbsp;updates. I get all excited and tell them to install whilst I go take a shower. I&nbsp;return to the phone telling me that the updates are installed and if I want to know the details, I need to go to
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowsphone.com</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I'm angry because it's a 'smart' phone that is capable of displaying text as well as amazing pictures, correct? So why not just ask me if I'm interesting in seeing 'what's new' and then tell me??? It's that simple!</p>
<p>Second, I go to <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowsphone.com</a> to look at what may have been installed (on my nice big monitor) and can I see a big sign saying 'Update log' flashing in pseudo neon lights? No. Can I find it anywhere on
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowsphone.com</a>? Nope. Can I find it on a search engine? Yes, search for 'Windows phone 8&nbsp;update log' and right at the top is - not the log but this thread!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>???????????????????????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programmers fix bugs and hand over their work to the distribution team who do....what exactly? Not their jobs for a start!
</p>
<p>I think I would be fired if I did it in the company I work for? Yes, yes, the boss just told me, I would have been fired.</p>

<h2>            How to apply a style set&#47;template to a set of existing documents&#63; Word 2010</h2>
                    I have an interesting problem that I have been working on for several days and have made very little to no progress. I'm trying to change a pretty lengthy set of existing documents and being able to quickly change future documents to adhere to a certain
 template/style set and have had no luck thus far. This software that we use at &nbsp;my place of work spits out word docs in a certain format (and we are unable to change the way it spits them out), and we have been manually changing them to our preferred format.
 I am able to edit these documents and I've attempted to save and test several quick style sets to make it a one-click option on new documents, making it very simple to change them over (with little luck - several formatting issues still present), my problem
 exists in the fact that one of the reasons my created style sets don't work perfectly is because the default left and right margins are not the same as our preferred format. How do I make a one-click style set, or a template

            Just to clarify one point: There's nothing in styles or style sets that will affect margins. That's why you need Doug's macro. Styles are concerned exclusively with fonts and paragraph properties, while margins are properties of sections (for which there
 are no styles, unfortunately).<br />

<div>Thanks everyone for your help! Now, how do I apply this template to existing documents that have the wrong formatting? And is there a way for me to attach a style set to this template that also changes the styles of the existing documents? Or do I have
 to create an independent quick style set?</div>

            Assuming that this new template contains styles with the same names as the styles in the documents you're reformatting... This is not a style set, it's just the definitions of the styles in the formatting you want.<br />
<br />
Create a macro in the template with Doug's code in it -- you need a Sub statement at the beginning and an End Sub statement at the end, like this:<br />
<br />
Sub FixMargins()<br />
&nbsp; With ActiveDocument.PageSetup<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; .LeftMargin = 72<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; .RightMargin = 72<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; .TopMargin = 72<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; .BottomMargin = 72<br />
&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Make a button for it on the Quick Access Toolbar. See <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm</a> if needed.<br />
<br />
When you get a document from the software, go to the Developer tab, click the Document Template button, check the "Automatically update document styles" box, click the Attach button, and select your template. Click OK. Then
<b>immediately</b> go back to the same dialog and uncheck the Automatically update box. (For an explanation of why this is necessary, see
<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/templates/attachtemplate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/templates/attachtemplate.html</a>.)<br />
<br />
Click the button to run the FixMargins macro.<br />
<br />
That should do it, unless we've missed something.<br />

            Thanks again, I'm making even more progress! I have another question on editing the styles. I have text that is formatted like this:
<div><br />
<div>1.0<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><u>Insert Text Here</u> </div>
<div><u><br />

<div><br />
1.0<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Insert Text Here</u>
<div><u><br />
</u>
<div>I've fixed the formatting manually and then right clicked on Heading 1 and clicked "Update Heading 1 to Match Selection", the problem is, when I put it back to the incorrect formatting and click on Heading 1, it remains as the incorrect formatting. It's
 as if the modifications don't stick. Here's the formatting description:</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Font: (Default) Times New Roman Bold, 12 pt, Underline, Small caps, Indent:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; First line: &nbsp;0.5", Justified</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Line spacing: &nbsp;single, Space</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; After: &nbsp;12 pt, Widow/Orphan control, Keep with next, Keep lines together, Level 1, Outline numbered + Level: 1 + Numbering Style: 1, 2, 3, … + Start at: 1 + Alignment: Left + Aligned at: &nbsp;0.5" + Indent at: &nbsp;0", Style: Linked, Automatically update,

 point me in the right direction? One is the correct formatting (although with the wrong styles), and the other is the output of our software (what I want to be able to change in a couple of clicks). I can also send the template that I've created, although
 not as much progress has been made as I would like. This is a lot to ask, but I'm at a loss on what to do, and being an extremely tech savvy person, this is very frustrating.

<p>It is simple enough. First thing to remember is never post anything on a file share (share being the key word!) site (public or private) that you wouldn't be willing to see posted on a public bill board.</p>
<p>Create a "sanitized" version of the file that does not contain any sensitive personal or corporate information</p>
<p>Pick a file share service:, Skydrive, Fyels, Ge.tt, Crate, to name a few) and sign up for a FREE account</p>
<p>Follow their instructions to upload the file and to mark is as public shared</p>
<p>Copy the link to the file</p>

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Issues with Microsoft Edge could be due to some updates , app-specific error, and other factors. To isolate this, you can send us a screenshot of the error page. When did the issue start? Does performing a soft reset made any differences? Press and hold
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> button until the phone vibrates and restart. Also make sure that your phone is up-to-date. You can go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update</strong> <strong>&amp; security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>To what format are you converting the Publisher file? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are converting to HTML then you are likely to fail. Publisher will choke when trying to convert some print formatting into HTML or web formatting as there are no equivalents in some cases. Then Publisher will often convert those parts of the page
 into pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what kind of format you need for ebooks but if you can use PDF then Publisher will do a better job for you. You might also find Word a better choice for producing your manuscript.</p>

<h3> buxz777  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8&#47;C7 PURPLE SCREEN ISSUE AND HOW TO SPOT IF YOU HAVE IT PLEASE READ</h2>
                    
<p>MODS THIS IS NOT A POLL OR IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM A VOTING THREAD IT IS A THREAD TO WARN USERS ABOUT THE PURPLE SCREEN ISSUE AND HOW TO SPOT IT IN THEIR PHONES CLEAR AS DAY , I HAVE BEEN INFORMED FROM THE DIRECTOR OF COMUNICATIONS AT NOKIA VIA TWITTER THAT
 THIS THREAD IS OK AND THE TEST IMAGE IS FINE TO LOAD UP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>--------------------------------------------</em></p>
<p><em>The following has been added by vandelay (Nokia administrator) :</em></p>
<p><em>Please note that there is normally a slight variation in the purple color level in each display unit. This is related to the display manufacturer's optical tuning process. However, some Nokia C7 and Nokia N8 users seem to be experiencing a slightly higher
 level of purple color tint on their device screens.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Nokia Care's technical experts told me that the easiest way to spot this problem is to just look at the black idle screen of the device - if there is a clear purple color tint on the idle screen, you should have the device inspected at a Nokia Care point.
 They will repair the device the device under warranty if there is a clear defect in the device.</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>So seeing some purple on the test image does not necessarily mean that your screen is faulty, but we hope that it helps some people to decide whether they should visit a Nokia Care point.</em></p>
<p><em>(end of vandelay's addition)<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>--------------------------------------------</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as you may or may not have read many n8s and c7s have a purple tint issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this can easily be spoted by saving the picture below to your pc , transfering it to your n8/c7 , then viewing the image in your gallery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the image shows purple squares in some areas then iam afraid you have one of the screens that is showing defects in gradiation of colurs and the greyscale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are also many n8s out in the wild that dont have this problem , i have 3 n8s , my gfriend has one , hers is perfect and shows the test image with no purple tint at all my three n8s all have purple tint and some display it worse then others</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the test image can be viewed on any brightness and it should display just as it does on your monitor screen ,my gfriends n8 displays the image perfect under all brightness levels yet my three n8s show the purple tint heavily on low brightness and not as
 much on full brightness</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the test image can also be viewed via tv out and hdmi out and again if you have a defect screen you will see the image perfect on your tv yet on your n8 screen you will have purple tints</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is the test image for you to load to your device and view via the gallery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2foi53.tinypic.com%2f2ivlhcl.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as stated above if you have one of the screens with defects in colour gradiation you will see some of the squares as purple</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this shouldnt be happending as there n8s out there that display the test image perfectly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from all my research on this in the last month and my time studying ICT systems support in which i have a diploma , it seems clear to me that nokia have used at least two screens in the build of the n8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>many phones bought between october launch and december dont have the problem yet there are still some that do but not as many as now , phones bought from the end of december up untill current date seem to have the issue moreand its now nearly impossible
 to find one without the purple tint issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this leads me to believe that from the start nokia were using at least two screen in the n8 , then one started to run out around december and by the end of december a huge majority of n8/c7 handsets have the troubles, if not all of them shipped after december</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>infact ive been to every phone shop in lakeside , chelmsford , colchester which included : carphone warehouse , o2 , vodafone , orange , three ,&nbsp; phones4u , tmobile all n8/c7 handsets i asked to look at had the problem not one n8 i looked at didnt have the
 issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have been in contact with nokia care escalation team , all they did is send me very badly refurbed handsets back for my brand new n8s ,&nbsp; which across all three handsets had the following faults</p>
<p>#hdmi covers scratched and worn</p>
<p>#no imei number under the hdmi cover on one of them</p>
<p>#torx screws on battery cover very worn</p>
<p>#plastic top caps not fitted right</p>
<p>#one had a huge gap between the silver screen surround and the main chasis of n8</p>
<p>#they all still had purple tint issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so nokia sent me three refurbed handsets for my brand new n8s , i obvously complained as they were so new i could have taken them back to the shops with the reciept but now nokia had changed the imei numbers my reciept was useless , i said i should be sent
 three brand new n8s , they again sent me badly refurbed handsets just as bad as the 1st lot and again all three of them had purple screen issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i complained again and this time supervsior took over the case and agreed that 3 new n8s should be sent to me as mine was so new , she got them sent out and this time they were new but they still have the purple screen issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thats a toatal 12 n8s direct from nokia and all of them have had the issue&nbsp; so i cant recomend going to a nokia care point or nokia care uk as the refurbs i was sent was a complete joke and looked like they were just used handsets that had been through a
 rough time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>through this month of me talking to nokia and sending emails and getting these phones swapped back to a condition of the phones that i sent them , they have said they are investigating it and taking it seriously however after some of their actions towards
 users (myself included) on these forums it doesnt seem like they are taking it very serious at all , they have known about it for a month now and we still have not had an offical response from nokia themselves</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are many more threads about this issue across the net and if you google n8 screen problems or n8 purple screen problems you will come acroos many many pages of unhappy users from all across the globe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i just hope nokia sort this out soon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ho do you users with the problem feel about this issue and how do you think nokia should resolve it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>id be happy for a screen swap at a nsc or via warranty postal repair as long as it could be done quickly and the user wasnt without their phone for too long after all this is nokias mistake and not the users that bought the phone so all fixes should be at
 minimal disturbance to them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>heres hoping when you test the image your not as unlucky as me and many other n8 owners from across the globe , its a brilliant phone but this screen issue lets it down alot especially during watching films and stuff</p>

<p>You can only find out if you take it in for servicing. Allegedly Nokia has stated that they are aware of this issue and have recommended that everyone affected approaches their local NCC. You should do the same.</p>

<p>sorry to hear you guys are having troubles too , its a shame sucha&nbsp; great device as the nokia n8 has had an issue like this arise , it is effecting alot of n8/c7 handsets and is quite a widespread issue across the globe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it would be great to hear from as many users as possible about this and what they think about it as a user of the c7/n8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>jimmyireland about your post mate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes it was written by me and yes it ws deleted not once but 3or4 times actually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the mods said it was because i had set up a poll and voting system , so i read through forum rules and posted it again with what fitted their guidelines and even put in big caps that it was not a poll but a thread to help users identify a problem and discuss
 it which is what the forum is for , it was deleted again , i then posted it again with just the test image and how to spot the problem and again put big caps that the post fitted their guidelines and was just to help users , it was again deleted and i was
 banned by mods for 2 days saying that i had broke forum rules and posted a poll and that the test image wasnt a proper test image</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i then asked other users to post the image but when they tryed nokias spam filter kicked in with a message saying that their post contained spam and that they should write it again and try posting again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to be honest it really looked like they were trying to cover up the issue , fair enough my 1st post could be considered a very very rough poll but the posts i made afterwards were edited to fit nokias guidelines and they still removed them ad banned me and
 then other users posts were marked as spam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i tweeted alot of people and even nokia have said that as long as the post doesnt contain polls/votes then it will be fine to postand that mods shouldnt delete it , which was excellent news and hopefull this thread will stay and users can load the image
 and test their screens and then discuss the issue here so nokia can see users discussion in one thread , it will alo help awareness of the issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hence this post that isnt a poll but a thread to help users identify wether their n8/c7 has a screen with a defect in the gradiation of colours</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as stated in original post not all n8s have this problem my gfriends doesnt and it displays the test image perfectly on all brightness settings , yet my n8s show the image as very purple on low brightness and the brighter the screen goes the less the purple
 is shown , it is still there just not as visible as it is in the lower brightness settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as i also mentioned many n8s between october and mid december are fine although some still have the problem , yet from mid december till current date the amount of n8s with purple issue is much much higher and it now seems very very rare that you will get
 a brand new n8 from the shops without this screen issue which leads me to believe that from launch nokia have used at least two screens in the builds of the n8 , some great screens and then the ones with dodgy purple tint , from the threads across the web
 it seems like the good screens nokia were using either run out or they have failed to source the same screen or the manufactuer of the screen has changed something</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iam not a nokia hater and iam not here to cause trouble or loose nokia sales etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i love nokia have used them for years and used symbian since the 6680 , iam always helping users across the web with their nokia problems and am an avid user on nokia users please check my profile and feel free to check my posts and how many times ive been
 thanked for being helpfull</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokiausers.net/forum/members/buxz777.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokiausers.net/forum/members/buxz777.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as you can see i love nokia and spend alot of time using their devices , speaking highly of them and helping their users with problems, i also love good customer services and customer relations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i understand that big companys have build issues iam a gadget lover and trained in ict supprt iam not silly and understand that these things happend and building these phones with such complicated electronics and some could end up with issues , it could
 happend to anyone , sony , apple , samsung , blackberry , lg etc etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however its how the companys react to these issues and relate to their customers that have spent 100s of pounds on their devices that is important , issues do arise , its how the company looks after its customers thats important</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i think alot of users think the same , they dont expect nokia to click their fingers and go heres a fix but they do expect nokia to investigate the issue and they do expect nokia to relate to its customers and not ignore them or the issue which is what it
 looks like when posts are deleted and users are banned for posting informative posts that help users identify a problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>things like sending users really bad refurbs for brand new n8s also dont help users confidence in nokia statement of going to nokia care about the problem as all i got was second hand looking n8s that still have the problem they were sent off with and the
 originals were in much better condition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like i say iam not here to cause trouble and i love nokia the n8 is the best phone ive ever had and its almost my dream device and everything ive wanted on a device for years its the ultimate convergance device and agadget lovers dream , however when you
 see your gfriends and some of your mates n8 screens display the test image perfect then your n8 display it with a very purple hue it does dissapoint you and you do hope that nokia will take notice and fix the issue with the least amunt of hassle to the users</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers jimmy and sorry about the long post just wanted to clear some things up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now lets get back to discussing the issue and what other users think about it</p>

<p>Cheers for the great posts Buzx and for championing this issue.</p>
<p>I have this issue as well and just hope there is a Firmware fix as I can't see Nokia recalling all these phones.</p>
<p>I would have thought that they would have learnt from Apples PR shambles over the antenna issue on the I4, but judging by the overwhelming silence on this issue, apparently not.</p>

<p>iam sorry jimmy ireland&nbsp; but if thats the case then nokia should come out and say something like</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>''if users believe they are effected by the purple screen problem that has arisen on some n8 and c7 handsets we know whats caused it and it can fixed via nsc centre or via postal warranty service ''</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all we have had is standard replys from nokia mods that can not be taken as offical statements as they are standard replys to users who think they have issues on many threads</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there has been no offical statement or repair procedure put in place so users dont even know if it can be fixed etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nokia should come out on nokia conversations and say they have a fix if there is one at least users will know it can be fixed , it will be fixed and itll be worth the time it takes to fix it as it wont come back the same or a refurbed handset with the same
 problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the motherboard issue nokia were pretty good and come out and said they had identified the issue and it has been put right and to visit the nokia care points for it to be sorted out , why cant they do the same thing here if they have a fix and it can
 be done at nokia service centres</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pretty much all the service centres users have been to have said things like '' the n8 is designed like this'' many users have reported the same on forums , which makes me think do nokia service centres even know about it yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ive also tryed sending my n8s to nokia care uk and after an original swap and then two more doorstep swaps iam still no better off and still have the screen issue , this is why i think its important that nokia come out and say something through nokia conversations
 etc</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think there's a discussion any more - it's painfully obvious there is a major issue with handsets produced in all locations - Finland, China, Korea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are trying to make it as easy as possible for affected customers to identify whether they have the defective screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far the response from NCCs across the globe has been pitiful, to say the least. I sincerely hope that as many affected customers as possible go asap to their nearest NCC with their defective handsets in order to reach quicker the critical mass required
 for Nokia to acknowledge the probem publicly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that reason I fully agree with the recommendation given in this forum - take your defective handset to your nearest NCC and have it replaced. I would add - take the test image with you on a USB stick and test the new handset on the spot. If it's defective
 as well - insist on another replacement.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me and I want to apologize for my bad English! I tried the trouble shooter, didn't helped.</p>
<p>The problem occurred after updating to preview build 14316, before I was on consumer edition of windows 10 pro. The only think I can think of doing before is to load the new extensions on edge browser along them and the onenote extension. I also tried to
 disable them all and restarted the edge, didn't worked either.</p>
<p>Also I noticed when I press the make a note tool and right after the save to onenote which takes a full screeshoot, the image is all right without any problems, so this occurs only when I use the clip tool to clip a portion of the screen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If everyone else who isn't with shaw.ca is receiving your emails then the issue is with shaw - who it would seem is either blocking your email server's IP address or shaw.ca is temporarily having issues of their own. Outlook doesn't pick and choose what
 emails get sent to the SMTP server and has no control over what the Telus SMTP server does or doesn't send etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short - you need to check with Telus on your end and your recipients need to check with Shaw on their end.</p>

            After opening the document, click File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced. Scroll down to the&nbsp; "Show document content" section of the dialog and click the Font Substitution button. The next dialog shows the list you want, and also shows which font is currently used
 as a replacement for each of the missing fonts.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there's no way to copy the list to paste elsewhere for later use, except to take a screen shot of the dialog. As far as I can tell, VBA doesn't have access to a collection of the names of fonts being substituted.<br />

                    <span>Hi, does anyone know if there are alternative synchronisation programs available on the market. I face various problems with MS mobile device center and active sync which i would like to address. I own a samsung
 omnia i900 with windows mobile 6.1<br />
<br />
a) it's allows for very limited folder selection - ie when having two accounts (pst/exchange or multiple pst files) - I want to be be able to select the entire 'mail tree'
<br />
b) 2 different programs for vista and xp - i would lik to work with one sync program on xp and vista to rule out incompatibility issues<br />
c) it's not transparent in what data it syncs - i want to see logs what data it exchanges.<br />
d) i can't find the option to change the way contacts are stored. i would like to see it first name, last name.<br />
<br />
I had a nokia phone and their software suite is really good and transaparent in what fields and data it updated.<br />
<br />
to be honest, i can't believe that there is such limited integration and interaction between programs made by one vendor being MS and what they produced is more a shame then a blessing....<br />
<br />
Hope someone can suggest a good alternative.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

                    Last week I bought Microsoft Lumia 532 and it's my very first smart phone. I am very much interested GIS (geographic Information system) I used to contribute to openstreetmap (http://hdyc.neis-one.org/?Umapathy) and I also take photo and upload it to panoramio
 (http://www.panoramio.com/user/69195). Uploaded photos if selected will appear in google earth, google maps and etc. I am relatively new to lumia is there any place I can set the camera to take photo with the geotag (I mean location infor where the photo was
 taken. i.e&nbsp; latitude and the longitude as it is having gps) automatically.&nbsp; That will simply my work.

<h2>            How to use Avery Business Card Template with Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a Microsoft Online Customer Service, who contacting on behalf of my customer. He is unable to use Avery Avery Business Card Template with Word 2010. And he couldn't find it on the Tool option of Word 2010.
</p>
                </div>

            If your customer is trying to use one of the "templates" that can be downloaded from www.avery.com (which are .doc document files and not .dot template files), that isn't necessary. Everything needed to create business cards on Avery stock is built into
 Word.<br />
<br />
Also, Word 2010 doesn't have any "Tool option", but the use of term indicates that the customer was probably reading instructions for Word 2003 or earlier.<br />
<br />
The key is that business cards are handled as labels. In Word 2010, click the Mailings tab of the ribbon and then click the Labels button near the left end. Click the Options button in the Labels dialog. Open the "Label vendors" list box and choose Avery US
 Letter. In the "Product number" list, choose any of the Clean Edge Business Card items from #8869 through #8878 -- they're all the same layout.<br />
<br />
Simply filling in the text in the Address box of the Labels dialog is sufficient for all-text cards. If the customer wants to include graphics, he or she should read this page:

            Its a scam.&nbsp; A well known and long running one.&nbsp; Microsoft will never ask for personal details (they already have them) and will never cold call you or send out anti virus messages.<br />
Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that<br />
See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates: http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/msname.aspx answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/protect_other-protect_scanning/is-that-call-from-microsoft-a-scam/6718e389-8a00-4e4b-aca1-d07298ea4c19?rtAction=1405643984573<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What should you do if you receive a questionable email? DONT CLICK ON LINKS, Dont go to web sites that are suggested, dont give access, or volunteer information (usually if you mouse over links they will not point to Microsoft)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate the information.<br />
Take some time and check up on the information. Often sites like snopes.com can provide information on known chain letters and other scams and untruths.&nbsp; Do not click on links within the mail, but do go to that company’s website, and contact their customer
 service reps via phone or online to verify the validity of the email.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report suspicious activities.<br />
If you think someone has accessed your Outlook.com account, that the Live ID sign-in page looks fraudulent, or you receive an email that tries to confirm a password change you didn’t authorize, change your password immediately by going to: http://account.live.com.
 Next, help ensure your PC has not been infected with a virus or malware by running a free full-PC scan.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help the Outlook.com team identify new scams.<br />
Click on the Junk button in Outlook.com and select “Junk” or “Report phishing scam” to report it to the Outlook.com team. Whatever you do, do not reply back to the sender.<br />
If you think you might be a victim of fraud, you can report it.<br />

<h2>            Excel Mac 2016 not scrolling sheet tabs in full screen mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I've seen this problem in at least two posts, but in neither one is Microsoft seeming to understand the problem or to provide a solution. So here goes again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a workbook with around 200 individual worksheets. Needless to say, the tab strip navigation at the bottom doesn't show them all, and I use the two arrow keys bottom left to navigate. In Windowed mode, this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In full screen mode, though, it doesn't. Not left click, not right click. Not CMD-click. Nothing works. If I want to scroll the tabs so that I can select the next set of worksheets, I have to take Excel out of full screen mode, navigate to where I want to
 go, and then put it back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to do some analysis which requires me to keep selecting different sheets to see the data in them. Needless to say, this is intensely irritating!</p>

            <p>Is your installation of Office 2016 fully updated? It should be at v15.23.2 or higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several versions back there was an issue with a yellow tip box obstructing access to the arrows. This has been improved significantly but may still present a problem in Full Screen view. Unfortunately, I don't have O2016 available right now to verify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is what you're referring to, make sure the tip of the pointer is <em>not</em> on the yellow tip box... point to the arrow space to the left of it. That should at least allow right-clicking to bring up a list of sheet names to select from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that isn't the issue &amp; your software is fully updated, use the ☺ at the right end of the Excel Ribbon to submit the details to Microsoft.</p>

    <title>On opening a Word file via Explorer, error&#58; The command cannot be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; ic2  say:</h3>
<h2>            On opening a Word file via Explorer, error&#58; The command cannot be performed because a dialog box is opened</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2016, running on W10 Professional, when I double click a .docx file, I get an error box saying "The command cannot be performed because a dialog box is opened". Dutch: De opdracht kan niet worden uitgevoerd, omdat er een dialoogvenster is geopend.
 Sluit het dialoogvenster om door te gaan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that moment I have no other documents or Word versions open. I can just click this away and continue but it's annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution I found (for older Word versions) are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 A Norton Antivirus problem (no because I do not use that)</p>
<p>2 Rename Officeav.dll&nbsp; , an older DLL which could cause it. This file is not present on my PC</p>
<p>3 A macro present in the startup template. This is not the case either. In %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates, there's only normal.dot. Renaming it creates a new one with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could have something to do with Office 2003 in use on the same PC, which is documented to be possible. My preferred solution would be that a double click on a .DOC(x) document opens Word 2003 but using Open with and then pointing to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
 Office\OFFICE11\Winword.exe still opens it with Office 2016. I have Office 2016 on my PC for being able to open the latest documents but I prefer Office 2003 in almost every aspect above Office&nbsp; 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else could cause it?</p>

            <p>Since you are running both Office 2016 and 2003 on the same machine, and you want Office 2003 to be the default, clear the option (in Word 2013) at File | Options | General that says "Tell me if Microsoft isn't the default application for viewing and editing
 documents." Most likely, doing that would improve the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tested thouroughly what happens if you keep, say, Word 2016 open and then double-click a *.docx file. It is quite possible that the open version of Word also tries to open the file, which is why you have to make sure that no dialog box is open
 in whatever version of Word is running at the time that you double-click.</p>

            <p>Hello Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. Something seems to have changed with your tip: after I cleared the box, the message was limited to files which are password protected as you can see below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3357217-aa2c-44d9-98af-4aa267968c09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3357217-aa2c-44d9-98af-4aa267968c09" /></a></p>
<p>This was actually the situation I had with an earlier installation of Office 2016. Remarkable thing is that after checking the box again, some other (non password protected documents) which opened with the above error earlier today now opened without the
 error. So it must have cleared something, but </p>
<p>1) it is not solved as you see </p>
<p>2) I am still unable to set Office 2003 as default. E.g. for .doc opening with Word 2003 would be nice, but Settings/Standard apps doesn't let me chose anything else than Word 2016 or an app from the store, and as said, Open with, pointing to winword.exe
 in the Office 11 folder still redirects to Office 2016 (note: not Office 2013 as you wrote).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even renaming winword.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16 to winword2016.exe is not the solution. It does enable me to chose Office 2003 again but it won't start Word&nbsp; 2016 anymore (nothing happens when I click the renamed .exe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I installed Office 2016 is that I actually like one program in it: OneNote 2016. The problem is, when I install only OneNote 2016 (even the free version), Office 2003 gives opening errors on some documents (mainly some docx files). This
 problem is immediately gone after I uninstall Onenote 2016 and re-appears when I install it again or install Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically to me it seems that there are quite some elements deliberately programmed in Office 2016 to "discourage" the use of older programs. Just like we need to revert to a few tracks to get back the Windows 7 games, the previous much better
 working calculator, or the Start menu in Windows 10. Some things certainly improved in newer software versions like Windows 10 or Office 2016 but it's a pity that more productive solutions are replaced and not or difficult to get back. Word and Excel 2003
 are much faster, the regular menu's are more logical and faster to browse, it has a help file which does need an internet connection and Excel 2003 can export more file formats. I write this just to explain why I want to keep using Office 2003 for most of
 my work which probably sounds like an odd choice.</p>

            If you start Word first, can you then open these files by navigating to them in the Open dialog box? If that works, you may have to keep doing that as a workaround.

            <p>Hello Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that way it works fine. To open files via Word as a workaround is not really needed because it's always more clicks than double clicking a file, even with this extra click. Note that I
<strong>can </strong>open such a file with clicking away the dialog. But it shouldn't happen. I had this problem earlier as well. After a clean reinstall of my PC I worked since August with only Office 2003. Then I reinstalled Office 2016 and found that this
 error returned. Maybe it is somehow related to Office 2003 on the system. Another problem I had earlier with Office 2016 was gone however: the previous installation did not show any help telling me that "I need an internet connection" for that which I obviously
 had. This now works fortunately.</p>

            <p>The workaround will be a little quicker if you use the Ctrl+O shortcut to go directly to the Open dialog box. Note that for this to work you must select "Don't show the Backstage when opening or saving files" at File | Options | Save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I don't know why the workaround is necessary. It appears that Word, for the affected documents,&nbsp;can't handle the password dialog box when it pops up.</p>

<h2>            1 user 2 pc Office Home and business 2010 dvd</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased a DVD full version of Office Home and Business </p>
<p>the product descriptions are as follows:</p>
<p>Licensed for use on two PCs by 1 user, Microsoft <strong>Office Home and Business 2010</strong> provides you with all the essential tools you need to work effectively, whether dealing with household matters or work. Included in this package are Word 2010,
 Excel 2010, PowerPoint 2010, OneNote 2010, and Outlook 2010.<br />
</p>
<p>Can we install it on two separate PCs for our company use? Two different persons will&nbsp;use the different machines. Does that count as one user? As the company is the user, in effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do we need to uninstall the old version Office first then install the Office 2010?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>Under the actual terms of the licence, its licensed for use by a single person on two devices. Generally two devices, under MS terms is a desktop &amp; portable.</p>
<p>MS has no means of identifying the actual useage or sys its installed on (Other than the number of times its being activated)</p>
<p>You dont have to uninstall the prior version, the std install of 2010 will offer to 'upgrade' the earlier version. But you can uninstall any earlier version first, if you wish, no data is lost</p>

<h2>            Creating Multiple outlook.com Accounts for Outlook Training</h2>
                    <p>I am teaching' Outlook skills to a class of adult learners.&nbsp; The participants will come from outside the organisation to attend the training.&nbsp; The PCs I am using have Outlook 2010 installed and internet access.&nbsp; The venue I am using has Exchange and tight
 policies around creation of new accounts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Can I create multiple outlook.com accounts (learner1, learner2, etc) temporarily or permanently?</p>
<p>2. Can I set these accounts up in Outlook?</p>
<p>3. Will the participants be able to trade emails and meeting requests?</p>
<p>4. Will the participants be able to view each other's calendars for availability?</p>

            <p>1. Can I create multiple outlook.com accounts (learner1, learner2, etc) temporarily or permanently?</p>
<p>When you setup an Outlook.com account, you provide profile information.&nbsp; It would be simpler to create a new account and have the correct profile information than to rename learner1 and change the profile information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Can I set these accounts up in Outlook?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Will the participants be able to trade emails and meeting requests?</p>
<p>When you create learner1, you must use the account in the first 10 days&nbsp;to keep the account active and login at least every 270 days.&nbsp; If the account is active, the answer is Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Will the participants be able to view each other's calendars for availability?</p>
