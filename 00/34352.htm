</p><p>This did not solve my problem.&nbsp; I believe I did it properly.</p>
<p>

<p>I am sorry for bothering you - maybe.&nbsp; It was an act of frustration before I delved further.&nbsp; Thank you for your quick response.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be related to my inability to activate the microphone associated with a MS Lifecam - the software dvd indicates that it is level 3.0.&nbsp; Camera works fine and the whole device works on an old desktop converted to Win 10 from 7.&nbsp; That was my Skypeing
 machine prior to this new one.&nbsp; In addition, the mic works intermittently on the new one.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you or one of your colleagues help me in that area, or pass it to another group.&nbsp; Should I close my inquiry?</p>

</p><p>My PC is - ACER with Win 10 which I do my best to keep current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lifecam (as regard to the ACER) - the video works but not the audio across the apps I have tried - Skype and Cortana.&nbsp; When I try it on my old PC (converted now to Win 10) it works fine.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please try to install the classic Skype app and check if the same issue persist. You download the classic Skype app here:
<a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please also update your audio driver. Here’s how:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the
<strong>Start Windows logo button</strong>, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select
<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver: Open
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<p>Aljon_T,</p>
<p>Thanks for the help and input.&nbsp; I would like to close this item, however.&nbsp; There is no sense in installing a base Skype.&nbsp; THE WEBCAM MIC DOES NOT WORK!&nbsp; Skype was simply a convenient method of checking it out.&nbsp; Cortana is another, and neither can hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand why MS folks won't admit here that their (at least) 8-year old h'ware is not operative with Win 10.&nbsp; Apple does that sort of thing every time they put out a new release.&nbsp; I have moved on and ordered a new webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I believe that the reason the webcam still works on my CONVERTED Win10 machine is that it has ALWAYS worked on that machine and there was some residue of Win 7 left when I made the conversion.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E<br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

    <title>Static noice when moving the cursor with the charger plugged in. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Static noice when moving the cursor with the charger plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Surface Book 2 and I've been using it for a phew days.<br />
I've been working on it all day and just noticed that, when ever i move the cursor there is a static noise, so I did some testing:<br />
<br />
The noise is there both when using the touchpad and a mouse<br />
It is only there during the movement of the cursor (like dragging something over the ground)</p>
<p>It only happens when the charger is plugged in..<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Why is this and how is it fixed?..<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Did a little more testing. It is not confined to the cursor.&nbsp;<br />
Tried hovering the pen over the screen and the litle dot it makes also gives a static noise.<br />
So I opened netflix and muted the sound.. It is just the movement of anything on the screen that does this..</p>

<p>I won the same prize from the same contest. It can take a bit for the code to come to you. I won about few weeks back. It can take 8+weeks for you to receive the prize itself.

<p>Be patient and you shall receive.</p>

<h2>            BSOD and uploading dmp files.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few weeks I am getting BSODs randomly when I boot or reboot my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling windows 10 pro (64bit) but the crashes still occur. It is not always when I boot, sometimes it al goes ok.</p>
<p>While looking on the web I found the page to use the driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions on how to set it up and use it and as soon as i rebooted I got the crash again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to upload the dmp files so that people might be able to help me. </p>
<p>I read in this article what files to upload by OneDrive:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/bsod-finding-and-fixing-them/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are on my OneDrive but how do i get them to the people mentioned in the article?</p>

            First of all, Please turn off driver verifier.
<br />Second,
<br />The crashes point to Logitech Driver(either KB or mouse) which is known to cause crashes.
<br />Try reinstalling them and see if it fixes the issue.

<p><span>Hello thanks for the replies so far.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How do I turn it off? I think I did when I had to get into safe mode cause my reboots kept crashing</span></p>
<p><span>I used something in prompt verifier /reset or so...</span></p>

</p><p><span><em>The crashes point to Logitech Driver(either KB or mouse) which is known to cause crashes.

<span><em>Try reinstalling them and see if it fixes the issue.</em> </span>
</p>
<p>Is there anymore information on this like a source that is know to cause crashes.</p>
<p>These hardware items been out for a while now. I would expect Logitech/MS come up with a solution for that?</p>
<p>Could It be that the USB port is malfunctioning or is it really a driver issue?</p>

<br />Good . That means the Verifier is off.
<br />
<br />For some Reinstalling the drivers(possibly older versions) worked.

</p><p>Is it the same issue that is crashing? I did uninstall the logitech gaming software but perhaps it is just the keyboard or mouse that is faulty?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro hangs&#47;freezes on install and when running</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This has been happening for months now, when I install Windows 8 Pro from a USB Flash Drive it hangs and unfreezes around 10 minutes later.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit on a Medion MIM 2210 and it works perfectly nothing freezes up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It only happens with Windows 8 and I ran the upgrade assistants and the only thing that weren't compatible were programs e.g. Microsoft Security Essentials, I can't seem to find the problem although I think it has something to do when I insert a USB device
 because it did freeze when I got it installed a couple months back. I look at the system requirements and everything meets the standards.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Processor: Intel(R) Celeron(R) M CPU 410 @ 1.46GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 1.50GB</p>
<p>Hard Disk Space: 64.4 GB (10GB used for backup)</p>
<p>Graphics Card: VIA Chrome9 HC IGP WDDM 1.1 </p>
<p>Microsoft DirectX Version: DirectX 11</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also have a USB Mouse and Keyboard plugged in but my laptop keyboard doesn't work so it's essential, also I read somewhere that BIOS can be causing the issue so I tried to update it but I need the Medion Support disc what broke but I don't think it's the
 problem with me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've gone through all the forums and NOTHING I have found has helped solve this I'm really stumped at what to do :(</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it might be a problem with the RAM but it's installed and running now (only froze three times when installing) and it's fine for now, it's not froze once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Also how can I update the drivers? I used Device Manager but it said it couldn't find them and so I used DriverMax7 but when I download the drivers it gives me BlueScreen and restores. I don't download things of the internet without researching first so I've
 done nothing about it yet, there was one from the Medion website but you have to pay for it and I don't fancy doing that :/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did need help installing the BIOS update because it said I need the original disc what broke and they just sent me an email full of FAQ's, I'll see if I can update without the disc but if not I'll have to ring up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the freezing problem, I think it was caused by a program/Windows Update because I've only installed iTunes and Mp3tag and around 70 updates and it's all going fine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice anyway I'll go ahead and attempt to update the BIOS.</p>

            I've just tried it install Adobe Photoshop CS6 from the USB pen I have the installer on and it froze 3 times so it's definitely caused by using the USB hubs but I never had this problem with Windows Vista or 7 also I can run CD's fine with no crashing.

<h3> mzvalerie  say:</h3>
<h2>            System resume takes 10 minutes from hibernation after going back to Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron N7110 laptop and upgraded to Windows 10. After having trouble with getting my printer to work and occasional graphics probs I found through Dell website that Windows 10 was unsupported on my machine so I went back to Windows 7 Home
 Premium 64-bit. I used to have no problem resuming from Hibernation. It would take less than 30 seconds. But now it takes about 10 minutes!!!! (If I'm patient enough to not just restart it.) Any suggestions as to what I can do? Thanks!

            <p>If you used the "reversion" feature in Win 10, you are likely not ever going to have Win7 working again properly.&nbsp; It will likely require you to re-install Win7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Win10 back to Win7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a “Custom” install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not install anything <em><strong>but</strong> </em>Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates.&nbsp; This is the setting you will keep.&nbsp; Restart.&nbsp; Set Windows Update service to Stop.&nbsp; Start globe, type services in text boxt that pops up, select services from the list.&nbsp; Find Windows Update in the
 list, right-click and choose stop.</p>
<p>Download and install the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Now proceed to Windows Update and begin the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get the list of proposed updates (some 200 plus), look for the Windows Section in the Recommended update section.&nbsp; Find the updates in that section that are NOT labeled security.&nbsp; Click once on each.&nbsp; Right click and hide any and every update who’s
 date is after 2014.&nbsp; FYI, all updates after 2014 are to grease the skids to Windows 10 or install Microsoft spyware on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed to update.</p>
<p>Check Device manager to find out if any drivers are missing.&nbsp; Start globe, type device into the text box that pops up, click on Device manager.&nbsp; If you find any item in the list with a yellow exclamation point, that driver is missing.&nbsp; Install them from
 the USB stick you stored them on earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about a week&nbsp;after the 2nd Tuesday, you are going to start and run Windows update.&nbsp; From this point onward, you are going to hide every non-Security update
 in the Windows section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>

    <title>Cannot move or rename folders on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonia p_97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot move or rename folders on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so here's my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I run Windows 10 Pro on my PC, and I've noticed a while ago I couldn't move a folder on my Desktop. At first i've thought the folder in case was corrupted, but then I've tested with other folder and the problem repeated. It appears
 a little window saying it wasn't possible to locate the file, and told me to confirm if the file's location was correct. I tried to move other folders out of my Desktop, but it didn't work as well, appearing the same little window i said before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides that, I verified that if i created a "shortcut" for a folder, i could move and rename that "shortcut", but that's not happening with the original one, so I'm not understading... I'm starting to think there's some kind of bug on the operative
 system, because i've tried so many resolutions I'd seen in this community and none of them worked :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate a lot if anyone could help me with this problem. Have a nice day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I'm from Portugal, and i've exposed this problem to people from my country, they answered but what they said didnt apply to my problem, and after that, they ignored me basically...&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answering your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>What are the file formats saved in the folder?&nbsp;</strong>Mostly PDF, docx, pptx, JPG.</li><li><strong>Have you copied the files from an external drive or was it downloaded from the Internet?</strong> I think I've did both, but there's a bunch of them i've created myself (specially docx and pptx files). The ones i've downloaded are JPG or
 PDF files.</li><li><strong>Are you able to view the files in the folder? </strong>Yes, and I can open them aswell.</li><li><strong>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?&nbsp;</strong>I've tried to turn off the antivirus, I've tried to see if there was any administrator problem (It says my account is an administrator on this PC), I've confirmed if the folder's
 location was correct, I've tried some commands on Windows PowerShell, I've tried to restore my PC, in order to come back to a previous point where the problem didnt exist, but unfortunately, i couldnt do it, because of some error (i dont remember what kind)</li><li><strong>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message?&nbsp;</strong>I can, but it'll appear in Portuguese, I'm sorry :(<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c9d3813-90cf-48ed-9980-38e14d6202e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c9d3813-90cf-48ed-9980-38e14d6202e8" /></a></li><li>It basically says it couldn't locate the file, and asks me to certify if i've specified the right destination and file's name..</li></ul>

            <p>I put those commands, and said that several files were now owned by PC user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then put the second command and it said <strong>"administrators: Não foi efetuado qualquer mapeamento entre nomes de contas e IDs de segurança. Successfully processed 0 files; Failed processing 1 files</strong></p>

            I found some corrupted files, and the system wasn't able to repair them all. I've tried to do something in order to fiz those unrepaired files, but with no success. I guess the best solution is to refresh the PC, i don't know..

            Sometimes uou can fix it by just teating each setting and it will open up. Other times its a bit harder. There could be a fire wall on the router preventing the signal for being fully used. You beat bet is to call your ISP and they can walk you through
 the steps to open up your connection as it might be effecting other divices and you are not noticing it

<p>Double NAT means at least two network devices are each creating private network addresses, when there should ideally only be one. For example, you've connected a router to your ISP-provided gateway (or modem/router combo) without first properly configuring
 them -- especially if you forward ports on your router, the ported data will not pass through the modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your case is like my example, then you should set your ISP-provided combo unit to "Bridge Mode", so it will only act as a modem, and your router will do
<em>all</em> network address translating (NAT).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since every device brand and model are different, you will need to look up the manuals or other documentation online to figure out how to log into the device's internal settings via your web browser. If you have never done this before, you may also need
 to find the default username and password needed to log in.</p>

<p>If you followed the instructions on the support site, there are also other reasons for a double NAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Internet Provider might have put you behind a so called "carrier grade NAT". Which means, that several of their customers (for example everyone in your city, county, or other larger area with the same internet provider) are "hidden" behind one public
 IP, and that the internet provider spans a private network behind that one IP for their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This often happens with cellular (i.e. 3G/4G/LTE mobile) connections or some cable companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you already configured your own network according to the support article, please contact your Internet Provider and ask them, if you are behind a CG-NAT with DS-Lite tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, ask your provider if they are able to give you a real public IPv4 address. Sometimes they will gladly do that. Sometimes they want a one time fee, others might want a monthly fee for a public IPv4 address, and some ISP's don't give you a public address
 at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are unwilling to give you a public address (and thus resolving the double NAT), your only option is to change your internet provider.</p>

            Hello, this problem can be solved in two ways.<br />
<br />
1. This is hard for many people - set up a static IP address for XBOX and do port forwarding on all the necessary Xbox ports.<br />
<br />
The 2nd step is light and will usually solve this problem - contact your ISP and tell him that you need a public IP address to have Open NAT.<br />
He ought to please you. Some providers do this for free, some due to the lack of IP addresses, this has been charged.<br />
But with the transition to IPv6, there will be no problem.

            ^^^^ This is the answer. Got to disable one of the devices from acting as a router by using "pass through mode" or "bridge mode".

    <title>Its hard to manage my Account when MICROSOFT ALLOWS CREDIT CARD FRAUD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aabcdefedddddrq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Its hard to manage my Account when MICROSOFT ALLOWS CREDIT CARD FRAUD ON THEIR SERVERS&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I use Microsoft's Xbox live service, and have been using this service for well over seven years. I am currently twenty years old and work a minimum wage job. Being a loyal customer to Microsoft, I have spent well over 7,000 USD in the past seven years to
 Microsoft and their partner companies. July 30th my Xbox live account was "hijacked" by an unauthorized user. This user committed credit card fraud upon my banking account linked to my Xbox Live account. This user authorized a payment of 75 USD to my xbox
 account that I no longer have control of. Immediately receiving a notification of this transaction that I did NOT authorize, nor commit, I contacted Microsoft immediately to solve the problem. In short, a microsoft representative told me that my account was
 locked from billing (meaning it cannot authorize purchases) and locked from xbox live (meaning it could not sign into Microsoft's servers for use). I accepted these terms and was told I would receive a full refund of the amount stated and a full free month
 of xbox live gold subscription would be given to me for damages. I was told that this process would take "7 days at the most" and the problem would be solved. I have contacted Microsoft Xbox customer support almost daily and weekly since then and I receive
 the statement that it would take longer, and longer, and then longer each time when I placed the call and when the original date of satisfaction was given. The last date I was given as a recovery date was August 23rd, 2011. On this date I had not received
 email confirmation, nor a phone call from microsoft. I decided to call them for the Nth time. I went through the process of explaining my situation to the Nth representative for a Nth time. After asking how the status of my case was, I was told "Our technical
 team is currently still investigating this case." How can a multi-billion dollar company with the name of Microsoft take this long to finish an "investigation"? This is unacceptable for a company of this status to be keeping my hard earned money while they
 "investigate" for an unreasonable amount of time. I do not believe Microsoft treats Credit Card FRAUD over their OWN servers with utmost discipline. I have personally researched these types of cases over the internet and I am APPALLED that cases like this
 are not being handled like a company should handle them! I have read that an average of 4,000 users (out of the many million) have their accounts hacked and charged fraudulently for the highest amount , being 75 USD, on a WEEKLY BASIS! These numbers are staggering
 because that is 300,000 USD weekly, including the entire time that a case takes to "investigate". That is well over 1 million USD that microsoft "holds on to" during the time being of all of these "investigations"! I use quotations on investigations because
 I KNOW that microsoft can simply, and easily, change the credentials on their very own server from the fraudulent and unauthorized user, to the appropriate buyer and subscriber. They state that these "investigations" are to "identify the fraudulent user and
 to punish them deservedly." "Punish them deservedly"? If they were exacting punishment, I would be receiving a summons to court along with Microsoft to "punish" the fraudulent user with the use of the law, not "Investigating" the case while they hold my money
 for this long and the unauthorized user is still accessing my gaming account! That's right! With microsoft's own Xbox.com I can simply enter the gamertag that was accessed ILLEGALLY and see that my gamerscore (This is a system used on xbox live to track gaming
 accomplishments and achievements and does so in a numerical value) has risen since my account was take. Not only do I call microsoft daily, but I also check my gamerscore daily and can clearly see that it has gone up since the illegal access. Every time I
 ask a representative if my account was locked (from using the xbox live service and therefore unable to increase my gamerscore) they reply "Oh, I am sorry it seems it was not locked previously. I will do that for you now." Obviously they are not "locking"
 the account. I have seen my gamerscore rise 180-200 points than when it was originally in my control. Non-gamers would think this is a good thing. It is NOT! Being on my account illegally, this user is playing with my identity (has deleted all of my friends
 from my friends list), and is playing the games that *I* payed for, not the fraudulent user! This situation is obviously not being handled the way it should be and needs to be settled immediately. I also asked for them to send me the times and recordings of
 all of my calls to their representatives for the possibility of a lawsuit against Microsoft, and they replied "No". I am NOT recieving the service I am PAYING for. I am NOT being refunded the FRAUDULENT money charge. I AM having my IDENTITY played with, literally.
 (Identity theft). I am not being treated like a customer should be for having spent so much time(7 years), effort, and money (well over 7,000 USD)that has been dedicated to a company. Microsoft is NOT treating the situation like it should be with all seriousness.
 I have constantly been given the runaround on this situation. Microsoft continues to hold my money on the basis that they are "investigating". A multibillion dollar company keeping a 20 year old's minimum-wage when he has bills to pay is outrageous. 75 USD
 to me is alot and is what I work hard for. 75 USD to Microsoft is a drop in the ocean, but when you add all of the other cases similar to mine up to well over 1 million USD, something is obviously not right.<br />

 for these happenings.....</p>
<p>I have already made the dispute with my bank...</p>
<p>And as far as being patient I believe I have been so, after being told and ASSURED of dates that my account would be returned to me, and they do not follow up with them.</p>
<p>No this is not the account that was compromised. This is a very old account i was given for free by microsoft after a 6 year gold member gamercard's windows lived id MAGICALLY disappeared from the account awhile back.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Since
 when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you use a laptop or a desktop?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 is the model of your mouse and who is the manufacturer? Is it a wired or a wireless mouse?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Apart
 from Word documents and Internet explorer, does the mouse functions properly with other applications?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you are using a CRT monitor then, I would suggest you to change the screens refresh rate and check whether the issue persists. Follow the steps mentioned in the
 article given below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also, I would suggest you to update the chipset drivers as well as the graphics card drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check whether the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to update the BIOS and check. Contact the manufacturer of the system to update the BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to connect a different mouse and check whether the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            I had this same problem ever since i reinstalled my OS, and this morning i adjusted the color quality setting from 32bit to 16bit by right clicking on the desktop,clicking on properties and in the settings tab, i made the adjustment to 16bit. It is also
 advisable to contact the monitor manufacturer to determine the recommended value for screen resolution on your model.Hope the adjustment works for you also...and btw, &nbsp;for whatever reason,the problem i had with choppy video when i stream online videos in full
 screen mode is also resolved.

</p><p>and so is every file such as "Downloads, Desktop, Pictures, Music, etc..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>but when I saw my Microsoft account and clicked it, it contains every file that I've lost but then when I tried to copy-paste them, it doesn't work and the problem is still the same.</p>
<p>

<p>Which version of Windows 7 are you currently running? Is it Windows 7 Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate? In order to get the Language packs and the functionality you would like you will need to have Windows 7 Ultimate. You can use the

Anytime Upgrade</a> to get your system to Ultimate.</p>

    <title>How can I print from my XP virtual machine installed on my Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukon100  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I print from my XP virtual machine installed on my Windows 7 host&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot print documents from my XP virtual machine that is installed on my Windows 7 host OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is properly installed on my Windows 7 OS and I can print test pages and documents through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot get my printer to print anything from my XP virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install my printer into my XP virtual machine as a local printer. The install wizard installs the the drivers from its own database. The printer icon appears in the printers window. But test page does not print, nor can it print a simple
 text document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install my printer into my XP virtual machine as a printer attached to some other computer on my network. To prepare for this, I enabled file and printer sharing on my Windows 7 host OS printer, and then shared it to the network. Then I went
 back to my XP virtual machine to activate the printer install wizard to install networked printer. The install wizard searches for network shared printers, but does not find any. I have the option to enter things like printer network address and so on. But
 I have no idea what to enter into these boxes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done my best to make sure that both the Windows 7 host OS and the XP virtual machine are on the same network, which is a workgroup, not a homegroup. But I may have failed at this since I don't know much about networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------</p>

            <p>This problem is not solved. Anyone having this same problem with a parallel cable connected printer will need to keep looking for the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, it is no longer a problem I have to deal with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally discovered that my printer has a USB port on the back. So I switched from parallel cable to USB cable. This allowed me to select and enable the printer from the special Windows XP virtual mode menu bar on the top edge, by clicking on the "USB"
 button there. Enabling the printer in XP virtual mode also disables it in the Windows 7 host OS. But then "releasing" the printer from XP virtual machine enables the printer in Windows 7 again. No big deal to me.</p>

<p>Perhaps the displayed filename was an NVIDIA file called:</p>
<p>
</p><p>nvlddmkm.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of wasting time trying things you should provide more information about your system, configure your system to generate crash dump files for analysis, accumulate a few crash dumps and upload them to your OneDrive (everybody has a OneDrive for sharing
 files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the "expert" from Microsoft can analyze the crash dump files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "expert" from Microsoft should know that it is impossible to include a screenshot of a Windows BSOD since the system has crashed and should also know that Device Manger is not the best way to update hardware drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to get started:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't see what the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) says because by default Windows is configured to automatically restart when it crashes so you need to turn that off and adjust your system to generate a crash dump file when it does crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Desktop right click Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings and make it look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1846c190-a123-4853-a2b2-6cc724851ae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0ce170e-946c-4597-87c8-9a23511a8ade" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to create the Minidump folder as Windows will create one if it needs to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK enough times to close all the dialog boxes and restart your system for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; After rebooting you can go back and check the settings again to be sure the adjustments "stick".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your next reply you can supply more information that will reduce the number of question asking message cycles if you will do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is a Dell what is the Service Tag number?</p>
<p>If your system is HP what is the serial number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.</p>
<p><br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do whatever you have to do get the system to crash again and you should have a crash dump file to upload for analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes more than one crash dump is needed to pinpoint the cause so send some of the most recent ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the directions in the following link to upload a few of your most recent crash dump files:</p>

                    Microsoft answers.....Funny all I see are questions about why your products are ****..... and no solutions!!!!! My display driver stopped working looking at this web page....nothing else running in the back ground. It does this regularly now....sigh.....Made
 the same mistake as I did with XP i.e. having automatic updates switched on.... switch automatic updates off and fix the problems via people that know how to fix windows issues...pointless asking here....never had any issues with XP after that.....Now I have
 to go about fixing 7... tried installing service pack 1 and it keeps failing and since then my pc won't restart.....trouble with internet shutting down too.....Wouldn't mind normally I'd just put it down to another microsft experience but my pc is only a couple
 of months old. By the way microsoft you owe my 2Gbs woth of internet usage for downloading your crappy updates that do nothing but screw my pc.
