            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You could uninstall then reinstall your Printer using the Drivers and information at this HP website.</p>
<p>Put in your Printer Model number there for that information <strong>and troubleshooting steps</strong> for it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or ask in the HP Support Forums.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro - Importing VirtualBox image &#40; .VDI format &#41; to Hyper-V Manager &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to import virtual machine from VirtualBox image to Hyper-V Manager ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because, re-installing of MSDN Windows under Hyper-V Manager may take times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have almost eight VirtualBox images ( .VDI format ), if there is a way to directly import into Hyper-V Manager,
</p>
<p>it can save me a lot of times in configuring and installing process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 fingerprint scanner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fitnessinstbob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 fingerprint scanner</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am brand-new to windows 10 and I'm just becoming familiar with its operation and the use of the fingerprint scanner to login. I've done several searches but can't seem to find the information regarding whether or not I can use the fingerprint scanner
 to log into websites &nbsp;rather than typing in a password. &nbsp;Looks like the fingerprint reader is only used to initially login to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I guess the next option is just to purchase a third-party password protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;There are so many and to be honest I'm not a techie so I'm not sure which one would be best or compatible with windows 10. I've heard of last pass and enpass being reliable.</p>
<p>Thanks .</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t enable Wi-Fi on laptop after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boxman02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t enable Wi-Fi on laptop after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on my laptop this morning. I switch between using ethernet and wi-fi to connect to the internet. My ethernet connection worked just fine, but it seems I can no longer enable wi-fi on the computer. There is a button on the keyboard
 that used to turn wi-fi on/off but now it appears to only turn on/off airplane mode. When I try to activate wi-fi manually from Settings, it doesn't work. The dot in the "switch" under Wireless Network Connection simply snaps back to the "Off" position and
 stays there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really sure where to go from here. I tried going through Troubleshoot, but no luck. If it helps, the laptop is an HP Pavilion dv6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance!</p>

            <p>hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had (!) the same Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>oddly enough, after the initial upgrade, wifi worked fine, but since i restarted a couple of times, it stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>davidcastator's hint set me on the right track - thanks david!</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems that my cisco anyconnect Client caused the Problem.</p>
<p>symptoms:</p>
<p>wifi Switch (my Fujitsu Laptop has a machanical one) on, but Windows showing it "off". the Software toggle also just flipped back to "off" everytime i tried it.</p>
<p>looking inside the Network Settings i found my cisco anyconnect adaptor was "disabled". even manually enabling it had no effect and everytime i rebooted, the anyconnect Client would disable itself again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAIK, the anyconnect Client (well, mine is, at least)&nbsp;can be&nbsp;governed by corporate policies that can prevent users from connecting from "wrong" Clients. in my case, i used anyconnect to connect to my client's Network in a BYOD scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had to uninstall the anyconnect Client (from within "programs and Features" in the control Panel), AND uninstall and re-detect/install my wifi Adapter AND restart to fix the Problem. wifi now works again like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>seems to me that the cisco anyconnect Client and/or my Clients security policy were preventing wifi from starting up. frankly, i am VERY surprised this went undetected during the testing Phase. i suspect until cisco and/or organizations update their Client
 and/or policies to Windows 10, this will occur VERY frequently.</p>

            <p>ok, update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>uninstalling anyconnect appeared to be a temporary/limited fix only.</p>
<p>after rebooting and changing networks a couple of times, connectivity more or less broke completely. the next day, i was lucky if i could connect to any network at all - not even wired. the symptoms were very odd and difficult to reproduce. somewhere between
 incorrect persistent routes, driver issues, and TCP/IP misconfiguration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to keep it short: i reinstalled windows 10 FRESH, FROM SCRATCH.</p>
<p>that was four days ago and since then EVERYTHING has been working perfectly. and i mean everything: all my apps, hyper-v, all my hardware and accessories (and my laptop is three years old!), Cortana AND even Cisco AnyConnect. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>well...except for my SD-card reader, which has no driver (yet) and an ancient RAMdisk tool that i haven't used in ages anyways..</p>
<p>
</p><p>right now, it looks to me as if the in-place-upgrade from Windows 8.1 to 10 seriously screwed up something.</p>
<p>but hey - doesn't everyone know that windows always prefers fresh installs? :-D</p>
<p>
</p><p>having to reinstall everything sucks, but at least my files were automatically restored from OneDrive.</p>

 yesterday. The druver is automatically installed by windows and i cannot seem to install any other different driver, i have the 802.11n 6.30.223.256 version and according to the system everything is working fine, except i can't enable the adapter. Please somebody

<h3> 2majorissues  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing MAC under Windows 7</h2>
                    I tried to change the MAC-Adress but that didn't work. I added in the registry the value "NetworkAddress" and 12 hexadecimal digits. I then deactivated and activated the network adapter, but when executing "ipconfig /all" the MAC adress is the same as
 before. Under Windows XP (im currently using this version)&nbsp;this&nbsp;is working&nbsp;flawlessly.
<br />
How can I change the MAC Address with Windows 7?<br />
Please help.

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that a corrupted Windows component is causing your Surface not to finish setup. However, performing a 2 button shutdown usually resolves the issue. To do that, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds.<br />
</li><li>Press and hold the Volume-up button and the Power button on your Surface at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.<br />
</li><li>Press and release the power button on your Surface to turn it back on.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If still you're unable to complete the setup, perform an Automatic or Startup repair.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from working normally.<span> On how to create a recovery drive on a working PC, see<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/3a747883-b706-43a5-a286-9e98f886d490/create-a-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create
 a recovery drive</a><span>.</span></p>

<li>Connect the recovery drive and turn on your PC.</li><li>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>screen, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and then select
<strong>Advanced option</strong>.&nbsp;<span> </span></li><li>Choose <strong>Automatic </strong>or <strong>Startup repair</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In case Automatic or Startup repair did not resolve the issue, we suggest that you reset your Surface device. Click on this

                    I have Windows Vista SP2; Internet Explorer 9, auto update on everything.&nbsp; I tried to uninstall lavasoft Ad-Aware since I have Microsoft Security&nbsp;Essentials and should not have 2 antivirus programs fighting each other.&nbsp; Using Lavasoft's "uninstall" and
 then rebooting,&nbsp; I discovered nothing had disappeared.&nbsp; So I manually removed one of the 2 programs in Control Panel.&nbsp; When I tried removong the second one.&nbsp; a tiny window popped up telli me "This action is only valid for products that are currently installed"!&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The entire program is STILL in my computer, so I attempted to delete the entire folder (must have 1000 files!) but up pops a window saying I must have permission to delete these!&nbsp; I'm in way over my head getting "permission"&nbsp; when I cannot understand what
 all the hints and rules explain;&nbsp; it sounds like gibberish!&nbsp; Can someone walk me through eliminating the files in the folder (Can it be done in 1 fell swoop?) and

            <p>I am assuming that Ad-Aware is still on the list under Programs and Features ?<br />
And can I assume that you had tried to uninstall it by right clicking and clicking Uninstall ?</p>
<p>If yes to both ......</p>
<p>Suggestion :<br />
Download and run this Revo Uninstaller.<br />
It is a free program. <br />
It is widely used when " traditional method " fails to uninstall.</p>

<h2>            movie maker is not like before&#33; It&#39;s layout changed.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>One time (a couple of years ago) I used movie maker to create videos. I tried to do it again, but the program layout is changed, I can upload short videos but before I could view and modify contents seeing a section for audio, a section for images below
 and another section, if I don't remember wrong! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the visual was different from the one I have now, where is a window for preview the video created and beside the photogram and above all options (home, animations, effects, project, display/visualize).
</p>
<p>I don't know if I explained well my problem!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would know if maybe is a old version that one I used or if there is an option that I can choose to visualize the old way to make videos.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

            <p>You were probably using a "classic" version of Movie Maker either on Windows XP or Windows Vista.&nbsp; When Windows 7 was introduced, Microsoft created a new version of Movie Maker as part of
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Essentials</a>.&nbsp; While the functionality is similar, there are some visual differences between the newer version and the earlier version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In particular, there is no separate Collections area for previewing clips and making splits and trims.&nbsp; Instead, that is all done directly on the storyboard/project area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another difference is the position of the preview window which is now on the left rather than the right.&nbsp; A final difference is the storyboard/project which is not a traditional timeline anymore but more of a wrapping hybrid between a storyboard and a timeline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer version has also added features for uploading directly to sharing sites, as well as saving in either .mp4 or .wmv formats where the old version only allowed .wmv.&nbsp; It also has the ability to position the text for your title as needed, rather than
 being part of a pre-defined title animation.&nbsp; There are also expanded options (themes) for creating an AutoMovie where the older version had only one AutoMovie option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, in the latest version, you can achieve most (or more) of the&nbsp;things you could with the older version.&nbsp; However, if you are truly wanting to use the older version, you can load it side-by-side with the new version.&nbsp; They go in different folders, so
 you can actually use either one depending on the needs of your project.</p>

Make sure Metered Connection is not enabled when trying to download the said Language pack. Here's how to disable it:<br />
<br />
1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Select <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>, then <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.<br />
3. Click on <strong>Advance Options</strong>, under <strong>Metered connection</strong>, option for
<strong>Set as metered connection</strong> should be <strong>Off</strong>.<br />
4. Once you've disabled the metered connection, retry downloading the Language Pack.
<br />
<br />
Keep us posted if you require further assistance.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are getting an event ID 157 "Disk x has been surprise removed" on Hyper-V guests almost always when the Unitrends backup runs.&nbsp; I found one post that suggested a certain KB SP which is already installed.&nbsp; Another says you can 'safely ignore' this error,&nbsp;
 which is great, but a problem we have pretty strict security measures that we need to follow in order to stay certified.&nbsp; Any way to prevent this warning from popping up in the Hyper-V guest machine event logs?&nbsp; Any helpful suggestions are greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Characters not appearing in windows 10 password textbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> menns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Characters not appearing in windows 10 password textbox</h2>
                    <p>When I type my password into the windows 10 startup screen textbox nothing appears in the textbox, not even the dots that normally do, although it does acknowledge the enter key and indicates the password is incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried several times and am convinced
 my password was correct.&nbsp; I also used the touchscreen keyboard with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is relevant, but the photograph shown on startup was different.&nbsp; It was a hillside, next to an ocean, covered with homes at dusk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was doing a warm start.&nbsp; I eventually logged in by forcing a cold boot and performing a normal login procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a bug then I am very concerned about Windows 10 security.&nbsp; This should be a robust routine.&nbsp; It does a simple job with minimal variations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned that I am a victim of a keystroke logger.&nbsp; At the very least this is a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this behavior before?</p>
<p>Is this a keystroke logger?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform a system restore and check if it works. Please follow the below steps to know how to perform a System restore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to the Start button and click on the Control Panel.</p>
<p>2. Click on the System Restore button.</p>
<p>3.Click on the Next button. When you click on the Next button you will get a new window that contains all the Restore Points that were created, maybe automatically or maybe manually.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Click on the Next button and then you will get a confirmation window to confirm that you want to do the restore of your computer.</p>
<p>5.When you click on the Yes button it will show a warning message that your system will do the restore, during this your system will be restarted and will re-apply all the settings that are necessary for your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, I will be glad to help you further.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 changes made to file disappear after pressing the &#39;Save&#39; button or Ctrl-S</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work at a university where we have many students who save their work onto USB stick and update it only/mainly on there (yes, we advise them it's a bad idea, they have storage on our servers and on the cloud but they still do it).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">First query:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently had a couple of cases of users saying that they'd been working on their documents for some time, been doing regular saves by clicking on the save button or hitting ctrl-s but when they've reopened the document the changes have been lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We configure Word so it does the usual 10 minute autosave and backs up if the user exits without saving so we checked the backup file locations and there's no previous versions found, no docx, no asds, no tmps. From this we concluded that Word was shut down
 correctly and the most likely cause was users accidentally overwriting the saved version with a previous version (many are prone to having multiple copies of the same file open simultaneously).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these users was particularly stressed, so I took her USB thumb drive and ran a data recovery tool on it and discovered many backup copies spread over the exact time period she said she'd been working. While this was good news for her, we were intrigued
 by this so we carried out some tests using a spare USB. We discovered that when you create a document on USB and save it, it appears as a .docx.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make subsequent changes and hit save without exiting a 'shadow copy' is saved on the USB (but it not accessible) with the key in the format:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>{network login display name}_year-month-day hour-minute-{incremented version number}.DOCX</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I.e.</p>
<p>James Skinner_2018-07-27 14-49-00002.DOCX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where 'James Skinner' is my displayed network name and the file was edited on 27 July 2018 and saved 3 times (creating versions 00000, 00001 and 00002). We have 3 universities based on the campus and I tried alternative logins as my credentials were with
 the 'native' university on which the base network resides and the user D became 'James Skinner@{university domain}' and this was displayed on the splash screen as Windows fired up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:&nbsp;<em><strong>is there a way to access these files without resorting to expensive file recovery tools?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching for any information related but with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Second query:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we've had multiple occurrences of changes rolling back, we're wary that there many be an issue with saving to USB.
<em><strong>Beyond the obvious good practice issues, are there any known problems with saving Office (or other) updated files to USB then exiting?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Third query:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We had some issues a few months ago where user's PCs crashed and when we tried to do an autorecover the files weren't there, even if they had been working on a network drive or plug in drive. It turned out that we had enabled deletion of user profiles from
 the C: after 10 days but Windows 10 decided to wipe the profiles each time the PC was rebooted (this was traced to Windows comparing the date to the wrong profile timestamp). Because of this we did some testing of autorecovery, and it was discovered it appeared
 to be working fine in most cases but when working from USB the ASD and other files weren't always being created. This was especially noticed (though not in every case) when we created new files, worked on them then saved to USB or created files directly on
 USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Are there any known autorecovery file issues when working from USB flash drive?</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Jim,
<br />
<br />I know of none. That does not mean that there are not any.
<br />Your tests are the first that I have heard about on this subject. They tell me that something might be possible. In the meantime, I would suggest posting the following prominently.
<br />\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<br />
<br />Working on a document from within Word on a flashdrive is recently the number one way of corrupting the document and losing your work! Word just does not play well with flashdrives.
<br />
<br />When using Word, pretend that your flashdrive does not exist.
<br />Do not:
<br />- Open a document on a flashdrive from within Word. Copy to hard drive and open from there.
<br />- Print a document that is on a flashdrive.
<br />- Save, from within Word, a document to a flash drive.
<br />
<br />(The second biggest cause of losing work is opening a document directly from an email, editing and saving without specifying a location. It gets saved as a temporary file.)
<br />////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. We tell them over and again not to rely on USBs as they can be wiped so easily or, even worse, lost or left plugged in, but they only listen after they've had issues. Macs are even worse. You can remove a flashdrive from PC (pretty)
 safely as long as there's no cached writes going on. In most cases if you pull a USB from a Mac it will become unreadable in all cases unless the correct settings have been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also advise them about the issue with making sure they download from email before updating because they're working on a temporary copy (we've had users in fits of tears where they'd been working on their dissertations for several hours on hand-in day,
 clicked save over and again, popped out for lunch then discovered their changes lost) but most of the mail providers now make you save before you can edit (but we still get users downloading documents to the local drive then wondering why they can't access
 it on other PCs!).</p>

<p>Your experiments are interesting but mostly confirm the advice that we (and you) regularly give: It's okay to store a file on a USB flash drive for mobility, but you should never open a Word file directly from the drive or save directly to it. Always save
 to the local drive and then, when you're done, copy/send to the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nowadays, USB drives have such large capacity that overfilling is not such an issue (premature withdrawal still is), but it is a fact that Word creates many temporary files in the active folder. If you have copied/pasted material, a .wrl file is created
 every time you save (in addition to any .wbk file that may be created and overwritten). All of these are deleted when you close the document, but of course if you remove the drive before closing the document, they remain on the drive.</p>

<p>This does line up with what we say, but it doesn't explain why we've had a small but significant number of users who have experienced similar issues - working on a file for a significant period, hitting save, ejecting the USB, discovering changes have not
 been saved for several hours then we do a file recovery and find there's say 20, 30+ apparently discarded copies of the file on the USB in .DOCX format between the initial time of opening and logging off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very worrying. We have a couple of thousand students through the doors of the library every day during the academic year. We only have a few dozen during the summer break and we've suddenly had a spike. In October we'd expect 10-15,000 users a week,
 so even a 1% chance of an issue would present a massive problem for us. We can advise users not to rely on USBs but during Freshers Week and induction their schools, local companies, etc. give them away as promo items and they've often been out and bought
 one when they've visited the stationary shop for their pads, pens, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd be interested to hear from a technical person about this. The fact it's being saved under user name/date and time stamp/version number makes me think that there's a process somewhere that's deliberately discarding a copy every time you hit save then
 creating a new one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is, in fact, the way Word saves files.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/211632/description-of-how-word-creates-temporary-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/211632/description-of-how-word-creates-temporary-files</a>:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="margin-left: 30px">A simplified view of the scheme used to save an edited file
</p>
<pre><br />Create temp file                     Create ~wrdxxxx.tmp<br />Write temp file                      Save example data to ~wrdxxxx.tmp<br />Delete original file                 Delete EXAMPLE.DOC<br />Move temp to target name             Move ~wrdxxxx.tmp to Example.doc</pre>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Word gains significant performance speed by placing the temporary file in the same directory as the saved file. If Word placed the temporary file elsewhere, it would have to use the MS-DOS COPY command to move the temporary file
 from the other directory to the saved location. By leaving the temporary file in the same directory as the saved document file, Word can use the MS-DOS MOVE command to quickly designate the temporary file as the saved document.

<p>That's an excellent piece you've found there - I've printed it out and pinned it to my noticeboard for future reference!&nbsp;As the piece was posted in April and we're running the latest safe Office and Window updates it should be pretty much up-to-date information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you say, it doesn't quite match what the process is we're getting in the real world and that's why I suspect there's something else going on here. I've been doing some delving and these are my current threads of thought (if anyone can add any clues I
 can pursue they'd be gratefully welcomed):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Our major concern is the rolling back of the files - there's clear evidence the users are hitting save periodically so why aren't any of the intermediate file versions getting saved, even if the final version isn't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Even if the users finally exited without saving after working on the file for several hours, there should be a backup of the file in the AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\UnsavedFiles directory (we have "Keep the last autosaved version if I close without
 saving" checked by default and I've tested that it's working) so we don't think this is the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I tested Autosave and it is working fine and saving to the correct location (AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word). The file name format doesn't match that found on the USB. Recovery is working fine too, as is 'Manage versions'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) The files that were discovered on the scan of the USB have unusual IDs. Why the user's name and not login ID? The ID is used elsewhere when writing files (i.e.&nbsp;C:\Users\{User ID}\AppData). It's almost like it's using the network user's name because it
 thinks the file is shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Likewise, the trailing number is obviously version control-related. It begins at 00000 and appears to increment each time the user clicks save. The date and time stamp also reflect this. If this is true then the file isn't just not saving on the USB,
 it's fully reverting to the initial version of the file originally opened. This is,of course, a different issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) If it was just a matter of the users not closing the USB correctly and the cached version being lost, then why would there be intermediate versions on the USB at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked into shadow backups ('Restore previous versions') on the USB but there's nothing to suggest it's that. I've done USB scanning before and never found this kind of filename so I'm guessing it's something that's rolled out over the summer in one
 of the updates but the evidence for this is thin. The use of the network name is pointing me to either network drive handling of file sharing setup, but there's no reason that either of these should affect memory sticks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admit, I'm grabbing at straws here. If we can find a reason that the files aren't backing up and why these undocumented backup files are here (and some way to access them) we can try and implement a workaround.</p>
<p>

<p>If I create a Word document today at 12:34, add in the word 'The', hit save, add the word 'quick', wait a minute, hit save, etc. I will have 9 deleted files recoverable on the USB.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keys all start with the user name (not ID), the date will be today and the time and version stamp will range from 12-34-00000 to 12-42-0009.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are all straight .DOCX files (the suffixes are capitalised, btw) and the contents will range chronologically from "The", to "The quick" up to version 9 which contains the full sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files aren't tmps or asds or anything similar - they are full docs that have been deleted and require no rebuilding or converting. They are simply deleted files that are recoverable on the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like some kind of version control, or that Word opens the initial .docx version of the file then writes a completely new one each time you hit CTRL-S and deletes the previous version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just going to do some testing to see if I can get more of a handle on it. I'm going to set the autosave to a fixed period (say every 5 mins) and hit CTRL-S every 3 mins on one file,&nbsp; not at all on another, etc. and see what gets written to USB, what
 temp files are created in appdata and when, then run the disk scanner on the USB and see what's been created and deleted and when. I'm also going to test exiting without saving after hitting CTRL-S and various permutations of pulling the sticjk after hitting
 CTRL-S or no, etc. Phew!</p>

            Wrt your #3, are you actually referring to AutoRecovery? AIUI, AutoSave works only when you're saving to OneDrive.

<p>Apologies for the delays getting back to this - annual leave!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, in reply to the query below I didn't mean 'autobackup'. It was a slip of the mind. I've been referring to the autorecovery and the 'exit without saving' files in reference to what's left in AppData (i.e. neither).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, the user name and timestamp noted in my previous responses seems to be a red herring - it's added artificially by two of the recovery tools to indicate which user had created or edited the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got back from leave this Tuesday and today (Thursday) I experienced another case of this happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The user created a Word file on one of our PCs here at the university on Tuesday 28 August 2018</p>
<p>2) The user saved the file and went home</p>
<p>3) The user came back in the next day (Wednesday 29 August 2018) and continued to work on the file for several hours. She stated she'd clicked on the save icon several times during the session</p>
<p>4) The user saved the work, ejected the USB then went home</p>
<p>5) The user opened the file on her laptop at home. It had reverted back to the version from Tuesday 28 August 2018</p>
<p>6) The user came in here this morning, logged into the same PC she had been on, plugged in the same USB and the only version of the document on the USB was the version from Tuesday 28 August 2018</p>
<p>7) I checked the user's profile. There were no autorecovery files in AppData which indicates to me that the file was closed gently. There were no 'closed without saving' files which indicates she saved before closing.</p>
<p>8) I checked the USB and it had 4 files (2 Word, one PowerPoint and an image) and a subfolder containing a small number of assorted files.</p>
<p>9) I ran one of the disk utilities we are evaluating on the USB (EaseUS) on my own laptop and it found 143 files on the USB. These included ~ files, .tmps, .pptx files etc. 16 or so of these were flagged as Word files.</p>
<p>10) Amongst the Word files I found 4 with a timestamp of Wednesday 28 August 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) The timestamps on these files were spread through the afternoon (i.e. 12:30, 13:14, 14:42, etc.) and each progressive files is bigger than the last. This indicates that the user was pressing Ctrl-S/pressing Save periodically during the session.</p>
<p>12) I recovered the files and sat with the student. Each version shows progressively more text and they are clearly indicated a document being written.</p>
<p>13) I copied the backups onto the user's USB. She will now make multiple saves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things to note:</p>
<p>* We run the latest version of Windows 10 and Office with all safe patches applied</p>
<p>* We set Autosave to 10 minutes and activate the option to save a backup if the user exits without saving</p>
<p>* We have tested the above options and they work as expected</p>
<p>* We have switched off parameters such as Recent File List.</p>
<p>* We are a university campus serving around 10,000 users studying at 3 universities. When users log in they effectively join different domains and have slight differences in profile</p>
<p>* The problem has occurred with at least two of the universities, and we think the third as well (but we put the problem down to user misuse originally)</p>
<p>* Users at all universities have OneDrive profiles and networked hard drive space where their profiles are saved and they can back work up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* File locations are split between local C: drives and their network drives. The C: is mainly used for the session stuff, the network drive for folders like documents, etc.</p>
<p>* We have recovered hundreds of files after sessions crash, users exit without saving, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem, again, seems to point to Word rolling back all changes for some reason. The work is being done, the documents are being updated, it would appear that the users are doing periodic saves, they're working from existing files, not new ones or email
 copies, they are not working on OneDrive files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;<em>really</em> need to get a solution to this issue. In 3 weeks we have 10,000 students joining or returning to study and almost every single one will be using USB sticks as their primary storage. It really isn't a practical or acceptable solution to
 tell them not to do so. Because we are using a standard setup of Windows/Office I'm pretty certain we wouldn't be the only institution to experience this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is simple:&nbsp;<em>under what circumstances&nbsp;would Word/Office possibly roll back all changes to a document in a single session even if the user had saved the document during the session?</em></p>
