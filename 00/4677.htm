<h2>            What&#39;s included in Education licensing</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am confused on what is exactly included in the education plans. Specifically Office Pro Plus.</p>
<p>From this site, it lists only Office Online. <a href="https://products.office.com/en/academic/office-365-education-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://products.office.com/en/academic/office-365-education-plan</a></p>

<p>This site, says <strong>"All students get online versions of Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Some schools allow students to install the full Office applications on up to 5 PCs or Macs for free</span>."</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education?tab=students" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education?tab=students</a></p>

<p>What determines "some schools allow"?</p>

<p>Hi MegaHurtz，</p>
<p>“some schools allow” refers to those who have signed Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES) agreement with Microsoft can get Office ProPlus for free.</p>
<p>Enrollment for Education Solutions under Campus and School Agreement (CASA+EES) is a subscription licensing program available to both primary/secondary and higher education. The Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES) offers the simplicity of counting people
 instead of PCs/devices. CASA+EES is for institutions with 1,000 or more full-time employees or students.</p>
<p>There are two articles may be helpful for you:</p>

            <p>How old is your pc? From what microsoft os did you upgrade to W10 from? Was it 7 or 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you do not wish to reload your programs, you still may need to do that to fix your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try downloading the new ISO file for windows 10. Mount ISO file and click on install.exe file to begin installation of Windows 10. You can choose to keep your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you would really better off doing a clean install with ISO file from Media center. Microsoft has an November updated version of Windows 10 there. I would use USB stick to boot up your install. You can create USB boot with Rufus tool. Then re-install
 your programs.</p>

            My computer is from 2013 and before I reset my computer Windows insider was working. I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 my laptop came with Windows 8. I upgraded to Windows 8.1 then 10. And now you doint have to upgrade from those is you can now
 use a Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 product key.

<p>The second http link contains Windows 8 reference but the procedure for creating USB boot up device for Windows 8 also works for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That particular post gives several different ways to create USB boot but they all will work for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>patrickmullhall's post says that his pc is on Windows 10 and can not get access to insider build. I do not agree with your advice to download Wndows 8.1. If his pc was activated in Windows 10, he can use ISO file for Windows 10 to do a clean install.</p>

    <title>Need to extend VBA Macro formula to multiple sheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidgibsoncnd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to extend VBA Macro formula to multiple sheets</h2>
                    <p>Hello Excel specialists.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in Excel regularly but have not delved too much into Macro development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this a very powerful tool and have found an application to start in on involving a series of selection sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created series of pages of pull down selection lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next to each pull down is a Vlookup to convert the text selection on the pull down list into a numeric value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time the selections for one product are made the selection menus have to be re-set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to re-set all the pages back to blank to prepare for the selections needed on the next selection run&nbsp;but I cannot use a RANGE CLEAR COMMAND because I need the VLOOKUP to remain so I name each individual target cell on the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To accomplish this I found some VBA code to run as a macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheets("Target Sheet 1").Range("C2,C5,E2, E4,E6,E8,G2,I2,I4,I6,I8,I10,I12,I14,I16,K2,M2,O2,O4,O6,O8,O10,O12,O14,O16,Q2,Q4,Q6,Q8,Q10,Q12,Q14,Q16").ClearContents</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this programmed to run with the key stroke combination "cntr R"</p>
<p>This allows me to list all the cells on a particular sheet to have them all reset back to BLANK.</p>
<p>It also leaves the other formulas on the sheet intact so they continue to function for the next series of selections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I need to clear multiple cells on mutiple sheets and have to name a particular macro and key combination for each individual sheet. There are up to 10 sheets of pull down selection lists that must be cleared. Each sheet with different
 cells and requiring re-setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: I have some experience "NESTING" formulas and creating single formulas that combine and execute several tasks in sequence to a desired end. &nbsp;Is this possible with VBA? Can this code be nested to include all the cells on all the pages that require
 clearing and re-setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can it be done?</p>
<p>I can write the code for each individual sheet, each one would look very much like the example given, but how does one combine the commands for different sheets in one formula in VBA to clear and re-set all the desired cells in all the sheets simultaneously?
 What would the nesting sysntax be? Layers of brackets ((( ))) or commas,,,, or would it be a series of sub routines or something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with the key to the required syntax of this VBA formula is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could i create a macro to clear each individual page and then a master macro that would execute all the shortcuts at once to clear all the pages? Is that feasible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There are 2 options below. The first one will clear the contents of each of the worksheets that have been nominated in the code. The second option will clear the contents of the active sheet only.

<h2>            Any tips to get the OneNote Importer to actually work properly&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying out OneNote so I'm using the importer to migrate one of my larger Evernote notebooks. It gets to about 450 or so out of 580 or so and then says it encountered an error. After that is shows only a few notes that it claims it couldn't import.
 Then when I look in OneNote, I see many notes did not get brought in with a title. Oddly enough, these same notes/pages have no date at all.<br />

<p><span>Hi JBBryant,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are certain parameters which will not lead notes to import. If Evernote notes have some things like ink, encrypted text, background colors, and reminders, then OneNote import will not import the pages.

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, I can create folders normally in a document library. To&nbsp; have a better understanding of your scenario, please share with me more info as below:</p>
<p>1. Screenshot of the error message you encountered.</p>
<p>2. Where you created your&nbsp;sites? (SharePoint admin center or SharePoint homepage.)</p>
<p>3. Which settings have you changed before this issue happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Editing Outlook 2007 messages in HTML code&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently stepped up from my old XP based Pentium IV to a quad core Intel processor and 64 bit Windows 7 OS, and when composing messages in outlook, there is no option that I can see for this function, despite it's predecessor Outlook Express 6 having this
 option.</p>
<p>I work on client's websites, as well as my own, and host a number of them through my hosting reseller account, and often offer a service of providing them (for a fee) with attractive rich HTML email newsletters, and fliers. promo ads, etc.. And I am becoming
 more and more disillusioned with Microsoft and their products, assuming I need all these protective measures, being imposed on me when I do not need anyone to protect me from anything, and I do understand and can appreciate there are allot&nbsp; of people who do,
 but couldn't you at least leave the options available for those who are so used to using them, and have been around the web since its inception?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging from the number of solicitations, despite close to fifty reportage of these illicit solicitations, and nothing is ever done, not to mention all the other junk that comes in to my live mail account that was required to use the instant message, I will
 NEVER be able to use that for my 7 and growing site email accounts, all of which I can manage from the one mail client, however not being able to hand code HTML in to my messages is a serious deficit in capabilities, making this whole install a waste, but
 yet OE 6 has these capabilities, but has not been updated to be compatible to run on windows 7, so what are my options for hand coding HTML in to outgoing emails, and why bother allowing a "view code" option if one cannot edit it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please offer some insight in to what aspect if this I am missing that I cannot find any reference to hand coding HTML in this version of outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any REAL help with this, I really do not want to have to set up an additional mail client with my almost 300 count people in my address b9ook, which again, why would they not make this compatible to be able to import my address book
 intact, to this upgraded outlook????</p>
<p>It took me almost a month of had writing them in as I used them until I found a way to force it to see the data file, which should have been three clicks and done.....what reason could there possibly be to prevent us from getting our existing data in to
 an upgraded program????</p>
<p>Not to mention what it is going to take to eventually get some 12k worth of inbox and sent items, filed in to folders in outlook 2007, as they were being filed in outlook express.</p>
<p>Please offer SOME good news, I really cannot handle any more bad news that is going to require I manually save each one in to a REAL folder and then copy them in to the message store database used by outlook 2007!</p>
<p>Now I just noticed that this option is even available HERE to edit HTML, so why not in our own mail program?????</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>TSG!</p>

<p>Outlook Express is not a predecessor of the Microsoft Outlook application that is part of Microsoft Office. They are two entirely different applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to hand code HTML for a message, do that in your preferred HTML editor, save it as an .htm file, and then in Outlook 2007 use the Insert as Text option on the Insert File dialog to insert the HTML content into the message body</p>

    <title>3D applications still have bad framerates after KB3216755 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epicgv  say:</h3>
<h2>            3D applications still have bad framerates after KB3216755</h2>
                    <p>So I first had this issue when i updated to 14393.693, as it was stated in the notes: "<span>Users may experience
 delayed or clipped screens while running 3D rendering apps (such as games) on systems with more than one monitor."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When i saw that 14393.726 came out with this note: "</span><span>Addressed
 known issue called out in KB3213986—Users may experience delays while running 3D rendering apps with multiple monitors.", i instantly downloaded it but after i installed it the issue was still there.</span></p>
<p>The problem still persist even after doing a complete reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Basically the problem is that the framerate keeps resetting to 60 from 144 like twice a second if
 any 3d app is not running in fullscreen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I have an Acer Predator XB241H 144hz G-Sync monitor hooked up to a GTX 1060 and a Samsung T22C350 60hz on my Intel HD Graphics 4600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any more info relating the problem just reply.</p>

            So plugging my second monitor also into my dGPU and disabling the iGPU in the bios and deleting its drivers fixed the issue.

<h3> sometimesclueless  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Current Form Access 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone provide the code or steps to do the following. I have researched this all over the net and I cant seem to find a code that works correctly:</p>
<p>I want a user to fill out a form, when complete I would like the user to be able to email the current view of the form or the current record to whomever. I tried DoCmd.SendObject... and also used the Macro builder with EmailDatabaseObject(Access 2010). Both
 get me very close, i am able to send my form, but it included every record in the form.</p>
<p>I have tried this in both Access 2007 and 2010. I prefer&nbsp;to using 2007 if possible, due that my company doesnt support the 2010 suite yet. But will accept any answers using either at this point.</p>

<p>Here is one way. I'm setting a filter on the current record, then call SendObject, then remove the filter.</p>
<p>This works with the Northwind sample database on all recent versions of Access.</p>
<p>Dim f As Form<br />
Set f = Forms![Employee Details]<br />
f.Filter = "ID=" &amp; f!ID<br />
f.FilterOn = True<br />
DoCmd.SendObject acSendForm, f.Name, acFormatPDF, "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", , , "test", "See attached", True<br />
f.FilterOn = False<br />
Set f = Nothing</p>

<p>Create a report based on the form. In the code that opens the report, use a Where clause that limits the report to just one record. You need to open the report to save it in .pdf format, but you can open it hidden.</p>
<p>A2007 gives us the ability to save a report in .pdf format in a folder on your hard drive. Then use SendObject to email the pdf version of the report.</p>

            I just did this in 2010 by doing the following:
<div><br />
<div>A switchboard button to add a new record initiates a macro which opens the form in Data Mode "Add" (therefore only displaying the current new record).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The form has a button at the end of it to submit the record which runs a second macro which does the following:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. SaveRecord</div>
<div>2. EmailDatabaseObject - Form - PDF Format&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will create a pdf of only the newly entered record and attach it to an outgoing email.</div>

</p><p>Hi Marty,<br />
<br />
The reason that your example 1 works compare to your example 2 might be the extra space that you have placed in your first example. If you can notice your post above specifically in the example 1, there is an extra space between INCLUDETEXT and "H:\\xxx1.docx".
 While looking at your second example, checking on the same spot there is only single space between them.
<br />
<br />

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

                    <p>Since outlook upgraded it web mail server I'm having all kinds of issues. PLEASE READ BEFORE SENDING A REPLY!!!!!!. TO AVOID FRUSTRATION ON BOTH ENDS WITH q &amp; a NOT RELATED.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so since outlook.com Mail upgraded to new features, every time I click on anything on the window, to open mail, my icon settings, open or close IT OPENS MY WEBCAME! I've tried to disable it but it just overrides Deny settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I don't understand how to set the priority on the new feature Focused?????. Mail is randomly going into either or.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) allowed mail is now going into spam fold, When I mark it as NOT SPAM it's being directed into focused folder when it was received before in Other folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now just to be clear! I have a hotmail and outlook address linked into outlook mail. I'm now missing time restrait emails because it's either going into one or the other folder not opened</p>

<p>OK it just happened again, didn't all weekend or this morning. Seems specific to the focused folder which lands randomly as same senders land in Focused or other folder?? with the exception from MS community.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't do the clean boot because I don't want to lose data. I can't find the over ride in system restore I was able to use in XP Pro to prevent it, in Vista. And as it appears now to be random in Outlook.com web server only I don't think it's a system
 issue, unless Outlook or my puter has been compromised that I can't detect, more likely it's an&nbsp; Outlook issue as I have enough safety features, including a high end router/switch with dedicated VPN ports and firewall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK so now it seems my option is to disable the Webcam. I tried disabling it by following the tree from Task Mgr to location then properties on what I found running when the camera was active. However that didn't work it keep relaunching multiple times after
 closing it. How else can I disable the webcam in vista??? without disabling Media Ctr.

            <p>You can disable the integrated camera by disabling the device in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Click <strong>Start </strong>and enter <em>
Device Manager</em> into the search field.</li><li>On <strong>Device Manager</strong>, locate <strong>Imaging </strong><strong>Devices
</strong>and <strong>double-click </strong>on your webcam to open <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, and click on <strong>Disable </strong>
to disable your webcam.<br />
Should you want to re-enable it, follow the same steps and select <strong>Enable </strong>
in the same window.</li></ol>

            <p>Thanks for the info, I was finally able to disable it this morning after doing a google search for my specific computer's OS. I did contact MS outlooks tech support as well and they are working on the issue. Just a note I didn't need to go to properties
 double clicking on imaging displayed the webcam and clicking on it gave me the option to disable. , going into properties only allowed me to change permission which is what I tried before that didn't work.&nbsp; Hay that is Vista, what can I say.

            <p>Disabling the webcam has at least stopped it from opening, But have not been able to resolve why it was happening in the first place. MS tech support hasn't really offered any resolution, just keep asking relevant questions and stock answers that don't apply.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thanks for your help in getting the webcam disabled, that issue was atleast resolved.

<p>
</p><p>This is what I want to be able to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a range from R2:R8 containing different text. I want to be able to input text into N2 and if it equals some certain text then equal the correct cell in R2:R8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;I need: </p>
<p>
</p><p>IF N2="One"then =R2 OR IF N2 ="Two" =R3 </p>
<p>
</p><p>etc etc </p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know if this makes sense but thank you if you can help! </p>
<p>

<h2>            S60v3 FP1 2 questions..</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently purchased a E51. Things looked pretty good until I found the following issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Volume level for Java games:</p>
<p>It appears that the games either blast in full sound, or no sound. There seems to be no way to control their volume level. I did some googling around and I find it hard to believe that there is no way to control their volume! Either the game developers have
 to provide it internally in their games or one will just simply have to turn the sound off! In one fell swoop, Nokia seems to have made all the preexisting java games incompatible with the E51. I find this a little bit like cheating/misleading, because one
 the spec you claim support for Java games. Is there some way via firmware upgrade or something that will enable the user to control the volume level of Java games? Will this be fixed in future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Shortcuts to folders:</p>
<p>I'd like to create a shortcut in active standby mode to my Installations folder, but I'm not able to figure this out. It seems to only allow shortcuts to individual apps. Is there a way to do this? One more thing is, I'd like to move things from the installation
 folder to folders under the file manager is this possible? If so how do I do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>try installing jbaktaskman. it is an excellent task manager and in the quick launch, you should be able to set a shortcut to whatever folder.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We are glad to help you. Based on the information you've provided,the file may have had a password which probably be causing the issue. You can try disabling the password of the Excel file to see if you still be getting the same issue. Let us know the result.<br />
<br />
You can also try using a different browser to eliminate the possibility of a browser specific issue.<br />
<br />
If you have further questions, feel free to ask.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            What kind of garbage is that? <br />
<br />
Previously, when attaching a password protected file Hotmail.com would present an option warning you that the file was unable to be scanned and ask if you really wanted to still attach it. Outlook.com doesn't give you that option it just says password protected
 files can't be attached.<br />
<br />
This is a serious downgrade of functionality. Users want and need to be able to attach encrypted files for their own security.
<br />
<br />
Having no password on the attachment IS NOT a workaround as having the password is needed on the attachment for the user's security.<br />
<br />
I created the file, I know what's in it - I don't need nanny Microsoft aborting the attachment if it can't scan it.<br />
<br />
Get this fixed soon Outlook, before many people are forced to switch to GMAIL.<br />
<br />

            Just replied to this through the Feedback form.&nbsp; I have now downgraded my "Likely to recommend this product" to 2, and have given up on using outlook.com except for sending casual messages to friends and receiving commercial newsletters, etc.&nbsp; There are
 too many half-implemented functions and removed features to seriously continue using it.&nbsp; It's too bad because the interface is the best, but interface is a want and functionality is a need.<br />

<h2>            texts from people and unknown keep repeating about 5-18 times</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I had to hard hard reset my phone. Aka windows phone recovery tool. And some of my friends send me some texts and the last one they send sometimes pop's up 3-5 times. Then a unknown number texted me with media and when I go to the tread it says oops
 the media content your looking for isn't there anymore. And the same message would pop up every minute or lots in 5 Seconds total of 18 messages. This is on a virgin mobile windows Nokia 635</p>
<p>
</p><p>does this happen normally or what is causing the problem?</p>

<p>It also sounds as if the MMS APN setting may be missing from the settings? If this was entered manually earlier, then it has to be entered again after using the recovery tool.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We received an Excel&nbsp;file from our location overseas.</p>
<p>A mysterious box appears on one of the sheets. It actually isn't a box, because you cannot select it. There are no handles to it, however normal cursor, (the cross), changes to arrow when moved on top of it.</p>
<p>It moves with deleting or inserting cells.</p>
<p>It is in front of cells. I formatted the cells in yellow and put the cursor behind. It cannot be deleted, fully cleared or asked to go away.</p>
<p>No matter of Excel version the file is opened in, 2007, 2013, 2016.</p>
<p>There are no macros in this workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have experience with such UFO in Excel and knows what it is, how it got there, and how to remove it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I recently bought a Lumia 930, great phone, but charging it up seems to be quite problematic. Sometimes i plug it in and it charges at a very slow rate, or not at all. Also I always plug it in before i go to bed, and i sometimes wake up in the morning with
 it less charge then it had when i plugged it in. See the image attached, as you can see, it procedes to charge up ok (24:00), keeps at full charge for a while (2:00-5:00), then suddenly procedes to drop in charge (5:00-08:00) then i unplug the charger, and
 it stops losing charge...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes i am using the charger provided with the phone, and have also tried other ones, all the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            hi fellas, have u checked u are up to date with the latest firmware along with the latest Nokia system app updates from the Store? also try performing a soft reset. failing them, a hard reset is in order.

<p>I have had a bad time with this as well - made much worse by a shoddy attitude from EE.</p>
<p>Basically it complains of slow charging and that I should use the official charger even when using the official charger. It also blew out the induciton plate on the 2nd day. And gets red hot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read if you are interested about EE (Bath Southgate)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of July we lost all power, routers etc. in our office. As we were going for several weeks and my old HTC HD2 was a bit hard work for reading e-mail, we decide to buy some new phones. Went into EE in Bath and despite them not having the 15 sreis
 phablet I had wnated I bought a Nokia 930 (which amonst other things, the sales guy assured me ran Cortana); [I was also offered a free extra charger, bluetooth speakers - which I never got ].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paid full price (no new contract) took it back to the office charged it on the induction plate (got very hot). On the 2nd day the induction pad failed. Went on holiday in a tent and noticed that every thing I tried to charge it with came up with slow charging
 and some silly text about a hppy phone and using the manufacturer's charge and cable. (Even when using a battery pack that keeps an Ipad happy still got the message). On a breif visit to a pub with a wall socket I saw the mesasge form the charger but thought
 little of it. Towards the end of the holiday I visited another location with sockets and got the same problem. During one of (many) chats with support [initilally we had a lot of problems with the internet as well] I was todl that they couldn't help me over
 the phone but if I took it back to the EE store they would be able to replace it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I got into Bath (30 mile round trip), went to the store and was shocked to be told that they had a 14 day policy and would not replace the phone. They offered to send it for repair with a minimum wait of 2 weeks (remember my wife and I had spent £950
 on two phones earlier in the month and my phone had never worked properly and I had been told by support that I coudl take it back when I next got to the shop - i.e. the problem had been motified.. T-mobile support were actually alot more helpful even suggesitng
 that I followed up with my suggestion that I should stop the credit card and that the approach of the store was very disappointing (apparently they woudl normally offer a loan phone to cover returns).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oddly the guy (and his manager) in the shop didn't want to test the phonebut jsut said that they believed me - sounds like the problem is known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I will try a hard reset (and all the pain of that) as t-mobile support said that sometiems sorts out Nokias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I storngly suggest that if you want a phone you don't buy from a EE shop who don't mention their poor return policy when you are buying; Amazon would have taken it back and they wouldn't expect me to pay full price for what will be in effect a refurbished
 phone; poeple wonder why the High Street is dying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Teh guy in shop seemed to think that their "policy" was the law - which it isn't. I thik in this day and age a 2 week loss of your phone in the 1st month doesnt count as a reoasnbale repair or being of merchatnabel quality]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice phone though.</p>

<p>really sorry to hear your bad luck, i have the 930 and hanvet got those issues so its probably just your phone.&nbsp; But to be fair i was withm apple for 6 years&nbsp; i just moved to windows.&nbsp; Im on voda phone and like most companys i buy things from its always
 usually 14 days no questions return policy.&nbsp; so them offering to repair it after 14 days isnt a bad or unusualy thing for a company to do.&nbsp; Actually it is the normal i have had for most of my life.&nbsp; Personally they could have given you a little grace because
 you were away on holiday, but at least theyll repair it for you. I know thats not what you want to here but that the world we live in and the way its been for years.&nbsp; Again a great company would have said ok its like just over 14 days well get you a nerw phone,
 but its not a requirement :(</p>

<p>I'm using&nbsp;unlocked German Vodafone Lumia 930 here in Finland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had problems with wireless charging. The phone stopped charging and after couple of seconds it started to charge again. This went in loops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have Lumia Icon which doesn't have that kinda problem at all. So that's quite strange...</p>
<p>I swapped&nbsp;the main boards of my phones just to investigate the charging problem. No use which is also strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, after a while I learned that the key thing is positioning. If I place my Lumia 930 correctly on the charging plate, it'll be charged without any issues.</p>
