<h2>            Windows Host Process Rundll32 has stopped working ONLY at startup on desktop.</h2>
                    When I start my Dell Inspiron 531 after sign in the desktop screen goes dark twice for several seconds then the Windows Host Process Rundll32 has stopped working window comes up. If you close it another small window exactly the same as the previously mentioned
 error message tells you Windows will look for a solution but NEVER does. I use AOL version 9.0, I can sign on and surf the Internet great for a dial up connection. I tried to download free Kaspersky from their site&nbsp;and some error message told me it was incomplete
 or corrupted. I have Glary Utilities, CCleaner, Stopzilla, Windows Security Essentials, have run sfc/scannow it cleaned some files&nbsp;and it tells me there are no integrity problems after 4 scans. The PC runs great but what the ____ is causing that Rundll32 error

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Be careful about having too many antivirus/security programs on the computer much less running<br />
at the same time. Only have one loaded at a time as even the remnants of one can cause many<br />
problems.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 touchscreen problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnleslie1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 touchscreen problems</h2>
                    <p>I was using my surface pro 4, all working well.&nbsp; I checked for updates and there were updates available.&nbsp; I let the machine go ahead and download/install the updates.&nbsp; Windows 10 pro, version 1803, build17134.191.&nbsp; Immediately after update process completed,
 my touchscreen and pen don't work.&nbsp; Battery also drains completely overnight once shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System info screen shows pen and touch not available for this display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager shows Surface ME has a problem.&nbsp; First attempt to fix moves it from error code 14, to error code 10.&nbsp; Cannot resolve error code ten.</p>
<p>Checking for driver updates returns result, best driver is already installed.&nbsp; Disabling driver then re-enabling doesn't work.&nbsp; Uninstalling the driver doesn't work.&nbsp; Running Intel driver and support assistant returns result my PC is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HID compliant pen and HID compliant touchscreen are not listed in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Microsoft diagnostic tool,&nbsp; that only offered the option to arrange for service or post in the forum, or search the knowledge base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run SFC, no problems identified,&nbsp; Performance monitoring/reports show nothing, except Surface ME issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restart, forced shutdown, et al.&nbsp; I have tried all the reset/recovery options, some more than once.&nbsp; I've re-imaged the tablet all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had two sessions with support agents, one online chat, the other on the phone.&nbsp; Both guys were very pro-active but the help and guidance available from them was no more than the instruction I had found on the Microsoft website and tried myself.&nbsp; Neither
 was willing or able to answer specific questions such as where can I download only the surface me driver.&nbsp; Both could only say to download load the whole .MSI driver package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to receive support from Microsoft of a sufficiently technical level that I might make progress to understand the source of my problems and the solution for them.</p>

            Hi Jo,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.
<div>
<p>As per your post, changing screensaver or lock screen on one system, it automatically changes the other system screensaver or lock screen and we will assist you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the same Microsoft account&nbsp;on both the systems?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest&nbsp;you to use a local account on the work&nbsp;system to check, if that helps.</div>
&nbsp;
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the&nbsp;system to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><div>When sync is turned on, Windows keeps track of the settings you care about and sets them for you on all your Windows 10 devices. So I suggest you to turn off the Sync settings on Windows 10 operating system.</div>
<div><br />
For more information, refer to the link below, then follow the steps and check, if it works.</div>

            To let you understand what's happening, I need to give you a bit background of the file system. Sorry that there will be a bit long.
<br />
<br />
Assumed a hard disk has 1TB ( 1000MB) size and it breaks up a 1000 small box to hold data for 1MB each. If I have a file of 10mb which I will use 10 small boxes to hold.
<br />
<br />
As result, the file allocation table will be huge. Therefore the file index indeed only has the filename and the location of the first box. Inside of the box has the location of the next box as a link until end of file.
<br />
<br />
**Once the location of the next box missing or misplaced. The file will be fail to retrieve.
<br />
<br />
That is what you see in " Stage 2: Examining file name linkage ... " . <br />
<br />
There are many reasons for the file missing link <br />
(1) accident lost power, suddenly shut down, which make the system cannot save all the links in time, the entire file lost. The harddisk should be good in this case
<br />
<br />
(2) the hardware problem make failed to save. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: <br />
To play safe, I suggest to replace the hard disk because you failed to boot up, which means a lot of system files cannot be retrieved with a huge missing link.
<br />
<br />
Sorry for my poor English and presertaion. I hope you can have a full understanding of your harddisk.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anthony

<p>If you have not already, try to power cycle you console.. If this does not help, it may be a connection issue, or an account issue.
</p>
<p>Start with the account issue, and delete and re-download, then from there move to resetting your router/modem, if you have a router, try hard wiring if you can, if you need to, contact your internet provider.
</p>
<p>And at worst try to factory restore your console.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you</p>

<h2>            Retrieve Windows 7 product key for Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help. I have an Acer laptop computer that had Windows 7 installed. I signed up for Windows 10 upgrade earlier this summer via the Windows 10 icon on the taskbar. So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, my hard drive decided to crash prior to the Windows 10 launch. I have put in a new SSD, but I don't have the Windows 7 install disc, or product key. Well, the product key is on a sticker under the laptop, but I cant read all of the numbers
 and letters (the laptop is now five years old).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to retrieve the product key so that I can install Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help me,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, you are unable to get product key after reinstalling Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For product key, you have to contact your system manufacture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get the product key from your system manufacturer, you can activate your windows and try to upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>

</p><p>What am i missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand 15-5 is a 'sync' error and that is most likely hardware related.</p>
<p>However, I am running a i7 9700k on a z390 with a RTX 2080....I don't see anything wrong with that.</p>

 service is running, ran the windows update troubleshooter but it just stuck at "resolving problems" so I restarted in safe mode and clicked windows update in the start menu - nothing happened. Ran the update troubleshooter in safe mode and received:</p>
<p>Windows Update was configured incorrectly - completed</p>
<p>Windows Update needs to be repaired - not fixed.</p>

</p>
<p>By the way, there are no error messages at all. Just No new updates available. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</p>

Do me a favor, Click Start, point to All Programs, and then click Windows Update or Microsoft Update and click Review your update history. Tell me when your last update was.

            Exactly, I don't have any either. Patch Tuesday was July 12 2011 it had 4 updates, 22 bugs. There not consecutive Patch Tuesdays. And in safe mode many people have trouble running Microsoft Updates. Security-related updates are released once a month and
 there hasn't been a widespread virus or worm so the update on the 12th took care of you.

    <title>Resetting password issues &#34;You have already used that password, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulgc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resetting password issues &#34;You have already used that password, try another&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am old and don't want to have to try to remember complicated passwords (Note: my desktop is secure in my home). I am trying to reset the one I currently have to something very simple, but get the message, "You have already used that password, try another".
 I don't want to try another. If I can't set my password to one that I feel is appropriate&nbsp;for me, can I turn the password checking off to not require any passwords??
</p>
<p>I think that I should be in control of what I think is an appropriate password for my computer, not Microsoft.
</p>
<p>Why isn't&nbsp;the password checking local? Why am I going against an MS database? Then when I log on with the wrong password, it says to go to the MS web site to retrieve it (reset it again). Do I have to have another computer to go get my password. This is
 frustrating. </p>

            What I did, and it worked. Is I changed my password multiple times, until it forgot about the password that i wanted to revert to. After I changed it a few times, I could change it back to my previous Password.

            <p>That really sucks because the dry icon is right next to the color match icon and when in to my work the two get mixed up often and I have to trash my project. That alone is unacceptable because that piece can never be duplicated again. The icons are far
 too close and shouldn't even be on the same bar in my opinion. There should be an option which allows one to reverse the process if accidentally selected, seems&nbsp; elementary if you think about it. Love the programs but am very disappointed&nbsp;that accidental drying
 is absolute. Minus at least one star, sorry</p>

<p><span>Hi call_kp</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to help you Automatically connect to Network.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The first time that you connect to a network,
<span>Windows</span> automatically creates a network profile and stores it on your computer. Your computer can then automatically connect to the network in the future, and your preferences for that network will be applied.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>If a wireless network that you want to connect to doesn't appear on the list of available networks, it might be because the network is not broadcasting. In that
 case, you can create a profile for the network so that you can connect to it automatically in the future.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
<span>If you save the network after successfully connecting to it, a profile for the network is stored on your computer. The next time you open Connect to a Network, the network will be in
 the list of available networks, if it is in range of your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Lord-potato, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you do not need a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Lord-potato,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />How did you get Windows 10?
<br />You can always reinstall Windows 10 on the same device, because the license is linked to your motherboard or to your Microsoft Account. If you want you can reinstall Windows 10 using Restore utility in Windows Settings. To do so:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + i
<br />2. Click on "Update and Security"
<br />3. Click on "Recovery"
<br />4. Click on "Start now"
<br />5. Follow on screen instruction.
<br />
<br />This will restore default settings for Windows 10 and you would be able to solve your problem.
        </p>

            Hi Lord-potato
<br />
<br />Did you re-load an earlier version of Windows and then try to upgrade form that?
<br />
<br />Honestly it is better to just clean install Windows 10, you cannot skip entering a product key, if you upgrade, you can, if you clean install Windows 10 . . .

<p>I had the same problem on a clean install, at the time you start your computer do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Repeatedly press F2 to take you to the systems sub menu</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Disable Secure Boot</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Enable Legacy Boot&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then hit restart</span></p>
<p><span>on restart be quick and press the F12 key</span></p>
<p><span>This brings you into the boot order</span></p>
<p><span>Scroll to "Change Boot Order"</span></p>
<p><span>do the security nonsense</span></p>
<p><span>then boot from USB or CD ect, the Disc</span></p>
<p><span>when it says activation code tick the little box for activate later on-line</span></p>

    <title>Can the People app sync with iCloud contacts or Can the Mail app use a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dale298  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the People app sync with iCloud contacts or Can the Mail app use a different contact list to populate emails than the People app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am exploring how to share one calendar and one contact list with my wife.&nbsp; I have a new dell machine now running windows 8.1 with office 2013 installed.&nbsp; After trying to figure a way to use outlook.com I have decided on using icloud (i have 2 ipads, 2
 iphones and 2 pc's running windows in the house).&nbsp; I have icloud syncing with Outlook for both calendar and contacts.&nbsp; I uploaded to google contacts a copy of my outlook 2007 contacts (using currently on old pc), and then synced outlook.com to the google contacts.&nbsp;
 Somehow, I also got the google contacts in to the People app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My issue is</strong>, now that I've decided to use the icloud for contacts and calendar, is there a way to sync icloud with the People app so that my wife can use the Mail app which, I believe, uses the People app for its contacts?&nbsp; Or is there a
 way to have the Mail app pull from the icloud contact book that is being used on Outlook?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to end up with 1 address book and 1 calendar that can sync across my devices listed above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            Honestly, use a Microsoft account. iCloud exists for Apple only. Your Microsoft account can easily sync your contacts and calendars across all the devices you just mentioned AND still sync with Outlook 2007.<br />

<p><br />
I use Outlook 2013 on my new computer -- does that make a difference?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not easy getting my contacts on to outlook.com in the first place since it would not accept my Outlook 2007 export (tried cvs file in dos and windows).&nbsp; finally, was able to upload my file to google contacts and then link that to outlook.com.&nbsp; The
 calendar function from google to outlook.com was turned off, so not sure how to get my current calendar to outlook.com.&nbsp; So far a very frustrating process; if microsoft wants people to use their environment they should make it easy to do so.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming I have the items I need in Outlook.com, I believe I know how to sync them to ipads, iphones (just add account and enable contacts and calendar items), but how does outlook.com share contacts and calendar to outlook 2013?&nbsp; Is the syncing 2 ways between
 outlook 2013 and outlook.com for both calendar and contacts (eg-if I make a change in outlook to a contact, will it sync to outlook.com, and vice-versa)?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Ah, Outlook 2013 is even easier. When setting up a new account, do a manual setup of the "Exchange ActiveSync" account type. The server is m.hotmail.com.
<br />
<br />
Your contacts, calendars, emails and tasks will show up in Outlook 2013.<br />
<br />
For your iPad and iPhones, choose the Windows Live Hotmail or Outlook.com account type for your Microsoft accounts.<br />
<br />
Any changes on any of these devices will sync to all the others.<br />

            <p>Entegy, I've started going down the path of outlook.com because it sounds like the best route for me (if it works :).&nbsp; I've tested it on my iphone and the 2-way sync works well.&nbsp; I hooked it up in an Outlook 2013 test profile and that seems to work as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue I am having now is getting a clean contacts list in to outlook.com.&nbsp; I've exported from Outlook 2007 on my old computer a csv file (both dos and windows version) and tried importing to People in Outlook --- no dice.&nbsp; Doesn't like the files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I need to "unhook" my google contacts from Outlook.com (since it won't let me edit them there) and get in to Outlook.com my current list of contacts that are in Outlook 2007 right now.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

<p>I had this problem and searched hard to find a solution.&nbsp; Here is what finally worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:&nbsp; I wanted to make my iCloud contacts (which I manage on my iPhone) the same as my contacts in the People app on Windows 10 (and therefore usable in the Mail app on Windows 10).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note: this solution assumes you also have Microsoft Outlook 2010/2013/2016 on your Windows PC.&nbsp; I have this (it came with Microsoft Office) but prefer to use Mail as it is simpler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ensure iCloud on PC set up, and 'email, calendar, contacts, ...' is ticked to sync with Microsoft Outlook (this is with Outlook 2013).<br />
2. In Microsoft Outlook on PC, ensure all contacts in 'People' tab listed under iCloud account are copies to contacts under My Contacts.&nbsp; (do this manually every so often).<br />
3. Go to OneDrive online - go to People tab (which is headed Outlook People) and delete all contacts listed there.<br />
4. 'Manage' and choose 'Import contacts'.<br />
5. Choose option 'Outlook 2010, 2013 or 2016' - and follow instructions (to export from Outlook 2013 and import to People online).<br />
6. After several minutes your contacts as per iCloud will appear in People online.&nbsp;
<br />
7. After a few more minutes, you should see the same contacts listed in People from your Mail app on your Windows 10 PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone. </p>

<h2>            Vista Boots to Black Screen with White Cursor and Nothing Else &#40;Black Screen of Death&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Following a download of Microsoft updates last week, my system rebooted. It initially got a blue screen error, rebooted, reported a disk error and automatically ran CHKDSK. Since then, system has booted to black screen with white cursor and nothing else.
 This happens in all boot up options (Normal, Safe, Safe with Command, Last Known Good). Not even sticky keys would come up. Ctrl-Alt-Del, Ctrl-Alt-Esc and all other keys did nothing. Same with right click.</p>
<p>I've searched all of the web for solutions. I've found (and tried) several over the past week but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>Here's what I've tried...</p>
<p>Held F8 key on boot-up and went into startup recovery. Ran recovery. Initially if found disk errors. Fixed those. Then it said it couldn't repair system and reported two driver errors.</p>
<p>Tried System Restore. It said I had no restore points (even though I know I had them before).</p>
<p>Using recovery options I went to command prompt. Called up RegEdit and loaded Software Hive. Checked the WindowsNT Login Entry; made sure it was set to explorer.exe</p>
<p>Loaded System Hive, checked RpcSs Key. Already set to NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService</p>
<p>Renamed event logs in winevt and created not Logs folder</p>
<p>Removed hard drive. Attached to another system (as slave) and checked file permissions. They were all messed up. Fixed file permissions and put drive back in original system.</p>
<p>Now sticky keys works. Does me no good, however, as my sticky keys does not have a configuration link.</p>
<p>Went back into startup recovery via F8 key on boot-up. Now, when I run startup recovery, it says that everything is fine and there are no problems.</p>
<p>I did download the Microsoft hotfix from article 977675, but I don't know how I can apply it without being able to get into windows. I would contact MS e-mail or chat support, but I can't get the product ID without being able to log in (talk about frustrating).</p>
<p>I would re-install OS, but HP does not provide an install disc with their systems (only a full recovery partition). My system is backed up (except for Windows folder), but I really don't want to have to do a full recovery, as I have a lot of specialized
 programs and settings that would probably take me a week to re-install and re-configure.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is my usual BlackScreen troubleshooter as there may be something you have not tried<br />
or if you can gain some access you might be able to revert and retry some of these.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is reached<br />
by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.</strong><br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />
<br />
<span>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1<br />
</span><br />
Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your system<br />
maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it only has to<br />
be bootable).<br />

These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span><span><a href="http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span></a><br />
</span></span><br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Driver PNP Watchdog Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike newsome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver PNP Watchdog Error</h2>
                    <p>Three days ago I decided to take advantage of my wife being away for a week and upgrade her HP TouchSmart 600, which was running Windows 7 to the current version of Windows 10. I utilized Microsoft's Media Creation Tool and created a bootable USB for the
 installation. The installation went fine but with the finishing reboot, the computer went into an endless loop- there is a period of several minutes of the Windows start up screen with the circling dots (which is at least twice as long as a normal start) followed
 by the blue failure screen with the error message&nbsp; DRIVER PNP WATCHDOG ERROR.&nbsp; I have research this issue since then and tried everything that has been posted with nothing positive to report. I have even utilized D-BAN to do a clean wipe of the drive (20 hours)
 so I could do a clean install and the same error returns. I have used Windows versions 1903, 1803 and 1809 and all wind up with the same issue. I have used the Media Creation Tool as well as RUFUS with the same result. I have even utilized a bootable USB made
 remotely on my desktop my a Microsoft Support person and you guess it, same result. I thought, while I try to elevate the issue to someone higher at Microsoft support (I've dealt with three Level one techs today) I'd put this out there and see if anyone has
 anything new they can share. I see this problem goes back for quite some time with several different version of Windows 10. I can also add that I can get to Advance Tools on the Bootable, but none of them work to resolve the issue. The computer will not boot
 to Safe Mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could sure use some help!</p>

            HI Mike.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands,  each followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps in the first link tutorial to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mike
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It appears this system is not certified compatible with Windows 10. All the drivers pre-date Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce an incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include: rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />If you need help with downgrading to the original working version of Windows you had prior to upgrading to Windows 10, do let us know.

<br />
<br />You should probably go back to Windows 7 and stick with it.

<p>Thanks Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While that's disappointing it makes the most sense of anything I've heard or read over the past three days. I get that the most recent version of Windows, 1903, doesn't work buy wouldn't version 1511 or possibly 1703 work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do wind up going back to Windows 7, do you recommend wiping the drive clean first? Prior to starting, I made a complete backup to an external drive just in case something like this happened.</p>

            You could always try an extremely older version such as Windows 10 1507 and 1703 which are no longer supported, but keep in those are not getting security updates. 
<br />
<br />So, give it a try first to see if it works, but I think, you ultimately would get better mileage using Windows 8.1. 
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work out and you do decide to go back to Windows 7, then you can do a clean install during setup.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What is the UEFI/BIOS firmware version presently installed, and the latest on the PC or motherboard's downloads page?
<br />
<br />What are the UEFI settings in Setup for UEFI, CSM or Legacy BIOS, Secure and Fast Boot, Boot Priority order?  
<br />
<br />How was the media created, was it booted as a UEFI device?
<br />
<br />I've probably troubleshot 10,000 or more installs and helped millions more Clean Install with my tutorials for 10 years daily in forums.  I can help you get it installed no matter what, if not you can install to another PC and move the drive to this one.  But I need feedback on at least the questions I just asked.

            Thats probably best. Considering its from 2010, thats going nearly 10 years now. Even my 5 year old Surface Pro is starting to feel stretched with the latest Windows 10 Feature Update. :)

            Thanks Greg, but we are dealing with a computer that is nearly 10 years old. We have been talking about replacing it. With this effort I was just hoping to delay that a bit. I plan to put it back to Windows 7 and start looking for a replacement.

            Hi Mike -
<br />
<br />That's a good long life for a PC, if it's still working with Windows 7 then doing a Windows 7 Clean Install may make it last even longer.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps for the gold standard Windows 7 Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the download link in Step 1 is dead and you don't have installation media, let me know and I'll help you find it.

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Start &#62; Search Application by Typing does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.battermann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Start &#62; Search Application by Typing does not applications listed in Start Menu &#40;such as Outlook, Excel, ...&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed Windows 10 yesterday, installed Office 2016 (from / via the Office 365 installer), Visual Studio and a couple other normal desktop applications but for some reason whenever I press the Start Button and start typing (i.e. 'Excel') it always
 says 'No results found for Excel' - even though it is right -there- in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same goes for all (?) other installed applications (Word, Outlook, Visual Studio, Acrobat Reader,... ) - NONE of them are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I kept the PC idle / running for an hour or two in order to let it do its indexing (assuming it might just take a little while) even though this is a 8 Core machine with Nvme SSDs only... but nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried the 'Rebuild Index' functionality of the 'Indexing Options' - again.. no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried changing the Index locations (by adding 'C:\Program Files (x86)', 'C:\Program Files') and explicitely adding MY 'Start Menu' folder in my 'Roaming' Profile in AppData.. and try to Rebuild the Index... but again NOPE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For some strange reason entries of the Start Menu are NOT showing up in the Start Menu &gt; Start Typing search... while default Windows functionality works (i.e. entering 'Event' shows 'Event Viewer' as expeced... or 'CMD' / 'Command' shows 'Command Prompt')...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why is that and how do I get it to work again - prior to re-installing (my 'old' Windows 10 installation) it -did- work perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-J</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>of course I rebooted several times.. let the pc sit idle (with no background apps running or me interacting in case it would have impact on indexing) - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I did perform a repair upgrade as per the linked description.. and again - NO change.. only a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to be clear:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have i.e. Outlook installed &amp; it is in my Start Menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88f221b2-5f5c-4e89-99ba-72d7a3f6f100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88f221b2-5f5c-4e89-99ba-72d7a3f6f100" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>.. however when I press the 'Start' Button (mouse or via Windows Key) and type in 'Outlook'..
<strong>no </strong>Outlook appears.. same for Excel, Word, Visual Studio.. all the 'normal' Desktop applications:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0df7d8a-7209-498b-90e9-818e86293554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0df7d8a-7209-498b-90e9-818e86293554" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So again - I've wasted my time repair installing Windows.. but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How DO I get the applications to show up here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-J</p>

<p>Windows 10 is Version 1703 (OS Build 1506.250) Office is v 2016 MSO 16.0.8067.2032 and both have no pending updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem not only occurs with Office applications, but ANY desktop application installed (as I said.. Visual Studio, VMware Workstation.. Visual Studio Code, Acrobat.. etc etc etc) - none of them are 'found' when typing their name(s).</p>

<p>DISM restore health syntax in command prompt should be able to fix this apparently, DISM in Creators build has issues aswell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try system file check:</p>
<p>

<p>2. Type sfc /scannow.</p>

<h2>            Windows cannot be activated</h2>
                    Dear Microsoft,<br />
<br />
I recently bought a new hard drive for my PC since the last one got corrupted. Now I am unable to activate windows vista starter, after installing it.<br />
<br />
I posted a question about this on the forum previously and was told that this was because the hardware ID has changed. I also got instructions on how I can re-activate windows again.<br />
<br />
But when i go along the steps and try to activate windows through the telephone, the number I get is an indian number that I cannot seem to contact. My local telecommunication service says that this number is not in use.<br />
<br />
The number from the Activation service - +91 08 40103000<br />
<br />
Please let me know what I can do to re-activate windows.

            <p>hi</p>
<p>you are replying to a 2009 thread</p>
<p>in these forums you start your own question/thread</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if you had contacted Acer they would have sent you a recovery disk to reinstall vista for a nominal $ cost</p>
<p>and if they never gave you a recovery disk when you bought it you would have had a hidden recovery partition on your hard rive</p>
<p>you press Alt + F10 at Boot to commence that recovery process on an Acer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>And you could upgrade Vista Home Basic to Home Premium or Vista&nbsp;Ultimate without losing any Data</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>all you had to do was uninstall a service pack if necessary,if the installed service pack level was greater than what was on the disk, then upgrade</p>

            <p>Hello, people seeking help with your Windows Vista upgrade, and trying to "move up' without loosing all the "stuff" you have on your computer...allow me to share my story if you would:
</p>
<p>I have had the same MAJOR PROBLEM for the past year. I bought a new Acer computer in 2010, and Windows Vista was already installed on it, BUT I DIDN'T GET A COPY OF THE DISK. So after a nasty virus wiped my PC out a year later, I had NO disk to use to put
 Windows back on my computer! The computer store that repaired my PC and cleaned the virus out, replaced my Windows Vista program, with what they said was MY VISTA, and AGAIN, I still had no copy of my own! So they ended up giving me a burned copy of Vista
 so that if I got a virus again, I could re-install it again myself...About 3 weeks later, I started getting pop-up messages that my Windows would be EXPIRING in "_____so many days"..(backwards down from 30 days to 1 day left...) and I was like, "what the heck;
 now what?" </p>
<p>Each time I try to register my copy of Windows online, I got an error-type message that kept telling me that my serial number is "already in use" - Well, even if it wasn't a copy that the computer store hadn't given me, I would be getting the same message,
 they said, BECAUSE IT'S MINE - STUPID MICROSOFT !</p>
<p>I REGISTERED MY COPY OF WINDOWS VISTA WHEN I FIRST GOT MY COMPUTER! </p>
<p>I have tried EVERYTHING. All I can do is either spend another $100 or so dollars and buy Windows 7 which I don't want (Hey I liked XP the best, call me "old school"..I am hanging on to Vista as long as I can...I don't even like IE-9!) All I can do is purchase
 tons of removable storage, move everything i have on my PC over to that every 29 days, and re-install this disk I have all over again. Not to mention having to reinstall Adobe Acrobat reader, all my free virus protection, Adobe Flash, Quicktime, etc., everything
 I use !</p>
<p>I have to copy all I have on my PC, move it off and then all back on again, EVERY MONTH until I buy a new Windows program.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I tried explaining all of this same information on the phone to Microsoft Help, and they either could not understand what I was saying (why there are no ENGLISH speaking operators is beyond me) or they told me I would have to pay $29.95 for
 Microsoft Tech Support!! Unless you have a new computer, they usually can't help you..</p>
<p>THIS TIME THOUGH, I decided to try starting with what I thought was the "lowest one",
<u>Windows Vista Starter</u> , that way I could upgrade on my disk a few more options "up" without losing everything or doing clean re-install. Well, from reading all these posts on Microsoft and other tech forums, I have learned that I can't do that. I did
 upgrade once before on my disk, without losing everything, from SOMETHING - now I can't remember which one it was, - to Windows Vista ULTIMATE and
<u>that did work</u>. </p>
<p>So here I am now, 9 or so re-installs later, and thought I'd maybe help someone else out there by sharing my experience, as it was similar to the previous story on this forum.. I was looking for help too, and after searching Google for "upgrading from Windows
 Home Basic to **** ", <u>I have learned that I cannot upgrade from Windows Home Basic to ANYTHING ELSE ON MY DISK..</u> I have to LOOSE EVERYTHING AGAIN and do a clean install.
</p>
<p>Oh well, live and learn. I'm going to have to deal with this difficulty until I can afford to spend more money to purchase another Windows version besides Vista. 'Just thought I'd share that I have the same problem, and wish you all good luck..</p>
