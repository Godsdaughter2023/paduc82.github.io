<p>Hi rezakim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code 0x80004005 will occur if you're trying to access/manage a folder that you don't have access rights permissions to. The user might be accidentally removed from the user names on the folder’s Security tab. That's why the access permission was lost
 on that specific folder. Let's try to give full access of the folder to the user that is currently logged in. Kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> the folder that you're trying to rename.</li><li>Select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Security </strong>tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit...</strong>.</li><li>On the new window that will pop up, click<strong> Add...</strong>.</li><li>Another window will pop up. Under <strong>Enter the object names to select</strong>, type
<strong>Everyone</strong>, then click <strong>Check Names</strong>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/735b31ce-c144-4d35-a3bd-2b97a2cd9f7c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/735b31ce-c144-4d35-a3bd-2b97a2cd9f7c?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li></ul>
</li><li>Hit <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Going back to the previous window, under <strong>Group or user names</strong>, highlight
<strong>Everyone</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Permissions for Everyone</strong>, check the box to Allow Full control.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4412420-d814-4ab1-bb7f-96e029f689ad?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4412420-d814-4ab1-bb7f-96e029f689ad?upload=true" /></a><br />
</li></ul>
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>. </li><li>Close the remaining sheets.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue will persist after performing the steps above, try to create a <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new user profile</a></strong>, and check if it'll make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using a Windows 10 Insider Preview build on your PC? If yes, we suggest that you update your computer to the new Fast Ring build 15042 as the new build contains fixes for the Settings app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you create a new user account on your computer and check if you will encounter the same issue with the Settings app. For steps on how to create a new user account, refer to the following link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a local user account in Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated with the results.</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to us. It looks like a scaling issue when on a high-resolution display. Can you check if you will experience this issue on different window sizes? Kindly resize the Settings window to different sizes and see if the gray boxes will
 appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you report this issue in the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/FeedbackHub/fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Insider Feedback Hub</a>. Reporting will help increase the visibility of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes for us to assist you further. </p>

<h3> fatherrich  say:</h3>
<h2>            LG Electronics GBC-H20L Blu-Ray Drive hangs wakeup from sleep</h2>
                    Came installed on my HP Pavilion Elite desktop.<br />
Did an upgrade install of Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit from Vista Home Premium 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Now, when waking up from sleep, the descktop begins to came back, but freezes, with mouse cursor able to move, but can't do anything with it.<br />
<br />
This blu-ray drive keeps making a noise and blinking its light repeatedly.<br />
I then have to do a hard reboot and computer will come back up.<br />
<br />
Strangely, it comes back up following the hard reboot with the desktop intact with everything that had been running before it went to sleep.<br />
<br />
Have installed all driver updates HP called for and Windows Update.<br />
LG website is silent on any firmware updates.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 compatibility says it should work.<br />

3 hours with tech support did no good - any ideas?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to be an issue with the chipset or graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you have a look at HP website to update the same and check if it helps.<br />

            Thanks for the input.<br />
I have installed the updates from both Microsoft and HP.<br />
The problem has been narrowed down somewhat, as we discovered that turning off the hybrid sleep mode stops it from occurring.<br />
The mission now is to find out why it will work OK in regular sleep and hibernate sleep, but not in hybrid sleep.<br />

            The final answer I got from MS was that some computers will not work properly with hybrid sleep enabled, even though W7 offers the choice.<br />
<br />
Does this seem correct to others out there?<br />
<br />

            Hi Jody.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> They want us to buy a DVD player in Windows 10, but the free options actually work better.   See here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd use VLC which is the world's most popular media player for a reason:
<br /><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>.  It just works.

    <title>SENS service not responding while accessing guest account and unable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lastgas  say:</h3>
<h2>            SENS service not responding while accessing guest account and unable to install camera app</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to troubleshoot the Camera app on my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. When I booted in Safe Mode, the Camera app wouldn't run, saying that I couldn't use the built-in administrator account. So I enabled the Guest account and logged out. I was presented
 with two options to log-in, my Microsoft account that is the administrator account, and the Guest account. When I selected the Guest account, it waited a long time and then gave the message: "Unable to connect to the Sens service" and computer became unresponsive,
 even the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I held down the power button until it finally powered down. Then when I tried to start the system again, only the Guest account option was displayed, and the system was unresponsive, eventually giving the same error message. &nbsp;I tried this several times.
 I could not get into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I had no way to get into Windows, I determined that my only option was a Refresh, which I did, giving it my Microsoft administrator account. After the refresh, Windows started, but somehow I was logged in with the Guest account again. When I logged
 out then, I was able to log back in with the Administrator account and the computer went through all of its re-initialization steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what went wrong? How is the guest account enabled without making a mess of my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the Camera app still crashes.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hello Kevin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, I understand that the issue you have experiencing while login on your computer was caused by the unresponsiveness of “System Event Notification
 Service” (SENS) service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Applications designed for use by mobile users require a unique set of connectivity functions and notifications. In the past these individual applications were
 required to implement these features internally. The System Event Notification Service (SENS) now provides these capabilities in the operating system, creating a uniform connectivity and notification interface for applications. Using SENS developers can determine
 connection bandwidth and latency information from within their application and optimize the application's operation based on those conditions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have already refresh your computer, it seems like your issue related with SENS have been resolved and its corruption been repaired.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What Refresh actually do is, applications</span><span> you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed.
 Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you are still facing an issue while installing Camera App, I will certainly assist you with that. However, we need few more details to understand the issue
 better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What happens when you try to access the camera app? Do you get any error message?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>As of now. I suggest you the following step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and run the Windows App troubleshooter. It resolve the issues related with Microsoft new style Apps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the Link to download
<strong>Windows App Troubleshooter:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persists even after running App troubleshooter, then go through the article based on it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the article based on
<strong>“Troubleshoot problems with an app”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you try to perform this task with an admin account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I suggest you to login with an admin account and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your account has administrative privileges, then too if you are facing difficulties, I suggest you to try the methods provided below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>•Open an elevated command prompt. (Right click on start button and select command prompt admin)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>•Type takeown /U %username% /F %USERPROFILE% /R /SKIPSL (You may also need the /P &lt;password&gt;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>•Once that completes type cacls %USERPROFILE% /T /E /G %USERNAME%:F</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This should force you to be the owner of everything in your profile and grant you full access.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still prissiest, try Method 2,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Press </span></span><span><span>WinKey</span></span><span><span>+ Q, type
</span></span><strong><span>user accounts</span></strong><span><span>and click on the result.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then select your User Account &gt; Click <strong><span>Manage another account</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the following window, click <strong><span>Add a user account option</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now we have to create a local account user. So after clicking
<em><span>Add an account</span></em>, click <strong><span>Sign in without a Microsoft account (Not recommended)</span></strong>, then click<strong><span>Local account</span></strong>. Fill the details on the screen so appeared for adding local account. Click
<strong><span>Finish</span></strong> when done.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + Q</strong> and type <strong>
cmd</strong>, for the search results, click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Type following command and hit
<span>Enter</span> key: <strong>shutdown /r /o</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The previous step will result your system to boot into
<em><span>Safe Mode</span></em>. After getting into <em><span>Safe Mode</span></em>, press
<strong><span>Windows Key + Q</span></strong>, type <strong><span>user accounts</span></strong>, and pick the same from results so appear. You would have now two accounts on your system; first you’re issued admin account and second the local account which you’ve
 created in <em><span>step 2</span></em>. Select local account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now click <strong><span>Change the account type</span></strong> link in following window:</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Moving on, change the account status from <strong>
<span>Standard</span></strong> <strong><span>to</span></strong> <strong><span>Administrator</span></strong>. Click
<strong><span>Change Account Type</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In this way, the new local account we’ve created has been changed to Administrator. Now you can restart your machine and log into this account with administrator rights. Since you have administrative privileges now; so you can back up your documents
 from the old administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Finally, delete the old admin account and switch to Microsoft account to synchronize your settings with new administrative account. Your system will now act normally with full admin rights in your hand.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            How do I delete my input history in Cangjie &#40;Changjie&#41; input method&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using Cangjie (Changjie) on Windows 10 for Chinese input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I found out that, when I am using the on-screen keyboard, the bar of candidate words always shows phrases I've typed earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how I can erase this input history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turning off "Show text suggestions as I type"</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling the Cangjie IME</li><li>Turning off "Prompt Associated phrases of the input character" in the Cangjie options page</li><li>Turning off "getting to know me" in Privacy</li></ol>
<p>But none of them is working. I can still see my input history in the candidate words bar when I type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching on the Internet but got no results. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone here can tell me how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>R.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Rees,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry to inform there is no option to delete input history in Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and <br />

            <p>Hello Sudharshan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that currently there may be no option to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for newer versions of Cangjie IME or Windows 10 to&nbsp;include this feature and enable&nbsp;input&nbsp;history clearing? Where can I send a request for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ability to erase input history seems to&nbsp;differ between IMEs: There is a "delete history" in MS Bopomofo and a "clear input history" in MS Pinyin, but there are no such options for MS Cangjie or MS Quick. Can this option be given to all IMEs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you very much for your help on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>R.</p>

                    <p>I got a blackscreen of death yesterday, and wasnt able to log in. This happend after I tried to change the background of the login screen.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you upgrade to Windows 10 - Windows Update or with Media Creation tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to hard reboot the system by pressing and holding the power button until the system shuts down. Power on the system after 3-4 minutes and check if you are able to boot successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then you might have to boot from the installation media and run a Startup repair.
<span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page to create media:

<ol>

    <title>HP printer will not connect to USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janmichele  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP printer will not connect to USB</h2>
                    I have Windows 10, a Dell computer. I use IE. My HP printer was working fine until a few days ago. After 3 hours of troubleshooting, trying to get some sort of support from HP (none), uninstalling, reinstalling, recovering programs, the only error message
 I continued to get was HP DeskJet 2130 series/Printer Connection Unsuccessful/the printer was not able to connect successfully over the USB cable. &nbsp; OK, so I bought a new cable, reinstalled the whole process again only to get the same error message. Anyone
 know a solution? (HP is no help unless I pay $). THANKS!

            I don't think there were any changes made prior to the malfunction. But, to be sure, I did a System Restore to 3 weeks back.&nbsp; I only have the one computer.&nbsp; I did get automated instructions from the printer website which I followed 3 times and each time
 still got the same error message as stated above. The printer turns on and does the usual sounds its always done when it was working. When I follow all the instructions, lastly connecting the cable, I get a message from Microsoft saying the device was connected,
 but I still get the error message stated above, and when I try to print out a page, HP Printer is not recognized in the printer options and the printer will not print.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for getting back to us with the said information. The best method to isolate the issue is to check your printer's instruction manual to ensure that the printer is not displaying any error light that indicates a hardware failure. You may also want
 to test the printer on another computer to see if it works. Otherwise, the best point of contact for this concern is from you hardware manufacturer.<br />

<p>Thanks for your help. I did get a troubleshoot form from HP website. I followed all the instructions in detail. Did this 3 different times. The computer would say that all was installed correctly but then an error message said that there was no connection,
 to unplug the printer cable and try again. I did this 3 times to no solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the computer and printer to a computer repair shop today and I was told that the problem was a virus. The printer connected fine with their instore computer. They said they could try to get rid of the virus but that it could be difficult and still
 might not work, but they were going to charge me $99.99 just to try. I didn't leave the computer because there was no guarantee that the virus could be deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was fine a week ago. No problem at all with the printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have advice on what to do in this situation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would doing a system restore several weeks back help?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an anti-virus program that's dependable for less than $100.00? and is there one that can rid the virus for sure?</p>
<p>I'm very frustrated and stunned. I depend a lot on a printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you see them running a malware scan using an anti-malware application that reported the presence of malware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't then I suspect that they are not telling you the truth.&nbsp; However, you need to check for yourself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Run a full scan with Windows defender - if its icon is not in your System tray [right-hand end of the Taskbar] then start it from your Start menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on&nbsp;Virus &amp; threat protection</li><li>Click on&nbsp;Advanced scan</li><li>Select Full scan and click on Scan now</li><li>It will only give you any useful information if it actually finds anything to report on.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; You can also run a Windows defender Offline scan but I believe that this is a waste of time unless Windows defender has told you that it has found something for which this would be useful -
</p>
<ul>
<li>Still within Windows defender, Virus &amp; threat protection, Advanced scan</li><li>Select Windows defender Offline scan and click on Scan now</li><li>The computer will reboot and conduct a scan then restart Windows.</li><li>It will only give you any useful information if it actually finds anything to report on.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; If you want another opinion, download and scan with <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free</a>.&nbsp; Be careful during installation that you do not accept any free trial of their premium version that has real-time protection because that would interfere with Windows defender.&nbsp; I also have this on my computer so I have a
 built-in second opinion available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult for malware to hide from an anti-malware scan.&nbsp; It is exceedingly difficult for it to hide from multiple anti-malware scanners so if both Windows defender &amp; Malwarebytes say your computer is clean then it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that distraction out of the way you will, at least, be able to get back to the main problem of your printer setup.&nbsp; I'll add another post with my thoughts on that in a moment [I want to review this thread again first].</p>
<p>

<p>Personally, I think that this problem might well have been caused by a faulty Windows update to your printer driver.&nbsp; What I do not understand is why reinstallation is not curing the problem straightaway.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have experienced faulty Windows updates to my printer and many others have.&nbsp;
</li><li>I am pretty sure that, on one occasion, I was forced to reinstall the printer not because of a faulty Windows update to my printer driver but because a recent Windows update had changed Windows' method of communicating with printers.</li><li>I am always suspicious of System restore as it can leave some things in an unknown state [half-installed or half-configured] without telling you.&nbsp; When this problem is fixed we can discuss alternatives that are much more dependable.</li><li>I assume that you have no other computer faults at the moment.</li><li>I assume, for example, that you are able to print to PDF using the built-in Microsoft print to PDF printer.&nbsp; Please try this now&nbsp;if you have not used it recently.</li><li>I suspect that&nbsp;your printer connecting to that store's computer successfully was a red herring.&nbsp; Unless they ran through the installation procedure then they could only have automatically installed the MS-sourced printer driver and that proves nothing other
 than that the printer &amp; its USB cable have not blown up or melted.&nbsp; That MS-sourced driver is probably 10MB but the HP software is round about 100MB because it does a lot more than just install a driver.</li><li><em>My printer is an HP DJ 2540 so I imagine that there is hardly any difference in the procedures required.&nbsp; Unlike you, however, I hardly ever use my printer nowadays.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Go to the Printers &amp; devices dialog, right-click on the printer, check all the various properties entries looking for anything that might be useful diagnostic data.&nbsp; {Start menu, Windows system, Control panel, Devices &amp; printers [or Hardware &amp; Sound,
 View devices &amp; printers]}</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Go to the Start menu, HP entry.&nbsp; If an uninstall item is there then use it as it will give you the cleanest possible state from which to start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; If there was no uninstall item then check your HP user manual for uninstall instructions and use them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; Check the HP website for uninstall instructions and use them.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Start at <span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">https://support.hp.com/gb-en/product/HP-DeskJet-2130-All-in-One-Printer-series/7174550</span> and see the guidance in all the tabs on the left.</li><li>Then do a search for <em>uninstall printer</em> / <em>delete printer</em> / <em>
remove printer</em> / ... </li><li>Then go to their user forum - <span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=deskjet+2130</span> and see what guidance exists.</li><li>Then do a search in the user forum for <em>uninstall printer</em> / <em>delete printer</em> /
<em>remove printer</em> / ... </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; Go to Settings, Devices, Printers &amp; scanners and select any remaining entries that refer to your printer then click on
<em>Remove device</em>.&nbsp; If you are given any options such as <em>Remove all its drivers &amp; settings?
</em>then say <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6&nbsp; Go to Device manager. Set <em>View</em>, <em>Show hidden devices</em>.&nbsp; If any entries for this printer still exist then right-click on them and select Uninstall device.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;{Start menu, Windows system, Control panel, Device manager&nbsp;[or Hardware &amp; Sound,
 Device manager]}</p>
<p>
</p><p>7&nbsp; Before proceeding with another attempt, stop all Windows hardware updates [this is a broad weapon and it means you will have to check for hardware updates manually every so often] - go to Start menu, Windows system, Control panel, System [or System &amp;
 security then System], Advanced system settings, Hardware tab, Device installation settings, No, Save changes.&nbsp;
<em>We can also discuss the ramifications of this setting afterwards.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>8&nbsp; Go to the HP link&nbsp;again and download their latest software for your printer.&nbsp; Choose the full software download not just the basic driver.&nbsp; Check that it says it is the Windows 10 version of the software.&nbsp; While it's downloading, check their installation
 instructions [they normally tell you at what stage of running their software to connect the printer - they used to insist that you uninstalled the previous version first but recent versions have not done so].</p>
<p>
</p><p>9&nbsp; Disconnect from the internet.&nbsp; This is just to ensure that Windows cannot start doing anything distracting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10&nbsp; Run their installation software.&nbsp; {When it completes, it will probably ask you to register online but you can skip that or just do it whilst not connected to the internet and it should then confirm that it has finished}</p>
<p>
</p><p>11&nbsp; Test the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the buttons on the printer to print its test page [to prove the printer itself is okay]</li><li>Go to your Start menu, HP group and run the software.&nbsp; It will attempt to communicate with the printer so might&nbsp;give you useful information straightaway.&nbsp; The opening page of the HP Printer assistant window that opens probably has an entry for
<em>Maintain your printer</em> &amp; that has a <em>Print diagnostic test page</em> item.</li><li>If it all works then try printing from one of your applications as you would normally do.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>12&nbsp; If the printer still does not work then go to your Start menu, HP group and run the software.&nbsp; In the HP Printer Assistant window, select Utilities in the toolbar/ribbon, select HP Print &amp; scan doctor [it will download HPP&amp;SD if it needs to so you might
 need to reconnect to the internet at this stage].&nbsp; <em>In my case, this tool was wonderful and immediately identified a stupid mistake I had made in setting up my printer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>13&nbsp; If this does not work then I suggest running&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">SFC</a> and then trying again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>14&nbsp; If this does not work then I suggest running a "Repair install" and then trying again.&nbsp; I can guide you through that but, in essence, you&nbsp;create a Windows 10 installation disk on USB then run its setup.exe file from within&nbsp;File explorer&nbsp;so it overwrites
 Windows files [run this way, it does not reinstall as such so your own files &amp; your installed applications are not affected even though it is still worthwhile getting your backups up to date first].</p>

<p>The only change made was a system recovery which I had done at other times, not often, with no problem to the printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the printer and computer to a computer repair place and they said the printer worked fine on their computer. Their result was that it "might" be a virus that could be slowly destroying things on the computer and that they could try getting rid of
 it for $99.99 but there was no guarantee.</p>
<p>This sounded too expensive and not very promising, so I just brought the computer and printer back home where they still sit, printer useless.</p>
<p>The HP website sent a troubleshooting program to download which I did. When the download finished I got a message saying it was complete, but got an ERROR message from Microsoft that the USB was not connected, which it WAS.</p>
<p>I switched the cable to different USB ports, didn't work. I bought a new cable, didn't work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The printer error light does not come on. The computer repair place says the printer works on their computer but they couldn't get it to work on mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer worked fine on my computer for more than a year. It just suddenly could not be recognized by Microsoft!</p>

            <p>1.Not getting any identified message.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Status" column&nbsp;in printer que first says "Printing" then after&nbsp; delay&nbsp;changes to&nbsp;"Error".&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; HP LaserJet CP1525nw</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I don't think so, but I did have this same problem last fall,&nbsp;and somehow figured it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to my two laptops, I have a Motorola Xoom.&nbsp; I have HP ePrint installed&nbsp;on it, and after I got it back from Motorola last fall after they&nbsp;installed
 the Verizon&nbsp;4G&nbsp;LTE&nbsp;upgrade, it would no longer print to&nbsp;Wi-FI, and the second laptop stopped prnting.&nbsp; By fooling around with the "Share"settings on my main laptop, I was able to get&nbsp;all three to print again.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I don't remember what I did.&nbsp; &nbsp;Same
 problem this time; my main laptop will print wirelesly, but my other laptop and Xoom won't print.&nbsp; Same symptom on both, says it's printing, then doesn't, but no error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've removed and re-installed the&nbsp;printer software numerous times on both laptops.&nbsp; I've printed out the&nbsp; printer wireless network test&nbsp;report numerous times and see nothing wrong.&nbsp; I've run the Windows Troubleshooter numerous times and it doesn't find anything
 wrong.&nbsp;The printer is always detected over the wireless network on both laptops and the Xoom and the TCP/IP is correct.&nbsp;I've set my main&nbsp;laptop that will print so it will not sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I think this is a Windows 7 problem related&nbsp;to the "Share" settings.&nbsp; What are the right settings for&nbsp;not using&nbsp;Share so that each&nbsp;computer&nbsp;independently connects to the&nbsp; printer?&nbsp; Since I don't have&nbsp; a computer connected directly to the printer, I&nbsp; don't
 think I can use Share, and also becasue the Xoom will not&nbsp;be able to connect to that. Is there somewhere I have&nbsp;missed setting up my permissions&nbsp;on my main laptop where that setting is blocking access to the printer by my other computers?</p>
<p>I will say one more thing.&nbsp; My Xoom was just updated with Ice Cream Sandwich.&nbsp; I can't&nbsp; imagine that could be related, but is just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Sound Recorder, you can record sound as a digital media file on your computer from a variety of devices, such as a microphone that is
<br />
plugged in to your sound card. The types of audio input sources you can record from depend on the audio devices you have, as well as on the<br />
input sources that are available on the sound card that is installed on your computer.</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have an audio input device, such as a microphone, connected to your computer.</p>
<p>2. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, and then click Sound Recorder.</p>
<p>3. Click Start Recording.</p>
<p>4. To stop recording audio, click Stop Recording.</p>
<p>5. (Optional) If you want to continue recording audio, click Cancel. In the Save As dialog box, click Resume Recording, continue to record sound, and then<br />

    <title>Write Access denied to .ini setup files installed in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> systrata  say:</h3>
<h2>            Write Access denied to .ini setup files installed in C&#58;&#92;windows folder by a commercial application &#40;made for XP&#41;</h2>
                    Hi There,<br />
I have read at many places in this forum that Win 7 prevent access in writting to certain folders such as program file, windows folder, etc...<br />
Well I have installed a CAD package that I have purchased $$$ during the Win XP era and it is working "almost" correctly under Win 7.
<br />
As far as a could test the only problem that the application is encountering is writting updated config parameters to its .ini files stored by default in the c:\Windows folder or Win 7 (I agree its probably not a very good practice...) .
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How can I provide write permission to the application to these .ini files so that it can update its config when I change it in the program environnement?</span>
<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;use an administrator account and UAC is "disabled" and it seems the application is still not able to update its inin files automatically...<br />
<br />
I have done a few tests and if I load the ini file into notepad and edit it manually, then save it back to the windows folder, next time I start the application, its gets the updated ini config perfectly well and all is well, except that It is a pain to go
 edit manually a file for specific CAD libraries (electronics parts) &nbsp;files to be loaded or unloaded (ok I know I could by default edit once and for all the ini file to include all library files, but it is not practical and will chew up memory...).<br />
<br />
Any solution to this problem welcome (I would like to try ovoiding having to&nbsp;run the XP mode virtual machine to solve the problem) since the application is running perfectly well for all other purposes.<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

            - What privilege does your normal Windows account have? User? Administrator?<br />
- What are the attributes of the problem file? Read-only? Windows Explorer will tell you.<br />
- What are the permissions for this file? Write access for everyone? Or only read access? Windows Explorer will tell you (Properties/Security).<br />

<p>Sorry to hijack the thread, but it looks like there hasn't been a response since Feb. I have the same problem, and notice that someone else is also looking for the answer.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is a Windows 7 gimmick. It could be something we can change via GP, or even better for just one file.</p>
<p>In my case, my domain account is configured as a local admin account. &lt;computername&gt;/Users &amp; &lt;computername&gt;/Administrators both have access to this file. Users can read and execute, Admins have near enough full acces.</p>
<p>I am only able to read the file. If i open the file manually by notepad i can read, but when i save it asks me to save it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The file is not read-only.</p>
<p>Hope that helps to diagnose further for the other people also having this problem.</p>

<p>I think the following thread holds the answer - even though it relates to Windows Server 2008. It points at the UAC, which can be adjusted via group policy. Apparently local Administrator and users who are a member of the local admins group have two different
 security tokens...</p>

<p>Ok, I've figured out where it is now, but I can't get 2 players working. It has the first user signed in and says press the menu button to sign in the 2nd. When I do this though, it just takes me back to the menu (funny that)</p>

<p>I have found that only the second player can actually sign in with the second controller. For example: I was signed in as player one. I tried to sign in as player two with the second controller. I was having the same issue as you. But I had my wife pick
 up the second controller and it let her sign in as player two. The xbox knows who's in the room and will automatically sign you in.</p>

<p>I had this confusion as well. I sit very close to the kinect so it doesn't get both of us in or holding the controllers in our laps so in the end we just switched off kinect and in the home screen signed into a profile with each controller.</p>

    <title>Can not set default printer on Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> combine junkie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not set default printer on Server</h2>
                    <p>My problem is that we are running a terminal server to host our accounting software, from which we need to print of invoices and the like.&nbsp; My problem is that only 1 station out of 20 is throwing an error with trying to have a default printer.&nbsp; It is currently
 running on Windows Server 2012 R2, using RDP to connect.&nbsp; It throws the 709 code whenever I try to set the printer as default, but I have checked the registry and there is no device data to alter to set the printer that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged in as the administrator and the device is set properly as the default printer on the server itself.&nbsp; I have also tried to carry the local printer settings over to the server (using RDP) but it does not show them, only the shared printers on
 the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to note the station has no ability to open the start menu, search function or much else. I can still access the folders via the task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If more detail is needed please ask I will do my best to answer.&nbsp; I took over the IT work at this company and the history I got from the guy before my was spotty at best, so I can not be sure.</p>

<p><span>Hi All,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According your unattended file that is fine, Sysprep command also true, now you may ask me what else you missed out.</span></p>
<p><span>1. make sure Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service is stopped.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Apart from default (Hidden one)&nbsp;&amp; your master profile other profile should be deleted</span></p>
<p><span>3. go to--&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList, remove un necessary<span>&nbsp;</span>profiles ( this is important for copying master
 profile)</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any other users accounts except these you will have issue:</span></p>
<p><span>S-1-5-18</span></p>
<p><span>S-1-5-19</span></p>
<p><span>S-1-5-20</span></p>
<p><span>S-1-5-21-3109238584-963930101-2188137106-500 (if you are using administrator profile to copy for other remaining users this is needed else by clicking on SID it will show you username
 keep that)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from these you can delete</span></p>
<p><span>4. Now run the Sysprep as mentioned (sysprep.exe /oobe /reboot /generalize /unattend:unattend.xml)</span></p>
<p><span>Incase if you have any issue, please check&nbsp;the c:\windows \panter\unattendedgc\setupact log file.</span></p>

<p>Hi Steve, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outdated Network adapter is one of the usual reasons why you may be experiencing this issue. We would like to know if you've already tried updating your Network adapter? Were you able to connect other devices on your Wi-Fi? Can you confirm if you've already
 tried the troubleshooting steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15287/windows-why-can-not-get-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've already tried all the steps on the article provided, we would suggest downloading the latest Network adapter from your manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response about this matter.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Cloned Installed on my New PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulv&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Cloned Installed on my New PC</h2>
                    <p><span>I had a HP Slimline Pavilian PC with Windows 7 that I switched over to Windows
 10 two (2) weeks ago. I liked the new Windows 10. However, I recently noticed this past weekend, that the EaseUS Backup Software that I had on Windows 7 apparently stopped working when the Windows 10 Software was installed. I have three external hard-drives
 (EHDs), one EHD for System Backup; one EHD for photos backup and the third EHD for documentation backup. Both the photos and the documentation successfully backed up. However, the System didn't successfully backup and I switched the backup from one of the
 EHDs that was designated for System Backups to the C-Drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since I knew it was going to take some time, I took a nap and when I awoke,
 I learned that the PC had crashed. So, I went to a Computer Store in Ozamiz City, Mindanao, Philippines and purchased a new 1TB Hard-drive with associated hardware which included what I believed to be Windows 10. However, I just learned from my daughter-in-law
 who accompanied yesterday, that what was installed, is a Clone Version of Windows 10 (which coincidentally doesn't look like what I just saw on a MSN Site) which supposedly will never upgrade.&nbsp; If I had known that a Clone Version had been installed, I would
 have paid for an Original Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, what I need to know is, can I delete the Clone Version of Windows 10
 (which doesn't upgrade) and upgrade a new Windows 10 (like I had been using on my former PC) with the former Key Number that I had when using Windows 7 / 10 prior to the crash?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your responses.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Paul.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes you can always reinstall Windows and it isn't necessary to again do the inferior Upgrade install, but you can do the vastly superior, gold standard Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you upgraded then it assigned a permanent Digital License which is keyless so you'd skip the key during install and it will activate after connecting to the internet when it phones home to MS Activation servers and finds your hardware signature owns the permanent Digital License.  
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; Ok, I will certainly give this a try as I am 69 (soon to be 70 in two months) and didn't realize that the store here in the Philippines had installed a "Clone Version" of Windows 10.&nbsp; The first time I powered up my PC, I thought
 if this is the new Windows 10 from May 2019 why does it look like what I used for Windows 7, as the startup is identical to what I was used to using with Windows 7 and NOT at all like what I had been using with Windows 10 for the past two weeks.&nbsp; Only after
 I consulted with my daughter-in-law (who travels everywhere with my wife and I, as that is how young Filipina Ladies are taught to take care of their elderly parents and elderly Mother and Father in-laws) this morning to see how I could get the Product Key,
 did she inform me that the computer store where I have visited multiple times in the past, had installed a Clone Version instead of the real Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since this is a Clone Version of Windows 10, "if" the download works, will it overwrite what was installed and then I can go back in and remove the Clone Version of Windows 10 much like I did when I downloaded my Windows 10 on my former PC and then
 came back in and deleted&nbsp; /&nbsp; removed Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your reply before I proceed.</p>

            Yes, Paul, just follow the steps in the tutorial closely - including deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space, then click Next to let the installer auto-create and -format the needed partitions and begin - and it will all be overwritten with a fresh copy of WIndows that will activate with your Digital License assigned when you upgraded.

<br />Don't worry as I'll be here to help as much as you need.

<p>Greg:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last question (as I just thought about this after I sent my previous message to you), I have uploaded all the former programs that I used in the past on my PC and have icons on the desktop for what is uploaded to better assist me.&nbsp; When the "Windows
 10 Clone" is removed, when I sign-in back into my PC, the Microsoft Start Window will most likely be removed.&nbsp; How will I be able to upload Windows 10 or, will the whole transformation take place without my having to worry about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for this additional question BUT, when you are old, you want to ensure that everything will operate in a flawless manner like it did before any changes / upgrades take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>

            Paul, you'd want to keep the PC functional enough to create the bootable media and do all the backup and other preparations outlined in the Clean Install tutorial here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You can also if necessary create the bootable media on another PC, just make sure it's for the correct licensed version and 64 bit rate. 
<br />
<br />It's very important to follow the steps in the tutorial which also include tips about what works best in Windows 10.  Those who stick closely to the tools and methods in the tutorial rarely come back with further problems because they've learned what it takes to maintain a great install.

<p>Hello Greg!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just one PC here in the Philippines.&nbsp; What they did at this computer store in Ozamiz City South of our location, was gutted out the 9-year old 64-gigabyte hard-drive (that crashed) and replaced it with a new 1TB Hard-Drive.&nbsp; I have backed up almost
 all of my files on the three (3) separate external hard-drives that I previously mentioned and will then continue where I left off with your instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any further issues occur, I will contact you.&nbsp; However, I am thinking that this might not be necessary, as your tutorial and responses have been well-written (especially for an old guy like me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you ahead of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With what you provided to me earlier today (which I greatly appreciate) I am at a loss as to what your instructions are, when speaking of, and I quote:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:</span><a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered. On second screen choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen
 delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.&nbsp;"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please remember that you are dealing with a 69 (soon to be 70) year old man).&nbsp; I thought that once I backed upped everything (which is still backing up the data on my three (3) External Hard-Drive that hold Photos,
 Documentation and Software) at this time, as the internet is poor here in the Philippines with frequent brownouts at times), I could just remove the Windows 10 Clone Version and install a Real Windows 10 Program.&nbsp; So, maybe it might be in my best interest
 to just disconnect the NEW PC that I purchased this past Tuesday, drive the 40-minute drive to Ozamiz City, Mindanao and have InnerSpace remove the Windows Cloned 10 Program that was installed by a repair technician at Innerspace and purchase a NEW WINDOWS
 10 Program to have installed on my NEW PC which has nothing physically stored on the hard-drive other than the programs that I lost when my PC crashed this past Monday afternoon and, what I re-uploaded in the past 24-hours.&nbsp; Otherwise, if you have any other
 suggestions, feel free to contact me.</span></p>

            Paul -
<br />
<br />Those instructions are excerpted from the Clean Install tutorial which illustrates them more fully here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Those steps pertain to booting the media.   If you have the new UEFI BIOS then the media needs to be booted as a UEFI device.  If you don't see the UEFI choice on the BIOS Boot Menu then you likely have the older BIOS, so just choose that.  
<br />
<br />I was explaining that to boot media, you need to use the BIOS Boot Menu key which is given in the link I provide for that step.  So for HP you'd power on while pressing or tapping the ESC or F9 key to trigger the one-time Boot Menu, choose the media as a UEFI device if offered, or as a plain flash stick or DVD if thats all that's offered, then it should load files and let you continue with the steps in the tutorial to choose your licensed version, then Custom install, then delete all partitions off the drive one by one until it is all Unallocated Space, then choose that Unallocated Space and click Next to let it auto-create and format the needed partitions and begin.  
<br />
<br />Be sure to follow the steps in the tutorial and ask back any other questions as I will be here to help you.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I will just have to take the PC back downtown this morning (in a couple of hours) and have the repair technician uninstall the Cloned Version of Windows 10 and then re-upload Windows 10, as what you are asked (as mentioned to you last night) is
 way, way over my head.&nbsp; As mentioned, I am 69 and I only use my PC to communicate (I am the Administrator of a FaceBook Site that provides information to veterans) and thus, I don't have the time to do all that you are suggesting.&nbsp; Additionally, my ESC and
 "soft keys" (F-2 thru F-12) have never worked since I had my PC upgraded last year.&nbsp; Thus, the F9 Key won't work as you suggested.&nbsp; To me, what appeared to be an easy question to see if I could just delete the Cloned Version of Windows 10 and download the
 most recent May 2019 Windows 10 Program ISN'T so easy after all and, will then have everything repaired to my liking today in downtown Ozamiz City.</p>
<p>

            Good luck.  There is a known issue where repair shops will activate using an illegal Volume LIcense key even if the PC has an embedded Product Key or Digital LIcense for Windows 10.  We see countless cases where shops reinstall Pro version and activate with an illegal key when if they'd installed Home and let it activate itself from key embedded at factory, or let it go online to activate with the Digital LIcense everyone got when they upgraded, it would have legally activated. 
<br />
<br />So I'd make it very clear to them that you want your licensed version reinstalled and activated with the Product Key embedded at Factory, nothing else.  Shops which use activation ploys are engaging in felony piracy which Microsoft will investigate if reported.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  I see you gave me a bad rating even after all I tried to help you.  But even though this hurts my ratings, I will still be here to help you out of they get you into another mess.

            Hi Cheryl, if as you indicate that Windows Pro was a retail licence purchased separately to the laptop, then it does have transfer rights to your new PC
<br />
<br />The best way to activate that on the new PC is to have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you activate your Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

<br />did you bought a full version (license) of Windows 10 Pro or just upgrade from preinstalled Home version?
