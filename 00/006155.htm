<h2>            How to set which Mail client is used when sharing documents by email with Microsoft Office Products &#40;Excel, Word, etc&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to share an excel document from withing Microsoft Excel, using File &gt; Share &gt; Email &gt; Send as Attachment.</p>
<p>I have 2 mail clients, Outlook and Mailbird installed, and strangely enough, Excel chooses Mailbird, even though my setting for default Email App in Windows 10 is Microsoft Outlook. Do you know how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook is set as my default app and I have gone to control panel &gt; internet options to try to change the program but it brings up the same Windows 10 screen to set programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this thread "<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10-mso_2013_release/how-to-set-which-mail-client-is-used-when-sharing/e4ad3e95-0b65-4012-b9a1-fe5216cf3996"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How
 to set which Mail client is used when sharing documents by email with Microsoft Word?</span></a>" is similar with the situation you encountered. Seems you have also tried the suggestions in this thread but it does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I would suggest you check if the option "Make Outlook the default program for E-mail, Contacts, and Calendar" is enabled within Outlook &gt;File tab &gt;Options &gt;General. In the meantime, you could
 also check if the similar option is disabled in Mailbird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any concerns, please post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got Office 2016 installed on my Mac with macOS Sierra. I'm using multiple office 365 mailboxes and I'm getting a lot of errors on a daily base. If I remove the errors, they just come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look in the folder 'synchronization problems' it's empty. Also the error does not describe which item can't be synchronized. More error details:</p>

            <p>Here's a possible solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had a user who had this problem (same error code) and another user who had a similar problem (slightly different error code, likely because it was a calendar sync issue). Here's what seemed to work for us:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user experiencing this same error code had several thousand emails sitting in the Deleted Items folder. It seemed that some of these emails were the source of the problem. We deleted the emails. We also displayed the Properties for the Deleted Items
 folder in Mac Outlook, and clicked the "Empty Cache" button. Those two actions seemed to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps somebody who's having this problem.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>now the excel keeps reopening again &amp; again post completion of the timeout period. Any ideas why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Was not doing so in my test but I am assuming there is a conflict with when each section of code runs and that the status bar update timer is possibly already set before the Boolean variable to suppress the setting. I don't really know for sure so am only
 making an assumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have done some more work on it and made a few changes that I think are for the better.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The test for the Boolean variable to suppress resetting the timers&nbsp;is moved to the start of each sub that actually does the OnTime resets.</li><li>Re-named some variables in an attempt to make the code a little easier to follow.</li><li>Added Constants at the top of the standard module for the ShutDown&nbsp;Interval and the Status Bar update interval. This is more professional because to change it is done at one place for the entire project.</li><li>Added an optional Wait command in the ShutDown sub. This is an attempt to ensure that the OnTime actually times out before the StopClocks code is called. If it times out then it should not get reset due to the Boolean variable to suppress re-setting the
 OnTime. If you continue to have a problem with the workbook re-opening then uncomment the Wait line and see if it fixes the problem. You will see the wait is for the same time as the Status Bar update Interval.</li><li>Instead of re-posting the code here, I have edited the code in my previous post because I think it becomes less confusing for other community members at a later date if they wish to try the code.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>See if the code works and if still having problems then think about uploading a copy of your workbook to OneDrive and I will have a look at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive. (If you already use OneDrive and your process for saving to it is different then you can probably start at step 8 to get the link but please zip the file before uploading.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save an unzipped workbook to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder). By holding the Ctrl key and left click once on each file, you can select multiple workbooks before right clicking over one of the selections
 to send to a compressed file and they will all be included into the one Zip file.
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Select "Get a Link" from the popup menu.</li><li>Click Copy the link and Paste into your reply on this forum.</li></ol>

    <title>Office 2007 and SharePoint 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelernst0830  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2007 and SharePoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>We have several users who get an error when they try to access a OneNote 2013 Notebook on SharePoint 2013 when they have Office 2007 installed. My assumption was that the OneNote Web App from 2013 would not work in Office 2007, since Office 2007 wil not
 Open files from newer versions of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just recently updated everyone to Lync 2013 which successfully updated the SharePoint OpenDocument Class in IE to version 15.0. However, now most users have an owssupp.dll in both Office 12 folder and in Office 15 folder. I have tried to do an Add/Remove
 in Office 2007 (it is the Professional Version), but when I remove it and run the updtae, it comes right back. So I believe it must be required by one of the Office 2007 executables. Does anyone know which one? I belive if I can get the old version removed
 and unregistered it may fix the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Sorry I can't help with your main problem, but I have to ask about the second part of the statement above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you try to open a 2013 file in the 2007 application?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean 2007 won't open 2013 files? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically what application files are you having problems with?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>That is not true for most of the Office applications. Office 2007 apps should open most 2013 files. The one issue is that if you use "new" features (ones added since 2007) in the file, when you open them in 2007 these features will will be "handled", either
 by completely/permanently stripping them out (ie the Word 2010 "Text Effects" feature is stripped when you open in 2007) or degraded (ie some animations are turned into static effects).</p>

            <p>So when we try to open a OneNote notebook, we get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cec23afd-f61d-4740-83d0-fea9673b3e6a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously not a very helpful message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my research, what I have found is that supposedly when Word, Excel or PowerPoint files are opened from SharePoint, by deafult they try to open in read only mode. However, OneNote notebooks by fault try to open in edit mode. So I am guessing that
 means it wants to try to open MS Office first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Office 2007 wil not open newer Office files - in fact there is a free compatibility viewer to allow you to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since an OpenNote notebook is trying to open in edit mode, my theory is that it goes to the Office folder (in our case Office 12 for Office 2007) to look for the owssupp.dll. The one there is the wrong version. So I need to get rid of it, or replace it with
 the Version 15 file. I cannot figure out how to do either.</p>

</p><p>Based on my research, what I have found is that supposedly when Word, Excel or PowerPoint files are opened from SharePoint, by deafult they try to open in read only mode. However, OneNote notebooks by fault try to open in edit mode. So I am guessing that
 means it wants to try to open MS Office first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Office 2007 wil not open newer Office files - in fact there is a free compatibility viewer to allow you to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since an OpenNote notebook is trying to open in edit mode, my theory is that it goes to the Office folder (in our case Office 12 for Office 2007) to look for the owssupp.dll. The one there is the wrong version. So I need to get rid of it, or replace it with
 the Version 15 file. I cannot figure out how to do either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes that is another fine example of the "new &amp; improved" "user friendly" error messages.&nbsp; All apologetic, but totally useless for trouble shooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I also can't help with the sharepoint part of your problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2007 will definitely open most newer Office files.&nbsp; By "compatibility viewer" do you mean the "Office 2007 Compatibility Pack". That is not a viewer, that is an addon created in 2007 that needs to be installed to allow
<strong>OFFICE 2003</strong> (and earlier) to open the (then) new "x-file" formats for Word, Excel and PowerPoint.&nbsp; I don't know specifically about OneNote</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you think you need to change the OWSSUPP.DLL file?&nbsp; Making that sort of change without explicit reasons is a BAD IDEA.&nbsp;

            <p>The OWSSUPP.DLL is installed as part of the “Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Support” category under Office Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue you should <strong>disable Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Support in any other version of Office installed on the machine and then repair Office</strong>.</p>
<p>e.g. if on a computer with Office 2010 and Lync 2013 you installed “Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Support” for both versions (Lync 2013 is part of the Office 2013 suite), you should disable “Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Support” for Lync 2013 and then
 repair Office 2010 so that the OWSSUPP.DLL gets registered.</p>

<p>A genuine E71 cover should come with the USB/MicroSD covers attached to the cover.</p>
<p>Did the Nokia Center fit the cover or did they sell you the part to fit yourself??</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click on a blank spot in the Notification Area of the Taskbar and then <em>

            <p>Goodbye and have fun overthere at Android.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you could have known that Google play (store) will never be able to work on a windows phone.</p>
<p>You should be glad actually, The windows Eco system is not as opensourced as the Google variant Android.</p>
<p>In the playstore there's actually a lot of **** to find. Many fake apps and a lot of other stuff that's not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>And how about the exploits discovered on android etc etc etc.</p>
<p>Windows may be a small eco system but actually a lot safer to use. </p>

            Hmmm. Well why can I use it on my Windows PC then?&nbsp; Just asking. I have just found that there are so many apps out there that are so cool and easy to use, and it's not available on my phone only because I don't have google play.&nbsp; Everyone around me is
 saying, "look at this cool app" and I think it's cool too, only to find I can't install it because I don't have and cannot install google play.&nbsp; I don't have google play, therefore I can't play.&nbsp; And, they don't seem to be having problems.&nbsp; Not sure what the
 big deal is about why Windows can't have google play.&nbsp; I'm not technical at all.&nbsp; Just a user looking for a user friendly phone.

<h2>            Nokia 8600&#47;Luna - Turning off, blank screen, limited functionality</h2>
                    Hi there everyone.<br />
I have had my phone just over a year now (since July 17th 2007).<br />
Just recently, my phone has been playing up.<br />
When the phone is turned on, it seems to find the network signal however none of the menu buttons work, similarly, on the network provider display is shown on the screen nothing else (no menu display, operator display etc).<br />
If I dial a number, this works. Also, I can receive calls. However, the phone soon just reboots itself after a very short period. It tends to be going on and off at intermittent periods (I was charging the phone and watching it, and it would turn on, go off,
 turn on, go off)<br />
Occasionally, the menu's 'will' appear, however when I go to say Create Message it comes up with a message "Message storage not available", then freezes, and reboots itself.<br />
Also, when the menu appears I can scroll down the Contacts list, but eventually it will just freeze then reboot.<br />
This started happening close to a week ago.<br />
I have looked after the phone meticulously, and as far I am aware have not dropped it, or had any water contact.<br />
The only other information I have is that it happened shortly after my battery went flat for the first time last week. When the battery went flat, I tried turning it on and tried to send a Message then it went off. I plugged it in to charge, went to write a
 message and that was the first time it froze, then kept on doing the systems I mentioned above (turn on, no menu display, reboot etc).<br />
Anyone have any ideas?<br />
I purchased the phone in the UK just over a year ago (Jul 17 2007) but am back home in Australia now. I have dropped it at the local care center, but am a bit wary as the phone is still not available here in Australia. Also, am a bit concerned considering the
 European Warranty is 24months, however, phones here in Australia are covered for 12 months.<br />
For a phone to function the way it is, it's something I believe that Nokia should take full ownership for to fixing it.<br />
All thought, ideas and feedback would be great.<br />

            hi,<br />
<br />
sorry to hear that... indead the 8600 Luna is covered by 24 month premium care in EU, but the 8800 is also i believed covered by premium care in australia, so perhaps the luna should also be covered by 24-month premium care, but then it is all up to Nokia Australia...
 hope for the best, and do keep us informed...

            Hi there mate. Since my last post I have had a complete run around here at the Melbourne repair center. At first there was international warranty issues to which they would not have a look at the phone until a response was received from Nokia central.<br />
After a week, they have said that they do not have the appropriate hardware (JIG/GIG) for this model as it is not available in Australia. Furthermore, they are not sure if any other JIG is compatible.<br />
I have "then" spoken to the central Australian Nokia service center who have advised that maybe I can do the software update via USB myself, and, if that does not work then send it back to where I purchased it.<br />
This my friends, is the worldwide service that a global organisation such as Nokia provides!<br />
If this was a throwaway handset, no worries. When I purchased it, it was almost a high end model. Now, I am stuck with a phone that does not work, and **bleep** know what the turnaround will be.<br />
Surely someone, somewhere can escalate this.<br />
Mate, if you have any ideas please let know....its a complete mick.<br />
Cheers<br />

            My handset does it too.. I had a 8800 which started doing this before I sold it and now my Luna has started doing it too.. I have spoken to a couple of people that have also had this issue with other Nokia handsets and it is a problem they are well aware
 of. I spoke to a consultant at a phone shop that said that the only thing that they can do is upgrade the software on the phone and that is the only "fix" at the moment and the problem just re-occurs anyway...<br />
<br />
I have always bought Nokia handsets but I am fed up to the back teeth with this error now and think this may well be the last Nokia handset I purchase.

            I've got a Nokia 8800 Arte. Bought it in Thailand from a Nokia shop and used it for about 6 months until while on holiday in the UK it broke. I had plugged it in to charge one evening and when I pulled out the charger the 'guts' of the phone came out with
 it.<br />
<br />
Phone worked fine but the battery couldn't be charged so I quickly saved my phone numbers to my SIM card and used the phone sparingly to save battery until I got home.<br />
<br />
I live in Hong Kong so took the phone to be fixed there under warranty. That's when I learned that Nokia doesn't have any form of international warranty and Hong Kong would charge me to fix the phone. I complained about this and a customer service person called
 me to say that there's nothing they could do and I had to send it back to Thailand.<br />
<br />
Ok, a bit of a ridiculous situation as I'm a business traveler and obviously can't always be in the country of purchase but I suppose it's my fault for not asking about the warranty to begin with.<br />
<br />
So I sent it to Thailand (getting hit with courier charges and import duty) only for Nokia Thailand to say that the phone can't be repaired under warranty as the circuit board is cracked. How on Earth it could be cracked without me having dropped the phone
 is beyond me- the surface of the phone is perfect, without any scratches as I always kept it in a case. And if this was the case, why would Hong Kong (after having seen the phone) tell me to send it to Thailand? Seems a case of passing the buck back and forth.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I have a trip to Thailand coming up so I'll discuss with Nokia there face-to-face and see what 'crack' they are talking about.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the situation, the phone broke without any misuse and I feel like I've been given a total runaround by Nokia. If it was one of the entry-level phones I wouldn't be so concerned but this was a US$1000 purchase that I can't simply throw away.<br />
<br />
I've been a long-standing customer of Nokia but can honestly say that this will be my, my family, and my business's last Nokia phone if this situation isn't resolved promptly.

            I really feel for you, and am 100 per cent with you on the notion that Nokia is failing to satisfy on customer satisfaction.<br />
After my dismal story above, after much waiting I was told by the Australian Nokia center that I must send it back to the UK to get fixed. Why? Because the Australian mob here dont have the mount for the 8600 that they put the phone in to do a software reboot.
 They would not even attempt it with a similar mount. Basically, I took it to a local mobile phone run by a chinese friend of mine, and he basically did a reload of the software and its working fine (for now).<br />
Go figure.<br />
I have worked with many clients before in my profession, and one thing I do know is that there is always a point of escalation and someone that can 'get things done'.<br />
Nokia was absolutely rubbish here in Australia, as was the phone customer service. Under no circumstance did they look or sound like they were going to think outside of the box, and hunt for a way to fix it. Seems my chinese friend did it with no trouble, even
 if it cost me $45 which is probably still cheaper than the **bleep** I would have to go through for couriering it to the UK, with insurance, and the inconvenience of not having a phone for probably a month.<br />
Nokia, wake up!!!<br />
Check out the feedback you are getting on this thread alone. The 8800 Arte fellow (which is a high end phone) and mine (which is a medium end phone).<br />
I have only ever used Nokia, but with **bleep** customer service like this I cant see why i should bother. I am going every day now just wondering when the symptoms are going to occur again on my phone.<br />
Wake up Nokia.

            Thanks for your reply, Sarj. You got the same advice as I did- send to the country where you bought it. Of course as you can see by my experience that's no guarantee that'll actually help.<br />
<br />
Amazing that a local shop could reload your software when the local center claimed they didn't have the right equipment to do it.<br />
<br />
As for me, I'll see what I can do when I fly to Thailand next week. Given the responses so far and the limited capability of the local service centers (beyond saying 'no') I doubt I'll get any resolution.

            Thanks Aatif. Understand your notion, but I (and probably the others) have already tried that. I have used "Contact Us", and in turn just got asked to contact my local repairer, who in turn said they could not repair it and to send the phone back to the
 UK, I then did "Contact Us" again who in turn just said I have to send the phone back to the UK to any of the care points and it was my responsibility to call the care point and to ensure they in turn could fix it. Happy to paste the thread of correspondence
 but its quite long. What annoyed me with the customer service is that they sent me a list of premium call phone numbers in the UK. When I tried calling any of them from a calling card here in Australia a $10 card lasts around 10 seconds. I asked Nokia Central
 (contact us) to provide me with a "single" point of call to whom I could correspond with should I have to send my phone to the UK. They would not do that, and again said it was my responsibility to do the calling around.<br />
Like I said. I understand your notion, but really the system is not providing. Would be interested to hear your feedback on this matter.<br />

<br />
<br />
what i can advise is that you keep trying though alot of your money will be wasted but sincerely there is nothing we can do here under hardware discussions..<br />
<br />
<br />
Nokia is a big company and PR should be its core objective but seems like they've dragged behind..<br />

 in a separate cell to sum all the cells using the COUNTIF formula. I noticed that the SUM amount was off, so I did some investigating, which is where I noticed the odd behavior. If I highlighted/selected the cells by clicking the TOP cell first and dragging
 down, the status bar would show the incorrect sum, but if I first selected the BOTTOM cell and drug my mouse up, the sum would be correct.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To help explain, here is an example of what a cell will contain:</div>
<div>=COUNTIF(FV3:FV294,"PM")+COUNTIF(FV3:FV294,"PS")</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All cells in question only have various numbers of COUNTIF formulas with the only variables changing being the PM or PS values.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And here is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sRgCSyh.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
screenshot</a> of the rows I am summing. Notice that the status bar shows a sum of 12 when it should be 43.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is another <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zFlURV1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
screenshot</a>, and the only difference is that I selected the bottom cell first (value 0) and drug my mouse to the top cell (value 27) and yet the status bar shows the correct sum amount.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: I was told it would be helpful if I offered an example. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25593924/SUMExample.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here is a link</a> to an example that shows the same behavior. Take a look down at row 300.</div>

<br />
The problem is that A305 is formatted as Custom d.&nbsp; In that context, d is day of month.&nbsp; Since the value is 43, the "date" is Feb 12, 1900.&nbsp; So the "day of month" is 12.<br />
<br />
Change the format to General, and you will see 43.<br />
<br />
BTW, A296, A297 and A300 are also formatted as Custom d.&nbsp; The fact that their displayed values look okay is coincidence (less than 32).<br />

    <title>Word attachments in Outlook won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word attachments in Outlook won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I have a user using Windows 7 Enterprise and Microsoft Office 2010. There is one person outside of our organization that emails .docx attachments to her. When she attempts to open the document she receives an error message that the document is corrupt and
 cannot be opened. The sender has saved the same documents to .doc format. The same thing happens. My user forwarded the email that she received to me. I can open the attachments with no errors. The user forwarded the documents to herself and she can open the
 attachments with no errors. The user has tried saving the "corrupt" files to her local hard drive and then tried opening the file from her local hard drive and she receives the "document is corrupt" error. She has tried opening the document in Word using the
 "Open and Repair" option. The document will not open. I have verified that her Word Trust Center Settings are the same as mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This user also experiences this same issue when downloading Word documents from one of our Vendor's support website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen on other workstations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what could be causing this issue and how to fix it?</p>

            Word sometimes has problems opening files that are still attached to emails. Please ask the user to download the attachment to their desktop and try opening it from there. If there's still a problem, ask them to try both double-clicking on the file and
 opening it using <strong>File&gt;Open</strong> in Word, it can make a difference.

<h2>            Account Notice</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping someone can help me with getting an "Account Notice" to go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am subscribed with "Office 365 Business Premium". Every time that I open any Office App I get an Account Notice. It reads;</p>
<p>"We've run into a problem with your Office 365 subscription, and we need your help to fix it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled everything, logged into my 365 account and reinstalled everything numerous times. The notice keeps coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted that in my account it is not recognizing the install. Which is confusing given that I log in, install, am advised the install is complete and yet the account still does not show the registered install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really getting old, painful and has been way to time consuming. Is there an easy fix to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>O365 Groups&#58; In SharePoint I Accidentally changed the experience - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher florian  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365 Groups&#58; In SharePoint I Accidentally changed the experience to Classic and now all navigation is gone and can&#39;t get it back.</h2>
                    <p>Previously, before Groups had a full SP Site and was forced to use the crippled documents-only site, if you went into Library settings and changed to library to "Classic Experience" it broke the site's main page and you lost all Group navigation in the Quick
 Launch area.&nbsp; You could fix this by going back into Library settings and changing it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>But now I have&nbsp;a bigger problem.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so excited about Groups having a full SharePoint site&nbsp; I went in to paly with it.&nbsp; Clicking on the new Site Contents link in the SharePoint site's quick launch I got the list of the site's contents. YEAH! (Used to just dump you back on the site home
 page).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa5b43a6-76fb-4091-bbfd-a096a2fa2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa5b43a6-76fb-4091-bbfd-a096a2fa2457" /></a>But
 I don't like the <em>new experience </em>and without thinking I clicked the "Use Classic Experience" link at the bottom of the quick launch.&nbsp;
<strong><em>Oh S***!&nbsp;</em></strong> The navigation disappeared.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But not only for a single list.&nbsp; <br />
And not even for the SITE I was on... <br />
Nope, it's now gone on every new site I create, and every existing&nbsp;site I have! Group&nbsp;sites, other site collections and sites.&nbsp; Even if I say&nbsp;I want a library to display using the new experience, it doesn't do it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the Admin center, SharePoint Settings it is set to New Experience. But I don't get any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, HELP!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am loving the depth of the information that I am gathering using my MS Band 2 &amp; the Microsoft Health website. Unfortunately I cannot seem to find any way to print out a nice daily/weekly/monthly report of my activities. Are there any options for printing

            Enter Time Machine<br />
Select an Identity prior to date you lost data. You need to restore an entire Outlook Identity (named Main by default). Your Identity is located here:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/your identity <br />
<br />
Select to save your Identity to the Desktop. <br />
Rename "Restored Main Identity" <br />
Drag to the Office 2011 Identities folder. <br />
Hold down Option key when launching Outlook and select "Restored Main Identity" as default.
<br />
Outlook opens in the restored Identity. <br />
<br />
Once you are satisfied that you have all the data you want out of Main Identity, you can delete that Identity and rename "restored Identity" to Main Identity or any other name you want.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am new here. I have a 128GB microSD card inserted to nokia lumia 735. I found the specification on https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/phone/lumia735/specifications/ (if that helps). I have 50GB's of music mainly chillout etc. I have
 recently updated my phone to windows mobile 10. When I try to play any music it plays only one song but nothing and I keep getting a error code 0x00d36c4. I have formatted the card both on the phone then on the computer (windows 10) plugged in to micro sd
 card slot. I am not if the card is corrupted or not </p>
<p>
</p><p>any advice is welcome</p>

The music file format used is mp3 (music). The container (not sure what it is) is groove music. I am sure about the profile. As it is only music on the card there Various Artists inluding a
<span>Norwegian band called cashmere cat. I hope this this helps but like I said originally it is music on the card.</span><br />

            <p>Let's eliminate all the checks before everything points to "user error"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have formatted the SD card and run a scan / fix error whilst the card is in card reader and songs all play WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious as to why only one track plays and the others return 0x00d36c4, this would indicate these file were recently changed, (the part answer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are aware 'various artist' keeps albums together</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-music/errors/error-code-0xc00d36c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
X box</a>&nbsp;rather than a link on repair etc it was this reading this that may provide the answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all the above checks show the SD AOK.</p>
<p>"<strong>0xc00d36c4&nbsp;<br />
This item's file format may be unsupported, the file extension may be incorrect, or the file may be corrupted"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the MP3 file on SD card &nbsp;but the W10 update has corrupted the register (if you alter the name of a song after creating a WMP playlist the song can't be found)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The song names presumably have not been changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct this and update the register remove the memory card from the phone and soft reset the phone, (there is no loss of data)</p>
<p><strong>press and hold both volume down and power button until the phor powers off release&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to music song and search for all conditions All music / On my phone/ SD card/ Streaming</p>
<p>
</p><p>This creates a register for zero music on phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch off phone add memory card</p>
<p>(As you have 50Gb this new register could take some time, essentially you overwrite the corrupted register and the error will disappear&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check Storage Sense &nbsp;it doesn't like music to be already on the memory card (unless you have already done it that way and music is recorded in music,) if not done as in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/11689/windows-phone-sync-your-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a></strong>&nbsp; the 50Gb may be filed in others</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid this the memory card needs to be blank and you would add the 50Gb from PC</p>

<h3> dresdenron  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 11 High CPU usage in WIN7 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I have seen similar&nbsp;posts before but no clear answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP laptop with WIN7 Home Premium 64 bit and 6GB Ram. I routinely get high fan noise and 100% CPU usage at times. It usually involves IE 11 running and just opening a web page such as weather.com.&nbsp; When I look in Task manager it shows explorer as
 the process using all the CPU. One time it showed 7 instances of iexplorer running under processes. Another time it still showed high CPU usage of iexplorer even after I had closed out of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I have a desktop system running the same OS and
 IE doesn't cause this problem on it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have always had Norton Internet Security running on the laptop with current updates and it doesn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any current ideas on what is causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Unable to sync 6230i - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fuzzymad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to sync 6230i</h2>
                    I have been trying to sync up a phone with a specific contacts folder in Outlook 2003, but am unable to do this. The moment I click synchronise, I get the below error message in the sync log:<br />
<br />
"Please ensure your phone is in the standby mode, then restart the synchronisation"<br />
<br />
I have done this literally hundreds of times before to hundreds of seperate phones, and everything appears to be as as normal up until it doesn't sync.<br />
<br />
I am trying to sync with the official Nokia lead (Which has worked perefectly in the past).<br />
<br />
I am using Windows Vista Business, and the latest version of PC Suite (6.83.14.1). (Both of which appeared to be working fine yesterday when I last used them to sync up a Nokia N93 and N95)<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling PC Suite and reinstalling it, re-downloading it and installing it again. I have even tried additional 6230i's and get the same message.<br />
<br />
Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I've got exactly the same problem. PC Suite (German Version) delivers an error message while trying to synchronise with Microsoft Outlook. Synchronisation does not work.<br />
<br />
"PC Sync-Informationen.<br />
Das Mobiltelefon hat nicht reagiert.<br />
Stellen Sie sicher, dass sich Ihr Telefon im Bereitschaftsmodus befindet, bevor Sie die Synchronisierung erneut starten."<br />
<br />
In English: "Please ensure your phone is in the standby mode, then restart the synchronisation"<br />
<br />
Configuration:<br />
Nokia 6230i<br />
USB Cable connection established<br />
Nokia PC Suite 6.84.10.3 (German)<br />
Windows XP SP2<br />
Outlook 2002 SP3<br />
<br />
Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

            I tried this but it didn't work.<br />
<br />
I've got the same error message like before.<br />
<br />
Is this a problem of the firmware version ? The mobile phone I tried to synchronize has the firmware version 3.88 (July 2006).<br />
<br />
I tried the same with a Nokia 6230i with an older firmware version from 2005 and this works.<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Exactly same problem here. Can't synchronise my old 6230i with standard contact folder in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Using Windows XP SP2<br />
Latest version of the Nokia PC Suite downloaded from the web<br />
<br />
Like the others, I have tried "everything" from simple reboot and on/off for the phone, to reinstalling an older version of the PC Suite, to resetting factory settings on the phone. Always get the same error message that the phone hasn't reacted (even though
 PC Suite indicates that the phone is connected).<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated.

            guys<br />
you should make your cell phone going to standby mode<br />
for that you should be in main screen of cell phone where you can see your wallpaper<br />
now your cell phone is ready to be synchronised<br />
Good Luck all

            Exactly the same issue here.<br />
Nokia 6230 (not 6230i), Vista SP1, PC Suite 6.86.9, PC Suite itself works fine, but when I try to synch my phone says either "Computer Disconnected" or "Bluetooth Connection Failed", and PC Sync says "The mobile phone has not responded."<br />
<br />
Of course I tried all of the suggested above solutions.

            SOLUTION AT LAST!! (as dumb as it may be)<br />
<br />
Hey everyone!<br />
It's been hours of forum searching and reading million of suggestions how to make my 6230 sync with the *several* latest versions of Nokia PC Suite (HELLO! NOKIA ARCHITECHTS! You have some serious recurring problem here! Don't abandon the veterans in your client
 base, it reflects really bad on you service-wise! At least post an official message that you acknowledge the problem and that you're working on it!)<br />
<br />
Seems that tons of people encountered my exact problem:<br />
Connection works, pairing works, file copying works, synchronisation doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Well, the forums mentioned that the older older versions of PC Suite had a very quick timeout problem, so one had to synchronise twice, fast, in order for sync to succeed.<br />
<br />
Now, it seemed like the timeout was reduced to almost "0", and disconnection immediately followed connection.<br />
<br />
So, even though I did not see any second confirmation message (normally the phone shows a request to "connect" and then a second request to "transfer data") - I thought maybe it was there only disappearing very fast. So I decided to simply click twice fast,
 and I mean REALLY FAST, on the main button to accept, hoping that the connection will be kept. And VOILA! The connection was kept, and the sync was successful.<br />
<br />
I know it's not a permanent solution, but for me, for now, considering how hard (why is it hard, Nokia??) and annoying it is to revert to a much older version of PC Suite - it's at least a temporary solution that works. And the only one I've found so far.<br />
<br />
================================<br />
Specifications:<br />
Phone: Nokia 6230<br />
Firmware: 04.44, 21-09-04<br />
<br />
PC Suite: 6.86.9.0<br />
MS Windows: XP SP2<br />
MS Outlook: 2003 SP3<br />
================================<br />
<br />
I wonder if that would work for everyone.<br />
If so please spread the word, seems that lots of people would like to know that. At least until a decent fix will be released for the PC Suite, that is.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Ohad

            I had the same problem&nbsp;- try first starting PCS and then connecting your phone. Worked for me. If I do it vice versa I keep on getting the error you mentioned.

            <p>If you have an "English" version of Word 2011, the English US proofing tools are installed if the application is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see a complete list of the proofing languages available, read the Word help topic "Proofing tools that are available for each language".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only way you could see that error message is if either your Office installation is one that does not contain any form of English (in which case, the user interface would not be in English either) or something has removed one of the languages from
 the application bundle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are Rubbishware applications out there that promise to "reduce the size of the office installation" by "removing unnecessary files". &nbsp;Monolingual is one such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you run those, they can indeed delete one or more proofing languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in<strong>&nbsp;/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Office/Shared Applications/Proofing Tools</strong>, you should see five files with "English" as the start of their name. These are the source files for the Hyphenator, Speller, Thesaurus, Grammar
 and Word Forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are not there, copy them back from your Installation disk. &nbsp;If you do not have an installation disk, you will need to restore them from your backup. If you have Office 365, a remove and replace will put them back for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
