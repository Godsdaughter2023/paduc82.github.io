<h2>            How to resolve issues with BioShock 2 running in Windows XP 32-bit.</h2>
                    <p><strong>original title:&nbsp;</strong><b>XP 32-bit BioShock 2</b></p>
<p><strong>for those of you experiencing the infamous main menu/in game menu&nbsp;lag/hang issue (in game cut scene issues).</strong></p>
<p><strong>download and unrar (unzip) the patch for Silent Hill 5 (patch 11).<br />
there is a folder inside called 'Binaries'<br />
copy this entire folder as is to the BioShock 2\SP\Builds folder in your install directory and boom.<br />
<br />
run BioShock 2 and when it says you can't, run it anyway and ALL problems with the game in XP mode are SOLVED.</strong></p>

<h2>            Touchscreen Stopped Functioning - ACER Monitor w&#47; ASUS Desktop on Windows 8 Pro- HELP&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have read thru so many posts, but most of those who have been successful in finding a FIX for my situation are either other types of systems (laptops, all-in-ones, etc.) or for other models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus far I have tried every solution I could find posted that was generic enough for my current problems, which is that the touchscreen just stopped working one day.&nbsp; Occasionally it would go in and out before it quit.&nbsp; I noticed that I had my windows updates
 set for Automatic and Windows had moved me from the Win 8 Pro that came with my ASUS Desktop when I got it in Jan 2012 to Win 8.1.&nbsp; I assumed somewhere in the update things got lost.&nbsp; After a couple months of intermittently trying different solutions to fix
 it, I finally bit the bullet, backed up everything I had and did a Full System Reset, rebuilding from scratch.&nbsp; Sadly I lost some programs that were purchased and installed by my Ex who I was still with when I got the system since he had the product keys,
 but nothing I could not deal with replacing.&nbsp; After resetting and starting from scratch with the Windows 8 set-up disk, I turned off updates, installed my plug-n-play Acer touchscreen and NO LUCK.&nbsp; I had already spent a good deal of time and money to make
 sure I was using USB 3.0 active repeater and I ran the screen from HDMI.&nbsp; The monitor still works fine and honestly i don't care so much about the 'touch' part.&nbsp; What I really miss is that it has 3 USB ports on the side that run my wireless keyboard, mouse
 and webcam.&nbsp; I have a medical issue that is aggravated by sound and vibration which is why I stayed away from all-in-ones and laptops.&nbsp; I do tend to run my system heavy with a lot of work in Photo and Video Editing, so even on 'silent' fan operation, the sound
 of it is too much for me to be around for more than 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; I found the ACER monitor before I picked out my ASUS Desktop.&nbsp; It was an 'early' affordable touchscreen (at about $500).&nbsp; I purchased an extension arm costing nearly what the monitor had,
 that weights about 40 lbs and can extend away from the wall almost 4 feet.&nbsp; It is designed for doctors offices and hospital usage.&nbsp; For a year and a half I had no problems running my system with Dual Monitors, and I kept my Desktop in my 'office' on the floor
 below my work room with one monitor and ran the USB 3.0 Active Repeater to the Touch Screen monitor and the HDMI to the ACER Touchscreen which I kept mounted on the 'arm' in my workroom.</p>
<p>After my divorce I traveled a lot but my computer stayed in a place that required longer USB and HDMI cables to reach from the Desktop to the Monitor.&nbsp; I purchased them from Lindy (Lindytronics).&nbsp; Very high quality and had no problem for another year.&nbsp; That
 was when the bottom fell out and these problems began.&nbsp; At first I though it was the USB cable as it does have an AC adapter due to its length.&nbsp; I had feared that it had somehow gotten a power surge.&nbsp; However the monitor never stopped working, only the touchscreen
 and USB ports located on it. For a while I could only use my computer for 15 minutes at a time because I had to have the desktop and monitor together.&nbsp; I put up with it for a few months, then came up with the solution to move the computer back to its original
 location and just run the USD to near where the monitor was (without plugging the monitor in) and I used a HUB to plug my keyboard, mouse, etc into).&nbsp; This was a short term solution, but required constant line of sight for the periferrals and they would get
 sketchy on me.</p>
<p>I am finally in a new home and am determined, one way or the other, that I will find a way to FIX THIS ISSUE !!!!&nbsp; Although I have repeatedly watched both the Acer and Asus site for updated drivers and solutions, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the
 Acer website FINALLY offers an updated driver, BUT it is for Windows 10.&nbsp; Well **** !!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I would regret it (and I did) but I went ahead and paid for Windows 10 Home online and did the Digital Download/Install.&nbsp; Well I ended up with Black Screen Nightmare.&nbsp;
 Not completely the Black Screen of Death.&nbsp; At least when it stuck on the black screen, the Asus Logo for my desktop was front and center.&nbsp; After more research (using my trusty ipad) I got to Bios (or actually UEFI) with the power up/power down 3 times repeatedly
 then hitting Delete.&nbsp; Of course it took about 15 different occurrences of this and following 5 different blog/online help sites, that with the Windows 8 Pro disk in the computer, I finally managed to get it to STOP trying to install Windows 10 and revert to
 Windows 8, which it installed from the Disc.&nbsp; I have not yet applied for my refund for the $120 Windows 10, because that only happened a week ago and I have 30 days.&nbsp; I am hoping that I can get help in getting my touchscreen back before that, because I am
 not sure I have it in me to deal with the install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>I kindly request any and all help, but please refer to what I have done thus far so as to not take your time posting solutions that I know have not worked.&nbsp; Also, if you make any recommendations about working in the C: window or Bios(UEFI ) I will need DETAILED
 instructions as I am NOT familiar with using the back end AT ALL. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What I can tell you from my previous tries, is that I have already searched drivers, thru windows, using a service I paid for called "Driver Navigator" which did find a LOT of missing drivers from my system, thru Asus and thru Acer.&nbsp; The Acer driver does
 say it is supposed to work for Windows 8, but when you download the driver and unzip the files, there is no .exe file.&nbsp; The install extension is .hckx which does not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have read all about Acer and Windows and the whole issue with them submitting their
 products (or drivers) to Windows to be an 'approved part' of the Windows Driver Updates, blah blah blah.&nbsp; That is all good knowledge but basically just says I am screwed.&nbsp; I HAVE SEEN many people talk about USB BUS something being able to control the touchscreen
 but I don't know how to do that or find that out.&nbsp; I CAN SAY that in Device Manager in the HID section there WAS listed and HID-Touchscreen, but it has gone away and I have never been able to get it back,</p>
<p>I just dont understand why if I did a complete reset from all the components that I started with (which allowed it to work then) that it didnt just start working again.</p>
<p>To make you aware, while I am working on fixing this issue, I am running dual monitors (one touch one not) and dual mice (wired and not).&nbsp; Additionally all hardware is running off the factory provided cables.&nbsp; No extensions.&nbsp; Finally, in case it makes a
 difference my monitor is:</p>
<p>ACER T232HL-4</p>
<p>NVIDIA Hi-Def Audio (yes, audio still works)</p>
<p>on NVIDIA GeForce GT 620</p>
<p>In the Device Manager Event Log it shows:</p>
<p>"Driver Management concluded the process to install driver t232hl.inf_amd64_8faf33ed019417e0\t232hl.inf for Device Instance ID DISPLAY\ACR013A\5&amp;326CC178&amp;0&amp;UID1048849 WITH THE FOLLOWING STATUS: 0X0."</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Computer thinks All Drivers are up tp date and all Devices/Hardware are functioning properly**</p>
<p>
</p><p>and my Desktop is:</p>
<p>ASUS CM6830</p>
<p>Intel i7-3770</p>
<p>8gb Ram</p>
<p>64-bit Op System, x64-based Processor</p>
<p>and currently in the 'System' screen after "Pen and Touch:"</p>
<p>is states "No Pen or Touch is available for this Display"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager under Human Interface Devices the list ONLY includes:</p>
<p>Compliant Consumer Control Devices</p>
<p>Compliance Device</p>
<p>Microsoft Hardware USB Keyboard</p>
<p>Microsoft USB Mouse</p>
<p>USB Input Device</p>
<p>(there are a multitude of listings for each when I chose to show 'hidden')</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone has a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help and patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebecca</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>the Updates that failed to install at that time were </p>
<p>KB2310138 </p>
<p>KB2586448</p>
<p>KB2572077</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then ran the sfc /scannow command as an Administrator.&nbsp; This was on Oct 15th..&nbsp; It reported that several files were corrupted and could not be repaired.&nbsp; Those files were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bitsprx2.dll</p>
<p>d3d10warp.dll</p>
<p>fdSSDP.dll</p>
<p>Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v3.5.dll</p>
<p>mscorsec.dll</p>
<p>notepad.exe.mui</p>
<p>PhotoViewer.dll</p>
<p>wmplayer.exe.mui</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No hint was given as to how to repair those files.&nbsp; I could not locate any info on repairing these or any sfc reported corrupt files.</p>
<p>When I looked in the profiles of those files I noticed that information such as the File Version, Product name, Product version, Copyright, and Language were missing, more specifically they were blank. Why?? I guess that is why they were corrupt. On other
 .dll files this information was present and looked reasonable, eg Copyright Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. or Product name Microsoft DRM, and so on.</p>
<p>Since I still could not locate any information on how to repair or replace those files listed as corupt I search on the internet and found a program named&nbsp; 7-Zip File Manager that claimed to extract files from my Windows Install DVD. I took a big chance
 and extracted the </p>
<p>bitsprx2.dll</p>
<p>d3d10warp.dll</p>
<p>fdSSDP.dll</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>mscorsec.dll</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;files from my Windows install dvd.&nbsp; I tried to copy thos files to the C:\Windows\System32 folder but I failed.&nbsp;&nbsp; However since my computer is a dual boot with Ubuntu Linux I was able to copy the files via Ubuntu.&nbsp; I saved the old files just in case of problems.&nbsp;
 When I rebooted Windows 7 everything ran OK.&nbsp; I had no errors reported, and no difficulties.&nbsp; Also the notepad.exe.mui and wmplayer.exe.mui would now run correctly. I also tried to install the failed updates and they installed with no reported problems. This
 is after several attempts with the orginal .dlls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However everything is not going perfectly as could be expected. If I examin the properties of the new .dll files there is one property that is not set.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Security tab under the Group or user names there is one missing group called "TrustedInstaller."&nbsp;
 I am not allowed to add that group to </p>
<p>Security&nbsp; tab.&nbsp; consequently when I now run sfc /scannow I get a message that is</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation."</p>
<p>Looking in the CBS.log file gives many entried like this</p>

<p>If I add the old .dll files back into C:\Windows\System32 &nbsp;that I saved from the Ubuntu copy operation the sfc /scannow error remains. Windows 7 still seems to run OK, I can still install updates and other programs BUT now Visual Studio 2010 has sever problems
 and cannot create a new project, or even open an existing project.</p>

            <p>Hello programmer1956,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for the response back.&nbsp; Since you advised you have your installation DVD for Windows 7, have you tried a Startup Repair?&nbsp;&nbsp; Startup Repair can only fix certain problems, such as missing or damaged system files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would also make sure you have your data backed up.&nbsp; Please let us know status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Startup Repair:</p>

            The corrupt files are probably the replaced&nbsp;dlls&nbsp;via the patch that were done when u installed the 3rd party theme. If it aint part of the original windows, it will spew out your scannow as a corrupt system. Suggest you undo the theme and see if that fixes
 it.

<p>As many times as sfc /scannow is suggested in this community I have never see a Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" ever actually resolve any errors reported by the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They tell you to run it and report the results but if there are problems that are not fixed, I can't recall them ever actually figuring out what the problem is and fixing anything.&nbsp; I'm sure if there is an example of that actually happening (without a Repair
 Install or complete reinstall) somebody will provide some links to examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what has happened to your system the fix could be very easy or you might need some help so I would downloading SFCFix.exe to your desktop from this link:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sysnative.com/niemiro/apps/SFCFix.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysnative.com/niemiro/apps/SFCFix.exe</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing, learning and practice purposes it is easy to create corruption issues that cannot be fixed by sfc&nbsp; /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I manually created a problem that sfc /scannow reported but could not fix (SFC is not as smart as some folks think) then ran SFCFix.exe to see what it had to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the SFCFix.exe process will fix the problem all by itself as you can see in this simple example where I created a corruption that sfc /scannow could not fix but SFCFix.exe was able to fix an "unimportant" corruption in one pass:</p>
<p><br />
SFCFix.exe fixed one corruption all by itself:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac210dca-a976-4015-9f8f-95f1dd469d8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac210dca-a976-4015-9f8f-95f1dd469d8a" /></a></p>
<p><br />
When I ran sfc /scannow again the problem I created was fixed&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>running sfc /scannow again reported no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2c35c21-335f-4dd4-98c4-b46019774bf3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2c35c21-335f-4dd4-98c4-b46019774bf3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That was pretty easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If SFCFix.exe can't fix the problem you may be promoted to insert your genuine Windows 7 SP1 installation CD/DVD and SFCFix will try to get the missing file(s) from there but if you don't have that or SFCFix can't find what it needs a results and log file
 called SFCFix.txt will be created on your desktop:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5edd88e-4b2e-455d-b291-ec402a022784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5edd88e-4b2e-455d-b291-ec402a022784" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If SFCFix.exe can't fix the problem you then register a new account at <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sysnative</a>, <span>follow the directions</span> and they will send you back a ZIP file with the fixes for you to apply.&nbsp; Often you get the fix in one message cycle because they know what they are doing.&nbsp; It might take a little more depending on what is wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to read, understand and follow their directions exactly:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Following the directions will get you the fastest and best reply in the fewest message cycles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For simple cases what usually happens is they will analyze the report (may ask for more details) and eventually send you some instructions and a ZIP file that has in it the files you need to correct the problem and you are done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the problems are more complicated but eventually they should help get things squared away.</p>

<p>In my experience...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never been able to solve a SFC report of corruption other than a re-install, but that has happened rarely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a number of instances where SFC reports themselves are incorrect and have been able to fix that by uninstalling a specific Windows Update that caused fictitious reporting.&nbsp; Specifically either&nbsp;&nbsp;KB3022345 or&nbsp;KB3068708.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted your solution in my treasure trove, and if I ever run into this, will definitely try this.&nbsp; It is always nice to know that the author has actually used a proposed solution successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your excellent tutoring.<br />

<p>The same is for Metallica, the last entry in Artist mode is "Live at Grimey's" and bootleg "Full Metal Package", but when just seaching for albums Beyond Magnetic and Lulu are shown.</p>
<p>Dear Microsoft.</p>
<p>Hire me for charity work and I will make huge updates to this database and make it better.</p>

            <p>Those are basics that do work and I always do them to CDs I extract.</p>
<p>The issue is not that there is plethora of information missing in the database, that I edit manually, also the problem is with genre, there is a list that isn't very compelling, there is also no way to edit the year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, that on some artists album list the newest albums are not displayed, while they can be manually searched, also the limitation of only 500 results in regular search sometimes isn't enough.</p>

<p>OK, so a batch of updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem of "over 500 album entries" in the database affects Metallica as well, with the last release being from 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all newer releases from Deep Purple and Metallica are easily searchable, but cannot be seen via "Artists" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem is that some new entries to the database lack cover art, example being:</p>
<p>JMJ - Oxygeene 3:</p>
<p>http://fai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com/FAI/AlbumMatch.aspx?locale=415&amp;geoid=bf&amp;version=12.0.15063.0&amp;userlocale=415&amp;requestid=FEDA39C2-B623-4663-A53D-445611296236&amp;AlbumId=319190057&amp;Volume=1&amp;4506=</p>
<p>Alestorm - No Grave but the Sea:</p>
<p>http://fai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com/FAI/AlbumMatch.aspx?locale=415&amp;geoid=bf&amp;version=12.0.15063.0&amp;userlocale=415&amp;requestid=FEDA39C2-B623-4663-A53D-445611296236&amp;AlbumId=322363023&amp;Volume=1&amp;877=</p>
<p>Judas Priest - Turbo [Anniversary edition]:</p>
<p>http://fai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com/FAI/AlbumMatch.aspx?locale=415&amp;geoid=bf&amp;version=12.0.15063.0&amp;userlocale=415&amp;requestid=FEDA39C2-B623-4663-A53D-445611296236&amp;AlbumId=319604896&amp;Volume=1&amp;1986=</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore the database is full of errors, duplicate entries and rubbish entries that are not albums at all, as well as messed up bootlegs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire Rainbow data is missing from the "Artist" page, but albums are still findable manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply hire me and I will start correcting it.</p>

<p>Go to your Laptop/Computer or Sound Card&nbsp;Manufacturer's website&nbsp;&gt; look for the Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; put in your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer or Sound Card&nbsp;Model Number &gt; look for your Operating System &gt; download and install the Windows 7&nbsp;Audio, etc Drivers
 you find there; IF they supply them for 7.</p>

<p>%Temp%&nbsp; in run,organize,select all,delete all..As far as audio goes,1st install the MB/Hardware/chipset driver-software,after,install video/audio drivers/software,then networking driver..After all,download Direct X 2010 redistribute,download,extract to new

<h2>            wifi adapter problem - system hangs</h2>
                    <p>this is my second 64GB surface RT, i have exchanged the first one because of the same issue. i'm trying to decide if i should return it or exchange for a third one.</p>
<p>at times Surface shows "limited access" (or something like that, i'm using a Chinese version) next to the wifi signal sign, and then problem comes...</p>
<p>1. i cannot disconnect from the limited connection in order to try to reconnect, nor turn off wifi from "wireless menu", nor disable wireless adapter from control panel, nor turn on the airplane mode (i can turn it on but it show that wifi wasn't turned
 off) the system simply ignores all these commands.</p>
<p>2. choose diagnose only find it stuck at "disabling adapter" and never fixes anything</p>
<p>3. choose to restart surface helps, but it won't actually restart, it take a very long while to actually&nbsp;shut down, sometimes it cant even shut down normally, and never power on automatically, i had to press the power button to make it start, and sometimes
 it shows error message of "power state failure" sometimes not.</p>
<p>4. all other devices work fine one the same network including laptops, phones.</p>
<p>the period between each time this happens seems random. more than enough to make it a real pain...... sorry for my poor english, i like this product, but it's really frustrating now...</p>

    <title>Looking for refund for my existing xbox live gold. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> revangg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Looking for refund for my existing xbox live gold.</h2>
                    <p>This is what has happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My card expired. Not a big deal, I have another payment option (paypal) and I'll get a new card soon. Regardless I always turn off auto-renewal.</p>
<p>2) My xbox live gold expired shortly after. Wasn't planning on renewing until better deals came up. Still didn't have a new card yet (bank didn't send it to me initially through the mail, had to wait another 2 weeks for it to come in the mail).</p>
<p>3) Was browsing around for Xbox live gold deals and wouldn't you know it, Xbox live gold for $1 for a month straight from Microsoft!? I log in, and the offer is still there, but when I try to purchase it, it says I have a pending payment dispute.</p>
<p>4) I get back onto my xbox, only to find that Microsoft attempted to auto-renew me through my expired card. Somehow it "went through", and I was given gold for a period of time (I never knew or used it, haven't been on my xbox for weeks at this point). Then
 it somehow registered that it was expired, and my account was essentially frozen until the payment option was taken care of.<br />
5) I've paid the $26 fee, and now the $1 deal (and the 3 month deal) is gone. It's because I'm gold again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially I either have to A) suck it up and accept that Microsoft decided to auto renew from an expired card, then take it back even though I never purchased it myself or used it at all. Or B) get a refund, which takes like 48-72 hours, and the $1 deal
 is going to be gone in about 7 hours.<br />
<br />
Stuck between a rock and a hard place. Was told to post here.</p>

<p>=============================================<br />
Just a few thoughts...</p>
<p>I wonder if there would be an improvement if you created the video<br />
slide show without the .wav file?</p>
<p>There may be a corrupted JPEG in the group of photos...it may be worth<br />
A try to convert the JPEG files to the BMP format before importing.</p>
<p>If you are adding lots of transitions and effects that could be an issue.</p>
<p>Also try going to...Tools / Options / Compatibility tab and uncheck all the <br />
filters / OK.</p>
<p>FWIW...the free PhotoStory 3 might be a better app for creating video slide<br />
shows with music.</p>

            <p>Eh?</p>
<p>I assume&nbsp;you are asking how you can install the Epson LX-300+ printer onto a Windows 7 system?</p>
<p>That printer is *old* - really old.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=14340&amp;infoType=Downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support web page on Epson's site</a> only lists drivers up to Windows XP.&nbsp; Their <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supAdvice.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;noteoid=147071&amp;type=highlights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Windows 7 compatibility chart" (Epson's)</a>&nbsp;states that there is a "Built-in Windows 7 driver" for it. meaning that many drivers are included with Windows 7. Simply connect your Epson product to your Windows 7 computer and follow the on-screen instructions.
 If there is both a Built-in Windows 7 and a Download from Epson.com method available, choose the download method.</p>
<p>Going by that and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Epson%20LX-300%20Printer&amp;v=Epson&amp;uid=100106&amp;pf=4&amp;pi=3&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Other%20Printers&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Windows 7 Compatibility Center report on the LX-300</a>&nbsp;(both 32-bit and 64-bit) - it seems that you should just be able to connect the printer to your machine with the machine and printer turned on and the driver should load automagically.</p>
<p>Unfortunately - I have found that some hardware just doesn't cooperate the way iit should - sometimes you should probably just 'let go'.&nbsp; Is there a reason you need this particular (sold about a decade ago) printer any longer?</p>

<h2>            What is going on with the Microsoft Solitaire Collection&#63;</h2>
                    I have been playing the daily challenges for about 18 months with not too many problems but on 1st July was unable to play any more. As soon as I try to load a game I just get a white screen and cannot do anything. Is this a ploy by Microsoft to get me
 to pay to play or something else that other people are experiencing?

<p>Don't bother asking Microsoft. I've just spent 2 hours with their tech support, and apparently, there's a problem with 1703, and sometimes Onedrive interferes with the ads. I give up. Will MS ever release something which doesn't need to be constantly updated,
 and something which doesn't keep trying to take over my PC?</p>

            I ended up deleting the app and then reinstalling it. &nbsp;I resigned myself to the fact that I would lose all my game statistics but when I signed back &nbsp;into x-box they were still there so happy days. I have had no problems since, so far!

<p>What they are saying is that after a certain date they will no longer support them.</p>

    <title>Win 8.1 Logitech Wave Keyboard &#38; mouse problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robin dew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 Logitech Wave Keyboard &#38; mouse problems</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 8.1 I have issues with my Logitech Wave combo. In Chrome browser it will no longer scroll until I have manually dragged the scroll bar off the top of the page.
</p>
<p>In IE11 browser the page back button on the mouse will only refresh the existing page. Also the 'back arrow' button on the top left of the browser page, when right clicked no longer has any page history making it impossible to page backwards.</p>
<p>Logitech only states Win 8 compatibility on its products and not Win 8.1. Win 8.1 has a lot of compatibility issues we were never told about due to being setup for laptops and not desktops. Any ideas welcome.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try installing your SetPoint in Compatibility Mode for Win 7...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have a Logitech keyboard, but have a trackball and a Model 510 Wireless mouse...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been using SetPoint version 6.32 x64 on my Win 8.1 machine without any issues.</p>
<p>I think I installed it using Compatibility Mode for Win 7, but I don't remember for sure...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed that Logitech has made some changes to it's newer SetPoint software, but I don't remember exactly what... I do know that I didn't like the idea, and continued using the older version...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no longer available through normal channels, but is available with a search from other sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this link which redirects you to a Logitech server... 6.32 is near the bottom of the list....</p>
<p>There are several&nbsp;available, so look closely for the newest 6.32 or 6.32 x64 without any extra characters in the name....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have tried 6.32 and that freezes IE11 for about 2 minutes at a time and didn't solve the issue. I then tried 6.52 and the freezing stopped but the original issue was still there. Thank you for your suggestion. I think IE11 has many issues which Microsoft
 are not solving like the very frequent crashes. For desktop use I am seriously thinking of going back to Win 8 and IE10 which was more stable.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the "Unifying" feature in the SetPoint ? I only have a mouse so I don't know much about it, other than it is for a wireless mouse\keyboard combo...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try the receiver in a different USB Port and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had zero issues with my mouse with Win 8 or 8.1 Pro on two separate desktops....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might check some of the settings in the "Game" area... I have Game Detection disabled, and on the same window on the right for "Speed and Acceleration" I have SetPoint Implementation and Retain OS Settings checked...</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I had tried re-unifying the mouse, also tried other USB ports. I don't use gaming but my settings were as you suggested.</p>
<p>I have had some guidance from Logitech regarding clean boot and then loading Setpoint 6.61. My desktop would not carry out a clean boot and system config crashed every time. So I have restored an image of Win 8.1 from the first day of upgrade back in November,
 then carried out a clean boot and reloaded Setpoint. Normal page back from the mouse now works but there is no page history on the 'back arrow' button on the browser screen. I will have to live with that.</p>
<p>Many thanks for all your guidance.</p>
        </p>

<p>I feel very strongly that IE11 is very unstable and frequently crashes. My PC is under a year old and was made for Win 8. IE10 was more stable than IE11. It is not happy working with Google search engine. Other search engines are more compatible.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Benyamin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Windows 10 was preinstalled on your computer and itâs an OEM copy you would be having a recovery partition on your hard drive. You cannot assign the partition according to your partition. To create the system image you have to type â<strong>Recoveryâ</strong>
 on the Search bar and select <strong>Recovery</strong>. Then select â<strong>Create a recovery driveâ</strong> and follow the on screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is recommended to create a System recovery drive on an external hard disk or drive. Refer the below link for instructions to create a recovery drive on a USB drive.</span></p>

<p>
<span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Disable the security software temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and
 other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during
 the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
