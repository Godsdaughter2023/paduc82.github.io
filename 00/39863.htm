<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Try to delete your profile (profile only), clear your cache (3 times), and then download your profile again. See if that solves the issue you're experiencing with signing out everytime you start a game.<br />
<br />
<strong>To delete your profile (profile only):</strong><br />
<br />
Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Select your storage device &gt; Gamer Profiles &gt; Delete the gamertag you're having this issue with. Make sure when deleting you select&nbsp;<strong>Delete Profile Only</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Clear your cache (3 times in a row):<br />
<br />
</strong>Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Highlight your storage device and press Y &gt; Clear System Cache &gt; Press Yes. &nbsp;Make sure to do this step 3 times in a row.<br />
<br />
<strong>Re-download your profile:<br />
<br />
</strong>Push the middle button on your Xbox 360 controller and go to Download Profile. Enter in your e-mail/password and it will begin to re-download your profile.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please Note:</strong>&nbsp;If you're using 2-Step Verification you will need to use the Application Password that you generated upon setting up 2-Step and not your normal password. This is again, only if you have 2-step verification enabled.</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect  Remote Desktop  from a Windows 8.1 tablet, error  &#34;Remote Desktop can&#39;t connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Remote Desktop to Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several machines running RDP in our office. &nbsp;I recently upgraded a computer from Win XP (I know shame on me) to Windows 8.1 pro. &nbsp;I am able to connect to the Windows 8.1 pro PC from a Windows 7 PC and a Windows 8.1 tablet (not on same microsoft account).
 &nbsp;But, I cannot connect RDP from a Windows 8.1 tablet that uses the same Microsoft account name as the PC. &nbsp;Is there a way to fix this? &nbsp;I log in to all RDP connections using IP addresses w/port #. &nbsp;The problem tablet just gives me an error saying "Remote Desktop
 can't connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons" and it has the standard 3 reasons. &nbsp;I know the ports and RDP work because the other tablet and PCs can access the Win 8.1 PC. &nbsp;I know the tablet generating the error works in RDP because I can
 connect to other PCs I have RDP set-up on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only PC that the tablet won't work on is the PC set-up using the same microsoft account. &nbsp;Do I need to create a different microsoft account for the PC?</p>

            <p>If selecting the Power icon the Restart while holding shift does not get you to Troubleshoot then you may have to download the media creation tool and boot from the USB or DVD media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one other thing to try. Once windows starts to load press and hold the physical power button until the device powers off. Power on again and do the same. On the third power cycle leave it to begin diagnostic boot. You should get to Troubleshoot.
 Once there you can try System Restore or Command Prompt. With command prompt you can enable the built in Administrator account using
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes.</strong> I found that once the account was enabled the user login would appear again. (after a restart)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why the problem occurs it took my by surprise at the time.</p>

<h2>            High Windows Explorer &#40;explorer.exe&#41; memory usage</h2>
                    I found out recently that explorer.exe (windows explorer) is taking ~50% of my cpu usage (that's 1 full core out of 2). Killing the process and running it again solves the problem. Using the microsoft task explorer (by systeminternals), it's explorer.exe
 itself using the cpu. I have Vista SP1 with all the latest patches with IE8.

<p>Hello fathead,</p>
<p>Is the new VZA Access Manager compatible with Windows 7? If you are not sure, you should check with Verizon.<br />
<br />
You might try to do a System Restore to before you installed the software. <br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply back with an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            Hi Josip.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Change the batteries if wireless, try another USB port, reset mouse from button on bottom if available.
<br />
<br />Try the mouse in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows causing this.
<br />
<br />Try another mouse in this PC to confirm if Windows is the problem.
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab. First try Update this Driver &gt; Automatically, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there mouse software installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features? Uninstall it to see if the problem stops. This is unneeded bloatware.
<br />
<br />Adjust the mouse settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse, checking all settings including the Additonal Mouse Options box - check Settings on all tabs.
<br />
<br />Report back all results for possible other things to try.
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you bet</span><span>ter, I would like to know whether you are able to print other documents from the printer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be an issue with the printer to communicate with the software. Hence, I suggest you to run the program in compatibility mode and also run the printer troubleshooter to check if there is any issue with the printer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also try downloading the latest drivers for the printer from the manufacturers website.</span></p>

    <title>Inconsistent Date and Time in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inconsistent Date and Time in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76abfb71-e384-480a-b67c-df86dbc408bc" /></p>
<div>
<p>After a upgrade to windows 10 there are lots of problem in my computer. Though it happens in windows a lot because I upgraded from windows 7 which is just natural in Windows yet this one is bothering me a lot. I don't have consistent date and time. Sometimes
 the clock is out of time and it is even happening with the date. The update history reflects that I was even in 2018. The time zone is set to automatically.
</p>
<p>What I already did:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Whenever clock is out of time I uncheck automatic time zone and check it back and it becomes normal.</li></ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>I did a scan with Windows Defender and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware but nothing to be found.
</li><li>&nbsp;sfc /scannow shows no integrity violation</li><li>System Restore will be of no profit since I had done that already for another problem which I don't remember now. I was same before and after system restore.</li></ul>

<div>Any Suggestion would be appreciated...</div>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Microsoft is not allowing me to make other account. I want to make a local account without Microsoft but after filling first form it says lets signup for Microsoft account. How many Microsoft account should one need when it is providing the alias feature
 ?? One !! Can I do so called in place upgrade without affecting my grub ? I had gone through hassles when upgrading from windows 7. Fix mbr. Upgrade. Install grub in win 10 after that my multiboot device was as usual. Now I use grub from Linux, I feel safe.
 At least some OS will be running there. I am unable to make any new user account locals last month so I sign in with my MSN account and left the issue behind.

            <p>I did a upgrade from windows 10 to 10 instead of troubleshooting. Now my windows is not activated !! Am I in trouble ?
</p>
<p>Edited:</p>
<p>A restart activated it. Hope Everything will be fine from now on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Future Reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;The inconsitency of time was due to my other operating systems which uses universal time format and changes the NVRAM variables. Tweaking Registry and keeping the time as universal fix the problem. Hope this will be helpful to someone doing multiboot.</p>

    <title>NOT Gaming on Windows 10&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chiwawamom2  say:</h3>
<h2>            NOT Gaming on Windows 10&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel like some kind of freak asking this question because I'm probably one of them a fraction of people that doesn't spend their whole day gaming on their PC. My PC is for personal use. I am not a business, however I'm really annoyed by the thought
 of even gaming anything! I'm not interested in playing any games and I don't want it taking space up on my computer. I feel like I'm at a total loss to completely get rid of gaming. Why did they have to put it in the program so you can't take it out at all?
 I called ms for this and&nbsp; I did get Xbox removed I got the game bar removed Microsoft helped me but overall the stuff is still there and I just really don't want an ooerating system or program that has gaming on it at all!&nbsp; Does anybody have any suggestions
 for people like me? I guess I'm just the odd ball around here everybody loves to play games but not me. I use it for personal reasons. What should I do? My other computer that's an old Windows 7vista&nbsp; didn't have that on there and I was happy as could be,
 but I don't want to go backwards in other features. I do like about Windows 10 are the apps basically I want my Windows 10 to be more like my Android phone which is a breeze to use. It's a shame that Android has outshined windows so badly and that the games
 are the only thing that they think they can have in common... I just don't understand it so I have become, against my better judgement, " Google dependent " and yet I long for a real computer that doesn't have some kind of agenda, works right,&nbsp; and has the
 programming of what do need use. What do I have to delete to get rid of this crap?&nbsp; What program in Windows does not include gaming that could be within my financial grasp?</p>

<h2>            New Surface Pro 6 random freeze&#47;lag</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I purchased a Surface Pro 6 on black Friday (i5/8gb/128gb) from Best Buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The first one, all of a sudden one day (after a month of the purchase) simply died on me. Though the device was charging and I could see that it was powering the keyboard, the screen just wouldn't turn on. Luckily, since it was a Holiday purchase, the return
 window was of more than a month and hence the Geek Squad person was able to return it free of any cost to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Now, the "new" device which I got, has been having issues as well. I would see random freezes and lags while working. I have tried refreshing the device thinking it is a software issue but I haven't been able to find a fix. I have tested this issue while playing
 music which continues to play suggesting that PC itself doesn't hang, just the display leading me<span> to<span> believe this to be an intel graphics drive issue. I have found that the device doesn't even have the latest driver, and I don't
 know if Microsoft is planning on releasing a graphic driver update for this model. The problem would only occur when unplugged from A/C power</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Also, there was an issue with the touchscreen a couple of weeks ago, for which I had run the<span>
<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Surface diagnostic toolkit</span></a> but that didn't help. The MS tech support, though congenial weren't of any help even though they remote connected and looked at this problem and suggested it might be a hardware issue, which it wasn't as
<span>Surface diagnostic toolkit</span></a> but that didn't help. The MS tech support, though congenial weren't of any help even though they remote connected and looked at this problem and suggested it might be a hardware issue, which it wasn't as
 another PC refresh fixed it.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
So, right now, I am seriously disappointed with these random jitters. I have returned one, and suffered losses in my workflow and the money I spent in decals for the first device. If this is an hardware issue, which I hope it's not, since then I will have to
 use Best Buy's insurance (good thing I bought that) to return this device, again, in less than a year, and suffer losses of time and money, once more.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
P.S. if a Microsoft agent decides to reply to this question, I would like a comprehensive solution. This is not my first windows machine and I have been using Windows PC since XP.</p>

<p>Hello Mizey for your reply. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Is there any changes on the Surface device before this issue happened?</span></em></li></ul>
<p>Yes, since my device is running Windows 10 Home, there is no way for me to defer updates and hence it got updated to Build 1809 (the same one which has been mired with innumerous issues since it was pushed into consumer devices). Before I received that update,
 my device worked fine and I didn't have random freezes.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Aside from the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, have your tried any troubleshooting steps on your Surface device? If yes, what are those steps?</span></em></li></ul>
<p>No. Also, it doesn't matter since I have reset the PC twice as well. So, any changes "I might have mistakenly made" were removed anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Here are the few things we can highly suggests you do;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">We will make sure your Surface device is up-to-date. To check the updates, go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and Security &gt; Windows Update, </strong>on the right side please tap/click the button "<strong>Check for updates"</strong> for us to know if there's any pending updates that needs to be installed on your Surface device.
</span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(Note: If there's any pending update on your Surface device, please do the update and while the Surface device is downloading/installing the updates, please do not perform any steps on your Surface device,
 let the Surface device completely installed the updates).</span></em></p>
<p>Yes, the device is up to date. Trust me. If it were up to me to opt out of, or control the way updates are applied to the device, I would not have update it to this build. There are no pending updates of any sorts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You may contact our Surface Support for them to provide you alternative options like for the replacement of your Surface device. I can assure you and guarantee to you that this will help you and
 solve your&nbsp; problem.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I think I did mention the losses I have already had to suffer while replacing the first device. The reason I bought this device was due to the 'flexibility' a 2-in-1 provides. But, it seems to me that was a mistake. I am just waiting
 for the April update to roll out and see if it will fix the issue or not. Otherwise, I am going to either talk to someone at Best Buy about it or someone at Surface Support. It's pointless to build a good 2-in-1 device like this which has this many issues.
 Seeing I am not the only one facing this one in particular (which a quick google search can corroborate to), I will make sure to let my peers, friends and everyone else know about this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Mizey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was contacted by the Surface Support person who has tried everything and lastly suggested a full PC reset which I did yesterday. The issue still persists. At this point, I am beyond disappointed. One would think that by spending $1000+ one would get a
 premium experience. All the glowing reviews this device gets are simply superficial and nothing more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1st option I have is to take this PC and spend more money to go to Pittsburgh and get it replaced (no guarantee that the 2nd replacement won't fail), doing which I will have to shell out additional ~60$ (including transportation and price for the decals;
 is Microsoft going to refund this? Of course not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd option is going to a local Best Buy (from where I purchased this device) and talk about what options I get since I got their insurance. Let me frankly say this: if I do get the option of getting a refund, I am going to take that and cut my losses
 since, at this point, I think I will just keep losing valuable time and money fiddling with a badly manufactured device (I am not the only one with these issues, as I have seen community questions from people with the same issues).</p>
<p>I will take my money somewhere else. Microsoft, it seems, is still a software company and not a hardware one. One would think the integration will be good, but apparently not. I will NOT be recommending this device, no matter how good, premium it looks and
 has glowing reviews from major reviews!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have a good day,</p>
<p>

<p>Hmm. This is weird. The computer is perfect EXCEPT for the lag/stutter. I don't really believe this is HW problems. This is just some combination with software/hardware and windows itself. Maybe it will be fixed in a driver/firmware update? It's weird MS
 can't use more resources for this to isolate the problem. They just say change the device. That's really a waste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked as a Computer Engineer for many years and when ever we troubleshoot computers, we tried to find the problem and isolate it. Nowadays they just ask you to reset/re-install the computer and when that doesn't work, it's just throw it and replace...
 What a time. Feels like someone won't take any responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought mine just in this town and i have 50 days to return it even if I used it (it's like this in Norway), so i don't have any problem with returning it and getting a new. But the solution is not satisfying for me. We don't know what this is. Just replace
 it. No real troubleshooting... This is the world we're living in now. Just buy buy buy buy and then throw if you don't know and buy again. Never actually find out what's happening...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
ADDON: Another thing i remember is that I think I remember something about freezes with my Surface Pro 5 last year also. Just barely remember I was irritated by some freezing, but it went away. Maybe I confuse It with something else, but I'm pretty sure. That's
 why I also think this is crazy to just make people change the whole device instead of actually troubleshoot properly.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I totally agree with you. Nowadays, even the Support team simply asks for a reset or reinstalling the OS (and hoping that the issue with go away) rather than actually troubleshooting. Like I said, I have tried to troubleshoot as much as I could, fiddle
 around with the OS&nbsp; and can't find the reason. That's why I asked for a comprehensive solution and not the generic "reset your PC" answers, which I knew would not work (having tried that earlier). And, the only other option is then replace the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you could be right with this being caused due to something going haywire with the SW/HW integration. But it's a MS product so that's not expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, MS should invest some time to actually isolate the issue, but most probably that would not happen (due to the reasons you already mentioned).</p>
<p>I saw that you have checked if the issue was resolved with the April Update for Win10&nbsp; and since you still are experiencing the problem, I don't think anyone at MS bothers to even take notice. I am going to the local store (from where I bought the device
 from) to see if I can get a replacement. (This device was a replacement too and I lost 7 days while waiting for this to arrive and $30 for decals)I will ask about the refund policy as well and take it if given the chance (though it that case, this surface
 pen will become useless for which I will suffer losses again). Let's see how it goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add-on : So, after a very long discussion with peolpe from BestBuy, I have only two options: 1. Ask BestBuy to replace the product in which case due to thier agreement with MS (they are quite transparent about it), I will be getting a refurbished unit and
 NOT a new one. 2. Ask the Surface Support rep to go through with the replacement. I have asked said person if I would get a new unit in that case. Let's see how all this goes! What a disappointing disaster this purchase has been for me!</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as it turns out, the BestBuy replacement policy will hurt me as a customer because they will provide me with a refurbished device and not a new one (though they were really transparent about it). BestBuy, however, can't give me any sort of refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, I have contacted MS again to check whether I will be getting a new device if I replace this faulty one: their answer (at first) was "It depends". No customer who paid for a new device will want to get a refurb device, even if it's certified by MS,
 when the replacement is due to a hardware issue. When I mentioned that I can do an In-Store visit, their answer was depending on the inventory of the store I may get a new one. So, that's what I am doing to do: visit the nearest store in the beginning of next
 month and let's see how that goes!</p>

<p>I've replaced my Surface Pro 6 now with a brand new one. The first thing i noticed was that I now have a Sk Hynix SSD drive (Had Samsung on the other one). Is that a better drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just setting my Surface up with Windows and apps, but haven't experienced any lags/freezes yet. But I'll continue to check and report back in a week to see if they have gone.</p>

                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows installer keeps bugging me. Any program I want to install gives me an error telling me that another installation is in progress. However there is no other installation in progress. However through out the day, a Windows installer dialog box shows
 up and configures something and then disapperares. This happens 3-4 times before it quits for ~5-6 hrs. I found out that it has to do with VAIO Media Gallery. However, I have uninstalled Media Gallery. Can anyone help me? This started 3-4 months ago after
 installing iTunes. Attached is a picture of the window that keeps showing up.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa0c1f8e-4c88-46c7-a318-af4dbb6f1555" /></p>

<p>Unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. On the "Start" menu, click "Run:.</p>

 is causing this issue, I would suggest you to perform a clean boot procedure and check. In a clean boot procedure, you disable all third party programs and you boot only with limited services which are essential for Windows to operate. If you don’t face this
 issue in a clean boot state, then it means that one of the third party service that was disabled is the reason for the issue. Refer to this article for more information on clean boot and how to troubleshoot the issue causing service in a clean boot:</font></font></font></span></p>

            <p>The clean boot did not work. Windows installer keeps interfering with other installations. I tried to update my computer and error code 642 came up. This keeps happening:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/942428fe-773f-4191-b9ad-ce9b0cedb0ed" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8f277a1-61c6-4c7b-9afa-cbe5dd0a2cdb" /></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It appears that you are typing the command in incorrect format.<br />
a. Open the command prompt as administrator.<br />
b. Copy paste the below commands<br />
<b><span>msiexec /unregister&nbsp;
<br />
</span></b><span><span>c. Hit Enter<br />
</span></span><span>d. Now type
<b>msiexec /regserver<br />
</b></span><span><span><span>e. Hit Enter<br />
<b><br />
</b></span></span></span><b>Note: </b>There should be a space between <b>
<span>msiexec</span></b> and&nbsp;
<b><span>/unregister.
</span></b><span><span>It is the same for the second command.<br />
<br />

            The software for the functions you mention is manufacturer-specific. With Acer laptops it is handled by the "Launch Manager". You need to find out what it is for your laptop, then download it from the manufacturer's web page.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I bought a new laptop and it has a licensed Home edition of windows 10. However I originally have a digital license for Pro edition connected to my account. I want to use the license on my new laptop and upgrade to Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obtained the pro license after upgrading from windows 7 and I had it on my earlier laptop which I formatted and sold already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am signed in with my account but it still shows Home edition but with a license linked to my account although the license is from manufacturer. How can I force it to upgrade to pro?</p>

<p>Whether or not you can transfer the license depends on what type of license it was.&nbsp; If it was an OEM license--Windows was installed on the computer by the manufacturer--it's not transferable.&nbsp; If it was a retail license, it can be transferred.&nbsp; Enter the
 retail product key during installation, and if there's a problem, use <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> john, tucson  say:</h3>
<h2>            At every shutdown &#34;Preparing To Configure Windows. Please Do Not Turn Off Your Computer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have been suffering through this issue with my Windows 7 laptop&nbsp;for over a week.&nbsp; At EVERY shutdown I get:</p>
<p>"Preparing To Configure Windows. Please Do Not Turn Off Your Computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It completes after 1-4 hours (always different)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This began after I attempted a routine Windows C drive cleanup.&nbsp; It stalled all night at cleaning up the Updates.&nbsp; I left it for the day and it was at the same point when I returned.&nbsp; I turned off the laptop with the Power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it restarts, it takes quite some to reconfigure.&nbsp; Then everything is exceedingly slow.&nbsp; My WiFi connection is permanently active.&nbsp; If I disconnect my WiFi, the system improves, but reverts to the slow response when I reactivate my WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My virus and malware checks show all is well.&nbsp; Scannow finds no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this first occurred, I attempted to Restore, but there were no Restore points available!</p>

<p>Issue appears to have been resolved with the help of Mark at MS Technical support through Caht and Remote access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since, fir unknown reasons, my Restore points were nonexistent, and we couldn't even create a new one, he went through the lengthy process of uninstalling the last updates of over a week and a half ago.&nbsp; The latest one took a considerable time to uninstall,
 and I believe that one was the culprit.&nbsp; After that, and rebooting (which was also lengthy since the updates had to be reinstalled again) everything was back to normal for the first time in over two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to Mark, and the tech support staff that had to try before I could be elevated, for their patience and consistent attempts until it was resolved.</p>

<h2>            EA Star War Battlefront - &#38;quot&#59;..not allowed to access online features&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I am long time adult with a valid Xbox live account, when I try&nbsp;to go online in Battlefront I get "You are not allowed to access online features"&nbsp; I downloaded the full game from the Xbox Store, Set up was simple agree&nbsp;to the long user agreement and I was
 playing but noticed I was not online, click "Y" to go one line yields "You are not allowed to access online features" after looking over all the options, I hard rest, no help. Deleted my profile, hard reset, add profile back, no help. I deleted the game and
 save games, downloaded from "games ready to be install" in my games and apps, agree to the license, Yields NO online for me! Delete profile, hard reset, add profile. Nothing. I check my MS account and Yes I'm old. I got this to play across country with my
 brother, We got the Xbox Ones&nbsp;on day one, both upgrade to win10 version. He can go one line and I not.</p>
<p>After reading post, I have a question. Do you&nbsp;create up an EA account during set up. I didn't have to do this, either time I installed it.. The EA account page recognizes my email address but not my password and after multiple tries it will not send me the
 info to change my password, so I can't see what's going on with it. Do you need an EA account? Why is my MS account good enough for every other game?</p>
<p>This is a long way from fun, help if you can.</p>

<p>EVERONE! I FOUND OUT HOW TO FIX IT! Just take a moment to soak up this awesome message. Thanks to a couple amazing of Xbox specialists, there is a solution!</p>
<p>QUICK SOLUTION: Hold the Xbox one off button until it turns off.( You must turn it off this way, or it will not work ). Then, you have to go back into Battlefront and somthing should come up that says something like, not linked to your EA account, it should
 have 2 buttons under that message: Relink and cancel(something like that). CLICK RELINK!!! That should work, if not......</p>
<p>Make sure you have an EA account with an alternate Email attached to it. THEN it should work.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to the Xbox specialists that helped me with this. Their hard work will not be left uncredited. :D</p>

<h2>            System and compressed memory killing me</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys. I am not that much of a tech savvy guy so I would like to ask you in advance to post simple answers as much as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo y510p laptop. These are the specs :&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">4th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-4700MQ (2.4GHz 1600MHz 6MB), windows 10 latest
 build, fully updated,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">NVIDIA® GeForce® GT755M 2GB,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">8GB
 PC3-12800 DDR3L SDRAM 1600 MHz memory,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">1TB (5400 RPM) + 8GB Hybrid Drive hard drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">I will tell you my problem. I play CS : GO. I play it on a 4:3 aspect ratio, 1400x1050 stretched, everything on low, I get
 200 consistent fps. Almost nothing is running in the background, only the basic things. I have 0 viruses, I scan it weekly, everything is okay with it, run sfc scannow, did disk checks, etc.. defragmentation, everything. Yet, sometimes and it occurs almost
 once a day, my fps drops to 30, everything becomes stuttery, I check my task manager and there it is, system and compressed memory taking up a lot of my ram and disk usage is on 100%. I do not know why this occurs, how come it does not occur every time I play?
 I seriously have no idea what to do, when it happens I just quickly restart my laptop. Any ideas on how to stop this? Can I somehow disable it? This didn't happen pre 1511 build. I also play other games like Fifa 15 for example but this thing only occurs sometimes,
 at random times, when I play CS GO.</span></p>

            Hi Jenith ! I have tried this too, running it in compatibility mode with windows 8, 8.1, 7, xp, everything, still persists. I have all of my drives up to date, reinstalled graphic drivers more than once, I am playing it online, CS GO through Steam. I'm
 at my wits end :(

            <p>Also watching System and compressed memory eat my hard drive now. I'm on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, wasn't actively gaming, but merely brought this Alienware Alpha out of hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System and compressed memory went on for&nbsp;what seemed like 7 minutes, but was eventually overtaken by our friend Antimalware Service Executable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first thought was the page file was not set as system managed in the Virtual Memory&nbsp;section of System Properties, which I always used in previous OSes without&nbsp;a problem. Then again, I don't remember a "System and compressed memory" process in previous
 OSes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 has a single check box for doing so to multiple partitions. Mine has 3, an OS, ESP and PBR image. Not sure what the ESP and PBR image are yet. I'm curious if these are 3rd party (Dell/Alienware?) partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless,&nbsp;System and compressed memory&nbsp;had a shitstorm lightning fit&nbsp;for a good while. At least according to Windows.</p>

<p>After a&nbsp;lot of experimenting I eventually traced the problem to my wireless USB dongle's driver. I made a lot of changes to my laptop at round about the same time that the Windows update came out and suddenly I had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first addition was a SAMSUNG SSD 850 EVO 1TB. I had rapid mode enabled and suspected that it could be the reason that my memory became an issue. Some posts on various forums indicated that it might be a problem and all advised against using it as it
 doesn't enhance performance in any way. After disabling it I had the same performance but the issue didn't go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clue to the possibility that it could be the wireless dongle came up in a post where someone suggested that a wrong and/or old driver could be the reason for system and compressed memory behaving badly. The fact that I lost wireless connection every time
 that System and Compressed Memory misbehaved then convinced me that it must be the issue. I remembered when I installed the dongle, I didn't install the drivers that came with it and in stead allowed Windows to find and install its own (my mistake).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the good news is I installed the correct driver and have been running for days now without any issues. My memory is nice and low and it releases properly after sessions with multiple virtual machines. CPU remains below 3%, except when I push it with
 hardcore processor intensive work. I haven't had a single issue gain after updating the driver and apart from frequently putting it to sleep haven't had a single hard reboot since.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can therefore confidently claim that my problem has been fixed and would suggest that anybody that experiences this kind of problem, look for it in your drivers. You might have a clue that will indicate which driver is affected, like in my case the wireless
 connection went down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as System and Compressed Memory is concerned. It works flawlessly and if you can fix the reason it seems to misbehave you will find your computer will sing along like never before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy hunting and I hope you all find your issues.</p>

                    <p>First of all, great feature, much better than snipping tool in my opinion.</p>
<p>But after using it, I cannot seem to close the window it creates.&nbsp; Is this a known bug/issue?</p>

            My version of win 10 IS the May 2019 update, which I had to reinstall AFTER attempting to update to it, LOL.&nbsp; Tried three of the mentioned options, and it was still hung.&nbsp; Then it resolved by itself, which was nice.
