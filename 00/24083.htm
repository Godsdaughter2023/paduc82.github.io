<h2>            Show Windows Store download progress in Action Center</h2>
                    I've got a slow network connection and It takes hours to download huge games and apps. Before Windows 10 Build 9926 the download progress was shown under the app tile in Start menu but now I have to open the Windows Store and click on "installing apps..."
 every time to check the download progress. It would be great if it could appear in Action Center.<br />

            <p>You can also update your Word settings to show the active document window AND the program window.</p>
<p>If you're on 2007, from the Office button </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - go to Word Options</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - choose Advanced</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Under Display uncheck "show all windows in the taskbar"</p>
<p>This should give you an active doc window and a program window.</p>

    <title>How to Make Null Selection in Combo Box Return All Values This topic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anita arnold  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Make Null Selection in Combo Box Return All Values This topic is a duplicate of another discussion.</h2>
                    <div>I am using a combo box in the HEADER of a form to filter the results displayed in the DETAIL section of the form.
<br />
<br />
On the AFTER_UPDATE event for the combo box, I have the following code: <br />
<br />
Private Sub cboSelectTester_AfterUpdate() <br />
Me.Filter = "TesterName = '" &amp; Me.cboSelectTester &amp; "'" <br />
Me.FilterOn = True <br />
<br />
What I need now is to accommodate NO SELECTION in that combo box. If a user selects NOTHING, I want ALL records displayed in the DETAIL section of the form.
<br />
<br />
I have read through answers at several other sites -- and I just do not understand what they are telling me to do.
<br />
<br />
Please, if anyone could assist with this, I would be extremely greatful. I've wasted all morning on trying to figure this out and I am at the end of my rope!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>You just need to remove the filter.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = False<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case just clear the top row of the combo and press enter or tab off the control</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can put this on any event - for example a double click </p>

            <p>It helped AND worked -- at least the top example. I don't exactly understand the difference between these two.&nbsp; Would you be able to explain it - if what I've written below does NOT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first one allows me to select a desired tester and returns the results in the form matching the selection. If I select the BLANK row at the top, I get ALL records, which is just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second set of codes also allows me to choose a selected tester and returns the results based on that selection. However, once I've selected a tester from the combo box, selecting the BLANK row returns NO RECORDS. If I double-click the combo box, all
 records are returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm trying to understand what is the functional difference -- or why one method would be preferred over another?</p>

            <p>Hi Anita<br />
<br />
<br />
It all depends on how you have set up the form to run (the UI).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first code will simply check if there is anything selected in your combo&nbsp;<em><strong>If Not IsNull([cboSelectTester])</strong></em> .&nbsp; AfterUpdate, if there is something selected, it will apply the filter&nbsp;
<em><strong>Me.FilterOn = True</strong></em>.&nbsp; If there is nothing selected it will remove the filter
<em><strong>Me.FilterOn = False</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second code applies the filter after update <strong><em>Me.FilterOn = True</em></strong>&nbsp;then, On DoubleClick of the combo, it will remove the filter
<strong><em>Me.FilterOn = False</em></strong>&nbsp;and the contents of the bound column in the combo
<strong><em>Me.cboSelectTester = Null</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not saying this is the only answer.&nbsp; You can clear the combo, set/remove the filter, etc, etc on virtually any event (e.g. clicking a button, if a control has some value, on open/close, etc, etc - the list is endless).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said it all depends on the flow of the form and this is for the designer to look at and then make the best decision based on what the form's function is.&nbsp; All people on these forums can do is answer questions with "possible" answers as we tend not to
 see&nbsp;the full application</p>
<p>
</p><p>You ask if one method would be preferred over another.&nbsp; That's again up to you.&nbsp; In my case I never use the DoubleClick event as at least half of the users on my system are using touch screens and they find it almost impossible to DubleClick, so I have written
 a (one line) bit of code that simulates this but with 2 clicks - the 1st click does something and the next does something else.&nbsp; The only thing I did was to trap a DoublClick (in case anyone did it, by mistake).<br />
<br />
<br />
So the answer to your question is that the codes do different things and use different events so they are both fine, but it depends on what you have set for the form flow as to which is preferable.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You can in fact do this with a minimal amendment to your existing code.&nbsp; Simply change the line:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True <br />
to:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = Not IsNull(Me.cboSelectTester)<br />
<br />
The expression <em>Not IsNull(Me.cboSelectTester)</em> evaluates to TRUE if the combo box IS NOT NULL&nbsp; i.e. a selection has been made, and to FALSE if the control IS NULL, i.e.&nbsp; so the filter is turned on or off accordingly.<br />
<br />
However, a better approach in my view, which makes it&nbsp; clearer to the user what to do to return all rows, is to add a line to the list of values by setting the RowSource property of the combo box to something like this;<br />
<br />
SELECT TesterName, 1 As SortColumn<br />
FROM YourTable<br />
UNION<br />
SELECT "&lt;All Testers&gt;", 0<br />
FROM YourTable<br />
ORDER BY SortColumn,TesterName;<br />
<br />
A UNION operation suppresses duplicate rows, so the SQL statement will return one instance of each tester name plus one row with the value
<em>&lt;All Testers&gt;</em>.&nbsp; The constants 0 and 1 returned in the computed SortColumn allow the results to be ordered first by this column and then by name, so the
<em>&lt;All Testers&gt;</em> row is listed first, followed by the names alphabetically.<br />
<br />
Then change the line of code in the event procedure to:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = Nz(Me.cboSelectTester, "&lt;All Testers&gt;") &lt;&gt; "&lt;All Testers&gt;"<br />
<br />
The Nz function returns the value <em>&lt;All Testers&gt;</em> if the combo box is NULL, so whether the user makes the control NULL by deleting the currently selected value, or selects
<em>&lt;All Testers&gt;</em> the expression <em>Nz(Me.cboSelectTester, "&lt;All Testers&gt;") &lt;&gt; "&lt;All Testers&gt;"</em> will evaluate to FALSE, turning the filter off.<br />
<br />
One final word; while the above does the trick, I find that <em>restricting </em>
a form's recordset rather than <em>filtering </em>the form generally gives significantly better performance.&nbsp; It also makes it very easy to restrict the results on the basis of multiple unbound combo boxes, in each of which a specific value or
<em>&lt;all whatevers&gt;</em> can be selected.&nbsp; I won't go into details now, but if you are interested you'll find an example in
<em>ComboDemo.zip </em>in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

</p><blockquote>I downloaded the file and cannot wait to look through it!

<p>
To give you a head start, this is how it works:&nbsp; the form includes three unbound combo boxes in its header.&nbsp; The RowSource of each is a UNION query which returns an 'All...." row as the first row in the list, e.g. for Counties:<br />
<br />
SELECT CountyID, County, 1 As SortColumn <br />
FROM Counties <br />
UNION <br />
SELECT&nbsp; 0, "All Counties", 1 <br />
FROM Counties <br />
ORDER BY SortColumn, County;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The fact that the data in this case is hierarchical is by-the-bye, however; the columns (fields) being searched could be independent of each other.<br />
<br />
The way it's done is to base the form on a query which references the three combo boxes as parameters:<br />
<br />
SELECT Counties.County, Districts.District, Parishes.Parish, Locations.Location <br />
FROM ((Counties INNER JOIN Districts ON Counties.CountyID=Districts.CountyID) <br />
INNER JOIN Parishes ON Districts.DistrictID=Parishes.DistrictID) <br />
INNER JOIN Locations ON Parishes.ParishID=Locations.ParishID <br />
WHERE (Counties.CountyID=Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoCounty <br />
OR Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoCounty = 0) <br />
AND (Districts.DistrictID=Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoDistrict <br />
OR Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoDistrict = 0) <br />
AND (Parishes.ParishID=Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoParish <br />
OR Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoParish = 0) <br />
ORDER BY Counties.County, Districts.District, Parishes.Parish<br />
<br />
The important thing here is that not only does the query test for the value in a column equalling that of the relevant control in the form, but also for the parameter (the control) being zero, i.e. The 'All...' option having been selected.&nbsp; The county combo
 box for instance is referenced in the query's WHERE clause with:<br />
<br />
(Counties.CountyID=Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoCounty <br />
OR Forms!frmDrillDown!cboGotoCounty = 0) <br />
<br />
Note how the OR operation is parenthesized.&nbsp; This is important as it forces the operation to evaluate independently of the AND operations.&nbsp; The way it works is that if the value in a row equals that of the control in the form the first part of the OR operation
 will evaluate to True, so that row will be retuned; if the control = 0 then the second part of the OR operation will evaluate to True regardless of the value in the column, so all rows will be returned.<br />
<br />
By doing the same for each control in the form's header, and tacking the parenthesized OR operations together with AND operators, only those rows for which all three of the parenthesized OR operations evaluate to True will be returned.<br />
<br />
To cause the form to show the rows restricted on the basis of the selections in the combo boxes it is necessary to requery the form.&nbsp; This is done in the AfterUpdate event procedure of each of the three combo boxes with the line:<br />
<br />
Me.Requery<br />
<br />
There is other code in the AfterUpdate event procedures, but that is only because of the hierarchical nature of the data and correlates the combo boxes.&nbsp; Where there is no such hierarchical relationship you only need the single line to requery the form as above.<br />
<br />
BTW to view the form's RowSource query do so by zooming the RowSource property in from design view.&nbsp; Don't use the build button (the one with 3 dots) to view the RowSource in query design view as Access will move things around and the logic of the query's WHERE
 clause will be obscured.&nbsp; When writing a query like this, with a series of parenthesized OR operations, always do it in SQL view.&nbsp; You can use the query designer to build the basic query without the WHERE clause, and then switch to SQL view to add the WHERE
 clause.<br />
<br />
The thing about this approach is that the logic is so simple, it's just a case of testing, in the case of each control, for:<br />
<br />
(SomeColumn = &lt;some parameter&gt; <br />
OR &lt;some parameter&gt;&nbsp; = 0)<br />
<br />
As many parenthesized operations like this as necessary can be tacked together with the AND operator.&nbsp; Given good table design, in particular good indexing of the columns in question, performance is generally very good in my experience.<br />

    <title>how to restore popup&#47;notification for new notification behavior, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amirtal  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to restore popup&#47;notification for new notification behavior, same as it was on skype version 7.x</h2>
                    <p>in skype version 7.x, when a new message was received, a new conversation windows would pop-up, with the received message, and would REMAIN OPEN.</p>
<p>so if a person is away from the PC, notification for missed messages were waiting on screen when the person returns.</p>
<p>in the new versions (both version 8 and 14), behavior is changed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>skype window itself is not kept open. it is minimized, and if this is not bad enough, it is minimized to tray. even worse, it is automatically hidden in the windows tray.</p>
<p>new popup is not kept open when message is received, actually it is not even opened, instead we get a brief windows 10 style notification, and the message is gone.</p>
<p>there is no visible indication on the screen that a message was received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been using skype for years and have never missed a notification.</p>
<p>my usage has now changed to getting an email telling me to check skype for a missed notification, for almost every single notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do i revert back to the old behavior? </p>
<p>i.e. when i get an instant message i want it to be visible and persistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have searched the web and the forum but could not find any way to achieve this, only information i could find is on hiding existing notifications, which is the exact opposite of what i am trying to get.</p>

<p>Get a version 7.40 at https://uploadfiles.io/djtr4. First remove ALL other Skype versions. It is clean and working. It should not ask to update, but if it does on your system, just say no. Keep the notification mail from this post to keep the link.</p>
<p>And mods should stop editing stuff when we try to help people unlike the Skype team!</p>

<p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may be software related, we suggest that you refresh your phone's software by performing a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. To do this, just press
 the power and volume down buttons simultaneously until the phone restarts. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any situations like the one you are experiencing.</p>

            Thank you so much for answering, I tried this but it did not work, so I did a reset, it gave me the option to not reset the SD card ( which was great) and everything is now ok. It took about 2 hours for the whole thing to get back to where it was. The
 only app I had to re install was Facebook. I am now happy again. I love my windows phone and I know when this phone dies I will have to get an android, :(

<h2>            OneNote for Mac can&#39;t search handwritten notes within in whole section or notebook</h2>
                    In OneNote for Mac, if I try to search for handwritten notes (created on the iOS version) in a section or notebook, the matching results are not shown in the list below the search box. It just says no results found. However, if I only search in the currently
 opened page, the words are correctly highlighted, which shows that OCR itself actually worked. Typed text can be searched in any range without problem. The iOS and Windows version of OneNote work flawlessly. Handwritten notes can be searched in section or
 notebook and all matching pages are listed.<br />
<br />
I tried closing and opening the notebook, signing out and signing in again, restart OneNote and computer. None of them helped. I'm running version 15.38 (170902) on macOS 10.12.6 and notes are stored in a personal OneDrive account.

<h3> jasonfpfs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel - How to calculate gross amount when you know the net amount after taxes</h2>
                    <p>How can I use MS Excel to calculate the required gross amount for a financial distribution when all you know is the net amount less taxes?&nbsp; Here's an example:&nbsp; John wants to receive NET $10,000 from his investments with 22% withheld for Federal Taxes, what
 is his GROSS distribution before taxes?&nbsp; It's not a simple 122% increase (which would equal gross $12,200).&nbsp; Because when you take a gross distribution of $12,200 with 22% ($2,684) for taxes you get a net distribution of $9,516,&nbsp; NOT the NET $10,000 that John
 wants.&nbsp; The calculation is a circular calculation because it's based on the gross amount and that is the unknown.&nbsp; Can you help me?&nbsp; Is there a calculation/formula in Excel for this issue?</p>

<br />Instead of clicking that cell, double click the cell, so you get a flashing cursor, then paste that list into the cell

<h2>            skype &#34;echo123&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I logged into live mail today to my surprise and dismay a new contact appeared "Skype echo123". To add insult to injury, this unwanted &amp; unsolicited contact cannot be deleted !&nbsp; Thanks a bunch MSN :-(&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I vaguely remember creating a Skype account about 7 years ago and never using it.&nbsp; I really don't like when programs make up their own mind to do something on my computer without my permission.&nbsp; MSN is getting really good at doing that (ala win10 with the
 never ending upgrade scheduling which can't be turned off).&nbsp; I tried it, did not like it and reverted back to 8.1 but the forced upgrade scheduling&nbsp;appears permanent. Again, no user control allowed.</p>
<p>I researched how to close a Skype account and that system is rigged to make it almost impossible by the demands it presents in order to close.&nbsp; Don't bother calling support it is a waste of time. &nbsp;In&nbsp; other words, MSN basically sets a policy for Skype which
 is tantamount to ..... "we don't really care what you want so screw off".&nbsp; I unlinked my hotmail spam account from Skype but still cannot delete the echo contact entry. &nbsp;Anyone who has any real solutions to this would be welcome to hear from.&nbsp; I have been
 using MSN since the dos prompt days and really find it ever increasing compulsive control nonsense to be getting way over the top.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the issue description I understand that you are facing multiple issues like you are unable to delete contact from Skype account, Unable to disable windows 10 notification prompt, you also tried to delete Skype account but not able to do so ,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For windows 10 notification</strong> try these steps and see if you are able to stop notification for windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To remove the Win10&nbsp; notification go to Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the left top side you will see “view installed updates” Click that</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the search window (upper right side) paste KB3035583</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Right click KB3035583 and click uninstall</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will have to restart your computer</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For Skype account</strong>&nbsp;I would suggest you to follow the suggestions mentioned in following link and see if it helps
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thanks for trying. I removed KB3035583 weeks ago and the prompt to upgrade still happens and I get to put it off for two days.&nbsp; And another two days. And another two days....................ad infinitum apparently.</p>
<p>As to the Skype echo123 showing up in my live mail contacts unsolicited and undeletable, (not in my Skype contacts because I have none) - I don't use Skype. &nbsp;The link you offered has no solution to that issue.</p>

            <p>There are different approaches you could employ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One option would be to perform a loop over the recordset and output the content as you require.</p>

 access to that account because i really need to delete some social media accounts of mine and other stuff.&nbsp;

<p>To close a Skype account, it must be associated with a Microsoft account before they can be closed. However, I have checked your account, it seems that your old Skype account is now linked to a Microsoft account. Because of that, closing your old Skype account
 will also close your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we can do in order to close your old Skype account was to move it to a different Microsoft account if it's already linked.
<strong>Take note </strong>that we only allow you to move your Skype account one time, so it's important that you verify the Microsoft account you want to use before getting started. You won't be able to merge your Skype account with a Microsoft account that
 is already linked to another Skype account, or has existing Skype Credit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Activate my Office 2016 Product</h2>
                    <p>I originally installed Office 2016 for Mac on an older MacBook Pro. I had issues with the hard drive cable on that computer and before then I did a completely fresh install of the OS and all the apps. Eventually I purchased a new MBP and installed Office
 for Mac 2016 on it. The software then refused to register coming up with this error instead...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The key associated with this account and product has been activated on another machine, or reactivated on this machine too many times, please choose another if available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calling into Microsoft Office Support was a complete waste of time as their only solution to this issue was for me to buy another license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support at Microsoft is the ABSOLUTE WORST SUPPORT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED in all my 23 years in technical support. It's like I was talking to a mindless parrot that wouldn't budge on this issue. They where even so kind as to escalate it to level 2 support
 tech who called me back and then told me that I needed to buy a new license to fix this! Eventually she said she needed to look something up and would call me back, but of course never did. It was just a way to get me off the call, but by that time I was exhausted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There actually is a support page that talks about what to do if you buy a new computer. It's hidden away so that it's difficult to find, but it's there. Here's the text...</p>
<p>"Office 2016 for Mac: One-time purchase or HUP install<br />
If you bought a one-time purchase of Office 2016 for Mac or received it through the Home Use Program, you're allowed only one install of Office 2016 for Mac and you can't deactivate it in the same way you may do an Office 365 license. If you need to switch
 your copy of Office 2016 for Mac to a different computer, you can do so over the phone. Contact Microsoft support."</p>

<p>
</p><p>My thought is that since I haven't purchased a product since November of 2015, I'm not going to get any service. Microsoft's answer to my issue is always the same, buy a new key. No one is willing to help simply because I'm not a yearly subscriber. I'll
 be signing up for the class-action lawsuit when it's filed.</p>

<p>There is a contradiction in your message that needs to be resolved first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the one hand, you say your are using a product key to activate Microsoft Office. A product key is given to purchasers of perpetual licenses. This implies you purchased a perpetual license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, you also say "<span>I'm a yearly subscriber</span>", which implies you purchased a one-year Office 365 subscription. When you have an Office 365 subscription, you manage it through an on-line administration
 portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your purchase would be for one or the other, so the first step in trying to help you would be for you to tell us exactly what you purchased, as the activation steps are different for each kind of license.</p>

<p>As an update to this issue I received a call today, April 11 2018, regarding this issue. I was told once again that I would need to purchase a new product key. There was nothing that the development team could do about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really burns me up the most is that Microsoft is checking to see if the product is installed on more than one computer. If it finds that it has been installed more than once then the key is disabled. What they should be doing is checking to see if the
 product is already registered and put up a warning saying that it's already installed somewhere else, uninstall it first before activating it here. Instead they note the second installation and just kill your purchase. Even Adobe doesn't stoop that low!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm done with Micro$oft. This experience has turned me into an advocate against them. I've downloaded Open Office which works fine for my needs.</p>

<p>Hi ddanis</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't work for Microsoft and can rely only on what is in this thread here. The case number doesn't help me, as I have no access to any of Microsoft's internal stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the product information - you have a perpetual license of Office 2016, not a subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears you replaced the hard drive. I know that the licensing check will consider the new hard drive to be a new computer. At one time Microsoft was very loose about the number of times you can install their software, but thanks to piracy, they have
 really clamped down. When 2011 was around, if a hard drive was replaced, you could call support and they would usually provide a new product key. With Office 2016, they don't do that any more, based on the comments I've read here in the forum and in news articles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution that Microsoft Officers is an Office 365 subscription. With a subscription, you get a portal site where you can manage your office licenses yourself. Subscribers never have this license issue when replacing hard drives or even entire machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Licensing problems such as yours is a big reason why Office 2019 will be offered only as subscription for retail customers. Only IT shops will be provided with a stand-alone version that doesn't have feature upgrades during its life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For light-duty users of Microsoft Office, there is a free on-line version of Microsoft Office at
<a href="http://onedrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive.com.</a></p>
<p>The free version has been gradually becoming more robust. If you haven't used it in a while, give it a try. Before paying for Microsoft Office, I always suggest giving the free version a try. It might be all you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LibreOffice is a good substitute for light-duty users of Microsoft Office. It is not web-based like free Microsoft Office, and it has the ability to work with many current Office Open standard file formats like .xlsx .docs and .pptx. LibreOffice even has
 some limited VBA macro support in calc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple's Pages, Numbers and Keynote are good software programs with compatibility with standard formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scrivener is a good specialty word processor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the free TextEdit program that comes with Mac OS is a good text editor and can work with Word documents (at least the text parts of them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks Jim Gordon for your reply. Unfortunately, you are missing the point entirely of my question and rant. I've already purchased this product and I simply want it to work. I really don't care about the 'rules' that Microsoft has created to prune valid
 license keys of Office 2016, I simply want what I purchased to work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft keeps track of installations, but they they do it in a disingenuous way. If they detect that the program is installed on more than one system then the key is disabled and you are forced to buy it again. They are watching, but they aren't acting
 in a way that helps the user. Rather than disable the key immediately, Microsoft should put a warning up or not allow activation until all other activations are logged out. Their approach is one where where they are just waiting for the user to make a mistake
 and then punish them for it. Even Adobe isn't that bad!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I'm using Apple Pages now for all my word processing, I always have. Apple isn't a dick about this stuff; they're not skulking around waiting for me to screw up and install the program on more than one system. I only purchased Office to be more
 seamless with others who use that program. No longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm done with Microsoft and I will <strong>NEVER</strong> purchase another product from that company again!</p>

<p>As I said, before all support ended for Office 2011, Microsoft would issue a new product key in your situation. Because all support is over, this option is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can purchase brand new keys for about $25 on eBay and other sites. At least you don't have to pay full price for the discontinued product.</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just got a new laptop with Windows 10. I downloaded the .exe to install but when the box came up asking for my product key there is nowhere to enter it and no way of proceeding with the installation. The box won't enlarge or offer me any options.

            <p>Thank you for your answers, I should have updated this before.</p>
<p>In the end I used the chat function to contact Microsoft. To my great surprise they were really helpful and once I let them take control of my screen (with full permissions and explanation) and sorted out the install. There were a couple of compatibility
 settings that need to be changed. </p>
<p>As I said, surprised and pleased that they are still supporting Office 2007!</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned, you use your Microsoft email to sign in to Skype which cause for your contacts and other information to disappear. If you will use a different credential to sign in to Skype it will create a new account. This account is different from
 your original Skype account, therefore, your contacts and other information will not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to rectify this, you should sign in using the correct. To find your username, please refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to our <a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Problems signing in</span></a><strong>
</strong>page.</li><li>Enter your email address or phone number and select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important note</strong>: When entering your phone number, be sure to enter it with no spaces or dashes (example: 12223334444).</li><li>We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address or phone number.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If there are multiple results, try accessing the accounts one by one.</p>

            <p>Hi ChrisMUY,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you’re using SMTP Relay to let the application to send emails. In Office 365, there’re three ways to achieve that. Please refer to this article:

<p>Which method are you using?</p>
