    <title>How to automate Microsoft Word tasks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to automate Microsoft Word tasks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am in need of a way to automate MS Word for Mac 2011 tasks... e.g. doing the same sequence of find/replace on many documents. I'm trying to work with Applescript, but have not been successful, and wonder what Microsoft recommends for doing this? I've also
 not had success loading Visual Basic, which apparently did not get installed, and wondered if switching over to Office 365 would make any of this easier?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 partial search</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2016 and I am amazed that I cannot search partial words. If is search for "oneword" it will&nbsp; only return results that start with "oneword", but ignores "typeoneword". My business requires me to search frequently by only partial information,
 I understand that I can go through the following steps to search partial terms, but it seems way too awkward and takes too much time. Does anyone know an addin, extension or any other solution so that I can search partial terms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current (Awkward) steps.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Mike,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Outlook 2016 will execute a partial word search only if the search sting is at the beginning of the word. For example, in a word called ‘Melbourne’, Outlook 2016 will be able to
 search the word if the search string is something like ‘Melb’ or Melbour’ etc. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the search sting is in the middle of a word or at the end of a word, Outlook 2016 will not be able to search the word.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do a partial search for a search string in the middle of the word or at the end of the word, you need to use Advanced Find option in Outlook 2016. Follow these steps to execute
 a partial search in Outlook 2016 based on Advanced Find. However, this is the only option in Outlook 2016 to execute a partial search.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click inside the search box in Outlook 2016.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on <strong>Search Tools &gt; Advanced Find &gt; Advanced</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on <strong>Field &gt; Frequently-used fields</strong> <strong>&gt; Subject</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on <strong>Add to List</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may select the search string and click on New Search to execute a partial search.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

    <title>Complaint against a Microsoft Consumer Escalations representative - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjubinville  say:</h3>
<h2>            Complaint against a Microsoft Consumer Escalations representative</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>I have been trying to find someone to deal with complaints regarding an issue I had. I am thankful my issue is now fixed as of yesterday, but not before I asked the Microsoft Consumer Escalations rep (Joe) to refer my case to someone else no less than 3
 times and asked for his supervisor 3 times. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The representatives I spoke with tonight, Marife V; a very nice chat representative directed me to call another representative from accounts and billing. This representative Sam,(she was okay), told me that there is no formal email or phone number for complaints
 and to post something on this site. To add merit to my complaint I also wanted a "supervisor" to see the exchanges with Joe and I, so Sam told me I could post the email exchange on here as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To be clear, my complaint is against Joe and the way he dealt with the situation. He did seemingly solve my problem (dating back to May 25ish), but not before I lost a lot of respect for Microsoft's product support. Joe might be good at what he does, but I
 strongly believe he should NOT be addressing the public directly and his lack of "bed side manner" has much to be desired!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Following is the email exchange with Joe.</p>

I've got word back that your account is now fixed. &nbsp;Please visit http://office.com/myaccount and see check for me please.<br />
<br />
I do not have supervisor contact information to provide to you. &nbsp;This is Microsoft Consumer Escalations.<br />

Hello Joe,<br />
<br />
Your response is not acceptable. This is now the third time I ask to be referred to someone else and now the second to a supervisor, this will be the last. &nbsp;Let me be clear; I want the contact information of your supervisor. Nothing else.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no desire to waste any more time going back and forth with you getting the same response. I also have no intention of creating a new account and transferring over my emails and documents to solve your problem.<br />
<br />
Once again, I am done reply to you, the only response I require from you is the information of a supervisor.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

S,<br />
<br />
I received your case in reference to your account. &nbsp;We are still working to fix it. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I do not have a timeframe on when it will be fixed but hopefully soon. &nbsp;However, if you want to create a new account to use, I can send you a new O365 subscription
 token to redeem so you can use it. &nbsp;If not, then we will continue to work to fix your current account.<br />

<br />
Can you refer me someone else,<br />
<br />
Clearly you keep sending me the same email over and over. You have been late numerous times with your "in case I don't hear back from you" responses and my patience is at an end! This considering I have been paying for a product since May that I cannot use.
 &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would like the contact information of your supervisor as it is clear nothing is being done from your side.<br />

Hello Joel,<br />
<br />
Can you please escalate this to your manager or the next tier of support. It has been over a month (My first call regarding these issues was made on May 27) and I keep just getting the same cut and paste response from you. I am paying for a service I have yet
 been able to use!<br />

I would appreciate some resolution as soon as possible.<br />

<br />
Any luck on this issue?<br />
<br />
I still do not have access to the "My Account" page of office.microsoft.com. &nbsp;When can I reasonably expect this to be fixed?<br />

Thank you<br />

Hello Joel,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am still getting the error. I can use everything associated with this account normally. I can log in and use my email and one drive. My issue is in the screen below in particular, in the office.microsoft.com site. &nbsp;After i click on the My account (or am directed
 to my account) link I log in normally and I get the following error. Note the string is not always the same. Also note I have tried this on several different computers on 3 different browsers on 2 different networks and I always get the same error.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what else I can do.<br />
<br />
Please advise if you have any ideas.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
S<br />

<h2>            Word 2016 slow in switching documents</h2>
                    Hey,<br />
<br />
Lately word has been slow for me in switching screens. It takes about six seconds to change from another program to word, or to change from one document to the other. One week ago this happened nearly instantly. I only have the plugin for Zotero in word and
 don't have anything else running in the background.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any idea how I could fix this?&nbsp;

<h2>            Office 365 - Create Copy and Send to a seperate location &#40;through Send Connector&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible in Office 365 to create a rule to create a copy of an email and then send that copy to another location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see this is possible by creating a rule to BCC the email to a mailbox, then another rule for that mailbox to send all emails through a Send Connector. Although this rewrites thes the To address to that BCC address, whereas I want to maintain the orginal
 To address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be the best way of going about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, please confirm if the following is your scenario and requirement:</span></p>
<p><span>Suppose the original sender is A and the recipient is B, you want to Bcc a particular message or all messages from A to C, then C sends all the emails receives to D. Meanwhile, you want to maintain
 the To address as B. Am I right?</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, please check the steps below to see if they can meet your requirements:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Set a transport rule to Bcc the messages to C. To do it, sign into Exchange admin center (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp</a>) with your Office 365
 admin account. In <strong>Mail Flow</strong>, click<strong> + </strong>to <strong>
Create a new rule…</strong>, select <strong>More options.</strong> Set <strong>Apply this rule if...
</strong>– <strong>the recipient is this person</strong> and select the B. Set <strong>
Do the following...</strong> – <strong>Add recipient to the Bcc box </strong>and select C.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Set an inbox for C to redirect all messages to D. To do it, in Exchange admin center, click your picture on the upper right corner of the page and select
<strong>Another user </strong>and double click C. Navigate to<strong> organize email – Inbox rules</strong>. Click + to create a new rule as
<strong>After the message arrives and...Apply to all messages, Do the following...redirect the message to D</strong>, click
<strong>Save </strong>at last.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above cannot meet your requirements, please tell us your detailed requirements with examples and confirm the information below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. By saying “another rule for that mailbox to send all emails through a Send Connector”, can you please confirm how you create the rule and the send connector?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What do you mean by “Although this rewrites thes the To address to that BCC address”? Please give us the relevant screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your time.</span></p>

                    <p>Every week I get a call from Geeksquad saying I have some kind of malicious spyware or virus on my computer - I think they mention Microsoft somewhere in there.&nbsp; I just cut them off and tell them not to call again.&nbsp; Does anyone anything about this?&nbsp; Is it
 ligit?&nbsp; I have several computers so I don't even know which one they are calling about, but I suspect it is the one with Windows Vista.&nbsp; My anti-virus protections says I am fine.</p>

<h2>            Currently Running App&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Just wondering if&nbsp;there was a App or something for the Windows Phone where you can view what apps are currently running. In my previous phones (mainly Nokia) when a App or something was left open it displayed a grey circle in the top corner of the stuff
 that was running.In the Windows Phone&nbsp;for example if i open IE and go to facebook, then press the "Home" button it takes me back to the home screen, but i go back to IE, Facebook is still running. Is there a true way to "Exit" things.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense</p>

<p>Hi Crampz,</p>
<p>It makes sense when I see where you comming from. HOWEVER, Windows Phone 7 does not allow multitasking for non-OS applications. This means as soon as a third party application is out of sight, it is in the fridge of the OS. So you don't have to worry about
 your device slowing down. To be honest, it is extremely fast.</p>

<h2>            Word 2007 cannot find the the data source &#40;an excel spreadsheet&#41;</h2>
                    Word 2007 cannot find the the data source (an excel spreadsheet) when the files are residing in an external network drive. &nbsp;If I move both documents to a local drive, word opens the document and links it to the spreadsheet with no problem. &nbsp;Otherwise I
 get an error message that starts with a hex number, i.e., "7CFE5F11 is a mail merge main document. &nbsp;Word cannot find its data source, S:\...\document name (S:\ is my NAS drive).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So every time I need to use both documents together I have to reconnect them again manually. &nbsp;BTW, I am connecting both documents using MS Excel Worksheet via DDE (.xls)</div>

<p>Hi blubal42, this is a problem with Firefox 58.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you hide the Reading pane,</em> so Outlook opens messages in place of the Inbox (or other folder), after opening and closing a couple messages, the mouse pointer starts behaving oddly: wherever there is sender name text or subject line text "behind"
 the message, the mouse pointer operates as though the message were not there and clicks are instead sent to the message list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mozilla developers are working on a fix for this. Until then, some workarounds:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Turn on the Reading pane. Best suited to wide displays.</li><li>Use the "Try the beta" switch above the Inbox to switch to the beta layout.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If neither of those suits you, try to avoid closing messages. Instead, you can navigate up and down the message list in the folder from the current open message using the up and down arrows above the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the problem strikes, you can temporarily restore normal mouse behavior by using zoom.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows: Ctrl+ or Ctrl+ or hold Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel forward or backwards one click.
</li><li>Mac: Command+ or Command+ or hold Command and scroll the mouse wheel forward or backwards one click.
</li></ul>
<p>This is only good until you close the message and open the next one, so works best in conjunction with the previous suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you reload the Inbox (using the Reload button on the toolbar), that will reset back to the beginning (working for the first message or two).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong></p>
<p>
This is another potential workaround:
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Change a Firefox setting</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the full consequences of this change; if you try it, I'm interested in your feedback. What is meant to do is switch Firefox back to laying out pages on live.com (including outlook.live.com) the way they were in Firefox 56 and earlier. If you
 want to try it, here's how:</p>
<p>
(A) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful or accepting the risk.<br />
<br />
(B) In the search box above the list, type or paste <strong>stylo</strong> and pause while the list is filtered<br />
<br />
(C) Double-click the <strong>layout.css.stylo-blocklist.enabled</strong> preference to switch the value from false to true<br />
<br />
(D) Double-click the <strong>layout.css.stylo-blocklist.blocked_domains</strong> preference and set the value to
<strong>live.com</strong> and click OK. (In the unlikely event that you already had one or more sites listed add
<strong>,live.com</strong> to the list.)<br />
<br />
Then exit/quit Firefox and start it up again to make the change effective.

<p>When you say they are listed, what do you mean? On the Recently Used list?</p>
<p>If you renamed them in windows you would still see them in Excel on the Recent Files list but those listing would be to the old files.</p>
<p>Choose File, Open and look in the appropriate folder.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Try opening the Windows explorer and going to the appropriate folder and opening it from there.</p>

<h2>            page numbering a mail merge document with an envelope</h2>
                    I am working with MS Word 2010, when I create a new or even work with an existing mail merge document that includes an envelope, also mail merged naturally, the envelope in previous editions was 'page 0' but in Word 2010 it is now 'page 1' that makes the
 first page of my document 'page 2' and the 2nd page of my document 'page 3' which is how the page numbering comes out.&nbsp; How can I revert back to the old Word 7 page numbering format?

That was done, but as my question stated, MS Word 2010 running in MS Windows 8 functions differently than MS Word 2007 running in Windows XP. &nbsp;ALL pages in the document, INCLUDING the envelope, show up as 'pages' so even following MS's directions which are
 yours quote-for-quote, does not change my results.

            Neither Word 2010 nor 2013 will set an added envelope as Page 1 (unless there is some unexplained oddity involved with Windows 8).

            I have tried starting fresh creating a mail merge document, adding my header and merge fields, making the document two pages and adding page numbers .... WORKS PERFECTLY .... UNTIL I add an envelope from the mail merge add envelope, then the envelope becomes
 Page 1 of 3 Pages. &nbsp;I even started with a blank envelope FIRST, did a Section/Page Break, created a blank document and the envelope still is Page 1 of 2 Pages.

<h2>            Business Contact Manager install runs - but nothing installed</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install Business Contact Manager (2010) on a Windows 10 system running SQL Server 2008 R2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation screen look as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a85b0b58-6698-4df7-bd25-cf18ce04349d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a85b0b58-6698-4df7-bd25-cf18ce04349d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how Space required on drive C states 0.0 MB? What's up with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the install begins, it finishes almost instantly, stating that BCM is installed. The software is not installed in the target directory however, nor are the Outlook add-ins available. The install basically did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thank you for the reply Sushma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I do NOT currently have BCM installed, and if I understand your reply correctly, I need to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install SQL Server Express 2012</p>
<p>2. Install BCM 2010</p>
<p>3. Install compatibility pack for Outlook 2013</p>
<p>4. Once I've confirmed BCM is working again, restore my BCM database (currently in 2008 format) to SQL Server Express 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this correct?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>FWIW, for those interested, I was finally able to get BCM 2010 working with Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up reinstalling Windows 7 (downgraded from Windows 10) and using SQL Server 2008 SP2 (in order to get the 8GB capacity offered).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I was back on Windows 7, BCM installed without a hitch.</p>

</p>
<p>regardless the default font size has already been set to "10" under "File" -&gt; "Excel Option" -&gt; "General" -&gt; "When creating new workbooks" -&gt; "font size".</p>

            Hi Paul,
<br />If you have an office 365 Business Premium account, you can use the Outlook Customer Manager - otherwise, microsoft doesn't have anything other than Dynamics, which is likely overkill and definitely not free- it's one of the pricier ones available. 
<br />
<br />There are some others that work with office 365 exchange accounts - some free for limited users or limited # of contacts. Which is best really depends on your needs. 
<br />
<br />If you use a pop or imap account, do you want a local database or will one stored on the web work? Many of the CRM programs have moved to web hosting.  I have a list some CRMs that work with outlook at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/addins/contact-tools/outlook-contact-management-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/addins/contact-tools/...</a>

<p>Thanks Diane. I have Office 365 Home Premium. I'm thinking of upgrading to Business Premium. For peace of mind, less labour, and lack of headaches, would you recommend I do that to get Outlook Customer Manager instead of piloting a lot of other apps? It's
 only about a $150 more Canadian annually for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another big issue - I'm a startup, and very few of my existing Outlook contacts are clients or prospects. The vast majority of people I need to track, create notes for, categorize as different types of leads, calendarize, etc., are on LinkedIn. I
 need to know if&nbsp; Outlook Customer Manager will work well with mass contact imports from LinkedIn. More than business right now, I'm doing lead generation and qualification. If I have to start manually adding contacts to Outlook, it's not worth my while.</p>

<h3> raphaelechappe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does AutoSave cause Word convert all equations &#40;either via Insert --&#62; Object or with MathType&#41; to uneditable images that cannot be converted back to equations&#63;</h2>
                    I have had this problem FOR YEARS guys. Finally breaking down and posting about it. Can this be fixed? It is incredibly annoying, because it means that I have to work without the auto-save feature (and Word does crash frequently) whenever I am writing
 a paper with equations.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I even turned off the Auto-Save feature through Preferences --&gt; Save and it turned itself back on mysteriously after I closed and reopened the document. This means all my equations got converted to an image and cannot be edited.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thoughts? Any reason this problem has not been fixed? It has existed since at least five years, from what I can tell (probably much more) and it never seems to get fixed with newer versions of the software.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am on a mac, using Word 2011, but I hear the same problem exists on the PC.</div>

</p>
<p>That article seems to exactly describe your situation including a potential solution. Read the paragraph at the bottom of the page; it mentions what to do to report your problem specifically through Microsoft, but it seems it's already been reported by the
 company. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've always used the built-in equation editor in Word 2010 and 2013 and never had that problem with any of the auto saved equations. Does the built-in equation editor lack functionality you need?</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for this. I had actually tried the solution suggested on the link prior to writing on this board (trying to convert the equations back), but it has not worked for me. The equations are stuck as non-editable image. In any event, one needs to turn
 auto-save off to avoid the ongoing conversion...</div>
<div><br />
<div>This problem has happened to me before with the equation editor function, which is precisely why I tried using a third party software in the hope it would help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue I get, with the equation editor function, is that after a while I get an error with the Auto-Save function. Specifically, it tells me my hard drive is full (even though it is not). It also converts the equations to non-editable images. Worse,
 sometimes these images are completely corrupted -- they get blurry.</div>

            Weird, I think that was a problem with the old equation editor with Word, the new one is actually quite robust, however I don't know what the differences are between Office for Mac and Office for PC. Hopefully someone else with more experience with Office
 for Mac posts more information.

            I have had exactly the same set of problems. Turning off Auto-Save means the Equations are no longer turned into illegible low-res pictures, so that's progress, but they still become non-editable pictures. It's a complete nightmare. I am creating MS Word
 files with Scrivener+MathType, and they work beautifully in Scrivener, but become non-editable pictures in Word 2011 even though I have MathType installed.

<h2>            Lumia 640 &#40;RM-1109&#41; Touch Screen problems on Windows 10, specially on UWP</h2>
                    <p>I bought this phone this month, then I used Upgrade Advisor to update to Windows 10</p>
<p>After Upgraded I noticed a degraded touch screen experience:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Lumia 640 (RM-1109) presents Touch Screen problems on Windows 10, specially on UWP apps.</strong></p>
<p><br />
The problem is <strong>annoying</strong> then I had to restore to Windows 8.1.<br />
</p>
<p>Lumia support on Twitter, in English, and Brazil, could not help, and denies the knowledge of this problem.</p>

    <title>Inline embedded images do not show in outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john bown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inline embedded images do not show in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>This issue has been raised over several years, but it still has not been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTML emails with embedded images do not show the image when viewed on outlook.com (using either Edge or Chrome, or presumably any other browser). The same emails show the image correctly on numerous other email clients including Outlook 2016 for PC, Outlook
 for Android, Gmail online (mail.google.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 'Forward' option is chosen from the 'Reply' dropdown menu, then the images are shown as expected, so there is nothing wrong with the emails. It is clearly a bug in outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To anyone at Microsoft: Is this an acknowledged bug, and is there an ETA for a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry for the long delay.</p>
<p>After a lot of investigating, I updated to the 'latest' outlook.com, having been prompted to do so for some time. It appears that the problem is now finally resolved, and embedded images now display as expected.</p>

<h2>            N73 Display Brightness issues</h2>
                    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Can you look at the bottom of the your n73 screen and see if the intensity of the screen is somewhat darker in some areas... (its not that noticeable but there none-the-less) On mine there are something like three darker sections... you have to tilt the phone
 towards you to see it. Was just wondering whether all of the phones were like this... cheers!<br />
<br />
Would greatly appreciate your replies... please!<br />

            Are you serious? Is this a complaint or are you just wondering if it's on all of them? I mean, seriously, you can't see them unless you're really looking. Probably just from the location of the backlighting or something.

            yes, i am serious ;) I was just wondering if all the phones had it, or if mine was faulty and warranted taking it to a service centre. Thats all!<br />
<br />

<br />
when you turn power on, did you see the yellow color on above or bottom of Nokia's word on the display/screen or not?

<h2>            Problems opening email messages in Outlook Live web mail</h2>
                    <p>This problem started within the past few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook Live web mail if I open an email and then go to open another email it stays stuck on the first email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp; tried clearing cookies/history/cache fir all time and restarting the computer. The problem manifests itself across multiple computers and browser products (Edge, Chrome, Opera). Gmail works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Harry in Washington state</p>

            Because of the timing of this I'm wondering if it's tied to recent Windows patching and updates.

</p><blockquote>I have the same problem not able to open Email. It just goes back to my other Emails setting in the inbox .<br />

<p>Hi Mick in the box, do you use Firefox? Is the problem that you click a message in the list, it displays, but the mouse does not behave normally in the message, it returns you to the message list when you click?<br />
<br />
For that problem: the developers are working on a fix, but it could be 1-3 weeks before it is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Workarounds</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Until then, consider one of these three options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Use the Reading Pane</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only occurs when the message replaces the message list. If you have a wide screen, you can show the Reading Pane to the right of the message list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08632bd4-5b14-4488-83f0-225a784bb6b0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<p>
</p><p><em>Use the Beta layout</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem does not occur with the new layout. You can slide the "Try the beta" switch above the Inbox to check it out. If you don't like it, it's equally easy to switch back.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/193ac2bf-c2ed-4387-b30f-b63741407407?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/193ac2bf-c2ed-4387-b30f-b63741407407?upload=true" height="192" width="352" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Change a Firefox setting</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the full consequences of this change; if you try it, I'm interested in your feedback. What it's meant to do is switch Firefox back to laying out pages on live.com (including outlook.live.com) the way they were in Firefox 56 and earlier. If you
 want to try it, here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(A) In a new tab, type or paste <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful or accepting the risk.<br />
<br />
(B) In the search box above the list, type or paste <strong>stylo</strong> and pause while the list is filtered<br />
<br />
(C) Double-click the <strong>layout.css.stylo-blocklist.enabled</strong> preference to switch the value from false to true<br />
<br />
(D) Double-click the <strong>layout.css.stylo-blocklist.blocked_domains</strong> preference and set the value to
<strong>live.com</strong> and click OK. (In the unlikely event that you already had one or more sites listed add
<strong>,live.com</strong> to the list.)<br />
<br />
Then exit/quit Firefox and start it up again to make the change effective.</p>
<p>
