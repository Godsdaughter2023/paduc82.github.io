    <title>Does MSFT sell product keys w&#47;o COA&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does MSFT sell product keys w&#47;o COA&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am sure there have been many questions about Windows 7 keys on ebay.&nbsp; I have been searching for answers to a specific question
 about buying product keys from MSFT.&nbsp; When you buy a product key from MSFT will it always come with the COA sticker?&nbsp; I see so many ebay sellers with Windows 7 product keys for sale.&nbsp; I have only had one person who admitted to selling MSDN keys on ebay.&nbsp; The
 others claim they buy directly from MSFT.&nbsp; However when I ask if they will send the COA out in the mail the answer is always no, or they will be shredded.&nbsp; I had one other person admit they were OEM system builder keys, still would not mail out the COA sticker.&nbsp;
 Now I am pretty sure an OEM key comes with a COA sticker and must stay with the hardware it is intended for.&nbsp; An example would be buying components at the local store and a copy of OEM software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have also heard discussions use the argument of cost to explain why something on ebay must be illegal.&nbsp; I don't buy it.&nbsp; It is possible for someone to sell something for much less than a retail store.&nbsp; They may not have employees to pay, a store front to
 maintain, and everything that goes with running a business and wanting high profit percentages.&nbsp; I argue it is very possible to sell the license to software much cheaper than retail MSRP.&nbsp; If you do it to make extra money outside of your regular job.&nbsp; If you
 don't have to pay for a store front or web site.&nbsp; If you don't have to pay employees, etc.&nbsp; All you have to do is sit home and use ebay and pay your taxes.&nbsp; I argue it is very possible to sell below MSRP.<br />
<br />
So that is the big question.&nbsp; Does MSFT ever sell a product key without the COA sticker?&nbsp; I am excluding MSDN subscriptions, just talking about MSFT products meant to be sold to users for home use not development, research or anything like that.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only time I have ever bought directly from MSFT is when I am on campus as a guest and go to the store.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is just like buying retail, and there is a shiny COA sticker on the box.<br />
<br />
thank you<br />

            Hi KoolAide<br />
<br />
Here is the official information.<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">COA INFORMATION</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/content.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;pg=coa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Tell: Certificate Of Authenticity</a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>What is a Certificate of Authenticity (COA)?</span></span></span></p>
<span><span>A Certificate of Authenticity (COA) is a label that helps you identify genuine Microsoft software. A COA is not
 a software license – it is a visual identifier that assists in determining whether or not the Microsoft software you are running is genuine. However, without it, you will not have a legal license to run Microsoft software. A COA should never be purchased by
 itself without the software it authenticates.</span></span><br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Q.
<span><span>When I purchase OEM Windows from a reseller, what should I receive?</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A. Genuine OEM Windows desktop operating system software is designed exclusively for computer manufacturers to pre-install on their
 computers. Genuine OEM software always comes with a Certificate of Authenticity (the OEM COA is different from an orange retail proof of license label) and a manual or Quick Start guide. Some major manufacturers provide an OEM disc for re-installing programs,
 while smaller manufacturers are required to provide a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/category.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;cID=ea710cad-37b0-4975-bcd6-abfee19961df" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>Microsoft Windows edge-to-edge hologram disc</span></span></a>. OEM software cannot be downloaded and may not be unbundled or re-bundled from sources other than the OEM selling you
 the computer. Visit our <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/content.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;pg=counterfeit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/genuine</span></span></a>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The license agreement that accompanies an OEM pack is very clear. Only System Builders can legally purchase an OEM version of Windows.
 This purchase comes with an agreement that defines how the software can be used.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Go to the following website, select your language, and download the System Builder license agreement.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>About Downloadable Software.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>With Downloadable Software, the files of a software product are delivered to your computer over the Internet. State of the
 art mechanisms help insure that the files you download that arrive on your computer are the same as they were when they left the Microsoft server.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Benefits</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may be more familiar with packaged software on CDs or DVDs, but there are a lot of benefits to downloading software
 instead.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Your software is available immediately.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>When you buy software on CDs or DVDs, you are advised to make backup discs in case you lose or damage the original discs.
 With electronic software delivery, your backups are maintained on-line. If you lose your hard drive or have other problems, you can just download your software again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Returns are easier, and there is nothing for you to mail back.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Downloading software is more environmentally-friendly and saves energy and resources by eliminating the need for product
 packaging and shipping.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Long Download Availability</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Downloadable software consists of two parts: 1) a product key and 2) the software files:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Product keys are kept with your order information in your Account.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Software files are available immediately after you purchase, and will continue to be available until Microsoft ends Mainstream
 Support for your product. Mainstream Support typically ends <em><span style="font-style: italic">five years</span></em> after a product is released.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For example, if you purchase the Windows Vista and Office 2007 products, Microsoft Store will make them available for downloading
 until April 2012. You can continue using these products after this date, but you will not be able to download the software files again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><span>Note: See the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifePolicy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Flight Simulator X doesn&#39;t run in Full screen mode</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: FSX Improper Flight Screen Size Screen </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just installed&nbsp;Flight Simulator X Gold Edition w/the acceleration expansion pack in Win 8.1, 64-bit. This is a new i7, HD computer.&nbsp;Everything working all right when I launch FSX, best as I can tell; except for one thing. My flight screen is kind of small.
 Flight screen does not fill up the whole 17" monitor. I have a screen that&nbsp;is not the correct screen size. There are on each side of the viewable&nbsp;screen black indents about 2" each with the flight screen sandwiched in between these black borders. How can I
 only get a full 17" flight screen when in FSX. The screens prier to the flight seem to look all right.</p>
<p>I even went so as to uninstall FSX and the Acceleration pack and reinstall, but got the same thing again.</p>
<p>Outside of the game, everything is great, on the Internet, programs and desktop. I have a good full HD screen.
</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance concerning this matter.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the game doesn’t support the graphics properties on the screen resolution that is currently set on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as compatibility of the game is concerned, it’s compatible with Windows 8.1. Refer to the link to check out the details regarding the same:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft+Flight+Simulator+X%3a+Acceleration&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033%2c2057%2c3081%2c4105%2c16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=10&amp;BreadCrumbPath=microsoft+flight+simulator+x%3a+acceleration&amp;LastSearchTerm=microsoft%2bflight%2bsimulator%2bx%253a%2bacceleration&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows+8.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft+Flight+Simulator+X%3a+Acceleration&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033%2c2057%2c3081%2c4105%2c16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=10&amp;BreadCrumbPath=microsoft+flight+simulator+x%3a+acceleration&amp;LastSearchTerm=microsoft%2bflight%2bsimulator%2bx%253a%2bacceleration&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows+8.1</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the kind of video card and monitor that you are using, you can run Flight Simulator X at different screen resolutions. The software runs at a minimum screen resolution of 1024 × 768. As you increase resolution to see more detail, you may notice
 a decrease in performance.</p>
<p>The video cards on some portable computers may let you select a resolution that is larger than the LCD device can support. In these cases, the view may be truncated when you run Flight Simulator in full-screen mode. To see the full-screen image, either reduce
 the resolution or use windowed mode (press <strong>ALT+ENTER</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link to change the screen resolution:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Set your monitor to its native resolution</strong>”</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn’t help, you can check if the game’s icon properties is set to run the game in normal mode. Right Click on Microsoft Flight Simulator X icon on the desktop and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. Go to run and check if it’s set to run in Normal mode. If yes, run in maximized mode and check if it fixes the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you can contact Microsoft Flight Simulator technical support team:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need any other assistance on Windows. </p>

<p>I've run system repair, but the PC doesn't recognize a problem, as per definition, the startup-sequence is working as it should.</p>
<p>I've run Safe modes in order to check if I can access earlier system restore points, but as windows explorer isn't running no actions can be taken. That is safe mode; Basic drivers, and basic drivers with network connection.</p>

<h2>            Wifi Option Gone</h2>
                    My wifi isn't working and the option for it under the network setting is gone. What do I do. This happened before and I can't remember how it got fixed but I believe updating it was part of the process. But with no internet I can't update. Please help!!

<h2>            Screen Time in Microsoft Family Parental Controls Windows 10</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi!&nbsp; A user asked a specific question that has not yet been answered.&nbsp; I have the same question.&nbsp; Does Screen Time begin counting only when my child explicitly logs into the computer?&nbsp; More importantly, does the Screen Time counter stop when the computer
 sleeps, hibernates, and/or goes to screen saver?&nbsp; As with the earlier user, Screen Time seems much much longer than the actually amount of time my child sat in front of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the Screen Time calculator continue measuring even if the computer is sleeping or when laptop computer cover is closed?</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I already know <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">how</span> to set up all the parental controls. &nbsp;However, the link you sent me did not answer my basic question: &nbsp;How is screen time measured? &nbsp;Must my child always log in and out for an accurate recording
 of the amount of screen time? &nbsp;If the laptop sleeps or hibernates, does the screen time counter stop/pause? &nbsp;How about if the display defaults to screen saver?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 controller for windows</h2>
                    Hi, I got a xbox 360 controller. It does connect to my windows 10 64bit, but its lights are all blinking green together. When I push the analog stick on the controller, the arrow key moves. Changed the battery but it did not work. Since all lights are
 blinking together, the control do not for for the games. Thanks

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Charge Port damaged</h2>
                    <p>Today I noticed that I have been doing damage to the Surface Pro 3 charge port with the docking station. Over time it has gotten bent pins or such and is now non-functional. My warranty died 17 days ago.</p>
<p>I am willing to buy the part, though to get support from Microsoft I must pay $99.00 which I am not willing to do, especially if they are just going to tell me "too bad".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could use help finding the correct part, I do not like to buy parts over ebay unless I absolutely have to.</p>

            That does not give me much hope for utilizing said products in the future. Guess if I can't keep the warranty up to date then I should expect it to die shortly after it expires.

<br />When you refer to the upgrade assistant is this Windows update or a tool? If a tool is there a reason why the normal Windows update can’t download the update?
<br />Have you tried updating via the Media Creation tool instead of the upgrade assistant? You run a repair install which will upgrade you to the latest version.

            I had the same problem you need to go into your BIOS settings and click the advanced tab, then SMART settings. Disable SMART self test then your computer will update no problems.&nbsp;

<p>

<p>Hummm don't think InputMapper is related to the issue, since I know the errors from them are when I unplug the controller out of my laptop. I also have that program installed way before my audio has started going to act weird, being using it for a few years
 now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(did uninstall it btw, and see if it is gonna resolve anything or not, and check with you again later)</p>

            Windows 10 Pro can be downgraded to Windows 7 Pro but not to Windows 7 Ultimate. 
<br />But you would require to download media for Windows 7 separately. Windows 7 set up files will not be part of Windows 10 set up files.
<br />
<br />If you want to go back to Windows 7 or 8.1, use the below Microsoft Help on this. You have all options to go back to Windows 7 / 8.1 documented here 
<br />

<h2>            Black screen when booting, fans turn on, no cursor.</h2>
                    Okay, so I recently allowed Windows to update as I was shutting my computer (HP G62 Laptop) down a few days ago. The next morning I tried booting it up and It just shown a black screen, however the fans span like normal and everything sounded okay, just
 a black screen. I tried powering the laptop on 2 more times and it eventually worked, and the laptop worked normally. The next day (yesterday) I go to power up my laptop and it happens again, however it took more tries to eventually boot up the laptop, around
 4-5 tries(again, the laptop worked fine after it booted up). This morning I tried booting it up and it took around 6-7 tries to boot up, so it seems like the problem is getting worse every time I attempt to cold boot the laptop. Is there any way to fix this?

 around 4-5 tries(again, the laptop worked fine after it booted up). This morning I tried booting it up and it took around 6-7 tries to boot up, so it seems like the problem is getting worse every time I attempt to cold boot the laptop. Is there any way to
 fix this? </blockquote>

    <title>Xbox one S video format support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rve88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one S video format support</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
I might be considering the Xbox One S as I am looking for a good media player anyhow.</p>

<p>A few things I am wondering however:</p>
<p>What file types does the console support?</p>
<p>Is 4k x265 HEVC 10bit one of them?</p>

<p>I have a Samsung KS8000 4k HDR TV and playing 4k X265 10bit files gives lots of stutters. Therefore, I want to make sure the above file play smoothly without issues :)</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks!</p>

<p>I might be mistaken, but your link does not seem to be the answer to my question. I am not asking if it supports 4k and HDR, but what file types it support and more importantly if it supports 4k
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">0bit</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>X2</strong><strong>65</strong><strong> HEVC</strong> </span>formats (as well as 1080p x265 HEVC 10bit). If it doesn't support this new format, it's pretty useless as a future proof (4k) media player. :(</p>

<p>What kind of file is that derived from? I've got the same TV (KS8000) and everything I'm throwing at it works nicely, no stutters etc. (UHD BR discs, 1080p media via PLEX streaming etc.)</p>

<p>All formats play perfectly via the KS8000 default player, except any of my 4k x265 HEVC 10bit test files I downloaded. Of course I can imagine its the most advance format there is, but as its a 4k TV which supports 10bit, I would love to be able to play
 the format :(</p>

            Are you referring to system restore or Reset? 
<br />
<br />If Reset is not working, try performing a direct clean install:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Restore is the problem, not reset. However, I had a nasty crash on the last windows update and had to start up again form an old drive before I could even download any thing from Microsoft. It was very bad. You have given me some ideas, though. I will
 try sfc and then follow your advice. I will let you know how I go on.

            I would suggest you to check the status of volume shadow service. If it is not running please start it and set it to automatic. If it does not start please check the dependency services and make they all are started when you click on volume shadow service you see a dependency tab. Make sure the services under the dependency tab are up and running.
<br />
<br />Services related to System Restore are:
<br />
<br />-      Volume shadow copy
<br />
<br />-      Multimedia Class Scheduler
<br />
<br />-      Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
<br />
<br />-      DCOM Server Process Launcher
<br />
<br />-      Plug and Play.
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions below and set all of the above services to Automatic.
<br />
<br />a. Click the Start button, and in the search box type in: Services.
<br />b. Press 'Enter' to open Services window.
<br />c  Find related services that are listed above, and check the Status (started) and Startup Type (automatic).
<br />d. Double click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, try this method.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Performing a System File Checker Scan(SFC) on your computer.
<br />
<br />SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions. 
<br />
<br />Check the below link for details:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />also
<br />Check your hard disk for any errors:
<br />Click Start
<br />Type: CMD, from the results, right click Command prompt
<br />Click 'Run as Administrator'
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
<br />Hit Enter
<br />When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.

<p>Tried sfc /scannow&nbsp; but no good. Also done disk and ram checks recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, have reset windows successfully,&nbsp; (as per your colleague) but Volume shadow copy process was not running (before or after reset) so I have set it running and checked the dependencies and set them to auto as well.
</p>
<p>One problem here,&nbsp;<span>Multimedia Class Scheduler does not exist !&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>SKU is blank. It is home built, 7 years ago, but upgraded to keep it near to new.</p>
<p>Desktop, Gigabyte board, i5, 8Gb, 250GbSSD, 2Tb hard drive, Nvidia,W10 1803</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ram and drive checks were done, also reset (as your colleague advised), and sfc /scannow. All passed fine.</p>
<p>However, I lost the back audio speaker connections when I upgraded to 1803. The front panel headphones worked so I have been using them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that the back panel connections are now working again. Interesting, because previously trouble-shooter did not find the fault.</p>
<p>The drivers for audio are Microsoft and all up to date, with 5 copies, location 0,1,2,3,2. (Yes two '2's. Can't explain that.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember correctly, the drivers should have been Realtek, not Microsoft. But I could not find a Realtek update!!&nbsp; Suspicious?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I tried a Restore, but it is still not working! Missed the error code but think it was the usual 0x80070003 or 5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think it is worth going back from 1803. I am more than happy with it and there are newer tools than Restore to sort things out and I suspect Microsoft will drop it anyway, as it is no longer switched on by default.</p>

<h2>            Windows-10 Shutsdown when playing video&#39;s &#63;....</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had Windows-10 installed now since it's release. I recently did a fresh install of Win-10 64-bit with no problems.</p>
<p>Has run fine until recently. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I watch videos after about 5 minutes my computer shuts down and reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This recently started happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I think I have a memory leak because after leaving my computer on for several days my computer ends up using more and more memory. Even though I have no apps open. I have seen it utilize as much as 24gb of ram with no apps open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to reboot my computer daily in order for my computer to run okay for the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My Computer is a BEAST.</p>

    <title>No Party Chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leyvin  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Party Chat</h2>
                    
<p>Alright so, I've actually had this issue since the Xbox App launched.</p>
<p>Where I literally cannot hear anyone, or communicate with them either. </p>
<p>I've re-installed Teredo half a dozen times now. I've manually activated (and set to Automatic Start) all the Peer-to-Peer Services (which without the Windows Firewall blocks the *** signal causing a Moderate instead of Open NAT) ... the Router MTU is set
 to 1500. Due to a recent upgrade (from Virgin Media) I've now got 12 Channels Down (at 70Mbit) and 4 Channels Up (at 5.5Mbit) and I bought a new Cat6 to replace my Cat5e Cable - with no triggers occurring (i.e. blocks) from the Router/Modem.</p>
<p>I can Join or have other Join me just fine. NAT is always Open.</p>
<p>Yet still no Audio or Voice while in a Party. This extends to Fable Legends (Closed Beta) too, where I've been somewhat vocal about this on-going issue since July.</p>
<p>Now back in Build 17, there was an odd situation that on a few Quests while playing with a&nbsp;Friend; she remarked she could hear people as if they were coming from me rather than her own Xbox One. This was bizarre given I couldn't hear them, but she could.
 There was also a replicated situation where if we were on Skype, and one of us disconnected from it (calling back) during mid-game on one of these start Quests kicking her back to Game Chat; THEN I could hear people but only for that one game until we did
 the same thing again.</p>
<p>(This is Skype Video App, not Skype Desktop that I'm talking about... which I've had some weird situations where since the Late-December update mid-conversation Skype Video runs into the exact same issue where suddenly we can't hear or talk to each other
 for no reason at all. Then I won't be able to communicate via that until I sign-out and sign back in - at which point we'd either move to Skype Video/Phone on our Windows Phones or I'd boot up Skype Desktop that seems to not be afflicted in the same way)</p>
<p>Currently I'm running:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Professional 64-bit (Insider Preview) 14257<br />
Xbox App (Beta) 14.14.10005.00000</p>
<p>Audio Outputs:</p>
<p>AMD HD Audio (Radeon R7 360 TruAudio HDMI) is Communication Primary<br />
VIA Vinyl HD Audio (VT1708S) Back Panel is Main, Front Panel (also HD Audio Output) as Headphone Secondary<br />
SPDIF (TX1) unused</p>
<p>Audio Inputs:</p>
<p>Kinect for Xbox 360 (v1.0) via USB 3.0 (Primary Input v1.8 / 2.0 Drivers)<br />
Inline Headset Mic (Microsoft ... dunno what it is came with my phone, use it on my desktop sometimes) via HD Audio&nbsp;Front Panel<br />
Xbox 360 Wired Headset via Wireless Controller (Wireless Receiver)<br />
Xbox 360 Wireless Headset (Wireless Receiver)</p>
<p>These are all using the latest drivers (Crimson 15.12 / 16.1.1 for AMD | 6.0.11.0800 for VIA)</p>
<p>Outside of doing a Clean Install, which I might do anyway with the next Insider Preview Build... I'm somewhat confident at this point that my hardware and setup itself isn't the issue, rather this is more some App / Network related conflict. I do know that
 for Fable Legends (which also uses Xbox Live for cross-platform voice along side Vivox, that has RENOWN issues of this nature) there was some limited success I had to get Audio working back in Build 17 on 4 Quests; where as a stop-gap I'd talk to my friends
 playing over Skype Video. Where if we dropped the call (either accidentally or deliberately) during these specific maps (on that build) then called back I'd suddenly have the ability to hear individuals with Open NATs - I still couldn't Speak but I'd hear
 them.</p>
<p>There were also times where we had this odd (but unreplicatable) situation where certain people would come down Skype as if from my system, while I couldn't hear them myself, yet my friend could. I know that since the December update of Skype Video (basically
 when it changed it's name to that from Skype) ... I'd randomly encounter this same issue often mid-conversation where until I signed out and back in, I couldn't use it again forcing me to either revert to Skype Desktop or use my Phone. I know my friend on
 Xbox One has also had some situations where Skype itself would start but she can't call anyone or receive (instantly hang up).</p>
<p>I don't know how Skype Video works for it's Audio-Voice, but I do know it seems to be different to Skype Desktop.</p>
<p>Now obviously given Fable Legends is in closed beta I can't exactly give more precise details, and I have been complaining to them about this issue since July-August.<br />
Yet no joy on this so far (obviously). I'm not the only person suffering from this specific issue over there either; which sure Xbox Parties can live without ... essential Voice Chat in a Team-Focused Game - yeah makes me somewhat less patient about a solution
 in the pipeline. </p>
<p>I mean one thing I have noticed is sometimes in Fable Legends I'll have a Microphone Icon (but doesn't show voice activation) while other times I don't.<br />
Similar situation happens in the Xbox App, although I do always see the Headset icon, the circle around my Avatar doesn't do anything even when I'm talking; and again I can't see this happening with other peoples either.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't made any software changes, hacks, attacks, super big macs or anything remotely close to fiddling with Windows 7 so why all of a sudden has my key been blocked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My windows still works but frankly I don't like things, software especially, that doesn't work PROPERLY.&nbsp; I paid the computer shop the money for the OEM software and I have a valid key thingy stuck to the side of my computer.&nbsp; What gives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I paid for it, I want to use it... Please!</p>

<div><span>Michael, you have a Windows 7 Professional installation that is using an MSDN product key.&nbsp; This is not OEM but a special type of product that should never be sold to private individuals or with a new computer.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>You also have an installation of Office Enterprise 2007 that has an invalid VLK.&nbsp; Enterprise is again one of those types of software that should never be sold to an individual and should not have come with a computer.&nbsp; It
 is sold in quantities to corporations of at least 5 installations.&nbsp; Many pirates use this type of license to sell many more licenses than they have (and by the license terms they can't sell to individuals anyhow) so when Microsoft finally sees many more activations
 than has been issued they block the license.&nbsp; But in your case the key was created by an illegal key generator program so it is absolutely pirated and never created by Microsoft in the first place.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>You need to go back to the store in Canada and demand a full refund and/or make sure you have a legitimate license.&nbsp; I would also recommend a quick trip to the RCMP in reference to illegal sales of pirated software.</span></div>
<div><span>If you need further confirmation on either of these parts then you can post to the appropriate Genuine forum (repeating the diagnostic report) from this list:</span></div>

<p>According to the information you have provided, this is a <strong>RETAIL </strong>
license, not <strong>OEM</strong></p>
<p>Your product id: Windows Product ID: 00371-<strong>220</strong> -3802366-86953</p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, <strong>220 area for Pro</strong> and the 230, 231, 221 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
If you have a similar PID, or your key is blocked and you want confirmation post a new thread with a report from the MGADIAG tool, download and run the tool, click copy and paste it in a new post here and Darin Smith from MS can verify your key for you. NEVER
 post your key, the report will suffice.</p>
