<p>When I am send an attachment, 365, for no apparent reason is now sending it as a one drive link, asking the recipient to sign in or create an account to view. I simply want to attach files as I have always done and send them as a straightforward attachment
 to view or download.</p>

<p>Hi PhilipMacve,</p>
<p>About the one drive link, could you please share with us a screenshot for further investigation? To upload the screenshot in the forum, click&nbsp;<b>Use rich formatting</b> and then the<b> Insert/Edit Media</b> icon.</p>
<p>I also wanna confirm the following information for a better understanding of the issue. Please share them with us at your convenience.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue occur to all other users in your organization? </li><li>Is the account an Exchange online account? </li><li>Do you user Outlook client or <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a> (Outlook Web App) to send emails? If the former, share with us the detailed version and make sure it’s up to date. And we also appreciate it if you could let us know whether
 the issue occurs with OWA </li><li>Does the issue occur to all recipients (no matter they are internal or external users)?
</li></ol>
<p>Note: OWA is applied to exchange accounts.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi philipmacve,</p>
<p>based on the screenshot, i’d like to confirm how do you attach files when sending emails:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c0625151-7963-456c-bdc0-37a7ad92b629" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc0625151-7963-456c-bdc0-37a7ad92b629" /></a></p>
<p>if we select <b>upload and attach as a onedrive file</b> when attaching files, the files will be uploaded to onedrive online. recipients need to sign in their onedrive online to view or download the files. it’s an expected behavior in office 365. this is
 because onedrive online and exchange online are two independent services, some office 365 subscriptions contain exchange online service but not onedrive online service.</p>
<p>if we select <b>attach as a copy</b>, recipients can view or download files directly. since you want recipients to view or download attachments directly, you can select
<b>attach as a copy</b> section when sending emails with attachments.</p>
<p>if this isn’t the scenario you are encountering, please let me know.</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>larry</p>

<h2>            Excel &#34;Shape Format&#34; tab problem</h2>
                    <p>Since last week's update, Excel won't let me paint two cells and pull them down to make multiple copies. &nbsp;It shifts into "Shape Format" mode with a different cursor shape (like a star). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the normal "+" cursor back? &nbsp;How do I close the "Shape Format" tab?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since the last update, Excel is very slow for Sort and even for simple data entry (sometimes).</p>

<h2>            Email address problems - outlook with windows 10 and other non outlook email address</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the free upgrade to windows 10 a few weeks ago, and my email address was a bt yahoo one and my login on laptop was that same&nbsp;email address as set up by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to get rid of my bt&nbsp;email address and only have&nbsp;an outlook one instead of bt one.&nbsp; So I logged in to ms live and set up a an outlook email address.&nbsp; This became "my alias".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However my sent from still showed from bt email.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the website
 would not let me change the outlook email to be my primary email</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft who suggested I set up another alias and then the system would let me change my primary email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this. my chosen outlook address is now my primary address. It shows as the sent from address on the website email login and on my mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;On my laptop however, my chosen primary outlook address has changed itself and is now the spare one and sent emails show as sent from it and not my chosen outlook primary email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But emails to my primary outlook address come into it.&nbsp; I have deleted this
 spare one&nbsp;from my account on the ms live login info, but it is still in use on my laptop!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also deleted the bt yahoo email address off the ms live login info, and off my laptop. I can still access it separately on line or my phone as I need it until I sort the outlook issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect I did something silly when faffing around with the aliases, and did not realise it was more complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be glad of any information to sort this out.&nbsp; Regards ReneeSU</p>

            Hi BeufordKidd,<br />
<br />
I would like to confirm if you are using the same email addresses for both of your college account and business account.<br />
1. If yes, here are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365legacy-mso_sharing/how-do-i-view-my-onedrive-business-and-personal/5a82e74a-bb60-4cdd-a27d-a80b9157c57f?auth=1">troubleshot
 steps</a></span> posted by Kerwin Yang for your reference.<br />
2. If no, can you share a screenshot about the abnormal display page you sign into? Meanwhile, try logging in to your accounts from different browsers or Private/Incognito mode, for example, open your college account by Chrome, and your business account by
 IE.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the updates at your convenience.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda<br />

            <p>well, I had the two account problem. also what I finally had to do was use two different browsers to access them separately. Every time I logged on to my school account it would load my business account. And that really slowed me down from doing my home
 work I would spend time trying to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have MS 10 and with edge, and chrome, just log into one with chrome and the other with Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and that seems to have solved my problem for now</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I must say both website are great I love office 365, it dose. things that not other operation will do. I love that way it's accessible from any were. And always updated. I never have to wait for updates. It's priced reasonable for single users like
 me with opportunity to expand when ever I am able. &nbsp;which should be too far in the future. &nbsp;I will be a MS customer for life. I might try other operating systems but Microsoft is for for almost everything.</p>
<p>Thank you for being there.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I am using Windows 8.1 on a laptop, and I have several hotmail.com and outlook.com accounts in my built-in mail app. In settings section for any of the account it states the same error like in your case. What is going on???</p>

    <title>confusion with microsoft accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outist  say:</h3>
<h2>            confusion with microsoft accounts</h2>
                    Due to a misunderstanding I have to accounts; live ID with outlook that contains my contact information and a microsoft account that has the cloud info and an attempt for banking (apps etc). The two accounts seem to confuse each other. Is it possible to
 syncronize them or to tranfer the contact information from the live account to the microsoft account?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also I was never able to get my banking information to work on my phone or computer for purchasing apps etc. I have been suggested that the problem may lie with the country name. My account is in Luxembourg, where I work and luxembourg is not listed as
 a country for the banking.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or is the problem based on the confusion of the accounts. I have visited computer stores in Luxembourg and Finland and no one has been able to resove the problem to me yet. Please help if you have an idea.</div>

            <p>Hi outist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us here Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me see what we can do for you about your concern about your Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to clarify some things. Why do say that "the two accounts seem to confuse each other". How do you access those accounts before? If you are referring that those accounts are being linked each other, please be informed that feature is no longer available.
 You can refer to this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/liveid-profile/are-there-changes-coming-to-linked-accounts/d300e1ab-a03a-4611-ba22-5b85c8dd7fc2?tm=1371513882351">
link</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And with regard to your issue that you are not able to access your bank information, What credentials are you trying to use when accessing your bank information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, we can try to use the "Export" "Import" option on your Outlook.com accounts so that we can copy contacts from one account to another. But we have to make sure first that you are able to signed in to both accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get back to us and provide us more details about the issue so we can go ahead and provide you a right solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Office 365 SharePoint Sites sharing with external users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lk777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 SharePoint Sites sharing with external users</h2>
                    <p>I have some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there any way to list all links to the shared files/folders (in the Documents library) sent by the site members to the external users?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the difference between Team site (created for the organization) and team sites created for the groups in terms of Site Settings. Site Settings are so different for the Team site and group sites. As far as I know, a member user (with the edit permissions)
 can't send a site invitation to the external users, but for some reasons that user can open an Invitation screen and send invitation to the external user. But external user never receives that invitation, though as expected.</p>
<p>For the Team site there is "Access Request Option" but it looks like it works only for this particular site. There is no such option for the group sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. This one&nbsp; is a terminology question.&nbsp; In this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-external-sharing-for-your-sharepoint-online-environment-c8a462eb-0723-4b0b-8d0a-70feafe4be85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> there is the following explanation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"...</p>
<p><strong>Sharing files and folders with authenticated external users</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you share a file or folder with an authenticated external user, an email is sent to them which contains a link to the site or document. Each time they access the file or folder using the link, they are sent a time-sensitive code via email that they
 can use to verify their identity. They must enter the code to access the file or folder..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it mean that for files and folders sharing with external users the external user doesn't need to have an account with Microsoft and he/she is not going to be listed as a guest user? And the email identity verification is sufficient? I see it works this
 way. Just sharing sites and files are so different in terms of authentication, it is a bit confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi &nbsp;Leogrande77,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the question1 and 3, you can refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-sharing-auditing-in-the-office-365-audit-log-50bbf89f-7870-4c2a-ae14-42635e0cfc01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use sharing auditing in the Office 365 audit log</a>. This article describes the external sharing process and the audit log admin can use to monitor the sharing history. However, notice that the audit log can only monitor the logs during a range of time that
 no more than 90 days. And there’s no way to get all links, but only can get the acting users/target users/shared items/date and time.</p>
<p>For the question 2, if the users can do external sharing or not, that depends on what the SharingOption is set by admin. This is described in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off-for-sharepoint-online-6288296a-b6b7-4ea4-b4ed-c297bf833e30#ID0EAABAAA=Office_365_Groups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. By default, all SharePoint site collections that are part of an Office 365 Group have the sharing setting set to Allow external users who accept sharing invitations and sign in as authenticated users. For the external user can’t receive the invitation
 email, please make sure the users click “send” button but not “copy shareable link” or “copy link”. If this is not the cause, that can be another issue. For example, you can check the Outlook Online inbox, if the acting user (sender) receive any email notification
 that the invitation email hasn’t been received by the recipient as the recipient email app block or reject to receive.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to invite other to your Office 365 group site, you need to click the “Edit” members button, or you need to go to Outlook on the web app &gt; click the group name &gt; members to edit members.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/836879db-2ff2-4039-83e0-c78a61026a5a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/836879db-2ff2-4039-83e0-c78a61026a5a?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>For the “Access Request Option” settings, this only works when the permission hasn’t assigned to the users (please check the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-sharing-auditing-in-the-office-365-audit-log-50bbf89f-7870-4c2a-ae14-42635e0cfc01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use sharing auditing in the Office 365 audit log</a> and see the sharing process) and the target user is in the existing list in the SharePoint Online directory. (For example, the user has ever logged in to your SPO tenant, the SPO will create a user profile
 for this user. This settings also works in Office 365 group site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Set YTD Average Line on Mutiple Bar Graphs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working with the below graph.&nbsp; What I need to do is add a horizontal line across each bar starting in February that marks that color's moving YTD average.&nbsp; So every month we can see which colors exceed the current YTD average and which do not.&nbsp; So my
 data table has three extra columns not represented here... Blue YTD, Red YTD and Green YTD.&nbsp; If I select any of those as lines on a combo graph, it draws three continuous lines up and down across all the colored bars, when what I want is just a simple horizontal
 line noting where within each bar is the current YTD average.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the error is because of Adobe flash player FP 24 NPAPI and may-be the update on the Winsows Insider Preview 15046 (rs2-release).
</p>
<p>I had the update from Microsoft then adobe after the adobe update is when I got the error 0xc0000142, so I uninstalled flasplayer did a sfc /scannow as admin and nothing was found and the error went away, so I reinstalled flashplayer just to test my idea
 and low and behold I got Error 0xc0000142. So I now know that it is adobe that is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two desktop PC's both on Windows 10 pro 64bit but only this one has the insider build on it... The other pc has no problems with flashplayer update 24? Is it Adobe or the insider build..?</p>
<p>Thank's To All </p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Yikes.&nbsp; In fact, I would be wondering about the validity of your esrv.exe.&nbsp; Apparently it is often a suspected Trojan.&nbsp; So, one view of what you are seeing might be that Flash got a security patch that interferes with whatever the Trojan needs to keep itself
 hidden.&nbsp; I think I would be doing a scan for malware.&nbsp; Otherwise, I agree with the suggestion to uninstall the ES product--if you can.&nbsp; However, another possibility would be that the esrv.exe is fine but just needs to be reinstalled to get its hooks set better
 in the changed environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Microsoft 365 is a combination of Office 365 and other Microsoft services. So, the Business Apps will also be added to Microsoft 365 E3/E5. But we do not have a roadmap for Microsoft 365 specific.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice to meet you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can connect your phone to PC via USB cable. And then press "Windows + E" to open "File Explorer" and click "Computer" to check your phone under "Devices and drives". Double click on your phone and locate the folder you store your photos or videos. Next,
 copy and paste photos and videos from phone to another location on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also transfer files from phone to PC via OneDrive. By default, OneDrive is integrated into Windows 10 and Windows Phone. If you use the same account on your phone and PC, the file sync feature should be switched on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be free to share more if you encounter any difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You! :)</p>

<h2>            Problem using access query as external data source for excel pivot table</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was forced to start using Office 365 and Windows 10 and I have problems using access query as an external data source for excel pivot table.&nbsp; The problem is that all data from the query is not displayed in the pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to create a PivotTable with an external data source in the following way:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Data</strong> &gt; <strong>From Access</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f2f9f5192-1b87-46b9-9f2c-7a9b7b72047d.jpg" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Select Data Source</strong> dialog box, I locate the database I want to connect to, and click
<strong>Open</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Select Table</strong> dialog box, I select the table you want and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li><li>In the <strong>Import Data</strong> dialog box, I select Pivot Table and where I want to put it, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After that, <span><span>the data is imported, but not all,
</span></span><span><span>as you can see in the pictures below.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This is the picture of access query. As you can see, there are three records for each month of the year.</span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.access-programmers.co.uk%2fforums%2fattachment.php%3fattachmentid%3d70038%26amp%3bd%3d1521115641" height="573" width="424" /></p>
<p>This is a picture of Pivot Table in excel after importing data from access.
<span><span>Here's just one record for each month.</span></span></p>

<p>I don't have much experience with Access or Excel, but in Windows 7 and Office 2010 everything worked as it should be.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">That's why I checked the external link properties and found some differences in connection string. In excel 2010 version it shows that
<span>
<span>
Provider=MSDASQL.1, </span>but in excel 365 it shows <span>
Provider=<span>Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB</span>.12.0. </span>
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>If I replace the whole connection string from excel 365 with the connection string from excel 2010, then everything works again and all the data is transferred.</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>Can anyone explain to me how to import data from an access 365
</span></span><span><span>query&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>into an excel 365 pivot table so that I do not need to change anything in the external connection settings?</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx for your suggestion, that is almost exactly what I did (see the bottom of my first post), but it is a bit inconvenient. But it seems I'll have to live with it.
</p>
<p>Or use&nbsp;Legacy import Wizard&nbsp;and then ODBC DSN as <span><span>data source</span></span> type... That also does the trick...
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Problem with outgoing calls</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently been facing a problem with my Lumia 800 after the latest update that was released!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time<u><strong> I can't make any outgoing calls</strong></u> from my phone except emergency calls! As soon as I dial the number, 3 seconds later it gives me "Ended" and it takes me back to the call history. I was facing the problem on and off
 since the latest update, but now it has been 3 days and it is doing this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted my carrier service (MTC Touch - Lebanon) and they tested my line and nothing appeared to be wrong with it, I removed my SIM card and put it in another phone and it worked normally!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure it si nto a netwrok issue because I am getting calls and not having trouble with it, it is only a problem with the outgoing calls!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some help on the issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            Not getting Weather on glance screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a Luimia 720 which is now on running Denim. I'm running the Bing Weather app , and have set Weather to background app on the lock screen - opened the app from the lock screen setting panel but don't get the weather on glance screen like in the picture
 below<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/873225cb-4383-430f-b75f-9bd741f00fe9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I DO get the background showing the weather picture (sunny, cloudy etc) but still no weather details like in the picture above when I double tap. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Was really looking forward to getting weather on my glance screen as it's
 one of the most common things I look at after messages.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Nebus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you mean the Weather app by Microsoft? &nbsp;I did not see one named "Bing Weather". &nbsp;Go to
<strong>settings</strong>, then select <strong>lock screen</strong>. &nbsp;The first item is
<strong>background</strong>, it should be set to <strong>weather</strong> in order to update the background and glance screen. &nbsp;I have that set on my 1520 and my glance screen looks like the screen shot that you put in your message.</p>

            <p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yes I do mean Msn Weather not Bing Weather sorry (just realised it had changed names a while ago) by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have set the background app to Weather in the lock screen settings which should set the glance and lock screens but it doesn't display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no luck. Perhaps a bug with the 720 Denim build ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with a Lumia 720 have this working on Denim?&nbsp;</p>

            Power Query (Data, Get and Transform) will let you do this. You can import data from all files in a folder and even extract the filename (or part of it) as a column in your dataset. Once you have set up the query once, it will run again whenever refreshed.
 I suggest you visit Excelisfun on YouTube and go through the first few sessions in his MSPTDA series.

            Yep. This is a real pain. Does it every time on most models.<br />
<br />
You need to export the contacts as .vcf files to your memory card. Make sure they're all there because filename conflicts (there's one file per contact) will result in contacts being overwritten. Then delete all your contacts, re-import them from the memory
 card and then you'll be able to set the defaults.<br />
<br />
The downside to this is that you'll lose the default numbers on all your contacts and you'll have to redo your speed dial settings and re-populate your contact groups.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can save yourself a certain amount of trouble short-term by exporting, deleting and re-importing just the contact you're trying to edit with a default.

                    <p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a silly problem. I made my skype account about 10 years ago with hotmail account that was long lost and forgotten since then. And since recently almost all my devices logged me out from my skype, and since i lost the hotmail.com account info, i can't
 log in anymore. I have only one device left that is still logged in, but it doesn't allow me to reset the password since again, i don't have access to the email any longer. I can't also ask skype support since I need to log in there with my skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything i could do?! would greatly appreciate help....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

Hi Patricknehin,<br />
<br />
May I know whether you mean all the emails have this issue (slow to delete or can’t be deleted) or just some specific email?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If just some specific email, I suggest you move it to other folder and then try deleting it. This is to isolate the cache’s affection; if all the emails, please re-confirm your Outlook for Mac has accomplished syncing with the server. Definitely, to ensure
 this, you can click “update folder” to make a forcing synchronization between Outlook for Mac client and the server. After that, try deleting the emails.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may check if your Outlook for Mac can be updated via clicking “Help”&gt; “Check for updates”. &nbsp;Try running your Outlook for<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Mac in safe mode</a> if the above methods
 don’t help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

Alan<br />

<h2>            How do I change the &#42;TEXT&#42; background color in a PowerPoint slide&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I change the background color of the *TEXT* (not the slide itself) on a PowerPoint slide?<br />
<br />
There are lots of examples out on the internet of how to change the background color of the *SLIDE* - that's not what I'm asking - I want to know how to change the background color of the *TEXT* on a slide, such as a yellow highlighter might do for one or two
 words in a sentence on a real-life sheet of paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The little "background color bucket" is conspicuously absent from the Ribbon Bar in PowerPoint, unlike Word and Excel, which have that icon as one of the "standard" ones.</p>

            <p>Interestingly it is included in the XML code (well hidden) so it is possible just tricky.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's a way to do it without code:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In WORD create some text and highlight. </p>
<p>Copy it</p>
<p>
</p><p>In PPT Right click and choose paste keep source format</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should get highlighted text. Adjust the size to match your text in PowerPoint</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor use the Format painter to pick up the format of the highlighted text and apply to any other text.</p>

            Why not make folders on your destop (IE Games; System; Work etc) and place the icons in the folders? Less icons and easier to find.<br />

<p>They have icons and folders. This is the problem not all of those icons are used every day. They need to make a way to have the common icons stay visible and make uncommon items become invisible or eventually file themselves in documents/video/music/links
 folders. I keep a clutter free desktop personally but I still would like to see more options for auto organizing desktop icons. The default rite now is just the occasional notice of having unused icons on your desktop would you like to delete/remove them?
 I sometimes end up with three rows of icons and have to manually file them in each category this is work a smart OS should be able to handle for the end user and something I would buy windows 10 for.</p>

<p>I think no matter how "smart" an OS can be with regards to cleaning up a messy Desktop of unwanted icons, it will NEVER know what YOU want and don't want, nor will it ever know where you want those icons to end up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I don't understand in regards to the picture of the desktop posted above ... are all those icons placed there purposely by the person using the computer, or are they actuall installing programs TO THE DESKTOP? Therefore the files within the folder
 structure of the program load onto the desktop. I seriously hope not!!!</p>

            <p>I would like to suggest to treat the desktop as a place for file management instead of plain simple desktop folder. I prefer desktop to be a default place to download and saved files instead ... for example&nbsp; make it desktop&gt;document or desktop&gt;music etc...</p>
<p>The desktop UI is already very outdated(the desktop ui looks like win 7 and win 8.1).....can Microsoft improve the look and feel of the desktop just like in mobile os from ios or android....</p>
<p>I also want a desktop management system that help me manage all the icon. Windows XP had provided the desktop cleanup feature but somehow they ditch it due to low usage ... the desktop management system would be great by sort or clean or manage this ugly
 icon with a press of a button .... <br />
I agree all the suggestion from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a1f46a7b-093b-48e0-b50c-2919ed1d9cc5" title="Xzemi">

<p>
</p><p>PS: Consumers and enterprises always give initial impressions on the OS when they start up their PC, yup its the DESKTOP!!!</p>

    <title>Three Irritating Issues with EXCEL 2016 for MAC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim-nsc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Three Irritating Issues with EXCEL 2016 for MAC</h2>
                    <p><span>I’m a very seasoned Excel user (25 years). I moved back onto a MAC in September 2015 for my Excel work having been using Excel 2013 on Windows 8. (I otherwise use a MAC) Having waited patiently (and in vein) for Microsoft
 updates to fix three specific issues, today I bit the bullet and made my first support call relating to Excel ever! I'm very
<strong>UN</strong>amused that after several calls (totalling 3 hours) with MS support they have told me the "Solution" is to revert to Excel 2011 for MAC to resolve my issue. What a surprise! - I'm an Office365 subscriber and I thought we paid subscriptions
 to keep our software up to date, not to pay to be "downgraded". Anyway self help and all that..... Perhaps someone has some thoughts/maybe even ways to resolve my issues before I think of more drastic alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Problem 1: Cursor misalignment in the function bar. When I place the cursor over the point at which I want to edit, when I "click", the cursor can appear up to two characters away and sometimes even splits the characters
 in half. I then have to re-align using the cursor using the left right cursor keys. This is BASIC functionality and needs resolving. (I have seen other posts about this, but understand it is still to be fixed.)</span></p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p><span>Problem 2: Whenever I get any form of error following the editing of a cell (normally a syntax error generated by me!), it is difficult to back out of the situation and often requires a variety of different keystrokes
 and cursor movements. Sometimes as many as 10 to 15. In previous versions of Excel simply pressing ”ESC” does the trick. Unless I type every formula correctly (and I type hundreds a day) this can be very time consuming. This is BASIC functionality and needs
 resolving. I cannot find any other similar post about this - I'm concerned.</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span>Problem 3: When I try to format Cell Borders (more precisely it seems that when I try to re-format them), I often am required to do it twice before borders appear correctly. This is exceedingly frustrating and as it varies,
 I have to manually check the result after applying them by going back to look at the formatting in the menu again.</span><br />
</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate knowing if anyone else is experiencing these issues, so that I have some confidence they might get fixed soon. I'm not moving back to Windows and I'm not prepared to have to revert to Office 2011 for more than a short term fix. So I'm
 seriously considering Numbers or OpenOffice unless this is resolved soon. It's a shame as up until now I have sung the praises of Excel from it's earliest version that I started to use in 1990!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>I'm using a MACBook Pro (15 inch, Mid-2012) (pre-Retina!) running Yosemite 10.10.5 and Excel 2016 version 15.17. I'm not sure if this could be some sort of Graphics issue so for completeness the Graphics are Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB.</p>

            The issues you described are well-known problems in Excel 2016 for Mac. You were advised correctly that Excel 2011 is more stable. It also has a ton of features that were cut from Excel 2016. Stick with Excel 2011.

            <p>Jim - Thanks for your post. Are you suggesting that Excel 2011 is more feature rich than 2016? That seems incredible! And I'm somewhat taken aback. What sort of features were cut out of the latest version and why are we pretty much forced to take a MS subscription
 if that is the case? Tim</p>

            <p>Two huge features that are shortchanged in 2016 are the Visual Basic Editor and the Microsoft Query SQL Editor (it's completely gone!). There are literally hundreds of missing, broken or incomplete features in Excel 2016. I don't know of a complete list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you're forced to take 2016 in a subscription. You can request 2011 from Customer Support.</p>
