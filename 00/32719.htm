<h2>            Windows 10 Mail is automatically deleting my trash mails, almost instantaneously</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Mail App that came with Windows 10, Version 17.8104.42387.0. I have it custom set up for a POP3 account. Mail sends and receives correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;as soon as I delete something, instead of it going to a Trash folder which I can empty when I wish, the emails are automatically being deleted almost as soon as they go into the trash folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I update the settings to prevent this?</p>

<h2>            Application Error ClassNotFoundException Rs2Applet.class&#63;</h2>
                    Hello I copy and pasted the same problem I am having as a guy that posted on this forum too but its dead so I started a new one with more info if somebody could please help me that would be great
<div>A few days ago I purchased a new desktop. When I go to RuneScape.com and try to load the game I get nothing but a black screen with "Error. Click for details" in the upper left hand corner. When I click on it I get the following: Application Error ClassNotFoundException
 Rs2Applet.class with the options Details, Ignore, or Reload. I have tried restarts, reinstallations of java, java 7 as well as java 6, clearing my cache, cookies, deleting temporarily saved files, running ccleaner, disabling add-ons, Internet Explorer, Chrome,
 Mozilla Firefox, and the rs client, and none of these work. I have also gone into my firewall and allowed Oracle America, Oracle, and Jagex to do everything. I even tried completely disabling my firewall. I tried another restart after I did all of this and
 I am still unable to load the game. Any help is greatly appreciated. One last thing that I should mention is that I am running Windows 8. Would this be the cause of any problems? I'm growing quite eager to finally be able to play again, so if you can help,
 let me know! Thanks!</div>
<div>This is what what I get everytime I try and load the game&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Why does my updated Skype no longer have ability to use the dial pad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riclambart1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my updated Skype no longer have ability to use the dial pad once my initial call contact is achieved&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The keys on the dial pad output no longer register the correct numbers . . . I may press a three, for instance, but it outputs two or three, sometimes four threes (3s).&nbsp; Same with any of the other keys.&nbsp; This is same problem on my other computers, as well.&nbsp;
 Never had this problem in earlier versions of Skype, the best of which were the original apps from 2004 and until not long after Microsoft purchased the Luxemberg corporation for over 8 billion dollars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found no solution to this issue and it needs to be repaired since calling to land-line services that require, after the initial call in connected, for further touch dial pad intputs is no longer either possible, or dependably functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please!</p>

<p>Karah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I just realized that my Microsoft (MS) account includes this yahoo.com address, an address which I never otherwise use, and only instituted because MS required I employ it rather than my normal email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not usnderstand why my normal or regular address wasn't sufficient for opening the Office 365 account, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, to get on with my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an older version of SKYPE which I keep on all of my computers because I've had such a terrible experience automatically taking the latest updates from MS to SKYPE.&nbsp; The worse reaction to a SKYPE update occurred</p>
<p>with my old main computer running Win10, which crashed and has sat idle now for over a year (or approximately that period of time).&nbsp; It was a nightmare.&nbsp; But I also had serious problems arise right after updating other</p>
<p>older versions on my other machines, also.&nbsp; Enough really bad experiences that I am now literally frightened of taking any more updates, since they have clearly not all been thoroughly vetted or de-bugged before release, or</p>
<p>I'd not have had so many problems with just SKYPE updates.&nbsp; I have what seem like truckloads of updates to an awful lot of other software, but those updates have never caused any sorts of instability problems or issues</p>
<p>with my other Windows OSs/platforms.&nbsp; Since MS has now owned SKYPE for some time now, it's hard for me to fathom why these sorts of bugs even occur, since the entire process is more or less "in house," whereas the</p>
<p>many other applications are independent, yet don't cause instability with the MS OS on which they must function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had SKYPE for years prior to the take over by MS, but had no problems with their less frequent updates.&nbsp; In fact prior to MS's ownership, I found that SKYPE was a far superior product, alone because it had so many wonderful</p>
<p>features, of which to many were literally removed by MS.&nbsp; One example was the ability to cusomize one's outgoing voice mail message/greeting.&nbsp; That is a long story and my workaround in order to even keep using SKYPE</p>
<p>took me a lot of time, and necessitated my using an entirely new cell phone service, along with SKYPE call forwarding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in addition to the serious performance issues and actual computer crashes, getting an automatic update with SKYPE could also mean waking up (too late!) to find that a loved SKYPE feature was lost in the new version!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only listed this latest nightmare re the loss of dial accuracy using telephone connections, which caused me to go back to an earlier or last stable version of SKYPE.&nbsp; I now have that same version on all of my devices,</p>
<p>since I cannot afford (literally) to have any more nighmare experiences just because of a SKYPE update.&nbsp;
<strong>The version am now running is: 7.40.0.151,</strong> which seems to have resolved the latent dial accuracy issue.&nbsp; Also, please</p>
<p>note that my only fix for this issue was to go back to a prior stable version of SKYPE.&nbsp; Uninstalling and re-installing proved a waste of time with no good results or solutions achieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also like to make another serious recommendation to your MS SKYPE team:&nbsp; <em>

<h3> ww3140  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to install driver for HP laserjet printer P1505n</h2>
                    I am trying to install the driver for a new HP LaserJet Printer P1505n on my new HP Pavillion which is running Windows 7. It was my understanding that simply by connecting the printer with the USB cable, that Windows and/or HP would recognize it and install
 the printer automatically. When that didn't work, I followed the directions meticulously...running the cd software that came with it, running the "Help" info that was suggested after the disc failed to set it up correctly, but it still comes up with the message
 that the driver was not installed. I am frustrated since I cannot believe it should be this difficult, even for a non-techy like me. Please answer in layman's terms, not tech speak. :+) Thank you<br />
<br />
P.S. It seems to stop at the "preinstalling driver files" during the installation process.

            The only drivers for the Laserjet P1505n are the downloads from the HP site.
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?product=3435671&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lang=en&amp;cc=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
If you have a slow download, the basic driver at about 3.5MB will work. For best use of the printer you need the 164MB full feature software and driver.

<h2>            Windows 10 Free Upgrade will not accept my Windows 7 Product Key as Valid</h2>
                    <p>Notified Windows 10 Upgrade was ready to install...ran it. &nbsp;On Startup it wants the Microsoft Product Key. &nbsp;Didn't see that coming, all info I read on the Upgrade process nothing ever mentioned about having your Product key available to complete Upgrade.
 &nbsp;I would have thought that would have been verified during the scanning process to validate my device as having a Valid Product Key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered my Win7 Product Key and its shows it as not a Valid Key. &nbsp;Can't be, I took it right off the Win7 Package Win7 came in. &nbsp;It showing if not validate w/i 30 days the OS will stop running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My research shows some user updating from Win8 to Win are also reporting this same issue (and with Win8....no one has a Product Key as it is built-in and hidden in BOIS of the Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft aware of this issue? &nbsp;It may be only isolated cases where this is happening but none the less...its real. &nbsp;My Valid key is not working......its has to be a Microsoft issue......</p>
<p>

<h2>            difficuty entering vista login password on acer aspire notebook</h2>
                    i have am acer aspire 5050-3371 laptop with windows vista and all currently available updates installed.&nbsp; My problem is that whenever the battery is installed you have to repeatedly press the keys for the password several times before they will show up
 on the password entry screen.&nbsp; since the actual characters do not show don't know if the correct letters are being engtered.&nbsp; Additionally if i remove the battery from the laptop the problem goes away.&nbsp; You can type the password easiily and the system accepts
 it.&nbsp; I have attempted to get help with this problm from the Acer Tech Support desk and was disconnected whenever they determned that the laptop wasn't under warranty any more.&nbsp; Any ideas for resolution of this problem?

            My only suggestion is to go to the manufacturer site and purchase a battery for replacement.<br />
Trouble is : it might be a bad connection between the battery and the laptop, in which case, you could have bought a brand new battery for nothing.<br />
<br />
How about take it to your RELIABLE local computer service shop...... don't&nbsp;take it to the " geek squad ".

                    I reloaded my computer with Linux and then installed windows 7 in virtual box. It let me activate windows and now a week later it tells me it is not genuine. Can I not run windows in a virtual machine? It really is the same computer that I originally installed
 windows 7 on, I would just rather run it in a virtual machine. If I reload windows directly to the harddrive will I have problem with activation again?

<p>Do you have your online pass activated? Just to be sure.</p>
<p>If so, there can be a problem with the server.</p>
<p>I know EA is busy with changing a lot of things serverside for the release of Fifa 13 and FUT13.</p>
<p>Things should be ready tonight (UK time). Maybe you can try again later.</p>

    <title>Too many weapons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankgoots  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too many weapons&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Gears of war typical fashion is to add all these cool new features without perfecting everything else first. Perfect example gears 2 &amp; 3 numerous amount patches and updates.<br />
Going to run through all my complaints with all these guns so haters you're gunna love it.</p>
<p><strong>Markza &amp; Breechshot</strong>: (kinda familiar so going to analyze them together) Both these guns are semi-automatic precision rifle that from the videos are 2 shots in the head. I feel like both these guns triumph the longshot.
 I would much rather choose either of these guns than the longshot for the simple fact I could get 4-5 shots off these guns to maybe 2 shots of the longshot. All in all these triumph the longshot and better not be starting weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Tripwire Crossbow</strong>: (cousin of torquebow) don't we already have enough explosive weapons, oh you can never have to many. YES YOU CAN. This gun will be used and abused. People will set these "tripwires" at ankle
 height on staircases, around corners, and everywhere and people will die before they even know why. This gun has a cool concept, but its just too much too soon.</p>
<p><strong>Booshka</strong>: Only new gun i'm really a fan of. Brand new concept to the gears arsenal with the ricochet aspect. Very unique and should be a fun, complex, non-noob gun to use. Assuming it has a controlled explosion
 radius.</p>
<p>Here is Grenades: First of there seems to be a lot of grenades now, I believe 4, and if your only allowed to hold 1 grenade type at a time it could pretty annoying having to choose.</p>
<p><strong>Beacon Grenade</strong>: Awesome Idea! I am a huge fan of this grenade and hopefully it has an appropriate radius/timing. This will allow for great strategic attacks if used properly.</p>
<p><strong>Stim-gas Grenade</strong>: Very useful if utilized correctly, but If i had to choose one of the other three grenades to hold; incendiary, gas, or beacon I would choose them all over the stim. I feel like it is a really
 cool, unique grenade but will just not be utilized fully.</p>

<p>Off the top of my head gears 2 &amp; 3 didn't have this much of an introduction to its arsenal as judgement will be and I think it is just a little too much. We already have *** ton of guns and I don't want to turn this game into Call
 of Duty. Feel free to say why you think i'm wrong below.</p>

<p>well assuming(from past maps) that each map has 6-8 weapons laid out across the map that are able to be picked up and that there is 17 power weapons total, 6 more than gears 3. It is just going to be overwhelming and just too much, especially since gears
 is notorious for problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think all these guns but the Breechshot will make the game better. No one would really used the Markza and the Tripwire Crossbow and the Booshka. But the Beacon and Stim-gas adds to more strategical game play. The Breechshot is a one shot headshot, plus
 it's automatic. So it's kinda unfair. The Booshka is a automatic grenade launcher, but if you miss, the radius is too small to do any real damage. The Marka is weaker then the Breechshot, but shoots faster. I feel that it's too week, to make any real affect.</p>

<h2>            Camera App doesn&#39;t open - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>So recently I've had this problem with my camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It simply doesn't open. When I click the icon absolutely nothing happens.</p>
<p>I get no error message. I get no window open. I get nothing... It's as if I was click on empty space.</p>
<p>The camera image of the icon is also not displayed unless I pin it to the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The webcam driver is up to date as far as I can tell, since it says it's already up to date when I search for updates on device manager.</p>
<p>The webcam itself works fine on other apps such as Skype. No problems there, only the app doesn't respond at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 is relatively new so are these problems, so I couldn't find any fix to my problem. I couldn't find my problem whatsoever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information required will be given.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.: Please avoid commenting "I also have this problem!...". I need my camera working ASAP so only actual helpful comments please.</p>

            <p>The window app troubleshooter didn't detect any problems, which was expected... troubleshooters rarely work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the camera app (along with a few others) required updates on the Windows store.</p>
<p>As I entered the download and update section the updates seemed to have already been started (I don't remember starting them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way none of them (including the camera app) are actually downloading/updating.</p>
<p>Most are stuck on "pending", others have already download (apparently) some MB but are still stuck on "pending" next to it.</p>
<p>I've waiting for a long time already and nothing has changed yet. So I'm guessing they are not updating at all...</p>
<p>That will be another problem to solve then. -_-<br />
<br />
Either way, since the camera app update isn't downloading/updating the app remains as stated on the previous post, completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.: I've added a screenshot of the seemingly unresponsive Windows app store download and updates section.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The page has been exactly like that forever. Nothing has changed (as stated above it seemed like the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;downloads were already being made when I first entered it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, any help is welcomed, any information required will be given.</p>

<p>Because the one Page File is adequate . If your C:\ partition is short on space you could use one of the other partitions.</p>
<p>However, if C:\ is an SSD and the other partitions are on an HDD, C:\ would be the faster Page File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, putting a Page File on an HDD protects the SSD from unnecessary <em>
writes</em>, which is proving to be maybe less of</p>
<p>a worry than the theories a few years ago that suggested SSD's would wear out quickly if too many writes are done to them.</p>
<p>If we do have to worry about writes to and SSD Win10's twice yearly version update overwrites will go a long way toward proving or
</p>
<p>disproving that theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Experiment, and find what works for you. Chances are you will not notice a difference with any of the options.</p>
<p>The Page File is not nearly as important as it was in the day of 512MB RAM and less.</p>
<p>It's not much good setting aside good SSD/HDD space if the Page File does not make use of that space.
<br />
</p>
<p>The 'best' Page File settings have long been debated. There was a time (XP) when 1.5X the installed System RAM for both
</p>
<p>min <em>and</em> max was all the rage, and I rather doubt 2X would benefit over 1.5X or just 3GB for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the people here suggest the default System Managed, which is as good as any on Win10.
</p>
<p>System Managed is dynamic, so the Page File cannot run out of space (assuming the SSD\HDD has adequate reserves).</p>
<p>Having said that, I use 2GB min/max with 8GB (or more) System Ram, just for old times sake. :)</p>

<h2>            Error 0xc000000f Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have not been able to access my desktop computer for a few weeks now and i'm seeking help from the community. I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 just fine and was able to use it for a few days until this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>File:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD</p>
<p>Error Code: 0xc000000f</p>
<p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact you PC administrator or PC/Device manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is what shows up if i just try to boot my PC normally. I did make an installation media (USB) with my laptop but nothing seems to work. Resetting the PC and reinstalling WIndows come up with an error, "There was a problem resetting your PC." System
 restore gave me false hope and appeared to be working but i got another error after it finished. Error Code 0x8000ffff. Going back to a previous build did nothing and automatic repair did nothing as well. I tried going into the command prompt and doing the
 bootrec.exe commands. /fixmbr /fixboot /scanos /rebuildbcd and nothing works. Lots of help would be appreciated! I would like to have my desktop back to be able to do my school work. Thank you all in advance!</p>

            I feel like i might be missing something here but is that option only if you can log in? I can't get to the log in screen at all, I think I should have mentioned that in the original post. I just power on the computer and it immediately goes to a blue

    <title>XBox LIVE Shut Down For Gambling&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azrael008uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox LIVE Shut Down For Gambling&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Gambling is both exciting and addictive, though not everyone who gambles will become addicted.</p>
<p>An interesting article on the BBC News page: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37385555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37385555</a></p>
<p>Details are very sparse. &nbsp;2 guys are charged for encouraging children to gamble but the article goes on to mention that this action was raised by The Gambling Commission which is "<span><strong>is warning parents that children can be drawn into betting on
 so-called skins - virtual goods such as weapons or clothes that are a feature of many popular games"</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>"Overwatch" is guilty of this. &nbsp;"Neverwinter" and the newly released "Star Trek: Online" too.</span></p>
<p>"HALO" is another prolific offender and "Gears Of War 4" is set to be a partner in crime.</p>
<p>Heck even "Destiny" has introduced the chance to roll the dice with their own version of Loot Boxes.</p>
<p>I suppose I can't say I blame them.</p>
<p>If the article is correct it says that the global market in betting on video games is £4 Billion.</p>
<p>But it does call into question some of the practices of Publishers and even begs the question is there such thing as a 'reputable publisher' anymore?</p>
<p>If this is the beginning of the end of in game gambling with Lock Boxes, Loot Boxes, Req Packs (and I mean specifically... charging money for this sort of thing) then it's not a bad thing at all.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Ultimately as a parent it's your responsibility to police your own children whilst at home in my opinion. If that means you watch them whilst they play or restrict their ability to purchase extra credit that may be needed to purchase said loot boxes etc
 then so be it. I don't see earning a loot box etc through normal gameplay as gambling, more a reward, but if they are sold as add on's then I believe the responsibility most definitely lies with the parents still.</p>

<p>"100% with Mark. Parents responsibility."</p>
<p>Yes, yep, absolutely, positively correct. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All 3 of my oldest kids will tell you they have no interest in paying for Loot boxes or anything like that. &nbsp;The stuff is unneeded and a waste of money. &nbsp;Same game without that junk. &nbsp;Smart kids and a reason my 16 year old had the money to buy his own laptop
 and things like that. &nbsp;Now, my oldest son has a friend who spends hundreds on Halo 5 req. packs. &nbsp;His money but what a waste. &nbsp;And then sometimes he is broke and wishes he had the money for something. &nbsp;Those are the people they make money on.</p>
<p>"If this is the beginning of the end of in game gambling with Lock Boxes, Loot Boxes, Req Packs (and I mean specifically... charging money for this sort of thing) then it's not a bad thing at all."</p>
<p>I do not see it as gambling myself. &nbsp;The best part of something like Halo 5 Req. Packs is that they are not needed and they fund the free content. &nbsp;I would much rather them sell unneeded things like this for those that want them and have the maps and other
 main content be free. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And really, I guess it could be gambling. &nbsp;But by themselves there is no gambling. &nbsp;You buy a Req. Pack, Loot Box, Lock Box, and you get a Req. Pack, Loot Box, Lock Box. &nbsp;And you get whatever is in it. &nbsp;It is not like you are running the risk of not getting
 anything in return. &nbsp;Like with lottery gambling, bingo gambling, casino gambling, etc. &nbsp;No, you get what you pay for. &nbsp;Like with Baseball/Football cards. &nbsp;Not gambling when I buy a pack. &nbsp;I get the pack of cards I pay for. &nbsp;I get whatever is in the pack. &nbsp;My
 oldest son used to collect Pokémon cards when he was younger. &nbsp;Each pack had Pokémon cards &lt;-- Like a Loot Box, etc. they where random --&gt; and you might get that $30-$40 card or just a bunch of cards of no real value. &nbsp;Same with a Loot Box or similar.</p>
<p>Now, I do have issues with the way some games allow you to sell and transfer those in game skins and stuff. &nbsp;In itself that is not bad. &nbsp;But that can lead to real gambling. &nbsp;Like if kids are bidding real money on online skin auctions for some "rare" in game
 skin. &nbsp;That is aimed most at children for the most part and it gambling. &nbsp;Just buying a pack for yourself is different. &nbsp;You get that pack yourself and get the contents. &nbsp;With these gambling things like these you many not get anything. &nbsp;You are truly gambling.
 &nbsp;And a lot are rigged. &nbsp;A local guy here rigs these sometimes with some others. &nbsp;They win the best stuff between them. &nbsp;And they make good $$. &nbsp;Guy does nothing but this stuff. &nbsp;If these certain games did not allow you to sell your in game loot that would
 not be an issue.</p>
<p>In the end the issue for me is not that they sell the Loot boxes and thing like that. &nbsp;You are buying something. &nbsp;And you get something. &nbsp;It is when they intentionally make things rare and then allow them to be sold around. &nbsp;And profit from those that sell
 them. &nbsp;And then act like they had no clue there was dishonest. &nbsp;All while those being dishonest where being protected by said company breaking their own rules in favor of those few to protect them and this huge income. &nbsp;And the odd part is that it does not
 seem to hurt the big companies or these people like it should. &nbsp;Dishonesty being rewarded in those cases. &nbsp;But many have come to accept these things. That is another topic though.</p>

<p>I totally monitor every aspect of my children's gaming habits. Online purchases are restricted unless authorised by my wife or I and we do not let them talk online unless it's to a real life friend. Even when they play Minecraft with people they don't know
 I sit and watch. I might be annoying lol but I know the kind of stuff that goes on.</p>

</p><p>If you go into Device Manager, &lt;right-click&gt; on&nbsp; the entry for your sound-device (may have to open a submenu first) you'll see the option "update drivers" or something.&nbsp; Or go up to the top and the last incomprehensible icon there is "Scan for Hardware Changes"

<p>Hi Liam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerns related to high CPU usage can be due to the system configuration of your device. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you've already performed a scan on your device using an antivirus software.
</li><li>The last activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Once you're in the clean boot environment, check if you'll still experience your concern about high CPU usage. The link will also provide steps on how to isolate the cause and how to revert your device back to normal boot after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm having the same issue since a few months and I always search for a solution on internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found how to disable it, but it invalidates your Windows activation( well, that's not a problem for me), Office activation ( that is, i don't like the notification at the beginning).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this&nbsp; in a few minutes and it seems normal till now.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found a temporary solution. If you type in Resource Manager, and click on the Resource Manager Desktop app that come up in the results, it will open up the Resource manager window. From there you can see what is using up your resources. If you click on<br />
the CPU tab, you can see the process eating at your CPU right? From the Resource manager, you can suspend the process which will instantly make a difference. Make sure that the process that the process that you are suspending is not anything that the system<br />
needs in order to run, before you suspend it.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is safe to end the specific process mentioned in this thread as it is not required for the system to run.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also beware of something:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case if I suspend&nbsp;sppsvc.exe Office Application stop responding after a while being idle ( when u stop working), but if you resume the process again it comes back to normal</p>
