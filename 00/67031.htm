<h2>            Need Help. Did Not Receive My Free &#36;5 Microsoft Gift Card For My Star Wars Last Jedi Movie Purchase.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sales and Promotions Customer Service Support,</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Already contacted and forwarded all emailed screenshots to Microsoft, Windows, and Xbox Live Support Teams but to no avail. They could not resolve this issue after being validated online for four hours, so I was told to post my concerns and problems here. I qualified for the Free $5 Microsoft Gift Card Star Wars Last Jedi Movie Purchase Promotion (ended on 14th March 2018 Pacific Standard Time 11:59 PM), and i have the emailed screenshot documentation to prove it. Still, I have not received the gift card as of 21st March 2018 when it was due to me on 20th March 2018.&nbsp; Please follow through with me, Microsoft Sales and Promotion Support Team. "You are my only (and hopefully, last) HOPE...."</p><p><br /></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><br /></p><p>William Sanchious</p><p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>Even wiht a small community, this game is more than worth playing online. Games are sometimes better that way because you can actually get to know the community unlike the millions of random nobodies you play with and against in COD, Gears and Halo.</p>

<p>I just got this game yesterday, there's a lot of people playing when I was searching for a game. It's seems the only game types anyone plays though is Team Death Match and Crash. I liked the online, just a huge learning curve.

<p>Huge learning curve? LOL! If you can play Call of Duty, you can certainly play this game no problem. The only difference is you have to toggle through your 3 perks. Personally, I think the online was a letdown. It's just a plain old run and gun call of duty
 game. It's not bad, just we only need <i>one</i> Call of Duty.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Still a decent community going, but this game does have online multiplayer achievements. So if you plan on getting those, I suggest you pick it up sooner rather than later considering the juggernauts CoD and BF are coming out. And if you need anyone
 to play with, just toss me a friend request and I'll tear up some C2 with ya'.</p>

<p>Well a huge learning curve for me at least. Those invisible guys are a problem for me. I can barley see them but when I use it I get picked off every time. I don't know, maybe I'm doing something wrong. It's a fun game but I was more of a walking target,
 it's going to take a while getting used too, especially with the perks.</p>

<p>the only thing is that if youre a lower level you start to wonder why people can see you when youre invisible but you cant see anyone. Later you get modules that help you see invisible people better and so on. If youre playing against people who unlock all
 the good mudules and you have squat, it can be frustrating.</p>

<h2>            Nvidia Graphics card not being detected</h2>
                    I recently updated my computer to windows 10 and after i started and tried to play a game the fps were as low as 5-10 framers per second. I looked up that it was because my driver was outdated to i tried to update my driver and it is unable to download.
 I read other posts and i uninstalled the driver that said windows basic adaptor because it wasn't detecting my graphics card/adaptor and i tried to download a new one off the nvidia website but it is unable to detect anything.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to <strong>Microsoft Basic Display Adapter</strong>?</p>
<p>How did you uninstalled Graphics card driver?</p>
<p>Is it through Control Panel or through Device Manager?</p>
<p>Are you able to see Graphics card driver in Device Manager? I.e. <strong>Device Manager /&gt; Display adapter /&gt; Graphics card driver</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you uninstall a driver through Device Manager, and by restating PC will automatically picks and install the appropriate driver on startup. If that is the case, try to restart your PC and see if it install the driver automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us above information to assist you in this regard.</p>

            <p>Having the same issue. My computer auto-updated windows 10 last night, and it seems to have totally removed my computers ability to detect my GPU. The only display adapted I can get to show up is Microsoft Basic Display Adapter....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an M17X Alienware, with a nvidia GTX 680M Graphics card that was working perfectly fine before this most recent update. Now, I cant do anything and cant detect it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the nvidia drivers: Nothing</p>
<p>Downloaded the GeForce program: Cant detect a nvidia device.</p>
<p>Even tried disabling the basic display adapter in BIOS to force it to use the GPU, with no luck.</p>
<p>I cant see it in the device manager, and the drivers cant find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some please help. I need this for work as much as play and I currently cant run anything until my laptop will re-recognize my video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>M</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. after an update on windows 10, NVidia fails to detect gpu. It was working fine before windows 10 update (still windows 10). Now in device manager panel, I see Intel Graphics 530 HD I/o Nvidia GTX980.</p>
<p>Display settings and properties are all based on Intel driver. GeForce fails to recognize gpu unit. Manual install of driver, same thing.</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstall Intel driver but nothing works. </p>
<p>Any help here is appreciated. No CUDA until I get NVidia running.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;On this fully updated Windows 10 PC I am the sole owner and user, with an ordinary admin account.&nbsp; This does not allow me e.g. to enable my keyboard to wake from sleep.&nbsp; I am told I have no access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely by default the sole administrator account should also have system administrator permissions?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sean.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Having trouble with setting permissions on Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocky619619  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having trouble with setting permissions on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone. I have Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 4 M3 and I'm having trouble with setting permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to be able to rename files located in the programfiles folder. But every time I do, it says I require permission from the user/admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set the owner to myself and have given myself full control so why is it asking myself for permission to rename a file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the specific steps I am taking to try and rename the file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open file explorer</p>
<p>2. Navigate to C: drive.</p>
<p>3. Right click on Program Files</p>
<p>4. select properties</p>
<p>5. Select the Security tab.</p>
<p>6. Select Advanced</p>
<p>7. Change owner.</p>
<p>8. Set owner as (PCNAME\USER)&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Check the box "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects"</p>
<p>10. Check the box "Replace all object permission entries with inheritable entries from this object"</p>
<p>11. Click apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It starts setting the security information to all the files and folder inside Program Files, but then I get an error at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error Applying Security - An error occurred while applying security information to: C:\Program Files. Failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is then followed by a Windows Security error: Unable to save permission changes on Program Files. Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Microsoft Store Download failed, but the failed download is still taking up 130gb of my HDD</h2>
                    I was downloading Gears of War 4 the other day and paused the download. When I hit play some time later the download disappears. I go to the store page for GoW4 and it shows the option "Install". Hitting it will attempt a fresh install. However, the failed
 download is still taking 130gb. How do I fix this?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The files you download are saved in a temporary location before they get installed. You may try clearing the temp files by following the steps given below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span>
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box by pressing the <strong>Windows</strong> key and the
<strong>R</strong> key together.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong>Temp</strong> and hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key which will display the contents of the temp folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select all files by pressing the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key and the <strong>A</strong> key.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press the <strong>Shift</strong> key and the <strong>Delete</strong> key to delete all selected files.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box again by pressing the <strong>Windows</strong> key and the
<strong>R</strong> key together.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong>%Temp%</strong> and hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key which will display the contents of the temp folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select all files by pressing the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key and the <strong>A</strong> key.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press the <strong>Shift</strong> key and the <strong>Delete</strong> key to delete all selected files.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Now, open the <strong>
Run</strong> dialog box again by pressing the <strong>Windows</strong> key and the
<strong>R</strong> key.</span></p>
<p><span>Type <strong>Prefetch</strong> and hit the
<strong>Enter</strong> key.</span></p>
<p><span>Select all files by pressing the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> key and the <strong>A</strong> key.</span></p>
<p><span>Press the <strong>Shift</strong> key and the
<strong>Delete</strong> key to delete all selected files</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can run the
<strong>Windows Disk cleanup</strong> tool to clean up the unwanted files and free up the disk space. Please refer to the article below.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as instructed, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my next reply there's a picture with the directory in question</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's occupying 124GB, but the Microsoft Store seems not to recognize the game is there, so if I try to download again, the store siggests I need space to download it</p>

    <title>Lexmark Printer Drivers installation program saved to a folder name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris raisin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lexmark Printer Drivers installation program saved to a folder name &#34;c&#58;&#92;Program Files &#92;&#34; &#40;with a space at the end of it&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a real problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow on my Windows 7 Professional machine an automatic update of Lexmark Printer Drivers installed and the installation program saved the files<br />
to a folder names "c:\Program Files \" (with a space at the end of it!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This all happened overnight without me seeing what was going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the Windows 7 system does not like folder or filenames ending in a "space" or a "period" and it cannot work with it correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The side effect is that somehow the system has copied EVERY sub0folder name over to this newly created folder called "C:\Program Files \" and I have ended up with TWO folders that look the same name (although one has a space at the edn of it".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not really a problem in that I could simply ignore it (the other corrrectly names folder still operates OK). The only problem is that changes to "Security" affect BOTH folders since Windows 7 sees both folder names as the "same" when adjusting security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, when I tried to mark the "bogus" folder as "not available" to everyone (including the system) it did the same for "Program Files" (the real one) with disastrous consequences. I was lucky to get out of it and restore some semb;lance of sanity to my
 machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I am now stuck with this annoying folder with lots of sub-fdolers (all of which are unaccessable since the system cannot locate them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is, how do you delete a folder which has a "space" as the final part of it's name when the Windows Explorer cannot work with it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks with any helpf with this very unusual problem.&nbsp;</p>

            If you have the ability to make a full system image of the disk, I would do that before attempting the following ... just in case deleting the "bad" folder ends up deleting all of the good ones also.&nbsp; Alternatively, instead of deleting the directory in
 the last step below, rename it using a command such as<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren c:\PROGRA~3 c:\badprogs&nbsp;&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
If the "real" Program Files and other directories survive unscathed, then delete C:\badprogs in the usual way.<br />
<br />
******************************************<br />
<br />
Type cmd into the search box and then right-click on cmd.exe and select "Run as administrator."&nbsp; Give the password when prompted.<br />
<br />
Type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd c:\&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
to change to the root<br />
<br />
Now type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir /x&nbsp;&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
This will show you a directory listing of the "short form" names.&nbsp; You will probably see something like this (from a Win 7 x64 installation, which is why there are "Progra~1" and "Progra~2" directories)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Directory of c:\<br />
<br />
08/01/2012&nbsp; 01:19 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROGRA~1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program Files<br />
07/30/2012&nbsp; 01:03 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROGRA~2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program Files (x86)<br />
07/03/2012&nbsp; 10:46 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users<br />
07/30/2012&nbsp; 08:16 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows<br />
<br />
<br />
In your case, your spurious directory will be named either PROGRA~3 (if you have x64) or PROGRA~2 (if you have 32-bit Windows 7).<br />
<br />
Now that you know the short name, use that to delete it:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; del C:\progra~3&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Remove a email account from the from&#58; dropdown list in a new windows live mail  email</h2>
                    <p>How do you remove a email account from the from: dropdown list in a new windows live mail&nbsp; email?&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;reply to an&nbsp;email from one account, but I to send it from a different account. (It's a long spammy story)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the account I received the email from shows up in the from: line and I have to change it every time and I usually forget. So I just want to delete that account from the list that I can send from. But I don't want to stop receiving email from
 that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bob</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS</p>
<p>This is in Outlook.com because Windows Live Mail isn't in the list of Categories.</p>

    <title>x080070005 on Win8 Store update for 2 apps, Music and Video - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irvspalten  say:</h3>
<h2>            x080070005 on Win8 Store update for 2 apps, Music and Video</h2>
                    These two apps although they start, will NOT show any videos (I didn't try the music), they just spin dots and say starting.<br />
<br />
Today there was 2 updates, one for each in the store. I did the update but they failed with the subject error.<br />
<br />
Many people seem to get this error in many versions of Windows. Scoured all the ones I saw that were recent.<br />
<br />
One I saw sort of indicated that I had a virus, and that MSERT.EXE should be run. It ran OK?<br />
<br />
Another suggested deleting the package folder under USERS\userid\APPDATA\LOCAL\PACKAGES, but that didn't help?<br />
<br />
Another 'suggests' permissions are wrong, but I can't find specifically what it should be?<br />
<br />
I've had problems with other apps as well in the past. After install (Upgrade of system from W7) all apps were working. I now also have a problem with USA Today that doesn't connect. Others too... but I've deleted them, such as Weather but I'm using the WeatherBug
 as a replacement.<br />
<br />
One thing I did find, at one point I had to do a REFRESH as a test, and everything appeared to work after that. However, I just did a random check. After that I restored my SAVED image of the C: drive. At that point they did NOT work?<br />
<br />
Figuring this had to be an access/permissions problem I started looking at that. I had TAKEN OWNERSHIP for my UserID that is part of the Administrator's group. Possibly that was a problem, I think as the old permissions were for
<span>NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller </span>so I changed drive ownership to that. It didn't change anything, even after a re-boot, so I took ownership again.<br />
<span>NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller </span>so I changed drive ownership to that. It didn't change anything, even after a re-boot, so I took ownership again.<br />
<br />
I've got another W8 computer here that DOES work? I've been comparing stuff between the two, but really can't see differences, so I'm probably looking in the wrong places?<br />
<br />
I've tried the MS Fix app and troubleshooter, nothing helps.<br />
<br />
I am running an ATI HD4000 series video card with the ATI 13.1 drivers. 12.8 are the initial ATI drivers and I have seen some indication that the 13.1 drivers are problematic for videos on the Start Screen, but the answer was to revert back to the 12.8 drivers
 but that also didn't help?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? How can I reset ALL the permissions if that is the problem?<br />
<br />

            I had the same problems last night and spent over an our trying to get those 2 programs updated. I really have no idea which of the 14 billion things I tried that did the trick though. There is a thing about stopping the update service, renaming the update
 directory, and then restarting the service. It would fail when I tried to rename the directory. After a bunch more reading there was something about making sure location is turned on in the OS. That took a ton of digging to find out how to do that. Also disabled
 a bunch of scheduled tasks in the task manager. Another thing was uninstall those apps and then re install them. \<br />
Anyhow, through all that, something hung my router, so I had to restart it, and along with the other things I did, I think I rebooted about 4-5 times.<br />
<br />
Well, most programs if you uninstall them, keep your settings, so I didn't give removing them a second thought. Well, wouldn't you know it, Modern doesn't work that way, so I lost my email account settings and preferences and music settings.<br />
<br />
And to top it off, the issues I had with mail and calendar are still not fixed. No way to view a mail full screen, or resize a pane so I can the the full width of a mail, and no way to schedule a recurring calendar item once every 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, to flog a dead horse, google or bing the error message code you get, and you may be able to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

            No, no luck at all...<br />
<br />
It seems my problem 'might' be licenses....<br />
<br />
Today I discovered something?<br />
<br />
My licenses are not getting updated even though the STORE says it is doing it?<br />
<br />
For the ones I can't use I see this in the event viewer :<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
Windows Store detected a license issue with package 32773Enigma.TomandJerry_1.0.0.8_neutral__vzarmjakcpmgw - the package must be licensed before you can use it.<br />
Result code: 0x0<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
However, in the Scheduled Tasks for MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\WS is see that SYNC LICENSES has failed?<br />
<br />
====<br />
<pre><code>Not enough storage is available to complete the operation. (0x8007000E)<br />====<br /><br />I've got 8GB of RAM with some free and a 4GB swap file that is EMPTY?<br /><br />Additionally when googling for that error code I found one that someone said solved the problem. <br />My LOCAL GROUP Administrators might be missing...<br /><br />==========<br />C:\Users\Irv&gt;net localgroup administrators<br />Alias name     administrators<br />Comment        Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the compu<br />ter/domain<br /><br />Members<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Administrator<br />Irv<br />NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE<br />NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE<br />The command completed successfully.<br />=================<br /><br />The 2 NT AUTHORITY ones were so I added them, didn't help.<br /><br />I'm really suspecting permissions to be a problem here.<br /></code></pre>

            OK, the answers, and I did NOT consider them tedious...<br />
<br />
1a) This was purchased from Dell in May of 2009, and it was <b>originally</b> shipped as Vista.<br />
<br />
1b) Exact date I do not have, but it was around Christmas last year.<br />
<br />
1c) No, never. I did run one Preview as a Sun VM, but never as installed.<br />
<br />
2) 64 bit version, all, VIsta, W7, and W8 have been 64 bit versions.<br />
<br />
3) I am running Norton Internet Security 2013. Have been running it probably since the 2010 version. It expires in 253 days. I just got a completely NEW update today even. That is when I discovered Windows Firewall was enabled. It got enabled during the install
 of the latest level as NIS was deleted before the new version was installed.<br />
<br />
4) When the computer was Vista it was shipped with a 39 month license for McAfee. I had some problems with it during the first year and used the McAfee 'clean-up' utility to get rid of it and installed one of the 3 PC license of NIS we had and have been using
 NIS ever since. <br />
<br />
I've had products like SpyBot Search and Destroy and Malware Anti-bytes as well as TDSKiller on the computer at various times and run them manually.<br />
<br />
No 3rd party Firewalls, only Norton's in NIS is used. My router does have NAT though.<br />
<br />
5) No free trial, came with Full McAfee's ISS.<br />
<br />
6) Confirm <b>ALL</b> fixes you listed are showing as installed.<br />
<br />
7) Firefox is my main browser and it and Chrome have been on this computer from its Vista days.<br />
<br />
8) Sad to say I am, and I have seen in posts where this could cause problems. Usually I only use CCLeaner, but I have 'dabbled' in the past with others.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to add my wife's W8 system doesn't have this problem (therefor I'd rule out the Router firewall as a problem), but DID at one point. I had lowered UAC one notch to not black out the screen when some programs start. After that she suffered problems
 with some 'Bing' apps. I did a REFRESH on her system and it did cure, just like mine did as a test, and since then I've not touch UAC on her's and she has no problems.<br />

            FACT: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've already dealt with the McAfee "leftovers" when you ran the <strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong> (I assume) so the Norton "leftovers" may be your primary&nbsp;troublemaker here. Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following
 multi-step fix I've cooked up just for your computer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ] </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the <strong>
Norton Removal Tool</strong>, saving it to your desktop: 
<font color="#0072c6">ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. If you have backups of the changes CCleaner's <em>Registry Cleaner </em>has made to your computer
<em>since you upgraded to Win8</em>, restore ALL of them now - then reboot - otherwise, you can skip this step
<em>only</em>. [1]</p>

<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall
<strong>Norton Internet Security </strong><em>and then</em> <strong>LiveUpdate </strong>
<em>as well as any</em> <em>installed</em> <strong>Norton Add-ons</strong> via <strong>
Control Panel | Programs</strong>. See: <a href="http://www.technipages.com/windows-8-uninstall-applications.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://www.technipages.com/windows-8-uninstall-applications.html</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make <em>certain</em> the Windows Firewall is enabled <em>immediately</em> after rebooting! [Should happen automatically but I want you to check.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>
<u>else</u></em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step #7 below!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility, then reboot again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do a clean install of <strong>Norton Internet Security 2013 (v20.x)</strong> using your Product ID, if need be (the upgrade, if necessary, is free), &amp; reboot. See:
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: <em>Do NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons or toolbars (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Manually and repeatedly run (Norton) <strong>LiveUpdate</strong> until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Download/run the appropriate scripts from the following Trusted Source (my colleague IE MVP Kai Schätzl):
<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE10, too,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the scripts below (plus a third that you will NOT
</p>
<p>use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> to run that script <em>then reboot.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-program-access-computer-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</font></a>. [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Reset Internet Explorer (via IE10 Desktop)&nbsp;manually (do NOT use the Fix It!) per the Win8-specific section on this page:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737#method1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737#method1</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIP: For optimum results, check/enable the <strong>Delete personal settings </strong>
option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. <em>Even though Windows Update has nothing to so with updating Windows apps =&gt;
</em>Run the Windows Update troubleshooter from start to finish per the instructions on this page, then reboot once more =&gt;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Robear, thanks for the reply and instructions.<br />
<br />
I have MORE than one Norton/Symatec product installed. It will be a 'pain' to re-teach the firewall and A/V and I also have Symantec's System Recovery 2013 installed. The computer used to have Ghost, of course that didn't work with W8, so I had to switch, but
 it uses the same Ghost files and setting. I did see some 'Ghost' files left around though after the uninstall. However at one point with these installed I didn't have any problems.<br />
<br />
CCLeaner might WELL be the culprit. Look at these 2 'saves' I have :<br />

<br />
That top one is large and could have been done around the time of the fails.<br />
<br />
I really do NOT want to totally clean out and remove Norton. Can I do this bypassing that step.<br />
<br />
As an aside I've had problems with many MS FIXIT's. I've got an SSD and they all seem to enable SYSTEM RESTORE which I have disabled. Also seem to turn on Windows Defender and Firewall, but I have Norton doing that and running two at a time is not nice.<br />
<br />
Rather than waste my time doing it partially, I'll await your approval to skip the Norton removal step before proceeding. If I
<b>MUST</b> do it, so be it, but I'd rather not. All was working before with Norton (although different versions) installed.<br />

            I was waiting to get an answer from you, so I just did it now. Oldest one first, re-boot, then the other one, and re-booted.
<br />
<br />
In both cases the problems persist.<br />
<br />
There are a few Live Tiles I can't install, like Video for instance, it always fails with an 0x80070005 error code which is Access Denied, but of course no more info I can find anywhere on what isn't allowing access? I have Process Monitor and ran it on the
 PACKAGES folder as a filter, but it didn't show anything?<br />
<br />
So, should I do the rest of the steps or must I take out Norton and do them? I don't mind if I have to take out Norton and it is a guarantee it will be fixed, but since it was working with it in, I'm not sure that step is required? Can I try it without that
 step?<br />

            <p>I can assure you that the years of Norton "leftovers" is the most-likely troublemaker here. If you wish to contact Norton Support for additional assistance, feel free to do so. (I'd very much doubt the support will be free, however.&nbsp;Nice, huh?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The Norton Removal Tool isn't likely to resolve <em>all</em> of your problems, hence the other steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: You could always do a <strong>Reset</strong> but that'd be even more drastic.</p>

            I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it said it had to fix somethings... but DETAILS gave no info.<br />
<br />
Didn't help anyway...<br />
<br />
I'd let you connect with TeamViewer if you thought you could possibly see something wrong. I really suspect PERMISSIONS to be the problem here?<br />

<h2>            Lost promotional code for free trial of EA Access</h2>
                    
<p>I recently preordered a copy of NHL 17 from the online store, which was supposed to include a promo code for a free trial to EA Access. &nbsp;I preordered the game almost 2 months ago, however, and I am not able to search that far back
 in my messages to find the code.</p>

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a video but can't find it back on my pc, but I know that I sent it in a Skype group chat like a year ago. The problem is that the group chat had thousands of messages and there is now way that I'm scrolling all the way back. My question is
 basically explained in the title. <strong>Is there a way to view back all your sent media ?
</strong>There is this sort of thing in messenger but can't find a way to do it on Skype. I really want this video back, I hope there is someone that can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and kind regards</p>

<h3> rodneybarnard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not responding to &#34;Hey Cortana&#34; but works fine when I click the mic icon.</h2>
                    I upgraded to windows 10 on my PC. I setup the mic and speakers. I enabled Cortana and went thru the voice training. I have a BT headset and a USB camera mic. The camera mic responded to "Hey Cortana" and then quit. The BT headset has never responded to
 "Hey Cortana". If I click on the mic icon with either device Cortana hears me fine and responds appropiately. In the Chrome browser Google Now responds to "OK Google" and works fine. I have watched the levels in the device window and both mics appear to be
 working fine. I have set the mic level to 100 on both. I have turned off all noise sources and had a quiet house with no one home. I went from normal to yelling and no response from either device. I have searched online but have found nothing useful. I opened
 a chat with MS and was passed to a different tech who never responded. Any help would be appreciated.

            I am wondering if the mic threshold for "Hey Cortana" is higher than for normal conversation maybe to filter out background noise? This would explain the conditions I am seeing. Anybody have thoughts on this or some other scenario?

            <p>I appreciate the reply but I have already been to this site and found nothing useful there. If you have any other suggestions I would be more than interested in hearing them thank you
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset my PC and have a barebones Win 10 install. Cortana will still not respond to the initial "Hey Cortana" but works fine after I click the mic icon. Can someone please assist with this as I like this feature but want it to work correctly. Thanks
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if the mic threshold for "Hey Cortana" is higher than for normal conversation maybe to filter out background noise? This would explain the conditions I am seeing. Anybody have thoughts on this or some other scenario?

            So I am now experiencing this problem as well after the update to Threshold 2. I can click the Mic ICON and she hears me fine, but she won't respond to "Hey Cortona" no matter what. This can't be a HW problem since the audio path works fine after clicking
 the icon. Sounds like Microsoft broke it with the latest update.

            <p>I am still experiencing the original problem.&nbsp;I am hoping that Threshold 2 fixes it but not holding my breath. I have since tried several mics (BT and wired) and still can't get Cortana to hear me until I click the mic. I have heard nothing further from
 MS on this and assume they are ignoring the problem. This is a shame as I like the concept of having a casual conversation with my desktop. Google Now is still working fine on the same machine but Google removed the "OK Google" option from Chrome so I don't
 even have that. Still hoping for a resolution from MS. Maybe this new activity will put this on their radar. Please encourage others with this problem to post in this thread.</p>

            I had the same problem. Cortana would not respond toHey Cortana. I called Microsoft tech&nbsp;support &nbsp;and found I needed to click on learn my voice on Cortana settings and follow the prompts from Cortana.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Cortana now works for me. Hope you find this

    <title>File associations in Windows 10 not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rustnel  say:</h3>
<h2>            File associations in Windows 10 not working</h2>
                    <p>Many of my file extensions are not pointing to the programs I need them to point. For example I create script files that are used by AutoCAD. The script file has an extension of .scr that I use a text editor program like Notepad to create it. When I upgraded
 to Windows 10 the .scr extension was set to open using&nbsp;the AutoCAD Script Editor. I tried to change the default program using a right click "Open With". However the "Open With" option was not available for this file type. I then tried: Right click on Start
 &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Default Programs&nbsp;&gt; Associate a file type or protocol with a program. I clicked on the .scr extension, clicked "Change Program" and&nbsp;it would not change. The only way I could get the file association to not be "AutoCAD Script Editor"
 was to Right click on Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit and delete all occurrences of the key&nbsp;.scr. After this I was able right click&nbsp;on the file and use "Open" to associate the file to Notepad. This worked, however, I think I'm missing&nbsp;a step. The "Open with" option
 is not available when I right click the file, like it is for other files. I would like to know what step I missed to get "Open with in the right click options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, many of the file extensions indicate "Unknown application" so I suspect this issue may be affecting over 350 file extensions. Does Microsoft have a fix to fix all these "Unknown application" issues?</p>

            The .scr files had the Description "AutoCAD script file" with the Current Default "Unknown application" in the file association list. This method might work, but I had already deleted the scr keys and then associated them with Notepad.

<p>Ok. Here is another way.. and easier too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To associate .scr files with Notepad, open a Command Prompt (Administrator) and type in:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>assoc .scr=txtfile</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>to revert back to defaults, type:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>assoc .scr=scrfile</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>.scr files are Screensaver files (executable) files in Windows, and that's the reason "Open with" is not there in the right-click menu. Same for .exe / .com etc.</p>

You won't be able to use the other characters until you complete a certain amount of the story mode and reach what's called the "hub". In batman 3 you'll eventually end up in a control room and have to choose which level to complete next, that "computer" is the hub. You can choose levels to replay there and choose either story mode or free play. In free play you can use any characters you want by pressing Y on the controller to pull up the character selection menu.</p>

            &nbsp;Let's scan the system and see if any files need repair:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Go to <b>Start</b>, <b>All Programs</b> and <b>Accessories</b>. </li><li>Right click on <b>Command Prompt</b> and choose <b>Run as Administrator</b>. </li><li>At the prompt, type <b>sfc /scannow</b> and press enter.</li></ul>

This might take a while to run.&nbsp; If it doesn't find anything to fix, try loading a restore point from before the problem existed.<br />

If that doesn't clear up the issue, I would recommend a "repair" install of Windows Vista.&nbsp; Just make sure you are already logged into your computer when you start the install.&nbsp;
<b>Do not boot from the DVD</b>.<br />

    <title>Sharing to Mail App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uncledimi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing to Mail App</h2>
                    <p>Hello Support Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 in August, I have not been able to share screenshots taken in the OneNote app to the Mail App. When I select Mail in the Share option in the OneNote app, an email is generated but the screenshot image does not display in the
 body of the email, just an empty box with the words <strong>"The linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been moved, renamed or deleted. Verify that the&nbsp;link points to the correct file and location.".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Was also having a problem using the pen to capture a screenshot into OneNote, but with the help of a Support Tech, we managed to solve this problem. The only problem&nbsp;we couldn't solve was&nbsp;the one described above. This sharing feature is very convenient and
 one of the reasons I liked the Surface Pro 3, so would like to fix if possible. As far as I can tell, there is no easy way for me to reinstall the Mail app within Windows 10, which would be the first simple thing I would try. I've already refreshed the system
 which didn't fix the problem unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I'm pretty sure I already have the most recent version of the Mail app and I have not messed with my app defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Are you able to send other attachments apart from the mail app?</p>
<p>2) Does this issue occur on Mail app or OneNote app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try uninstall and reinstall of mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Open Windows Powershell as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>2) T</span><span>ype in the following command(s) listed in the table below under the
<strong>“Remove PowerShell Command” column </strong>to remove the associated native app.&nbsp; The app can be reinstalled using the Store App or by following the link listed in the table below. You will need to exit the Store app if it is already open before reinstalling
 the app. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to download the mail app from the Microsoft store and check if this helps.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. To answer your questions, I don't seem to have any other problems creating attachments except for this situation regarding the sharing of screenshots from OneNote to the Mail app. As to which app is responsible for the problem, that's
 hard for me to assess. I'm technically selecting the "share" feature in OneNote, but it's the Mail app that seems be having difficulty finding the screenshot I want to share from OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I will try to uninstall and then reinstall the Mail app per your instructions, but I admit to being a little confused about how to get into the PowerShell and what I'm supposed to type where. I'm not well versed in these matters and don't want
 to mess anything up. In fact, I'm thinking I should take my Surface to the local Microsoft Store and have them help me do this. Would that be appropriate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p>
