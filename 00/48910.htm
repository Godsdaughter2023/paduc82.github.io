    <title>High DPC latency from acpi.sys causing audio clicks and pops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewvilleneuve  say:</h3>
<h2>            High DPC latency from acpi.sys causing audio clicks and pops</h2>
                    <div>Has anyone found a definitive fix for this?&nbsp; I am encountering an issue with DPC latency causing clicking and popping when trying to record using multi-track audio software (in my case Presonus StudioOne, but exact same issue reported by countless others
 I've read on other forums across the internet, with a wide range of DAW software on all manufacturers Windows notebooks). When using the LatencyMon utility, I consistently see "...reported DPC routine execution time" of 4100 or higher, from ACPI.sys activity.&nbsp;
 Noises occur using either external audio interface, or onboard sound card (when left enabled)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My system:</div>
<div>Dell Precision 7730, Intel i7-8750H, 40G RAM, 3x M2 SSDs (OS, Projects, Samples)</div>
<div>Clean install of Windows 10 Pro, build 1903&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Audio Interface: PreSonus Quantum 2 (Thunderbolt 2, connected via recommended/tested startech TB3-&gt;2 adapter)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I've tried so far that has not resolved the issue:</div>
<div>
<div>Set power mode to "Best Performance, additional settings to Max everything, set Minimum processor state to 100%</div>
<div>Disable ACPI-Compliant Control Method battery in device manager</div>
<p>Update BIOS, all firmware and all drivers (seriously, have gone over with a fine-tooth comb. Really ALL, and have tried both Dell and original vendor for any where available)<br />
In BIOS:&nbsp;<br />
Turned off C-states<br />
Turn off Intel TurboBooost<br />
Turn off Intel Speedstep<br />
Turn off Intel Speed Shift<br />
Set "thunderbolt adapter configuration" to "no security"<br />
Uninstall "Intel Dynamic Platform &amp; Thermal Framework"<br />
Uninstall Bonjour, MaxxAudioPro, OneDrive, XBox Companion, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Weather, Mail and Calendar, Solitaire, OneNote, Office, Paint3d, Print3d, Sticky Notes, Voice Recorder, Groove Music<br />
bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes (run cmd as administrator)<br />
Install Latency-Mon and Process Lasso, observe that high DPC latency processes limited to cores 0, 2, and 10.&nbsp; Set process affinity in Process Lasso for studioone.exe to avoid those cores.<br />
Turn off "energy efficient ethernet" in advanced options of ethernet connection<br />
Turn off "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" in power management tab for both ethernet and wireless nic<br />
Set roaming aggressiveness to "lowest" for Wireless nic<br />
Turn off "Link Power Management" in Intel Rapid storage technology&nbsp;<br />
Turn off Windows system sounds<br />
Set Performance Options, adjust for best performance of Background Services<br />
Performance Options -&gt; Visual Effects "Adjust for best performance"<br />
Advanced &gt; Data Execution Prevention &gt; ensured set for DEP for essential Windows programs and services only.<br />
Settings-&gt;Privacy-&gt;Background Apps-&gt; Let apps run in the background = Off<br />
Device Manager &gt; Universal Serial Bus Controllers &gt; right-click on a "USB Root Hub" &gt; Properties &gt; Power Management &gt; deselect "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" &gt; press "OK."&nbsp;<br />
Device Manager -&gt; Sound, Video and game controllers -&gt; Disable "AMD High Definition Audio Device", "Intel Display Audio", and "Realtek(R) Audio"<br />
Turn off "Allow downloads from other PCs" in windows update delivery optimization<br />
In power &amp; sleep, set both screen and sleep timeout to "never"<br />
In power options-&gt; system settings, set power button to "shutdown", remove sleep from shutdown settings<br />
In power options ensure "Turn on Fast Startup" is deselected<br />
Task Manager -&gt; Startup -&gt; Disable "Realtek HD Audio Universal Service"<br />
Task Manager -&gt; Startup -&gt; Disable Waves MaxxAudio Service Application"<br />
</p>
</div>
<div>There are a rash of people returning or selling their Windows based notebooks, as this issue renders them nearly unusable for multitrack audio recording.&nbsp; The clicking goes away if one raises the buffer size (nomenclature differs depending on software),
 but this makes the audio latency unusable for recording in sync with previous tracks.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Matthew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you seen these articles on the subject:
<br /><a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/solving-dpc-latency-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/s...</a>

<br /><a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=62139&amp;p=558868&amp;hilit=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.soundonsound.com/forum/viewtopic.ph...</a>
<br /><a href="https://homerecording.com/bbs/general-discussions/digital-recording-and-computers/clicks-pops-skips-fix-your-dpc-latency-now-283418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://homerecording.com/bbs/general-discussio...</a>
<br />
<br />For due diligence, I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1)  Update the sound driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Next try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back the version in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />Finally,   If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi thanks, yes I did go through all of those articles and have gone through their recommended actions in an attempt to resolve this (summarized in my list of things I've tried) as well as basic sound functionality as you mention. I have started several
 times from a clean Windows 10 install, with various builds tried. This is a more a more fundamental issue with the way that ACPI.sys impacts DPC latency on essentially all Windows notebooks.&nbsp; This impacts users of audio recording software, high-end gamers,
 and other users with latency-sensitive applications.&nbsp;

<p>I have the same issue, also with a Dell Laptop (G7 7790)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an experienced system tuner, I run Win10 LTSC 2019 for pro audio applications, and have tried literally everything under the sun, including disabling the ACPI-compliant control method battery (which results in blue screens).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm to the point of suspecting that it's something to do with the Dell hardware's implementation of power management in Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In LatencyMon tests on my previous rig, an ASUS GL702-VM, ACPI.sys doesnt even appear in the top 10 of problematic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that anyone can suggest in dealing with ACPI.sys on a Dell system?</p>

<p>There's a reason it was rated unhelpful.. I felt compelled to join the forums today just after I saw this post.. As a senior MVP you have zero idea what you are talking about in your reply, and giving solutions that will not do anything to address DPC latency..
 (deferred procedure call). Honestly, there is not ONE helpful thing in your reply. That said, you meant well but it was a bit disconcerting to see you talk about your status there and get so offended.. Terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it's been some time, but to address the original question.. Without drastic measures, It's nigh on unfixable in Dell laptops...disabling wireless and ethernet will usually help a LOT, sometimes even bluetooth. But then you lose so much functionality
 of your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also got to do with the motherboard and bios and the audio card driver has never affected it as far as I know.</p>
<p>If using an external audio interface it doesn't hurt to disable the onboard one though in any case.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that can often single handedly solve it is disabling acpi battery management but this means you lose BATTERY POWER MANAGEMENT and it *may* even stop the laptop charging the battery!</p>
<p>I can NOT recommend doing this and will not be held responsible if you do.. but sadly, on laptops that have a high DPC, this is sometimes the only fix.<br />
</p>
<p>To put it in simple terms, DPC latency occurs when a driver takes longer than normal to complete a process. This is why sometimes people think that it's the audio card driver but it's in fact, other parts of the system competing for resources and having
 this driver issue (why it also often happens with nvidia gaming card drivers and people who work in audio use the microsoft standard video driver), and therefore interrupting the audio interface's communication with the OS.</p>
<p>This is also why setting an interface at a high ASIO latency can overcome the issue as the interface communicates at a rate that give the other device delays time to be sorted, however as we all know in the music scene, we want as low latency as our computer
 can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, to use bootcamp on my macbook to any reasonable degree, I sadly have to disable acpi, otherwise DPC latency is nuts.. On my imac pro it's fantastic and using windows is faster and more fun than OS X, so i'll actually build my next audio workstation
 based on Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, if it ends up that you need to disable ACPI, re enable it before you reboot your machine!! Don't forget! You'll need to disable it on each reboot this way but it ensures the machine will boot correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, DPC Latency also doesn't just affect audio applications but can appear as micro delays in games with video or audio/sync issues, etc. Low DPC latency is always a GOOD thing, it is never bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, and I mean this sincerely, never, EVER buy a dell "hell" laptop for audio production. The Alienware area 51 DOES "just pass" latency mon but I am guessing that's due to having a 9900K in there and desktop grade parts.. and even then.. it's borderline..
 only Dell could do that to a machine not designed to idle at ultra low power lol! Check out the competing MSI GT76 titan for example.. the lowest DPC latency I have EVER seen in a laptop, and can be used quietly for audio production too believe it or not.
 Just so darn expensive!&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of Dell's other laptops fail as do HP Omen..<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop popular brands quick overview for audio production:</p>
<p>Gaming laptops that pass with flying colours are much of the Clevo range which a few different OEM's use (Sager, Metabox, others). In fact I am pretty sure the current models all pass. This is why ALL pro audio builders use only Clevo shells for audio production
 laptops. They also have workstation models with the main difference being quadro graphics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo's gaming ones are hit or miss (usually miss), but much of their workstation range is fine.. Many MSI gaming and workstation pass, in fact I only have seen one major model this year that's failed (the GP75).
</p>
<p>Asus are hit and miss but DO have a couple models that perform fine for audio production though (avoid Scar II/III &amp; Zephyrus),.. it's just hard to know which ones unless you see reviews that actually use the latencymon utility to test them (more on that
 below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gigabyte.. usually a miss also.. Sadly, even their very latest aero model fails you can see here.<br />
https://youtu.be/W64J7_Md1I4?t=436</p>
<p>Jarrod is now my go to reviewer as he includes latencymon results in all his laptop reviews starting about 8 months ago.</p>
<p>Two other randoms - Vapor Pro (aftershock) and Mag 15 (Eluktronics) pass easily. Same internals different brand.. it's in collaboration with Intel therefore I am not surprised it passed.. It also has excellent thermals and performance!</p>
<p>Personally the next time I buy a laptop it will be a custom build Clevo 8 core, or an MSI.. it's really that simple. I want something that can game well and work at low latency in a DAW well (I also use Studio One, as well as Cubase).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps somewhat, and at least can help someone else reading it in future.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same issue with my Dell inspiron 15 7000 Gaming.</p>
<p>Nothing would work properly:</p>
<p>Focusrite 2i4</p>
<p>Behringer XR18</p>
<p>Even the onboard audio crackled every now and then....</p>
<p>The solution is to get rid of some services that Dell installs in your computer.</p>
<p>Stopping all adobe services also helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>See screenshot attached :)</p>

<p>After spending several hours and trying every possible thing, your advice seems to be the only one that actually worked. Don't want to celebrate too early, but Latencymon says everything is okay now after I disabled all Dell services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much, you saved me some time and probably money too cause I was thinking of taking my laptop (Dell 7567) to a repair shop.</p>

            Good to hear that that someone seemed to find a solution- I ended up giving up on Dell. Luckily, Best Buy accepted my return, even though it was a bit past the due date, and I went with an HP Omen instead, which works perfectly *without any hassle* My
 advice is that if you can, stay completely away from Dell if you are a Pro Audio user, until they fix their issues- which it seems as of Feb 2020 to be still unsolved.&nbsp; So if you have bought one, and have a chance to return it, do so immediately and save yourself
 a lot of grief.&nbsp;

<p>Nope, its pre-owned, so can't give it back or replace it unfortunately. Besides, I am more or less satisfied with my Dell (only had Acer and desktop before): nice cooling, sturdy build, was pretty cheap compared to other similar laptops, etc. I got these
 sound problems about a week ago, everything was perfect up until that time since summer 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I heard that HP laptops are a nightmare in terms of repairs and maintenance, maybe those are just rumours or outdated info. I would pick Asus if only they did not look like a sacrificial altar.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows XP boot option gone after Windows 10 upgrade. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juan_olivier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP boot option gone after Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 7 and Windows XP installed on two different partitions on 1 hard drive. On boot I got the option if I want Windows XP or 7 to boot. After I upgraded my Windows 7 with Windows 10 those options are gone. I only get the option of booting Windows
 10 or and earlier windows version. Every time I chose the earlier windows version option the computer just restarts. How do I restore my Windows XP boot option?</p>

            <p><strong>A little background first...</strong></p>
<p>With the release of Windows 8 and Windows 10, many new computers are shipping with UEFI firmware in place of the legacy, BIOS firmware. This changes the way operating systems load and interact with the hardware on your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what does this mean for me?</strong></p>
<p>If your PC is set to boot in EFI mode, Microsoft has blocked the loading of legacy Windows operating systems in the boot menu. This includes Windows 9x, Windows XP, and Server 2003. You also can't add Linux or DOS entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then how was I able to dual-boot Windows XP before I installed Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Some newer PCs continue to include the older, legacy boot in addition to EFI-boot. It is likely that Windows 7 and XP were installed using legacy boot, and the Windows 10 install used EFI boot during its installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is the solution?</strong></p>
<p>You have two options: you can revert to using legacy boot, or you can use a GRUB boot loader instead of the Windows Boot Manager. The first option requires a reinstall of Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Recordings are retained for a period of 30 days only in cloud. After that it is deleted from the cloud.
<br />
<br />My sincere apologies. After 30 days you can't retrieve it from cloud. You will need to download it within 30 days period only.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>CD-ROM driver not found during Windows 7 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael entin  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD-ROM driver not found during Windows 7 installation</h2>
                    I'm installing Windows 7 on a fresh built box, P55-based motherboard.<br />
Just after starting the setup (from CD-ROM), the installer complained that it can't find the CD-ROM driver. I've tried to load Intel INF files, but it did not help. Both 32-bit and 64-bit installers had that problem.<br />
<br />
The CD-ROM is quite a generic NEC IDE DVD-ROM - a generic IDE DVD-ROM driver should work for it, should not it?<br />
<br />
Luckily, I had another CD-ROM (Lite-On DVD writer), and after plugging that in, Windows 7 started the installation, without any additional drivers at all.<br />
<br />
So it is working fine now, but why did not Windows 7 recognize the original DVD-ROM, and I lost couple hours trying to figure out what's wrong? It is a generic NEC DVD-ROM, a standard DVD driver should work! The DVD worked fine for many years with XP and Vista,
 and obviously works now since the installer was running from it.

            It's possible since you indicated it an old unit and I take it only a DVD-ROM not Read/Write device Windows 7 really can not detect the device properly during the install. Have you tried connecting it now that Windows 7 is up and running?

<h2>            Windows update appears stuck at &#34;downloading updates 100&#37;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have spent 4 hours trying to get Windows to install these updates with no luck. I have had it been stuck at 33%, and when I have done troubleshooting it has told me that "there are updates, and some update files are corrupted, would you like to fix them?"
 Then sometimes it fixes something, but I still can't update, then I troubleshoot again, but troubleshoot gets stuck at "checking registry keys".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it seems like the update has gone the farthest so far. It says "downloading updates 100%", and it's been like this for an hour. I'm unsure if it's stuck or if it's still downloading stuff and it's super frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update code is KB4048954. The troubleshoot error code (and also manual installation error code) is 0x800705b4, and in update history it says the following about this update:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I apologise if this question has been answered already, it just feels like the answered ones do not apply to my specific situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Pavilion Notebook, on the bottom right, a "?" symbol with "!!" highlighted in yellow appears, when you hover over this "?", it tells you "Important actions needed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ten updates that I supposedly need to update. I have needed these for around a year now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every now and then I get notified that my computer will download these updates in "20 minutes"... then when I say OK, nothing happens. Then when I manually try to download them, this happens :</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong? I have plenty of space. Decided to ignore this issue for a long time. Has been what feels like a year now. Only decided to come to the forum, because now on the home screen, there I a slight lag to even log into my laptop. This
 laptop is in mint condition. I just don't understand. Eternal gratitude to whoever can help me.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi mjstk, 
<br />
<br />So these updates are coming from an HP application, not windows, and off the top of my head I don’t know where that update cache lives. I’ll do some digging and see if I can figure that out. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried to download / install just 1 at a time? It’s possible 1 update is causing all of them to bomb out... Try one, and even if no luck, try another. Let me know, and we’ll try to figure this out!
<br />- C

<p>Hey Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kicking myself for not giving all the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried downloading each of these 10 updates individually. Have also realised this is an HP issue, and have posted on their forum also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yeah, unfortunately I cannot download these updates one-by-one, no matter what order I try them in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot even begin to describe how thankful I am for the quick response. Will post updates from the HP forum as they come(if they come...).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            No worries at all, likewise, I appreciate your quick response and additional info. 
<br />
<br />Let me do some digging about why these aren’t working and I’ll get back to you. 
<br />
<br />Couple of other questions, Click start - Settings - Updates and Security - Windows Updates - any updates pending? If so, let’s get those installed on your PC. 
<br />
<br />Next, do you have a 3rd party AV/Firewall on your PC? Sometimes those will block certain downloads... even if it’s from a trusted source like HP.

<p>I use and recommend a little freeware background program called<br />
AllChars. This lets me type many common special characters (many of<br />
these are used in other languages) very easily, by pressing the ctrl<br />
key followed by a two-character mnemonic combination.</p>
<p>For example, for с the two characters are ~ and n. For з it's c and ,<br />
For ь it's u and "</p>

 with clean drives and now the issue is still there but it sort of varies,It'll increase(sometimes stay at 100%)for a while and then decrease.Any more suggestions?

            Hello,I tried a cocktail of solutions along with clean reinstall(Disabled services that were at the top of disk usage) and so far the disk usage is still shooting up and down(But to a lesser degree).So far I have no freezes.I'll provide the log files if
 I encounter a freeze. <br />
<br />
EDIT:A freeze occured so I had to force shutdown my laptop.Uploading files soon.

That's the DMP file(Minidump).Thing is,I reset the windows but kept the files a few hrs ago so that's from the windows.old directory if that matters.Secondly,Because of the clean re-install I only have the 1 DMP file(Sorry).<br />

<h2>            &#91;RESOLVED&#93; Windows 10&#58; Volume Control Triggers Screen To Flash and Speakers To Beep &#40;BUG&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>The ISSUE IS RESOLVED...&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>&nbsp;November 12, 2015 Windows Update (</strong></span><span><strong>Version 1511).</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue appears to be between Windows 10 Pro and Logitech keyboard G510...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When changing the volume with the control wheel, the screen will go black and then the speakers will beep. This will happen several times depending on how much you spin the wheel...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a drivers issue, though there do not appear to be any updates, this is most likely due to Windows 10 just being released a few days ago...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted driver updates from motherboard manufacturer ASUS as I am using an ASUS M4A78T-E motherboard... I have also attempted to acquire drivers from VIA as the the audio is the built-in VIA VT1708S, there are no driver updates for Windows 10 for
 either...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also updated the drivers for my EVGA NVIDIA 750ti graphics card (Version 353.62)...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also downloaded Logitech Gaming Software designed for the keyboard (Software Version 8.70.315), this does not repair the issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not the only one reporting this issue, there are several others that are reporting the issue, I am sure that there are quite a few that have not reported the issue...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been a fix for the issue, though it is NOT an official fix from either Microsoft of Logitech...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is aware of an OFFICIAL FIX please let me and any others know in the comments below, so that we are able to have our computers functioning properly.</p>
<p><br />
**BUG** Causes graphics drivers to drop when adjusting volume from keyboard. ONLY FIX KNOWN IS TO AUTOSCRIPT...&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Answer: No, I do not get any error messages or codes... Just the symptoms that I have mentioned in the above posting... The symptoms listed started after only the Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Operating System was installed, and prior to any third party
 software being installed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Response: Performed Clean Boot, when starting Windows 10 Pro, there was no way to reproduce the issue for me, as I was unable to adjust the sound... &nbsp;</p>

            Yes, I can confirm that this is happening to me as well. Not sure what the cause of this can be but making an educated observation, I would say it
<em>might</em> have something to do with the audio slider that pops up in the top left corner. When adjusting the audio from the task bar, there are no issues. However, when using the the slider that is integrated from a Logitech keyboard for example, it causes
 the audio slider widget to appear and that might be the root of the problem.

            <p>I also experience the same problem. Every time I try to adjust the volume with the wheel anywhere above 12, the symptoms appear. The higher the volume, the symptoms manifest more frequently. At and above ~65 they manifest nearly each second even if I stop
 the adjusting and leave it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, adjusting to 66 and leaving it there makes the symptoms manifest about every 1.5 seconds.</p>

            <p>I also have the problem with a flashing black screen when turning the volume wheel.</p>
<p>Updated my Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Installed newest Logitech Gaming Software and Graphic Card Drivers (Nvidia Geforce 970).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the volume wheel on the G510 very slowly everything works ok. When I turn it a little bit quicker, the flash appears and I hear a Beep. When I turn the wheel very quick multiple flashes and beeps occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran the&nbsp;System file check some errors occured and are fixed, but the problem still exists.</p>

            <p>I know you are just covering our bases, but I'm 95% sure that the problem is with our G510 device drivers. &nbsp;These Microsoft knowledge tree experts are just going to tell you to do whatever their little knowledge base says when they type in 'user is reporting
 problems with his keyboard'</p>
<p>
</p><p>They don't care that literally everyone who owns a G510 and has upgraded or clean installed Windows 10, is experiencing this issue. &nbsp;After they exhaust their given list of scans and tests, they will simply tell us the problem exists on the hardware side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unofficial fix basically remaps the volume slider to have a buffer and slow down your spin of it to below the blinking threshold. &nbsp;So that means it could be simply taken care of in the device drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: 8/17/2015<br />
As of now, I am no longer experiencing this blinking and beeping. &nbsp;I used the method others are reporting worked for them of rapidly increasing and decreasing the volume all the way. &nbsp;After about 20 seconds of this, the beeping and flashing stopped and the
 volume wheel has worked correctly since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone else with the problem.</p>

            <p>G510s here, same issue. Running a Razer Lachesis (4000 dpi, not 5600) mouse as well, in case it has something to do with the software suite trying to interface with non-supported devices (doubt it, but never hurts to mention).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally find this happens only on system startup (or resume from standby) until I allow the OSD to disappear. After doing so, further use of the volume wheel seems to work fine without triggering it. It seems to be something to do with hitting the limits
 on the volume, either minimum or maximum. Can't trigger it easily enough to find out more without repeatedly restarting, at the moment it's more of a yellow flag annoyance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by others, it's likely an issue from the upgraded Win7 driver, though why it's representing itself in this manner I can't figure out. Will probably dig into it later on when I run out of bigger issues to sort out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Disregard the bit about it being rare. Seems it does have to do with adjusting too fast while the OSD is fading in or out. Updated my software as best Logitech provides, no change. Not surprising really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: I've found if on startup you rapidly change your volume up and down through the entire range, stopping for a few seconds every time it starts the beep/flash ****, in less than a minute it will have worked out its idiosyncrasies and be functional.
 At least for a while, I haven't tested if the problem re-emerges after being on for an extended period.</p>

            <p>As additional information to my post: this did not happen for me under Windows 8 or 8.1, and I always relied on Windows to use whatever driver it wants to install for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
So it is definitely a Windows 10 problem. Fix it.</p>

            I have 2 PC's running Win7. &nbsp;The first PC backs up to the NDAS drive using Win backup without problem since day one but the 2nd PC always produces this same error message. &nbsp;There is always something written to the backup location but it is small and probably
 some header or other identification. &nbsp;I have tried a different NDAS drive with 2 partitions and successfully backup the 1st PC to one partition but still cannot backup the 2nd PC on the other. &nbsp;It is obviously an issue with the Win backup system but I can't
 decript the error message.

<p><br />

            I have two customers with Windows XP having the same problem. Yes, the ads come through in safe mode as well. It's not constant - it starts and stops randomly. I opened Task Manager and ended the process svchost using the most memory and it quit until
 I rebooted. I tried creating a new user and it still persisted. Ran Malwarebytes - reports: no issues/clean. Does this info help? Any suggestions?<br />

    <title>How do I find the real product key for my Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I find the real product key for my Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Hey all. So I purchased Windows 7 Professional a few years back through Microsoft's student discount program. I want to reformat but unfortunately have no earthly idea where or what the product key is. Unfortunately, I opted for the simple and quick version
 of downloading it so I never got physical copies of anything. I tried Belarc and Magical Jelly Bean, both displayed BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB as the key. However, Belarc DID display my key as BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB-6W8WQ.
<div>Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated. And sorry if this problem has already been asked and solved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For the record, this IS NOT an illegally acquired/pirated version of Windows.</div>
<div>And yes, I do have the original DVD installation files.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing this my folders that contained videos how started generating Thumbnails.</p>
