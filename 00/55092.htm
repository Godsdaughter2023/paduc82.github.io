            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>HEre are a few things you can try:</div>
<div><br />
<div>What happens when you run IE 8.0 with no add-ons? Click the Start button&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools&gt;Internet explorer (No Add-ons).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Otherwise try resetting IE8:</div>
<div>1.) Open IE 8<br />
2.) Press the ALT key<br />
3.) Click&nbsp;<strong>Tools | Internet Options<br />
</strong>4.) Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab<br />
5.) Click the big button at the bottom that says "RESET..." on it and follow the prompts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How about if you download and install Firefox, do you get the same problems? If not then there might be some programs that is affecting IE8. It might be worth reinstalling it - after backing up your favorites.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            How do I access my files from my old hard drive with windows&#63;</h2>
                    I was running a Dell Dimension 8200 and the motherboard died. I was running Windows XP SP2 and had a password on my administrator account. I now have the hard drive in an enclosure and hooked up to my laptop, but when I try to access "My Documents" from
 the old hard drive it says the folder is secure. I know the password since it is my folder, but it doesn't give me an opportunity to enter a password. I think what I need to do is be able to boot up windows from the enclosure hard drive, or access the "My
 Documents" from the enclosure hard drive using my regular laptop windows. Please help! I have 10 years of pictures and documents saved in the old hard drive and I desperately need to recover them. Thanks for your help!

    <title>How to only use OneDrive when I want to use OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to only use OneDrive when I want to use OneDrive</h2>
                    OneDrive is trying to take over my computer. Everything seems to be defaulting to saving files there.
<strong>I DON'T WANT THAT!!!&nbsp;</strong>It's extremely aggravating. I want files to go where I want them to go, not where OneDrive thinks they should go. If I want to save something to OneDrive, I will specifically save it to OneDrive, otherwise it should stay
<strong>ONLY </strong>on my computer. I don't want to have to repeatedly tell programs to save to the correct spot. I want
<strong>NO </strong>defaults going to OneDrive, PERIOD, NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH, NADA. When I install programs, they should default to saving on my computer not OneDrive. Is this possible? Will If have to constantly reset this after Window updates?&nbsp;

            Hi NealMcGuire 
<br />
<br />OneDrive is getting harder to control, and is beginning to take over Windows 10
<br />
<br />The best option may be what I do, and that is to uninstall OneDrive totally from your PC, then when you want to backup files to OneDrive, you can log into OneDrive in a web browser and drag your files into the OenDrive page
<br />
<br />
<br />Right click the OneDrive icon on the right hand side of your Taskbar and choose Settings 
<br />
<br />In settings, you will see 'Unlink this PC/My Account' select that option 
<br />
<br />OneDrive will no longer try to sync your files 
<br />
<br />Then depending on the version of OneDrive you have, you need to uninstall it . .. 
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter 
<br />Go to Programs and features, find OneDrive, select that and choose Uninstall
<br />
<br />If you do not find OneDrive in Control Panel: 
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu) 
<br />In the list of Apps, find OneDrive, select that and choose Uninstall
        </p>

<p>Maybe that is the way I will have to go. I like having OneDrive as an easily accessed storage source that can be shared with others. Its great for sharing files and screen shots. But it's becoming virus like. Files that I never wanted to be stored off my
 computer are finding their way onto it. In most cases it's because a default saving location was changed without my direct consent or the consent hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If OneDrive can't be reigned in, I will have to treat it like any other virus and remove it from my computer. There are third party service that can replace it that I can control.</p>

<p>Relax. This is really easy to solve. The solution here, as in similar situations, is to learn how OneDrive works, and then make it work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two parts to OneDrive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- OneDrive is the default storage location for Microsoft Office, and possibly for other apps from Microsoft. That's easy to change - simply change the default storage location to where you want. I'll illustrate with Microsoft Word:</p>
<p>
</p><p>File &gt; Options &gt; Save &gt; Save to computer by default</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Did you know that you can make Google Drive the default save location for Microsoft? Isn't that fun?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- OneDrive syncs files and folders of your choice to your OneDrive account online. That too is easy to change - start by opening OneDrive settings. That's how to make OneDrive work
<em>your way</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in the Account tab click on the Choose folders button. That's where you tell OneDrive which folders to sync. Either remove the checkmarks from every folder, so nothing gets synced, or create a 'dummy' folder - that's a folder that serves no
 real purpose - and make that the only folder that syncs. Of course, you'll store nothing in that folder. Isn't that deliciously wicked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same thing to Windows Media Player back in the day, when it&nbsp;<em>insisted</em> that I have a default location where it can store files for me. No thank you, Windows Media Player:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e321ce8-d0c0-4624-8963-63aa742fd8c8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e321ce8-d0c0-4624-8963-63aa742fd8c8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to settings in OneDrive: In the Settings tab you can decide whether you want OneDrive to start automatically when you sign in to Windows; back in the Account tab you can unlink your PC altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're getting the idea, right? Don't get mad - get smart! There are settings and work-arounds for almost everything. And where there aren't ... in a matter of time someone will publish a utility that does what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how we make Windows 10 do as we like <em>withou</em><em>t causing problems for our computers in the future</em>. The alternative is to find ways to break Windows 10. That, of course, is nuts.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for you reply, but I already know all that. Those are steps that I have taken time and time again. The problem is that OneDrive/Windows keeps reaching out and grabbing them back. It seems like every time there is an update to either office or windows
 I have to go out and repeat those steps. That and it appears to be grabbing other programs also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently downloaded photos with Adobe Bridge. Now Adobe is not likely to want me to use OneDrive. Yet when I went to look for the photos, guess where they were? Somehow a "Picture" folder was one my OneDrive.<br />
</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I gave you the same steps that I followed. Nothing has ever reverted for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think - don't react. How did Adobe store photos in OneDrive (if that in fact is the way it happened?) Somehow, it got the message to store photos there ... how did it get that message? That's what you have to figure out, because if you work&nbsp;<em>within</em>
 the system, it will work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an idea to start:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the very beginning, Windows has had 'default' locations for your files. The default location is where your files go if you don't tell Windows otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default location for my pictures is the Pictures folder in my user account. That's:</p>
<p>
</p><p>D:\Users\S and S\Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I store all my personal files in a separate partition.) What is the default storage location for your Pictures? Unless you told Adobe otherwise, your pictures are going to their default location. If the default location is OneDrive, change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: There's a reason why Microsoft chose OneDrive as a default place to store files, and it's not just that they're being self-serving. Microsoft is trying
<em>very hard </em>to move Windows to the cloud ... because that's where the future is. Google has been there from the very beginning and they are absolutely killing Microsoft in that way. That's why you can buy a kicka$$ Chromebook for a fraction of what it
 costs to buy a Windows PC, and that's why Chromebooks update with 1/10 th the drama of a Windows update.</p>

<p>I am going to disable the onedrive virus. I'm also considering filing a formal complaint with the state AG. I was doing some cleanup on my outlook and found that Microsoft OneDrive has switched my archive folder to Onedrive. That was not a change that I
 approved and I do not want my personal email stored on Microsoft drives. To me this is theft of personal information and should not be allowed without very specific authorization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a shame because Onedrive offers some very good feature that I like. It's great for share files and integrates well with the OS. But it is acting more like a virus designed to steal information than a benefit.</p>

<p>You should do what you feel you need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only natural for Microsoft ... and Verizon and Apple and Facebook, Google, Comcast, Adobe, etc. etc. to do what they can to get you to use their products. That's how business is done, for better or worse. Rather than contacting the Attorney General,
 why not learn how to make the software work the way you want it to work while you still can. Try avoiding Google's heavy hand - good luck!</p>

<p>You do realize, that with the exception of Adobe, each of those companies are having legal problems related to privacy concerns. Facebook was just slapped with a 5 billion dollar fine, Google is under attack for it's privacy issue, Microsoft Office was banned
 from some school in Germany.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how software works. Stating that all you need to do is change the save paths to somewhere other than OneDrive is naive. There are dozens if not hundreds of places that the path needs to be changed. Then they have to be monitored to make sure that
 they are not changed back. Even with my default document directory set up be on my C: drive and the document folder deleted from OneDrive, it still recreated the OneDrive "document" folder and redirect application to save there. That is sure as hell not a
 wanted feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Companies are welcome to work on new and improved features. As a customer I also can tell them that I don't like those features. And when a company crosses the line bevelant to malicious I have a right to formally complain.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Background selections for Jigsaw</h2>
                    <p>This is really a feature request for Microsoft Jigsaw, so it it should be somewhere else, please let me know.&nbsp; I would like to see more lighter tone and brightness background choices.&nbsp; This is more important than ever with the release of the 600 piece puzzles.&nbsp; The only two light ones are a bright off-white and a wood grain.&nbsp; Depending on the puzzle it can be difficult to see pieces of certain colors.&nbsp; Lighter shades of gray, green, brown, tan are a few choices.&nbsp; Maybe a few more selections for the standard version and many more for&nbsp;premium.&nbsp; BTW, I notice that sometimes when changing backgrounds it can shift the Ghosted Image, especially on my Microsoft Surface Book.</p><p>I&nbsp;really like this program, though it sometimes acts strangely different on different PCs I use.&nbsp; I don't know how many puzzles I've solved.&nbsp; That would be a nice feature to have as well.&nbsp; I do have over 220,000 credits, but that doesn't really show how many

            <p>What does "not working" mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ffa800c-3fe6-4ab6-989e-a4e21af3744e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ffa800c-3fe6-4ab6-989e-a4e21af3744e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when XP feels threatened
 by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa2b55d8-046b-4d51-86a8-73e93ae8f650" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!
</p>

    <title>Have to keep restarting router to solve MTU problems &#40;Belkin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rory skywalker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have to keep restarting router to solve MTU problems &#40;Belkin router&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, me again - thought I had this sussed. I cannot get on to Xbox live and less I do a soft restart on my Belkin N router - as in, clicking "Restart Router" from the IP settings page, not by switching it off at the plug and turning it back on again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I've done the soft restart it then signs in no problem - otherwise it won't do it. I can't find the MTU setting in my router config as it's cable and the connection type is dynamic. On my friend's Belkin, he has ADSL and I can se the MTU settings in
 the PPPoE section. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? I don't want to have to keep booting my PC up to soft restart the router everytime I want to sign in. I've been using Xbox live for two and half years with the same wireless set up and Belkin router and never really had a persistant problem like
 this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help! Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Rory Skywalker</p>

<p>Shad0wmanUK - thanks for this but it hasn't worked. I have to restart my router EVERY time in the IP settings page to get it to connect. Keeps saying the MTU isn't high enough otherwise. This is SO frustrating as it used to work fine. I did lower my broadband
 from 20mb to 10mb - would this have anything to do with it? The two seem to tie up or just coinscidenc? Hope you can help!</p>

<p>Your with Virgin then yes? They do have some issues with Live at the moment but I wouldn't expect it to show up as MTU really. You can prove its the Belkin by connecting direct to the modem as a test (you will have to power off the modem before swapping
 it over to the Xbox).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it works ok with a direct connection you know Virgin is fine and its the Belkin. What is the exact model of Belkin it will be printed on a sticker underneath and starts with F. Also what firmware is it running?</p>

<p>I updated the firmware yesterday and that seems to have made no difference. My problem with testing it directly is that I have NO ethernet cable downstairs. I suppose I could hook it all up in the spare room - a bit of faffing about but, as you say, it could
 highlight that it's the Belkin. I'll test it later today - as for the model number, I'll let you know about that, too! Thanks so much for your help so far!

<p>I think we may have got there. I plugged the Xbox into the modem directly via the ethernet and it connected to Live straight away! I then took it back downstairs, hooked it all up again and tried to get it connected wirelessly. Failed - this time saying
 something about a DNS server error. The PC upstairs also said "There's a conflict of IP address with another device on the network" - the Xbox? The connection test results then said to restart the router by turning it off and on again - I did this at the plug
 (not by restarting it in the config settings page). I then powered the Xbox up and VOILA! Connected to Xbox live! I then turned it off and tried again - no problem, connected within seconds. So - first of all, I think we got there and second - WHY/HOW did
 this work (ie connecting it to the ethernet directly etc) - does it reset the IP address or confirm it or something? I'm dying to know how/why you thought this would work so I can bear it in mind for the future! Thanks again, Shad0wmanUK - look forward to
 hearing from you! - Rory Skywalker</p>

<p>Hi,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well connecting direct to the modem is a basic way to connect so I would expect that to work fine it was really about proving it was the route and not Virgin. As for it working when you put it back well doing a cold boot (turning off at the plug) as opposed
 to a soft boot (reset via the router menu) can work wonders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how is it set-up now then? Is it set-up as per that link I posted?</p>

<p>Shad0wmanUk, well thing is, I'd already done umpteen cold reboots, the router/modem do not get left on, I switch it off when it's all not being used. The cold reboot wasn't helping at all, it was the soft reboot that was allowing me to gain access to Live.
 It's now back downstairs with the wireless adapter pluged in, Belkin PreN router upstairs and connecting. And yes, thanks for the suggested settings, I've done that, added the ".120" to the end of the IP address in the box etc. As I said, I tried it earlier
 twice after setting it all up back downstairs and it worked. Off out for an hour or so, will try it when I get in. Will let you know! Thanks again for all your help and correspondance so far! - Rory Skywalker</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live currency balance set to expire</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently at a point in my life where I don't have any time to dedicate to playing video games. I've been an Xbox Live Gold subscriber for almost a decade now and I feel like I've been a great customer to Microsoft. I have a current cash balance that
 is part of my Xbox Live Gold subscription that is set to expire on June 1, 2015. I would really like a refund on my remaining cash balance. I feel that is a reasonable request considering the points are set to expire. It would be unfortunate on my end that
 this money go to waste and would definitely affect my relationship with Microsoft in a negative way if an exception not be made. I appreciate your understanding regarding this issue.</p>

<p>What a bunch of BS. I did contact support and discussed this matter with billing and they suggested I post on the forum.. This is typical of any business who lacks in customer support/satisfaction - "let's just redirect said person to another department
 so we don't have to deal with them".... Microsoft is garbage. Xbox/Microsoft won't see anymore of my money.</p>

<h2>            Fable 2 for Steam</h2>
                    What will it take to get Microsoft to add Fable 2 to Steam? Many users including myself would really love to see this come to Steam and I'm sure Microsoft would get some extra profit by doing so.

<h2>            Highlight misspelled words</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just have a fresh installed Windows 10 Pro with all latest updates. And I have to languages: ENG (US) and RUS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I type some random word like "sadfg" in application in windows (Steam, Discord, Chrome) it`s highlight the word with red line like misspelled.I turn off all this in settings auto-correct and highlight, restart but still I see this highlights. If I write
 something strange in Russian it not highlighting. So my question: What should I do to&nbsp; get rid of this highlighting in ENG (US) keyboard language?</p>
<p>

<br />I would also recommend you submit a feature request; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project Draco</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone heard much about this title</p>
<p>Well here's a video:<br />
&nbsp;http://youtu.be/R8GJZbvsxxU</p>
<p>( if some one wants to PM me about how to embed them in posts it would be great, I can't seem to get it to work.)<br />
<br />
here is a blurb on it.<br />
[quote]&nbsp;</p>
<div>Speaking to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6572/from_panzer_to_draco_yukio_.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Gamasutra</span></a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://joystiq.com/game/project-draco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Project
 Draco</span></a></span>&nbsp;lead Yukio Futatsugi and producer Toshiharu Tange laid out several details about the upcoming Kinect title. First and foremost, it won't actually be called&nbsp;<em>Project Draco</em>&nbsp;on release, though the final title has yet to be decided.
 The pair also expressed some of the difficulties in developing a title for Kinect.<br />
<br />
One such issue is that different players will perform actions in different ways. "Previously you could just say 'Press the A button' and everyone got that, but trying to catch all the possible ranges of motion can be tough to implement," said Futatsugi.<br />
<br />
The pair also discussed some of the processes behind how they create the worlds of their games, including the classic Panzer Dragoon series and&nbsp;<em>Phantom Dust</em>. According to Futatsugi, a good portion of the fantasy is reliant on "lies." Or, to put it
 more clearly, about 70 percent of his games are "created with a 'realistic' bent," while around 30 percent focuses on "stuff you would never see in real life, such as the supernatural abilities people have." And, you know, riding around on&nbsp;<em>dragons</em>.
 Check out Gamasutra for the full interview. [/quote]</div>

<div>Details released so far have the game being an on rails experience, Similar to Panzer Dragoon. The game will be 3 player co-op with unlockable dragon types and a level system to increase the power of the dragon. I am not sure how much
 replayability an on rails dragon shoot er game will have. But it is being described as a Hardcore game.</div>

<p>There are a few updated screens of the game that's progressed much more since the release of that trailer, now. I believe things are looking good on that front though.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd much rather an RPG version of the series, but for now, I'll just have to take Panzer Dragoon in any form possible.</p>

            Hi Neville.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />This could have been caused by Windows Update.  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so we'd want to test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Can&#39;t purchase anything on Xbox One. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t purchase anything on Xbox One.</h2>
                    <p>So over the past few days I've tried to buy a few different things. I bought Injustice 2 about a week ago and that worked fine. But since then everything I've tried to purchase, ranging from the microtransactions in Injustice 2 to State of Decay: Year-One Survival Edition, hasn't worked. Every time I try to purchase something, I hit "Buy" and it says "Working..." before the screen turns dark like the overlay for the "how do you want to pay for this" window is about to pop up, but it never does. Instead the screen brightens back up after a moment, and it simply says "Working..." indefinitely.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've tried hard resetting my Xbox, unplugging it for extended periods of time, and resetting my router and modem, but none of this works. <br /></p>

    <title>Skype for Business Crash when Disconnecting Headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business Crash when Disconnecting Headset</h2>
                    <p>I use Skype for Business on a Windows 7 machine daily, since I work from home. &nbsp;I have a USB headset that I use for 99%+ of my calls. &nbsp;About 2 weeks ago I started to notice that Skype for Business would crash and restart like the image below, almost inexplicably.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18fff53a-2690-4da5-aa9f-afd13586f979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18fff53a-2690-4da5-aa9f-afd13586f979" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past couple weeks I've tried several things and finally realized that I could recreate this error, at will, whenever I disconnect my headset from my computer while Skype for Business is running. &nbsp;One work around is to never disconnect my headset,
 but that seems ridiculous because this software should not be so unstable that simply unplugging or turning off a USB headset would crash it. &nbsp;Has anyone seen this before? &nbsp;If so, is there a patch or something to fix this issue?</p>

<h3> punchcard steve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10Pro 1809&#58; I cannot select Bose Sound Color II Bluetooth speaker</h2>
                    <p>In the last few days I lost my ability to choose my Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>I have a USB Bluetooth adapter to provide Bluetooth access to my speaker, an earbud, and stereo headphones.</p>
<p>I also use a USB audio gizmo to connect my wired headphones and microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEW SETTINGS NOT CONTROL PANEL</p>
<p>I have tried to change the settings/system/sound control panel to select the Bose speaker but it will not select.</p>
<p>There is a selection for "Speakers (Bose Color II Soundlink Stereo)". </p>
<p>But it is not selectable. I can choose the other two items for USB Speakers and HDMI audio.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is ON.</p>
<p>The Bose Color II is Bluetooth connected for voice and music.</p>
<p>The Bose Color II will play if I select it as output from Fubar2000.</p>
<p>But none of the system, game or other sounds will not play through.</p>
<p>I have the latest Bose firmware and have reloaded the USB and System and Bluetooth drivers more than twice.</p>
<p>I have tried setting and unsetting the Advanced Allow applications to take exclusive control...but that changes nothing in this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OLD CONTROL PANEL SOUND</p>
<p>In the old Sound/Playback control panel I cannot choose to make the Bose speaker the Default Device.</p>
<p>In that panel there are two Bose speaker selections; one for Headset Earphone and one for Speakers.
</p>
<p>All attempts to choose the Bose speaker are ignored even though it appears as an option.<br />
Curiously, the speakers selection never works but the headphones selection will play Fubar2000 music through the speaker???<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            Hi  Punchcard
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />1) Open Control Panel - Sound
<br />
<br />2) Right-click your computer's speaker then click Disable. 
<br />
<br />3) Proceed to run the Playing audio troubleshooter - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />It should detect your BOSE Bluetooth speaker.
<br />
<br />4) See if the BOSE Bluetooth speaker now shows up in Control Panel &gt; Sound
<br />
<br />Also, make sure the Bluetooth speaker is not disabled in the classic Sound control panel itself.
<br />
<br />Launch it, right click then click 'Show Disabled Devices'<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c836e54-c5e6-4ce1-a799-0337857e4e1c?upload=true" />

<p>Thank you Andre,</p>
<p>The troubleshooter said "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several restarts with Bluetooth on and off. At one point during a boot I heard the Bose speaker do a deedle-do sound. But then it went silent again.</p>
<p>Wondering if the on board audio was causing a conflict I disabled on board audio.</p>
<p>After that reboot the Bose speaker worked. </p>
<p>But when I enabled on board audio the speaker kept working; so not likely the culprit.</p>
<p>Then the problem was reversed. The Bluetooth speaker worked but I could not switch to my headset (Speakers in Sound control panel). So, I disabled the Bluetooth (turned it off) and rebooted. Then the headset worked.</p>
<p>I looks like switching between the Bluetooth speaker and the wired headset requires disable/enable of the sound devise manually in the old sound control panel AND a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the situation is workable but a lot more trouble than a week or so ago.</p>
<p>I got some updates back on about the 14th for many subsystems and suspect that one went poorly. It seems like a couple of automatic selections somewhere are confusing my system driving the audio system into an unknown state. I'll have to go back to using
 the speaker with my phone not the computer.</p>

<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />
