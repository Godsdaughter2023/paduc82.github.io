    <title>Latest Windows 10 Update and Xbox One controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Latest Windows 10 Update and Xbox One controller</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since installing Windows 10 update&nbsp;kb3140743 my Xbox One controller has become unusable for many games and applications. Xpadder, for example, used to run at 1% CPU but after the update and with the Xbox One controller plugged in, it now runs at 25%
 CPU. This problem is not limited by application it seems, for example many have experienced problems running Halo with Xbox One controllers and the new drivers (see http://www.infoworld.com/article/3040403/microsoft-windows/bad-windows-10-xbox-one-controller-forces-microsofts-hand.html).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original solution to this problem was to manually install old Xbox one drivers (following the instructions provided by stuntman on of&nbsp;http://forum.halomaps.org/index.cfm?page=topic&amp;topicID=49128 , which instructs you to manually install the old drivers
 from&nbsp;<a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/search.aspx?q=xbox%20one%20controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/search.aspx?q=xbox%20one%20controller</a>&nbsp;(note:
 Requires IE to view)). This would have been fine, but doing so meant my chatpad, which relies on newer drivers, stopped working. I ended up 'solving' the problem by removing the update and disabling Windows update, but this isn't a real solution for the future
 (I tried installing&nbsp;KB3140768, released today, but because it is cumulative the problem still persists and I had to roll it back too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure what aspect of the driver is broken, but some interface has definitely been made to be very CPU inefficient, taking up a whole core.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this is probably a question for Microsoft rather than the community, as all we can do collectively (without rolling our own drivers &gt;_&lt;) is to disable or work around the updates. Is there an outlook on when this will be fixed, or do you have a work
 around that will allow me to continue to use my Xbox One controller, chatpad, and have Windows updates without these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers :)</p>

            I am having the same exact issue. Many players on Steam are having this issue too, being unable to use the xbox one controller. I really hope Microsoft releases an update soon to patch this error.

            Thanks for the link, I did this immediately but I fear it's just gone to backlog mountain and won't get seen again - even I can't find it after posting it! This seems like quite a crucial defect for Microsoft to put in the 'suggestions bin', could we get
 something more concrete on a fix expectation? Windows update is getting more and more forceful in making me accept the 'updates', which will reverse my 'fix'!

<h2>            Skype for Business opens phone line when placing or receiving a call on cisco jabber.</h2>
                    <p>We have some users that are using both Skype for Business as well as Cisco Jabber ver. 10.6.3. Some users are experiencing issues where when a call comes into Jabber they will hear a dial tone for about 30 seconds and then the Jabber call will drop. They
 can hear the person on the other end of the jabber call as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have determined that when a call is placed or received with jabber that skype is also opening a call simultaneously, which has no activity and then times out and closes both lines after about 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can stop skype from opening up a phone line at the same time a call is being placed or received in Jabber?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it matters, but tends to only effect folks using headsets on their laptops.

    <title>How do you remove old Windows Vista Backups&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew leer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you remove old Windows Vista Backups&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been backing up my Vista box using Complete PC backup for quite a while now, and I was just wondering how it is that you remove old backups when your backup drive is to full for another backup.</p>
<p>I recently received the following error:</p>
<p>&gt; The backup did not complete<br />
&gt; successfully.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; An error occurred.&nbsp; The following<br />
&gt; information might help you resolve the<br />
&gt; error:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; There is not enough space to save the<br />
&gt; backup files.&nbsp; Free up disk space or<br />
&gt; change your backup settings.<br />
&gt; (0x81000005)</p>
<p>I don't see anything in the settings for the backup to change this.&nbsp; Do I have to mount the backup to delete an old backup?&nbsp; If so where is that file located?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Changing the backup settings means selecting a different type of backup that doesn't take up so much space and you don't want to do that.&nbsp; The backups on the backup drive are labeled with dates.&nbsp; Just go to it and select the oldest and delete it like you
 would any other folder.&nbsp; That should give you enough free space to do the new backup.&nbsp; If it doesn't, then delete the next oldest backup and try again.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>Reset my PC doesn&#8217;t work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reset my PC doesn&#8217;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I was wondering if anyone here could help me out with a problem I have.</p>
<p>I booted up my computer the other day, and when I logged in, a grey screen showed with a cursor. I left it on for a whole day and when I checked back, it was still the same. The computer didn’t respond to the keyboard either, but the keyboard worked when
 I was typing in the password, so that isn’t the problem. I can’t access windows, so please don’t ask me to do anything that you wouldn’t be able to do without logging in first. I have tried ctr+alt+del, does nothing. I’ve tried ctr+p+down arrow twice+enter.
 I’ve tried startup repair, and it says it is not able to fix the problem. Nothing works. I can’t see the taskbar or the start menu, my desktop items or my background, just a cursor that I can move around. All that considered, I have decided to do a clean restart,
 but keep all my files. You can do this from Troubleshoot&gt;Reset this PC&gt;Keep my files. I followed that path, but the reset this pc said it needed more harddrive space, which I can’t free up because I can’t access windows. Please help guys, I have some really
 important things on this computer that I don’t want to lose</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be greatly appreciated if you could help me with the first problem first, and if none of those solutions work, help me with the second one.</p>

            Hi Al.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you didn't back up your files it means they're valued at zero since the hard drive can die at any time without notice.  I would rescue them first using the bootable media you'll be needing to reinstall, following this method:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you confirm the files are all copied out fully by spot checking enough of them and  size on the USB rescue media, you can delete those and other files using the same method to try to free up enough space to see if Reset will run.  But Reset is always dependent upon the quality of the install and yours may be corrupted.
<br />
<br />If so follow the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can buy additional space for cheap.
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> A better automated file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts: <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

    <title>Reset to Windows 7 theme - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas-h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset to Windows 7 theme</h2>
                    A few months ago I changed my Windows 7 to a Windows 8 theme. I eventually uninstalled it because it was third party and therefore not attractive. It changed my icons (library/folders/computer/picture/music/video), my start menu button (now looks like
 4 small white squares making up a bigger square), my login screen, and during computer startup it changes the looks of the Welcome screen. After I uninstalled it, these options remain the same except for some of the folder icons are regular Windows 7 icons.
 Just wondering if anyone has a clue how to reset these settings so the appearance is orginal? Thanks a lot for your help.

            Alright, I actually could fix the problem. I simply inserted the Windows 7 install disk that came along with the computer and did an "upgrade" or basically a renewal of the system. It took a few hours but it worked, and I didn't lose any of my files/programs!!

<h3> johnherndon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center, TV Black Screen</h2>
                    I have the HP M9040N Desk Top, with Windows Vista, My graphics card recently went out, I changed it with the Nivida GE Force GT 520 and updated the drivers. Now my Windows Media Center TV&nbsp;has only a BLACK SCREEN, it will program the channels and you can
 hear some audio, after some time with the black screen it will then go to a BLUE screen and state&nbsp;no antenna connection or channel not available. I went to the Happauge site and downloaded the current driver for the Win TV HVR 1800, restarted the computer
 and it still has a black screen. It worked fine before I installed the new graphics card. Can anyone help me??

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you uninstall the old graphic card drivers before updating new one?</p>

            <p>Yes I uninstalled the drivers for the Happauge Win Tv card and uninstalled the Nividia Graphic Driver and reinstalled them both and I also updated the drivers for the Windows Media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No joy the TV screen is still black</p>
<p>I can hook the antenna through the Roxio composite 2 inputs and view TV, but cant see it with windows media live TV?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This all occurred after I instelled the new GT520 Nivida graphics card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im confused, I did everything that anyone has said on all internet blogs, I also noticed that other people have this iissue also.</p>

            Ok Happauge Technical service, gave me the WIN TV software which I loaded, the TV tuner card works awesome with that. But my Windows Media TV still only has a black screen, so its not the drivers for the video and graphics card and its not the Happauge
 card, its Windows Media?? So what do I do to fix my windows media? the computer did not come with a CD for reinstall

<h2>            BLE Pairing with Android and Windows 10 unsecure pin &#34;000000&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tring to pair my Android App with BLE to Windows 10. I enabled encryption on the GATT characteristics so pairing is essencial. When pairing, an input pops up on my phone and windows remains silent. After a few days I figured out that the pin "000000"
 is used. That is very unsecure. How do I manage to enable a random pin or passkey method?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: see same issue reported on google for attached hci.log </p>

            Hi Legend
<br />
<br />Is that 'press esc for startup menu' message white text on a black background?
<br />
<br />If so, check your BIOS settings . . .
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS and check that your hard drive is set as top of the boot order list
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you
<br />
<br />Start your PC, press Esc and as Windows starts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

<p>It's not a simple question. No one can answer you with certainty unless they delve into the purpose of each one of those empty files. People who understand technology are not going to spend time on that fool's errand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an example of how people mess up their computers: They tinker with things they don't understand because they think know better. Then an OS upgrade comes along and suddenly their system becomes unstable. And they blame Microsoft.<br />

    <title>What Just Happened&#63;&#33; Windows 10 BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> varun somashekar  say:</h3>
<h2>            What Just Happened&#63;&#33; Windows 10 BSOD</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hey guys, I have a question about my HP PAVILION X360 2016, &nbsp;came with Windows 8.1, Intel Core i5, 8Gb Ram and 1TB hard drive. So I believe yesterday, 9-14-2016 I went to sign in to my laptop. I put in my Pin, but it was taking &nbsp;a long time to get
 in, &nbsp;so I hard reset-you know, press and hold power button for 5 seconds. &nbsp;Once I powered on my Pavilion x360, something bad happened--I got a BSOD-Blue Screen Of Death. The error was CRITICAL PROCESS DIED. &nbsp;I let the computer do its thig but when I restarted,
 &nbsp;nothing happy happened. &nbsp;Somewhere in the middle, I got another blue-green, &nbsp;the same error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I was booting up my laptop at first, &nbsp;before all this had happened, I plugged in my Amazon Fire Tablet, &nbsp;5th gen. So I'm guessing that the possible suspects are my tablet's drivers of shutting down my laptop. Although I've done this before (plugging
 my tablet in to do an Android development course on Udemy) this had never happened. I restarted a few times but that didn't work. I had to then go to back to school night, while worrying my head of my sister would unknowingly click reset in recovery options.
 Also, &nbsp;before back to school night, I selected the scan the hard drive but nothing came up. I also did that boot up option from the drive - SSD, &nbsp;HD, &nbsp;USB but that didn't work either. Once I came home at around 9:00, I scanned the hard drive again before going
 to bed. &nbsp;I usually keep my laptop on me and I saw the screen blank (it usually did/does that whole booting up) and the me light was ON!!! I was so happy, I went to bed happily, thinking that I was awesome at fixing tech. I am interested in programing and stuff
 like computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that wasn't the end of it - - today I signed into my Laptop this morning - I can sign in, but here's the problem--all my Taskbar pins are gone, &nbsp;I set my desktop to hide the icons-note they're showing &nbsp;AND worst of all, &nbsp;the Start Menu won't open
 up, and Cortana &nbsp;and Search box won't activate. Same with "Hey Cortana." Yesterday, I also tried running the command sfc &nbsp;/scannow. In recovery it failed. Today when I logged in, I clicked on a folder on my and navigated to System32 and ran Command Prompt
 as Administrator. &nbsp;Nothing came up. That no integrity problems message came after the scan. I LITERALLY can't use my PC without having to type the command in Run. I still have yet to run DISM /online /cleanup-image /restore health. &nbsp;My auto hide Taskbar had
 been reset to noon hide and the settings app shows a splash screen and then crashes. MS Edge, Store won't work (as in not even start- I tracked down Edge's file location just in hopes of it would launch. It never did start even when &nbsp;my PC was working). &nbsp;Restarting
 never helped. If nothing works, I thinking on Refreshing Windows. After the sfc scan, I clicked on &nbsp;C: drive's properties and clicked that Scan or repair button. I restarted, let it do is thing and then, when I came from the bathroom, I got another BSOD</p>
<p>&nbsp;But this time it was error &nbsp;NTFS FILE SYSTEM. Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this COLLOSAL &nbsp;PROBLEM? &nbsp;I'm with the First Lego League and I WILL Need my laptop for building models-instructions on the web Only and a binder for the coach with the instructions. Anyways, the bottom line is I need to use it without
 any problems, &nbsp;I have about 200-400ish GB on that drive and none is to be discarded. I am worried sick ish. &nbsp;Please, the quicker solutions come, the much, much better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know, I USED my Fire Tablet and SwiftKey to write this post, that's how serious this is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay, here's what likely happened. And it ain't pretty, so get your hanky ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows does not catastrophically fail 'all of a sudden.' What happens is that people make mistakes when using Windows. Not because they're stupid - because operating systems are horribly complex and instructions (when they exist) are filled with geek jargon
 and other confusing terminology created by marketing departments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows can be remarkable resilient, so it <em>looks like</em> everything is going okay, but under the hood is a disaster waiting to happen. It could be a mistake you made yesterday or a year ago, but eventually something comes along, usually something
 from Windows Update, that doesn't know how to handle the configuration it's looking at and
<em>wham</em> the whole thing falls apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I talking from experience? Not gonna discuss it. Let's just say I don't learn many things the easy way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had a known good backup you probably wouldn't be posting, because you could just restore your backup and in a few minutes you could be back at work. But in your case, where everything has gone
<em>kablooie</em>, you're probably looking at a factory reset and then reinstalling all your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be worth your time (and money) to show your computer to a professional, someone who can sit with you and try to figure out what happened. Not someone from the Up The Creek Squad or whatever their name is. You are probably looking at a complete backup
 and reinstall. I would be glad to be proven wrong, but I think that's where you're headed.</p>

            if widows 10 was preinstalled on your device, when you restore factory settings windows 10 will already be installed (just like it was when you bought it).
<br />there may be a large update, depending on how old the factory restore is, but windows update will sort that for you.

            Hi Pavlusa
<br />
<br />A Windows Reset will put Windows back to its original clean state, you do not need to worry about a Product Key or activation at all . . 
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />If you can get into Window: 
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset 
<br />
<br />
<br />2,
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows: 
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi Pavlusa.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You would never  need to buy another Windows 10 license to reinstall it as often and in any way you want.
<br />
<br />If you have a Factory Recovery method for your particular PC make/model then that will set it back to Factory condition using a special recovery partition on the hard drive.  If you need help with how to perform Factory Recovery, look in the Support pages for your exact Model PC, or you can report back the make/model here and we will find it for you.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 also has a Reset built in which will do the same thing.  See here:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
