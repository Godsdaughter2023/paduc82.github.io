            Hi ArthurTarr ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Video call icon is at top right as in the picture. If this is still missing, use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />OR
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and paste into Run window and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8e0b746-1d61-43e7-8ad9-aff48d73fae3?upload=true" />

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These drivers are related to Graphics Card.</p>
<p><span><span><span>NvMcTray.dll:&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Nvidia media center library.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>NvCpl.dll:&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Nvidia Display Properties Extension</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you reinstall Graphics card drivers&nbsp;from the Manufacturer's Website after uninstalling them from the device manager. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press Windows key +&nbsp;R key. Type "devmgmt.msc" and click Enter.</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand Display Adapter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Double-click on the Display Adapter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Properties, go to Drivers Tab and click on Uninstall.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Reinstall the Display adapter from the Manufacturer's Website and see if it helps.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            <div>Dear Jesinta, </div>
<div>I have uninstalled the display driver as suggested by you and tried installing the Nvidia display driver v353.62, but I get error messages, which says Nvidia Drivers couldn't find compatible hardware. The display driver uninstalled from&nbsp;Device Manager&nbsp;was
 Microsoft Display driver.</div>
<div>I hope there is another solution to this issue which has come up only after upgrading my Windows 7 to Windows 10.</div>

<p>&nbsp;Just focus on latest install.exe file of Nvidia driver for your Nvidia display adapter and use
<strong>Troubleshooter Program</strong></p>
<p>see below step by step:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Or you try download the latest driver from Nvidia and see if you right click to get "Troubleshoot Compatibility"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Using Compatibility Mode to Resolve Driver problems</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If both Windows Update and driver update prove unsuccessful, the next option is Troubleshoot Compatibility. Troubleshoot Compatibility provides a simple way to make older drivers work under modern versions of Windows by making the driver believe
 it is being installed on a supported version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d388%26amp%3bh%3d290" height="290" width="388" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is point where the setup files are located. If you are installing from a thumb drive or CD/DVD. Launch File Explorer (Windows key + E) and open the location where the setup files are stored.</p>
<p>Right click the setup file for the program, this can be designated as&nbsp;<strong>setup.exe&nbsp;</strong>or something similar. Click<strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d405%26amp%3bh%3d313" height="313" width="405" /></a></p>
<p>This will launch the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter wizard which will check for issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d398%26amp%3bh%3d308" height="308" width="398" /></a></p>
<p>Select the option&nbsp;<strong>“Troubleshoot program”</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d402%26amp%3bh%3d311" height="311" width="402" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on the problems you are experiencing when attempting to install or use the software, check off the problems. In my case:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won’t install or run now’</li><li>The program requires additional permissions.</li></ul>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d421%26amp%3bh%3d325" height="325" width="421" /></a></p>
<p>Select a version of Windows the program is known to work in. I notice the program works great in Windows Vista (with Service Pack 2), so I will select that option.&nbsp;<strong>Click Next</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-6_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d421%26amp%3bh%3d325" height="325" width="421" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to run the through the programs setup routine by clicking&nbsp;<strong>Test the program….</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-7_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d417%26amp%3bh%3d324" height="324" width="417" /></a></p>
<p>Follow the on screen instructions to install the program as you normally would.</p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-8_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d407%26amp%3bh%3d315" height="315" width="407" /></a></p>
<p>If all is successful, click the option at the end of the wizard ‘<strong>Yes, save these settings for this program’</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/compat-opt-9.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f07%2fcompat-opt-9_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d402%26amp%3bh%3d311" height="311" width="402" /></a></p>

<p>You can save Ricky by telling him not to go on the trip; what becomes of him, I don't know, but at least he's not dead. &nbsp;But the fight is scripted, so everyone else dies regardless of your actions. &nbsp;It's supposed to establish the danger of the White Legs

<p>After the fourth reload I shot the first guy on the cliff who throws the grenades right away away then popped everyone else that showed up, Jed, Stella and a couple guards survived but they just stood there. I cant remember what the say but it's basically
 if you try to talk to them they say their busy. So I waited for a few moments and they still never moved from their spots although they were not frozen. So I figured that they werent supposed to be saved so I reloaded again let them get kilt and looted what
 I wanted from them. I sent Ricky home before we left the cave, not sure if you see him again in Vegas.</p>

                    <p>What is the difference between optimization and defragmenting in Windows 10 (with SSD)?&nbsp; I've seen several articles which state you should not run defrag on SSDs.&nbsp; So what is the correct answer?</p>

            SSD's never need defragging or optinizing
<br />
<br />SSD's use a function called TRIM, this is managed by Windows and the firmware on your SSD and no user intervention is required
<br />
<br />On a conventional HDD a file can end up all over the place as bits are written into the first available space and then some into next available space and so on . . .
<br />
<br />On a conventional hard drive, files are not really deleted, they are simply marked as can be written to at some point in the future
<br />
<br />This does not happen on an SSD!

            HD "Optimization" and "Defragmentation" is the same thing.
<br />
<br />The windows file system is "lazy", designed to minimize "write head" movement.  This was a design choice/requirement from when HD's were much slower than current ones. Files are not always written in single continuous "blobs". They are broken up into "blocks" of storage on the drive.  The file system keeps track of how link these blocks together.  Initially, when the drive is empty, the unused space is continuous.  When files are deleted, their space becomes available for writing new files.  So the next time a file is written to the HD, it takes the first available free block. If the file is too big for a single block, it uses the next available block.  Over time the free blocks become more scattered, making large files written in scattered blocks. It is "fragmented".
<br />
<br />The problem is that when a file is fragmented, the arm inside the HD that reads (writes) has to move around to find the separate blocks. This takes time, making reads (and writes) slower.
<br />
<br />Defragmenting, or Optimizing, the HD reorganizes the files so that they are continuous on the HD. This is done by reading a fragmented file, then writing it to another location (often at the "end" of the HD). Later when there are large enough continuous blocks the files are moved from the temp location to the "front" of the drive. 
<br />
<br />Each defrag tool uses different rules on what files to select for defragging, and how to organize the re-written files.
<br />
<br />Yes, it is recommended to not defrag SSDs.  Actually, some defrag tools are "smart" enough to refuse to defrag them.  The reason is that SSD storage is fundamentally different:
<br />#1.  there are no read/write heads to move
<br />#2.  SSD use "electronic" memory that can retain data when powered down like USB Flash drives and UNlike computer RAM
<br />#3.  SSD memory has a limited number of WRITE cycles, it "wears out"
<br />
<br />Defragging moves files around unnecessarily, "using up" write cycles.

    <title>XBOX ONE Controller issue with Arkham Knight game menus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bloodsign  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX ONE Controller issue with Arkham Knight game menus</h2>
                    
<p>Copy and paste from the WB forum, just seeking any suggestions.</p>
<p>Issue: Unable to scroll down within the menu screens of Arkham Knight using the left analog stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I started playing on 6/27 everything was fine when browsing AK's menu screens. Since about 3 days ago, I am now unable to scroll down using the left analog stick. This only occurs in the menu screens (select save, main menu, pause,&nbsp;character bio, and
 similar&nbsp;screens). This however is not affecting gameplay, upgrades, or the map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting steps I have tried: Hard reset, unplugging the system from power for 10min, resynching the controller, uninstalled the game (reinstalled), signing out and signing back into my account via Kinect. I have tried other games and they are fine
 when browsing menus. Only an issue with Arkham Knight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, this has not affected gameplay, it is more of an annoyance and I am looking for any other suggestions. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. In the pop-up window, select <strong>Personal</strong>, uncheck<strong> Automatically start the app when I log on to Windows</strong>.
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>

    <title>Resident Evil 0 Game Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snofox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resident Evil 0 Game Crashing</h2>
                    <p>To start off there was another post with the exact same issue, but was <strong>
closed on Jan. 13th 2019.</strong> This is my first time playing Resident Evil 0 on the
<strong>XboxOneX </strong>and the issue is when I am on top of the train at the beginning of the game, once I interact with the broken wires to activate a cutscene the game freezes and I lose power to the console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to look on YouTube for a workaround, first I tried to <em>remove the game save/s.
</em>No problem I only had one game save, after this started a new game and still crashes in the same spot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone said to try and use <em>Billy and leave Rebecca,</em> this did not work for me at all. The game freezes at the exact same spot, I even tried to skip the cutscene all together, but can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone had mentioned going to <em>Capcom</em> in the Xbox forums, this has been done by others. I did opt out of this one myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally said well maybe I just need to <em>redownload the game</em>, not only did I download the game again I did so on my
<strong>XboxOne S</strong> and the game still freezes in the same spot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think a post should be <em>closed unless it has been confirmed it is no longer an issue</em>, which this still seems to be. Someone had mentioned the game played fine until there was a Microsoft update, I can not confirm this nor give a date this
 could be speculation, but it was mentioned. If anyone has a work around please let me know, I don't want to get a refund but I can't play a broken item either.</p>

<p>Thank you for the guide, but that was wanting me to get to the home screen. Which I can't do once the cutscene is activated resulting in the guide saying that "<strong>Step 18:
</strong><span><strong>Your console needs to be repaired</strong>" I think that was me answering I was still unable to get to the home screen, which I couldn't do once I interact on the wires.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am definitely getting better at the start of the game, learning the enemy locations from each iteration. It's just getting annoying making it back to the top for the crash again.
<strong>OK Fowl</strong> do you own the game? Have you not encountered this issue? I am seeing it happens for both physical games and digital games in the same location.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for providing some troubleshooting, but this was actually already suggested to me in the previous reply for
<strong>Step 9. </strong>I figure there might be something to this since it was suggested twice. Only this time around I did the (Physical)power cycle, followed by starting a "New Game" not loading the last game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly this didn't work for me, <strong>DerVaddi</strong> could you walk me through what you did for this game, step by step maybe that would help me out. I tried looking in one of the largest RE(Resident Evil) groups to look for anyone to help me with the
 issue. I can't find anything, someone mentioned to try and skip the cutscenes. I have tried, but failing at this as it just keeps locking up and shutting of both my controller and XboxOne S/X consoles.

</p><p>Thank you very much for the information, before seeing this response I had tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Settings -&gt; Display &amp; sound -&gt; Video Output -&gt; changed Display -&gt;</em> Resolution to
<strong>720p</strong></p>
<p><em>Settings -&gt; Display &amp; sound -&gt; Video Output -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Video modes -&gt;</em>
<strong>uncheck </strong>“Allow 4k”</p>
<p>
</p><p>As someone in another post said it was a graphics issue, so I thought maybe I could change the video settings. This however didn't work.</p>
<p>The Insider Hub I had no idea what that was, but looking on the XboxOne X it did have an app. So I did unenroll the device and uninstalled application entirely. As "<em>a console enrolled in the Xbox One Update Preview reverts to the current public system
 update the next time it’s powered on</em>.<span>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then after I did the (physical)power reset. Started the game Resident Evil 0 using the last game save. The game is still crashing in at the same location once connecting the broken wires on top of the train. I will give the unenrollment process 24hours.
 The XboxOne S didn't have the Insider Hub app and I didn't see the serial number as an enrolled device. It's possible it was linked to the account, and I will try that too at some point tomorrow. Until then I will continue to read the subreddit and other sources
 for a "fix" or temporary adjustment to get by.</span></p>
<p>Not sure if using the<span> OSUDT could expedite this or not. So I'll run another factory reset as well. I did buy the entire Resident Evil collection from the XboxLive Marketplace game store, does this
 affect any of the other games in the series? I did get them for the nostalgia feel before the release of the new Resident Evil 2. This is a little frustrating but, things happen it's technology nothing can work perfect all the time.

<p>Hi SnoFox,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a known issue for a while now and acknowledged by the Xbox Preview team and were testing a fix for this issue in the Alpha ring back in December. Since then, there has been no updates but based on this
<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/12/03/new-preview-alpha-ring-1902-update-12-3-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> I'm assuming the issue was resolved in the Alpha ring preview update but doesn't seem to have gone live yet. There could have been some setbacks or the issue re-surfaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was being tested in the Alpha ring, which is the first ring to test preview updates and requires an invitation to join, and has preview updates with the potential to have the most bugs so it's possible it's&nbsp;stalled in the Alpha ring.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is to report the issue through the Xbox Insider Hub app, which you can do so by the report a problem option in the power menu after you have the app downloaded.
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>If you join the Insider program, eventually it&nbsp;should get pushed to the other preview rings and you can get the fix in an upcoming preview update&nbsp; before it would go live.</p>

            Hi Subhra
<br />
<br />You have 2 physically separate drives on your PC, a 128GB SSD drive and a 1TB HDD
<br />
<br />Do not convert your Disk to a Dynamic volume, you would brick your system . . .
<br />
<br />You cannot move space from one drive to the other, you can only add space to another partition on the same drive . . .
<br />
<br />The best solution for your system layout is:
<br />
<br />Right click your D drive partition and choose Expand, to add that 9.7GB back to the D Drive, then move as much data as you can from your C Drive to your D Drive.
<br />
<br />Ideally the SSD should be used for Windows and installed Applications and games and your D Drive should be your Data drive. This would make your system more responsive and in the event of a re-install all your data would be safely on the D Drive . .. 
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Move all your User Library folders to D:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, right click your Documents folder and choose Properties
<br />
<br />Select the Location tab
<br />
<br />In the Location box, type D:\Documents then click Apply and Ok
<br />
<br />When that move completes, do the same for Pictures, Videos and Music
<br />
<br />Each time, provide a new folder location, for example, Pictures will go to D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Move the location of all future content downloaded from the Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage - Change where new content is saved:
<br />
<br />Change all options you find there to D
<br />
<br />3.
<br />If you are a Steam Gamer
<br />
<br />Stop all processes associated with Steam
<br />
<br />Move the Steam folder to your D drive manually
<br />
<br />Then open the Steam Control Panel and point that to the new location
<br />
<br />
<br />4.
<br />Please Note: this should ideally be done before you begin installing any software
<br />
<br />For 3rd party applications, some will allow you to choose an installation location, for those, create a new Program files folder on your D drive, then for each application, create a new sub-folder of that folder
<br />
<br />Other 3rd party applications will not allow you to change the installation location, and there is no safe way to move those to your D drive . . .

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>Unallocated</em> volume is on different disk (Disk 1), hence, unfortunately, you can't merge it with volume of Disk 0.</p>

<p>The only way is to get a larger drive.</p>
<p>You can not add space from one drive to another.</p>
<p>A thing that you might consider is reducing the size of the D:\ partition and making another partition in which you install Windows 10.</p>
<p>Search through the forum and there should be some one that has addressed that.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. Below is a screenshot of the memory usage in the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f29e47aa-e6ed-4c66-9215-75fce998dc94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f29e47aa-e6ed-4c66-9215-75fce998dc94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>you can see that I don't have any unnecessary file / folder with large size in my C: drive. The Users folder has taken 2.6 GB only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now clearly understand that I have to deal with the allotted space in my C: drive. Therefore, the question is how can I manage the space given the current scenario of my drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, without adding any file to the C: drive, it automatically eats up some space every time I open the system. I checked the memory allocated for the system restore and it's 0 kb now. Still, I am having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me regarding this?</p>

            Hi Subhra
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type restore
<br />
<br />Form the resulting list, open 'Create a Restore Point'
<br />
<br />Select your C drive and click 'Configure'
<br />
<br />Set the resulting slider to 4GB - 6GB and save that Setting and close those dialogs
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Restart your PC, have you gained much space on your C Drive?

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not much memory is used for system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7671f1bd-c4ab-47c3-81d1-8246cff9184a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7671f1bd-c4ab-47c3-81d1-8246cff9184a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With the first clean up I will gain around 30 MB. With the second clean up the scenario is given below:</p>
<p>

            Hi Subhra
<br />
<br />Yes, you can safely delete those update files, they have already been installed on your system . .. 
<br />
<br />With regards to system restore, there is an inconsistency, Treesize reported 19GB+ and only 3.7GB in system restore . ..  on the System \restore dialog, delete the restore points and restart your PC, then create a new Restore point . ..

<h2>            Taskbar won&#39;t change colours</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I recently changed my desktop background and decided to change the colour of windows borders and the taskbar to match. I picked my colour and hit "Save Changes". The windows borders changed fine, but the taskbar is still the old colour and I can't get
 it to change. How do I fix this?</p>

            <p>So, the taskbar colour thing went away on it's own. It's now back to changing colours along with the window borders. However, now I can't pin anything to the taskbar. I hit the "Pin to Taskbar" option and nothing happens. If I go to do it again though it
 says "Unpin from Taskbar", but it's not on my taskbar to remove. I tried updating my graphics driver but this didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions and ran the System File Checker tool. It came back with:
</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log
</strong><strong><var>%WinDir%</var></strong><strong>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>That last line means the Sfcdetails.txt file is empty, but I don't know how to replace the corrupt file now if I can't find out what file is corrupt.</p>

                    Spells it out in title. Unable to copy and paste. Copy works OK but then unable to paste! The word paste will be greyed out and cannot paste-even using control-V.
<br />
<br />
Continually pops up in daily useage. So--when paste is greyed out and unusable, is there something else you have to do to get it to work?<br />

    <title>Fixing the &#34;Index is not running&#34; issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrien gallet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fixing the &#34;Index is not running&#34; issue</h2>
                    <p>The purpose of this post is to suggest another method of fixing the "<span>Indexing is not running" problem. Please bear with me; I am not a Windows expert, but I felt the need to write this post simply because all of the
 other solutions "out there" did not fix my problem. The following however worked for me, so I considered sharing this with the rest of you. Please comment/criticise/improve this solution through comments below. Also, if this "fix" works for you, please let
 the community know through comments or upvotes below!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Computer System</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This fix worked on my Windows 10 Home computer, version 1803, OS build 17134.706, although it is likely to work on any Windows 10 system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problems (I was encountering)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When searching using the Start menu, windows claimed that&nbsp;<span>"Search indexing was turned off"</span></li><li>When trying to "Rebuild" the index, nothing happens and the issue was not fixed</li><li>When checking with the "Windows Search Service" using the services.msc command, the Index was stopped. Yet when trying to start it, it returned Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.</li><li>When attempting any fixes using the "Registry Editor" (regedit), such as bringing the SetupCompletedSuccessfully value to 0, did not work (value was already at 0 for me).</li><li>Installation of Microsoft Office 365 worked, yet starting the Microsoft Office 365 suite (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.) all failed. Similarly, I was able to install LibreOffice, yet unable to open any of the LibreOffice applications.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution</span></strong></p>
<p>At the end (after many days of searching), what was causing the issues above was that "<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compact OS</a>" had been enabled on my system
 without me knowing this. Why? See below. For now, there is a quick way to figure out if this is also the case for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Open Command Prompt as an administrator, and type in the following in the command line:&nbsp;<span>Compact.exe /CompactOS:query</span></p>
<p>If the query returns, "The system <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span></strong>&nbsp;in Compact state. It will remain in this state unless an administrator changes it.", then it means that Compact OS has been enabled. When I then disabled
 it, it fixed all of my problems above when I then re-started my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: Before disabling Compact OS, ENSURE that you have AT LEAST 5GB of memory on your hard-drive. If you do not, you may end-up facing all kinds of issues later on. I am dead serious
 on this point.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable Compact OS, simply type (copy paste) the following line into the command prompt as an administrator:&nbsp;<span>Compact.exe /CompactOS:never</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Compact OS will take some time (5-10 minutes), yet when it is complete, it will inform you of its completion. If you then check with&nbsp;<span>Compact.exe /CompactOS:query&nbsp;</span>again, it should now return "The system
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>is not</strong></span> in the Compact state.&nbsp; It will remain in this state unless an administrator changes it.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer, and hopefully your index works again. In my case, it ended up solving all of the "Problems" I listed above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please comment below if this solved your issue! (This will help others find this post more easily).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Causes (why does this issue exist)</span></strong></p>
<p>I have some idea what may be causing this issue. Please take what I am about to write with a grain of salt (and comment if you can improve my answer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compact OS is one of those hidden features in Windows 10 that is normally automatically enabled when your hard-drive is running low on disk. This may be because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You installed a large application and exceed your hard-drive space.</li><li>You were saving a very large file and exceeded your hard-drive space.</li><li>You upgraded from a previous version of windows with little space on your hard-drive (in which case, Windows would have enabled Compact OS automatically to have the space to install the update).</li></ul>
<p>In any case, visually, this would have resulted in two "blue arrows" on all of your icon files, as discussed
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/mysterious-blue-double-arrows-added-to-windows/fad079c4-6498-4543-b4ec-b547a2bd00eb">
here, for example</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would in most cases be fine, however Compact OS unfortunately also stops indexing from working, and even meant I was unable to install any new applications; in other words,
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Compact OS, a feature from Windows 10, actually ended up corrupting some fundamental aspects of Windows 10</span></strong>. Why? Well, I actually don't know at this point; hopefully someone from Microsoft will
 be able to answer this for us. In any case, if you directly tell Windows 10 to disable Compact OS using the steps above, it then ends up solving all of the problems from before, AND removes the blue arrows visible on all icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this has helped you. Please let the rest of community know if this solved your indexing issue or not; maybe someone more experienced and technical than me will be able to lend a hand. Cheers!</p>

<h3> shatteredfaith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to install Dungeons, get error message This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package</h2>
                    When trying to install Dungeons (Which IS compatible with windows 7) i get the error message "This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package." So i go to the Microsoft
 download page and try to run the PatchRegCleanup-x64 and it tells me A product code must be specified. Can anyone help me with this? Very frustrating.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined to the installation of the Dungeon Game?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You may try the below Methods and check if they help.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start the Windows Installer service</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type Services.msc and press {ENTER}
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click Windows Installer
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Set the Startup type of Windows Installer to Manual
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start to start the service. Note down the error message if any.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK.
<br />
&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer to do that follow the steps provided below.</span></strong></span><span><b><span>
</span></b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, click Run, type MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER, and then click OK. Even if you
<br />
do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, click Run, type MSIEXEC /REGSERVER, and then click OK. Even if you&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After you run this command, the operation is complete.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Try your Windows Installer-based application again.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists it could be due to the incompatibility of the application as this issue could occur if you are trying to install a
 application made for 64 bit operating system on a 32 bit operating system.</span></span></p>

            <p>Same problem for me. I have Win 7 Professional 64bit and I have tried the following to install Win 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Update via Windows Update: failed FOUR times</p>
<p>2. Created a USB file to update with: failed TWICE and failed to reset back to my original Win 7 (thanks for Seagate Cloning software I have a backup SSD).</p>
<p>3: Created THREE DVDs with the ISO file and all of those attempts failed also EVEN after all the stop bit, start bit, rename this and that **** which did nothing to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>****???????? MS wants to tell us how great Win 10 is but nobody can install it without a Masters Degree in Computer Science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a horribly designed product that they have to give away for free because of all the issues with it. Win 12 will come out before anyone will be able to figure out how to install this POS!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately an inferior in-place Upgrade is not the best way to deliver the free copy of a great OS because it's dependent upon the old OS which may have corruption or factory bloatware that chokes or passes issues into Upgrade.&nbsp; These steps are compiled
 after helping in several thousand Upgrade cases here, and work for everyone who tries them.&nbsp; You can wait to use the "Save Nothing" option to see if the other steps work first, but if not it may be the only solution and offers the added benefit of being close
 to the superior Clean Install. </p>

            <p>windows 10 has very poor hardware compatibility compared to previous versions, its probably choking on some piece of hardware, doesn't matter anyway, even if you get the dog to install, and work, it will eventually just break itself anyway because the software
 is poorly written and the windows updates they have been releasing are constantly breaking things</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has always had some kind of delusional fantasy that things are gonna be great if you install windows on windows (in place upgrade) rather than wiping everything and doing a clean install, in fact installing windows on windows has NEVER been a good
 idea, and ALWAYS yielded problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should have KNOWN this would be problematic, but no, they are still in their delusional fantasy land so they released windows 10, to install windows on windows, instead of a clean install, and now all **** is breaking loose</p>
<p>
</p><p>not that it matters with windows 10 anyway, because unlike previous versions,&nbsp; clean installing from a disk doesn't always work either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>then you add the fact that Microsoft appears to have stopped making quality software after windows 7</p>
<p>(8 sucked, 10 sucks) and you have a real MESS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile Microsoft is pretending everything is just fine and dandy</p>
<p>i will never, use any Microsoft OS after 7, and i cant advise anyone Else do so either</p>

Which Antivirus to buy?
<div>
<p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.&nbsp; I want to emphasize that the
<em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are strictly an ANTIVIRUS product</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install only one product in my client’s computers.&nbsp; My support comes as a condition that they use that and only that product.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better</strong>.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk.
<strong>Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections</strong> or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Download and read the 2015 summary report.&nbsp;
<strong>Bitdefender is at or near the top.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Microsoft’s is at or near the bottom.&nbsp; These are not closely scored, but wide differences.&nbsp; Note also that Norton (Symantec) declines to even participate.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until September 2014, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security.&nbsp; September 2014,&nbsp;Symantec (owner of Norton) decided
 they would no longer sell an Antivirus-only product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of research, I decided on <em><strong>Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp;</strong>
</em>I have installed it&nbsp;120 of&nbsp;those PCs and there has not been a single infection, and this has been over a course of about 17 months now.&nbsp; It is a better product than Norton.&nbsp; It is not expensive. It uses very little of the computer’s resources.&nbsp; One of
 the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; Especially if you silence its “Wallet” function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clients know well that if they install any “Internet Security” (IS) product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that the other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems
 than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; The problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose
 the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; The IS product&nbsp;will actually hide the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, this is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical home Windows computers.</p>
<p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection software installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

            <p>Hello JemJem1411.. I'm sorry that you are having this issue. I wouldn't go to the extent of saying that Microsoft is allowing cheating, because that is entirely false. What helps is to report the player and let the Xbox Moderators handle the process.. The reason it appears that Microsoft is doing nothing is because there may be a few hundred to a thousand cases where players may be modding or cheating. We can prevent the problem from our end, but ultimately it is also up to the developer of the particular game to update their game in order to stop future security breaches, cheating, and modding. Reporting the player definitely helps but may take a little time considering on the work load of the Xbox Team. In my opinion, switching over to Playstation is a suggestion I&nbsp;suppose, but do not be suprised when you encounter modding, and cheating there as well.</p>

            <p>I feel you man, its a shame, ive had the exact same 90% of my games and it comes and goes on whether theres cheaters on. best thing to do is to report them in game and through xbox, xbox cant do anything if they arent reported. they will make a new account but enough reports will block their ip and then they cant play at all. The ingame report will send it to the developer and they can help too but i dont think they regulate it much if at all anymore, sometimes feels like a lost cause because of that but the xbox report isnst, you wont know if theyre banned but if enforcement look into it and see what you see, they will be. I do know playstation is way more stricter on literally everything, one swear is a day ban so if thats the sort of strength you want thats your choice, but they dont have backwards compat or crossplay, so i wouldnt get the console just because of the one game.</p><p>good luck with the switch</p>

            <p>This is more of a widespread across quite a few games.</p><p><br /></p><p>I think the issue is that its far harder for the enforcement team to ban players for cheating due to needing evidence,&nbsp;Where as communications related enforcement are far easier to bee issued.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;I do know that a lot of the games developers will accept video evidence of cheating so that they can directly ban a player, I did do this a few years back on world of tanks with a player that was purposely griefing and intentionally blocking team mates to&nbsp;get them killed, It actually took them just 10 minutes to ban the player after receiving my recording of their gameplay.<br /></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The icon looks like a camera symbol.<em> Have you installed any application that imports pictures from the Digital camera?</em> If yes, then it is possible that the camera icon is displayed whenever that application is performing some
 tasks in the background.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you haven’t installed any such applications, then I would suggest you to check the task manager to see if you are able to identify the service or process the icon belongs. Open task manager and check the list of process running when
 the icon appears. Then you might be able to identify the application. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, select ‘task manager’.</span></li><li><span>Click on the “process’ tab and check which services are running when the icon appears and check.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are still unable to find, I would suggest you to run a complete security scan to check if the issue is caused by a security threat. Make sure that the antivirus software is updated with the recent virus signatures before you run
 a security scan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also download and run the Microsoft Security Scanner from here:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;<a href="http://safety.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://safety.live.com</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection. Any data files that
 are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, then I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. If the icon is not displayed in clean boot, then one of the services disabled in clean boot I responsible for this
 icon. To find out which particular application is responsible, refer to the ‘More information’ section in this article:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer to the step
<em>How to set the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting</em> under more information.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps and let us know the results.</span></p>
