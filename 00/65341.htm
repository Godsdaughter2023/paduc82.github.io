                    <p>Having checked the error code, it does not have a resolution on the Microsoft Error list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried other games and they seem to be loading OK.&nbsp; The game was working up until fairly recently.&nbsp; We have completed an update and this has not made any difference</p>

==============================<br />
Chances are the file will play anyway.<br />
<br />
Or...may be worth a try to use the following <br />
freeware to convert it to the .wma format.<br />
<br />
Free Mp3 Wma Converter<br />
<a href="http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html</a><br />
(Mp3, Wma, Ogg, Aac, M4a, Ac3, Ape, Flac, Wav)<br />
(FWIW if you install the converter you may want to<br />
uncheck the offers of Yahoo and Dealio) (also...you<br />
may want to uncheck the CD Ripper and the Easy<br />
MP3 Cutter)<br />

            Ideally you would want just one Virus scanner. Two or more compete for file access and can cause your computer to run slow. I have personally used Windows defender with great success since Windows 10 came out and never have gotten an infection. It all depends on your browsing habits. If your prone to infection and can live with a slower than normal performance, leave both. 
<br />
<br />I hope that helps.

            Hi aunakniroula,
<br />
<br />Nowadays, yes, Windows defender is as good as most of the 3rd party Anti-virus software. It is regularly updates with the latest virus definitions and will do a good job at protecting your system. MalwareBytes is a good addition as it finds malware that none of the 3rd party Anti-virus software sees, so you are well protected . . .

            I have looked at the links you provided. &nbsp;I have completely removed my child from family safety and Windows 10 is still blocking him access to his computer. &nbsp;That is why I contacted you. &nbsp;Family Safety in Windows 10 DOES NOT WORK. I have had endless problems.
 &nbsp;Also, I did not see how to change my child's account from "child" to "standard user" in Windows 10... especially after I have removed the account off of family safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I log onto my MS account no problem.&nbsp; I have completely removed my son's computer from MS Family Safety.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not get an error message.</p>
<p>When he tries to log onto his account this is the message:</p>
<p>"Time's up!</p>
<p>It is past the curfew time your parent set.</p>
<p>come back at 12:00 PM, or ask a parent for more time"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There is no option to ask a parent for more time</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; My son has no curfew.&nbsp; His account has been deleted due to the ongoing trouble with MS Family Safety.</p>
<p>3. Before I gave up on MS Family Safety, I turned off the screen time option completely.&nbsp; Still we got the above message.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Before I turned off screen time, I made the time unlimited in a certain time frame.&nbsp; It was far from unlimited.&nbsp; My son was blocked after 1 hour.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Before I made the screen time unlimited within a certain time frame, I increased the number of hours he was allowed to have screen time.&nbsp; Still he was blocked after 1 hour.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; This is just a glimpse of my ongoing problems with MS Family Safety.</p>

<p>You are going to have to find them or reload a save file from earlier. I normally keep 10 save files back to make sure.</p>
<p>Always pay attention to your companions. Its easy to tell if Ed-E is with you, you can always hear him. But you have to look to make sure the others are with you.</p>

<p>You need to back track and find them. Or they might just be gone.</p>
<p>And you should never have only 1 save file. This game if far too buggy. And save files can get corrupted. 10 save files at a time is my min. With save at major points in the game that I dont delete.</p>
<p>In order to change your party members you have to dismiss them by talking to them. And since you cant find them........you are up s-creek with out a paddle at this point.

<p>It would be nice if they would implement limited companion access from the pip boy. &nbsp;Not inventory access as this would make it far too easy to use them as safe extra inventory space in hardcore, but access to the wait/follow me, melee/ranged, and dismissal
 features.</p>
<p>As for getting them all, you just have to get all of them to join you once. &nbsp;You can immediately dismiss them if you like, they just have to have followed you at some point.</p>
<p>And MisterEFQ is right, you should never rely on a single save in this game. &nbsp;The chances of ending up with a save that is either corrupt or is stuck with something important glitched is way too high.</p>

<p>Just bring up your pip-boy map and your companion's location should be noted on the map. If for some odd reason you travel to an area where companions aren't allowed inside (The Fort, Lucky 38, Silver Rush) then go back to that location and see if they are
 there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way you dismiss companions is simply toggle companion wheel, choose option to talk to 'em, then tell 'em you are heading on w/o 'em (with ED-E choose companion end protocol) from that point on they will return to location where you originally found 'em.

    <title>Sound keeps playing from same output device even after changing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound keeps playing from same output device even after changing default device</h2>
                    <p>After a Windows update last fall I have had issues with switching between my USB headphones and my desktop speakers, and the only way to get the sound output to change is by disabling one or the other. When both devices are enabled I can hear sound when
 moving the volume slider or playing a test sound, but if I change source of output in the lower right corner in Windows, nothing happens other than the new output source displaying when clicking the volume button. The sound keeps playing from the previously
 selected device until I disable it entirely. Then I have to use Sound Troubleshooter to re-enable it as it disappears from the list of output devices once disabled. I find this very frustrating and I hope someone can help me solving this issue.</p>

            Hi Kjetil 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />2. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            impossible to sign in with microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Dear Win8 users,</p>
<p>I've installed win8 and I do have the Microsoft account (with a password not forgotten). However, my laptop refuses to sign me in (after 2 days successful enjoying&nbsp;the new environment and installing some software)&nbsp;with creditials I have and that still&nbsp;work
 on the web-page. Resetting the password on the web-link has "temporary problems". I'm in an endless loop: "That password is incorrect. Make sure you're using the password for your Microsoft account. You can always reset it at account.live.com/password/reset
 ". What the trap it is, do I really need to reinstall back to win7 or to use some 3rd-party recovery software? Unfortunately I had no idea to prepare some "password reset CD". I don't get to my own machine...
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Kalev</p>

<div><strong><br />
</strong>Similar to the issue above, if you sign in at <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.live.com</a> with your email and password, you may be interrupted with a message such as "It looks like someone may be using your account".&nbsp; There are a number of account 'blocks' that we put on an account to help protect your account from hackers.&nbsp;
 Just follow the prompts to unlock your account using your alternate email, phone, or trusted PC.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have lost access to all your security info such as your phone or alternate email, then you will need to delete all your security info and wait 30 days before you can access your account again.&nbsp; This is to protect your account from an attacker removing
 all your security info.&nbsp; It's inconvenient, but better than losing your account.&nbsp; After 30 days, your account will be back in your control.&nbsp; Make sure you have multiple good 'proofs' on your account so your account stays secure and you don't get in this situation
 again. <br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 and Facebook Flickering.</h2>
                    <p>I am concerned that my Surface Pro 3 may be about to spit the dummy on it's 4th day.</p>
<p>Long marathons of trolling facebook the last 4 days&nbsp; ;) has caused the screen to jump and flicker, I assumed over heating was to blame.</p>
<p>But this morning after a while on fb it began to flicker even worse and I had to force a shut down. Upon reboot all is good, for now.</p>
<p>Anybody else experiencing similar.</p>
<p>Oh and if there are any spelling mistakes in my post I am blaming this keyboard that i got with my surface pro, I refuse to tap lightly. ;) :)

<h2>            Performance Issue - Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Manually allowing selective applications and such at system power on/bootup/windows load......&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone here can help me out with this two fold issue I am having with my Win 7 machine. To begin, I had been running an application way back when on my old Windows XP OS machine while trying to find what application was starting up which
 was causing me grief while Windows was running. What this application did was give me a pop-up window asking me to allow or deny the start up of that specific application or whatever which was trying to start at that moment. This helped me filter out start
 up/autoruns/whatevers until I found what was causing the issues. Obviously, when all is running fine, this application was a pain in the neck to have running all the time, having to "allow" each and every application requesting to launch so I removed it once
 the machine was fixed. Issue one, I cannot recall the name of this program now and have a need to use it again. Any idea as to what this program may be called?????
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason for issue one: My Win 7 box suddenly goes to 100% CPU usage and the time is random. When it does this, the machine runs at a crawl. The only thing I may have determined is that it is closely related to Windows Live Mail 2012. Once WLM is opened and
 left unattended for a random amount of time, CPU goes up to 100% seen in Task Manager and stays there. I see nothing in Task Manager Image Names that has anything running even close to that high a percentage. The only thing that fixes it is a reboot. Can't
 find out what is causing this. I have run numerous rootkit and malware applications to no avail. The only thing I know for sure right now is that if I restart the machine and never open WLM, machine runs fine all day. On 2 occasions this 100% CPU issue did
 occur with WLM closed, but I am unsure if WLM was opened but then closed before walking away. I figure that with this "unknown" application I used on my XP machine, when I return to my machine with WLM still open and running, I should eventually have a popup/popups
 requesting me to "allow or deny" the startup of whatever app is causing my issue, making it easier to solve. I really hope someone can help me solve this! It is very frustrating!!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ray</p>

 I was charged a large amount for a service I do not use nor want. It's a 12 months subscription.<br />
I immediately cancelled the subscription, but it tells me that I can use it for 12 months and then it will be cancelled. I don't want the service, and it says I have the right to request a refund within the first 14 days.</li><li>
Now the instructions says that I should login to my account, look at history, select the transaction, and then select REFUND ... but there is nothing there to click.<br />

            It could be a game bug rather than a console issue that prevented them from firing. Quite frustrating, I know I have a few in games that never popped despite doing what was required to compete them.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to Connect to Multiplayer</h2>
                    
<p>It spins for a while in CoD Ghosts then finally just doesn't connect. &nbsp;Tells me to check their server status.</p>
<p><br />
I thought maybe it was on my end so I check my connection and it connects to the internet just fine but when running the Multiplayer tests it just doesn't connect. &nbsp;I opened all of the ports listed for Xbox One, tried to DMZ it, and have restarted the console
 completely as well as the router. &nbsp;I have tried both Wireless and Hard Wire to the modem to no avail. &nbsp;It just won't connect to multiplayer.</p>

<p>It seems to go between NAT Type Strict and Open more than it should when every single port is open. &nbsp;It currently says "Open" but gives me error code 0x1040040000000000 every time I run the Multiplayer test.</p>

<p>I fixed it.</p>
<p>Go into your router management and delete ALL ports that you have open for the Xbox One. &nbsp;If you have it in a DMZ remove it. &nbsp;Save your settings and reboot for good measure.</p>
<p>Go to UPnP and disable it and save the settings.</p>
<p>Restart your Xbox and your Router/Modem.</p>
<p>Go back into your router management and make sure UPnP is disabled.</p>
<p>Enable UPnP and save the settings.</p>
<p>Restart the Xbox and the Router/Modem.</p>
<p>That fixed it for me and I was able to immediately connect to MP after. &nbsp;I guess it doesn't like it when you have ports open and UPnP enabled.</p>

<p>I have the same problem unfortunately, my NAT is strict and I cannot join or host a multiplayer game (have only FIFA 14 atm). I can search for games, but the connection is interrupted when I have found an opponent.</p>
<p>All ports are open, I tried the "Exposed Host" option as well (I have a Fritzbox 7390), but to no avail. Nat continues to be strict. When I do the multiplayer test in the Xbox ONE, I get the error message "Can't get a teredo IP-address", even though I have
 opened all ports, tried the "Exposed Host" option etc. </p>

<p>I don't. &nbsp;It seems that this "fix" is mostly temporary. &nbsp;I have had to do it 4 times and when I started today it said something about the Teredo address. &nbsp;I opened all the ports and did this UPnP thing again and it allowed me to connect.</p>

<p><br />
I assume you have your own account password protected. Yes ?<br />
Here is my question to you : how can you be sure your account's password can not be accessed ?</p>
<p>Hackers can get into your account no matter what. Password means nothing to them.</p>
<p>One point to make sure you know......</p>
<p>&nbsp;Parental control is meant to be applied to&nbsp;user accounts. Not to admin account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please confirm if this is happening to a&nbsp;specific number? If you have enough Skype credit and the number is covered by your subscription yet, the call won't connect - try uninstalling and reinstalling Skype app. If the issue persists, isolate the
 issue by calling&nbsp;the number using a regular device (not Skype). I also suggest to try to make a call at a later time as there might be a network issue happening on their end.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions.</p>

    <title>Secondary User can&#39;t access internet sites - This page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jalew9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Secondary User can&#39;t access internet sites - This page canrsquo&#59;t be displayed</h2>
                    <p>I recently set up an Outlook account for my 11 year old son with Family Safety activated on his account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he attempts to log in to Outlook.com from my Samsung Notebook (running Windows 8.1) he only get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><div>"This page canrsquo;t be displayed</div>
<div>
<p>Turn on TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 in Advanced settings and try connecting to &lt;website address&gt;&nbsp;again. If this error persists, contact your site administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;"canrsquo;t" is how it comes up - odd!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all the TLSs are selected - they are - and then restarted the computer - no good.</p>
<p>I have rebooted the router and also cleared the Cache / Browser History as suggested elsewhere - the problem persists.</p>
<p>I have tried using alternative browsers - no good, gets the same message.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling his Family Safety settings - no good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have to contact my administrator - but since that is me, I don't hold out much hope :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, as the Administrator, have no issues with my Outlook Account - I can use the access the internet via Chrome, no issues - it seems to just be the secondary user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note others are having the same issue - anyone got any ideas or found a fix?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with Outlook. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to reset your browser and check
 if you are using Internet Explorer. Please follow the below link to know how to rest the browser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:
</span><span><span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2: check the issue in no add ons mode.
</span></strong><span>Please follow the below steps to use no add on mode.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click the Tools button
, and then tap or click Manage add-ons.</span></li><li><span>Under Show, tap or click All add-ons, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click Disable, and then tap or click Close.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also check the below link to know the best browsers that work with Outlook.</span></p>

<h2>            Antimalware Service Executable</h2>
                    This only started happening today. This command, Antimalware Service Excutable, will without fail, begin running on my computer after being on for a few minutes. I have tried every single solution listed both outside, and inside this webpage, and nothing
 is stopping it. It is on average using over 70% of my CPU and 100% of my disk space. I'm told it's connected to windows defender. Why did this only start happening today? How can I ensure it stops and never happens again?

            Hi, CasonCorbitt
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<p>I had the same problem, and I think I solved it for myself. Please try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Task Manager locate Antimalware Service Executable</li><li>Right-click on it, then select "Open file location"</li><li>In that folder locate ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe and double-click it</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please comment in this thread if this has solved your problem like it did for me. Also please go one folder up in Explorer and check if another version of Defender is also there. In my case there is an old one "4.18.1903.4-0" and a current one "4.18.1904.1-0".
 This problem might be caused by an incomplete upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft &#34;Lost connection to server&#34; when joining game</h2>
                    <p>So my friend has this world we've played on for about a year and I've never really had a problem joining it, but after this most recent update everytime I try to join his game or he tries to join mine or just says "Connection to the server was lost". Very frustrating, any&nbsp;fixes?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Logon issue</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just upgraded from Windows 7 to 8.1 on my PC. I managed to setup everything correctly, even connecting the Microsoft account. Strangely after booting up the second time, I was brought to the login screen. When I tried to enter my password, it says incorrect
 password. So I tried accessing Outlook.com on my mobile with the same password, and it works just fine. As per the login screen suggestion, I even reset my password, but similarly Windows 8.1 login is still telling me incorrect password. Can you advise what
 do I do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Till date my new password works fine on Outlook.com but not for the Windows 8.1 login. I am being locked out of my own PC and have to resort to using another profile to send this email to you.</div>
                </div>

<p>On the Login screen tap the language selection i the bottom of the screen. Change it to the one that</p>
<p>fits the language of the&nbsp;&nbsp; pc / keyboard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eg en/da .&nbsp; With the cursor in the Password input-field hit backspace and then enter your password. You might have to do this every time you login or you could change the special characters in your password.</p>

<div>Hi Vijin,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your tip, it seemed to work. It's funny when I enter into the system it reverts back to US keyboard, but at login in screen it automatically switched to UK keyboard. Anyhow I finally managed to login, thank you!</div>

Hi People</p>
<p>I had the same issue after updating to Win 8.1 and being forced to setup an outlook account - couldn't login even though I was pretty&nbsp;sure I knew the password.</p>
<p>I have tried a few things, none of which worked.</p>
<p>I have now tried your suggestion - it works - I am now in and the password I remembered was correct!</p>
<p>It seems to have unlocked something. I can now logon in either language, and without using the backspace. I am a little suspicious that it was the backspace that cured the problem.</p>
<p>If anyone else tries this, try just a backspace before your password first.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Color Laser Jet Pro MFP M477fnw - scan is not working</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set the printer up to have both scan-to-computer and scan-to-email options set up. &nbsp;These are not working. &nbsp;Prior to installing Office 365 suite, I was using HP AiO Remote option to scan documents, but that application stopped working once
 Office 365 was installed.&nbsp;</p>
