<h2>            17004 bug report&#58;  Preview installation hangs in a Stage 1 Restart Loop several times before success.</h2>
                    <p>Installing build 17004 on 16362.&nbsp; Stage 1 completes and the system asks for a restart.&nbsp; The restart in a normal one instead of an installation restart and the system returns to the 16362 desktop.&nbsp; This happens several times (four on my system) and then the
 next restart successfully starts Stage 2 of the installation.&nbsp; The installation completes successfully.</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; It took me four restarts back to the 16362 desktop before the fifth succeeded in restarting into Stage 2.

                    I created a new outlook.com account today but can't set it up for use on my Mac -- are there instructions for this anywhere? The online instructions seem to be only for IOS.

<span>Melanie_D</span></a>&nbsp;provided in her post is for setting up Outlook for Windows (2003, 2007, and 2010) and HotMail/Outlook.com. &nbsp;The initial question, and mine, is how to set it up with Outlook 2011 for Mac
 OS X.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried to set it up in&nbsp;Outlook 2011&nbsp;as and Exchange server, like it works on my iPhone, but all I get is an endless loop of redirects to a couple of "autodiscover" host/URLs.
 &nbsp;I have seen a couple of references to set "Outlook.com" up as a POP email server, but you don't get contact or calendar sync and do get the POP mess of multiple devices (webmail, computer, and iPhone) reading the same mailbox.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I guess Microsoft needs to do 1 or 2 things to get it to work, 1 - add full Exchange Web Services front-end to&nbsp;HotMail/Outlook.com, or 2 - update Outlook 2011 to add either the
 activeSync protocol or an&nbsp; "Hotmail Connector", like some previous versions of Entourage had.</span></p>

            Updates install automatically in the new version of Skype. But one of the ways you can check if there is a new version to be installed is by clicking the three dots in Skype, click Help &amp; feedback.
<br />
<br />It should then start downloading any updates if any is available.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b7977a5-3947-4be1-aefe-ac5769294e7d?upload=true" />

<h2>            excel parameter _start_ of range.characters object limited to 255</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using excel 2016 on win7.</p>
<p>Here is the issue I encounterred:</p>
<p>I need to build the content of a cell, using the text, with some words in color, coming from several other cells:</p>
<p>Cell A = bla <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">bla</span> bla bla</p>
<p>Cell B = bla bla bla</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">bla</span> bla</p>
<p>etc....</p>
<p>Result cell must contains:</p>
<p>bla <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">bla</span> bla bla</p>
<p>bla bla bla</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">bla </span>bla</p>
<p>
</p><p>To not loose the color, the only way I found, is to work at characters level, using range.characters(_start_,_length_) object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But doing so I am limited by the _start_ type, which seems to be a byte -&gt; So limited to 255.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All characters after the 255th one are ignored, and no error is returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be overriden by a custom class ?</p>
<p>Could _start_ type be changed to integer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to share my files, but how can i do it here ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great thanks for your assistance.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>Here is the link</p>
<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AnW1qXXvWln0df3XtHTmys6Nm4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link to OneDrive</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Dashboard template.</p>
<p>There is a button, which you have to click to import datas from TestMultiprojectFormat.xlsm file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After more tests, by adding some text manually, and them change the color of higher characteres index than 255, works well (I changed it to Cyan).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be the .text which does not work if index is higher than 255 ?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello JP,</p>
<p>There is the sub&nbsp;PRJ_MilestonesDates_deep() in the module PRJ_Milestones_Dates.</p>
<p>There is the main if statement :&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If ((Not PRJ_dst_ProjectLine = 0) And (dst_ws_ProjectSummary.Range(PRJ_All_date_In_DB &amp; PRJ_dst_ProjectLine + 10).Value = 1))&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its else part can be ignore to highligth the issue. So I detail a bit only the 'then' part.</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each c In src_ws_datas.Range("b:b")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Search for Milestones<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Search for Period Achievements<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If c.Text Like "Period Achievements" Then<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />

<p>
</p><p>Then I treat first the milestones with their color</p>

<p>Hello JP,</p>
<p>Continuing to work around it, I did some new approach.</p>
<p>I do t not use .text anymore, but this force me to create a kind of color change table (showing a toggle between color black, and any other color).</p>
<p>Here is the file with this work around&nbsp;<a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnW1qXXvWln0elCVPowldzc76hg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">.text work around</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The side effect, is the code efficiency. It is much more slower :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this can be improved by Microsoft :-)</p>

    <title>Nokia, is this all you can do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iiih51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia, is this all you can do&#63;</h2>
                    I recently got myself an E51, thinking that since it's been out there for a while and recently got a firmware update, it would be stable and well-tought-through. Main buying point was the built-in SIP client, since I tried fiddling with Fring on a Sony
 Ericcson P1i before and it was way too cumbersome for everyday use.<br />
<br />
My needs are as simple as they seem obvious to me: While on the road, I want to make VoIP calls via the best internet connection available to me. That's it. Too much asked for?<br />
<br />
For a test: I selected "always on" for my Sip account, picked my home network as a standard connection and made sure to check "internet call" for my call preferences. So I dialled a number, the phone made the connection via my VoIP account, and I was able to
 talk. That easy! Wow - so I thought.<br />
<br />
1. To save battery life, I decided to deactivate "always on" for my Sip account. Now that's where the first two bugs come to bite you: Now, when you dial a number, the Nokia phone will simply go ahead and make a regular phone call, even though the call preferences
 are set to "internet call". You can overcome this bug by sacrificing convenience: Instead of just punching in the number and hitting "connect" you can go via the context menu and choose to make the internet call that the phone should be doing by itself. Second
 bug after you hang up: Nokia's sip client won't disconnect you from your VoIP provider anymore. This bug can also be overcome by sacrificing convenience: Toss out one of your standby menu applications, replace it with the "internet phone" system option. After
 each and every call, hang up, then go to the menu and thoroughly disconnect.<br />
<br />
2. Next step: Leaving home, and entering the office, where you also have WiFi. Trying to make a call, Nokia's Sip client tells you that "the" Wifi connection is not available. Options: Make the call via GSM, or make no call at all. Only alternative: Dig through
 the phone configuration and reconfigure your VoIP account. Of course, that means when you get back home, the phone will tell you once again that "the" Wifi connection isn't available. I found a workaround for this, too, and from here on convenience is going
 way downhill: Instead of being able to dial directly (which we already sacrificed in step #1) or going via the context menu, you actually have to visit the "internet phone" system option after AND before your VoIP call. Because connecting via "internet phone"
 indeed seems to be the only way to be able to choose an available WiFi connection.<br />
<br />
3. So having all of this figured out, you finally dare to take the E51 out on the road. Trying to make a VoIP call from a place that hasn't WiFi, you're in for the next surprise: Where's my UMTS connection? Turns out that the menu of available connections will
 only show you WiFi connections, nothing else. So once again you'll have to dig down to your VoIP provider configuration and change the default connection to your GSM provider. What happens now is that, every time you want to make a VoIP call, you start connecting
 via UMTS. Then you need to cancel that connection attempt, and after that you are finally presented with a list of possible connections (this time it's UMTS and WiFis together). If there's no WiFi available you can then go ahead and connect via UMTS anyway.<br />
<br />
Nokia, are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
Somehow I imagine Batman's Joker sitting somewhere in a top level office at Nokia viciously plotting all this. Well at least it would mean that *someone* is enjoying it - I am certainly not.<br />
<br />
I have even tried to use third-party software (WeFi in particular) to somehow make this phone usable. For those who aren't familiar: WeFi creates a single access point (Automatic - WeFi) and will then connect you with the best WiFi connection actually available.
 This will actually work for all internet applications on the e51 - except for the SIP client. Because if you choose WeFi as the default access point and try to make a SIP call, the phone will tell you - you guessed it - that "the" Wifi connection isn't available
 but hey, how about a regular GSM call?<br />
<br />
Concluding this post, I am somehow hoping that someone will tell me what a douchebag I am, that I have overlooked the essential configuration of my phone and that Nokia's SIP client is actually usable. I am really looking forward to this! Please! - Anyone?

<p>&nbsp;Do you have an unlimited data plan? If so, why are you not using the UMTS all the time? It should be available everywhere (meaning you never need to "change connection") and it uses less battery.</p>
<p>Can't say it's really a "solution" but at least a work-around. That said, my E51 just didn't have the battery power to keep the 3g stuff on all the time. It would drain in a day and a half or so.</p>

            Well I don't have an unlimited data plan - but the main issue is that VoIP over UMTS doesn't have the same quality as it has over WiFi. And yes, the third issue is battery life - which all in all doesn't make it a viable workaround I'm afraid.

            I never noticed a difference in quality myself, but it could have to do with the speed and coverage of your network? For battery life I understand that UMTS is actually preferable over WiFi, as WiFi has a higher power consumption.

<p>Problem 2, specifically having to reconfigure VoIP accounts when moving between access points, is one I seem to have avoided.</p>
<p>I have one SIP account for each commonly used access point.</p>
<p>The SIP accounts are identical but for the name and default access point.</p>
<p>Both are set to automatic (in the Internet Tel app) and, as long as wifi scanning is enabled, the correct SIP connection is automatically created when moving between the access points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing is, I only created one SIP account to start with. The rest were created automatically by the handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my E65 I set up one SIP account "Gizmo" (Tools|Settings|Connection|SIP settings) with default access point "home", and one "Internet Tel Settings" record called "Gizmo Settings" (...Connection|Internet tel. settings).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I configured two wifi access points ("home" and "work").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While at work, starting the Internet Tel application (Connectivity|Internet Tel) it listed the work access point and tried to connect to the SIP account "Gizmo". In doing so it created a second SIP account "Gizmo(work)" automatically and associated that
 with "Gizmo Settings".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So each access point links to a single VoIP profile. Each VoIP profile links to many SIP accounts (one per access point).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still don't understand why the configuration has to be so convoluted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi gnomeza - thanks for the reply, in the meantime I've discovered that one as well, and of course it improves the situation considerably. On my E51, I can create SIP settings for each Wifi access point and connect them to my main SIP profile. So that makes
 Internet Telephony usable, no doubt. (Interestingly, Nokia support didn't or didn't want to tell me about this.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The drawbacks that remain are that all of this has to be done manually and the amount of settings that accumulate over time will be considerable. Switching VoIP provider will be a huge PITA, and of course, and it's not possible to discover and use free WLAN
 spots as you go (and when you happen to be in a LAN Cafe out in the sticks it kinda feels pointless to add it to your phone configuration, but as it seems that's the only way). I've tried all automatic WiFi connectors I could lay my hands on (WeFi, HandyWi,
 Easy Wi-Fi, Birdstep) but while they all work more or less fine, none of them works with Nokia's SIP client. :(

<h3> michaelmasters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lack of Acknowledgement of Display Problems in Build 14951 Continually Continue to Maintain the Continuity of Information SOP at Microsoft.</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so the title may be a bit tongue-in-cheek, but there are a lot of frustrated people out there, so a bit of humor is warranted.&nbsp; I've lost count of the builds that this issue has persisted in since 14905.&nbsp; There is basically an established bug, with
 between many and all systems using WDDM&nbsp; 1.0 chipsets (still listed as the minimum for installation and use of Windows 10).&nbsp; Most of these systems can regain limited function with the use of the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver.&nbsp; Arguably, all of these
 systems could regain complete function with the replacement of their chipsets with new ones of WDDM 1.3&nbsp; or above (a. at Insider expense, and b. in contradiction of the stated minimum equipment standard requirement for Windows 10).&nbsp;&nbsp; Insiders have posted several
 times on the threads for the previous contentious builds, that Microsoft can't make drivers to support all chipsets.&nbsp; Perhaps this is true, but who wrote the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver?&nbsp; Excuses are easy, solutions are somewhat more difficult.&nbsp;
 So, if Microsoft is unwilling or unable to support WDDM 1.0 hardware in Redstone 2 builds, then since 14931 is now downloadable on the Insider Preview download&nbsp; page (along with 14393 which works just fine with WDDM 1.0 hardware), there needs to be a notice
 that affect on the system requirements, as well as an entry on the&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Lifecycle page</a> . An official announcement on the Feedback Hub would be helpful as well.&nbsp; Give me your thoughts on this, as well as any ideas you think might help.&nbsp; I don't want to demonize Microsoft.&nbsp; I simply want them to do their due diligence.</p>

<p>I would have to agree. But the issue isn't WDDM and the problem isn't Microsoft's. I was, until I gave it some thought, in the camp that thought it was Microsoft's responsibility to ensure hardware compatibility. I am no longer in that camp. It is the hardware
 manufacturer's responsibility to design and release new drivers that are compatible with the direction Microsoft is moving in. What is stopping them from having their staff working on Insider builds? What is stopping them from having their staff working with
 Microsoft to develop new drivers for, in their view not Microsoft's, redundant&nbsp;hardware? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DV4-1454ca laptop that is running Insider builds. If I go to HP's support site I am lucky to find any driver updates for this computer that addresses anything past Vista. There are some Windows 7 drivers but nothing for Windows 8. Why? Because HP
 considers that the DV4 became obsolete prior to Windows 8 release. Most of the drivers on the laptop, video and sound specifically are not HP drivers but Microsoft drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I agree that Microsoft should have a site where they list devices that are no longer compatible with the new direction Redstone 2 is taking but it is the hardware manufacturer's responsibility to also state quite clearly what hardware they are prepared
 to make compatible with the Windows 10 Redstone 2 release. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to throw a 10+ year old laptop away in order to have a robust functional OS then so be it because the 10 year old laptop has lasted longer than the vehicle that was bought in 2006 and has more than paid for itself.</p>

            <p>Truly Richard, I am resigned to the fact that support for 1.0 is simply going to end with build 14393.&nbsp; If Microsoft is going to allow those with that build to stand with it, and not expire it on them, as long as they keep that machine out of the Insider
 Program from that point, then fine.&nbsp; However, as stated in my feedback and the OP, I think MS has a responsibility to those in the program to inform us when the OS hits a compatibility wall. It's a minor issue, both financially and technically, to replace
 the graphics adapter on basically any system.&nbsp; In Dallas, you can go to say Frys or a similar electronics store and get a compatible adapter out of a bin for less than $10.00..&nbsp; On that Dell 655 it would take about 10 minutes to replace.&nbsp; On the average laptop,
 the adapter cost is about the same, and the time investment is about 30 minutes (depending on the number of screws to open the case, on most HP's it's a tab).&nbsp; The thing is, there are a lot of Insiders out there that are noobs (no insult intended), not technically
 proficient enough, or just lost, frustrated, or stunned by the deafening silence on the subject from Microsoft.&nbsp; I have said many times, and still maintain, that we are out own tech support.&nbsp; If we are not here for each other, then who will be?&nbsp; I will keep
 pressing the issue here and in Feedback.&nbsp; Your post here and those in past threads show me you care, so why not add your voice?&nbsp; Thanks again for Dona's contact info. The more information we can send her, and anyone else who can effect change, the better our
 chances of getting the necessary information to all Insiders.&nbsp; They need it.</p>

            <p>It is good that you don't have an issue with this.&nbsp; Many other Insiders do.&nbsp; I set the bar at WDDM 1.3 because I know for a fact that it is absolutely compatible with all Redstone 2 builds.&nbsp; Many manufacturers are brand specific in their compatibility.&nbsp;
 After some buck passing between Dell and Intel, Dell washed their hands in general and Intel just said no more support for the Q35 Express family in Windows 10.&nbsp; That translates into that adapter won't work beyond build 14393.&nbsp; They did the same with several
 other adapters prior to 4000 family.&nbsp; Just kinda said sux to be them and cut their losses.&nbsp; Other manufacturers have done the same.&nbsp; Your adapter works with the builds to date, but we operate in a constant state of flux. What is fine today may be scrap tomorrow.&nbsp;
 Time will tell.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            <p>Don't get me wrong Michael, I agree. But I also think that the hardware manufacturers whether Dell, HP, ASUS etc. should bear some of the responsibility.&nbsp;The devices on my DV4 support WDDM 1.1 but HP has shown no interest in updating them so they actually
 work in Windows 10. As far as they are concerned the device is way past its&nbsp;Best Before Date. &nbsp;I don't think it is Microsoft's responsibility to step in, which they have done in a lot of cases, and build drivers for devices HP refuses to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to see a data base somewhere that listed compatible devices with Redstone 2 as they become known to Microsoft but I also have some issues with the Insider program. If you look at the top "me too" ratings on the feedback hub the top 100 I would
 venture are **** about how bad Windows 10 is or why it doesn't have this or that, not what isn't working and the last time I checked the issue with the most "me too" was less that 10,000 and there are supposedly millions of Insiders. Thus Microsoft's problem,
 if issues aren't reported by enough users&nbsp;they won't show very high on their action list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully things will either improve or Microsoft will start pressing the hardware/software venders to get their act together and start building and publishing their own lists of incompatibility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now it is 3:30am here&nbsp;and time to get some sleep. A bit like when I was working and I sent out emails at about 3:00am and my then boss almost instantly emailed back and asked&nbsp;why was I still up and working. My response back was 'Why are you?'</p>

            <p>Some clarifications, long post ahead, sorry.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as <strong>WDDM </strong>chipsets. WDDM is a Microsoft driver model defining a feature set and a set of libraries (WDDM API set). Chipset/GPU's are not Microsoft specific, they handle other OS'ses which do not use WDDM at all, all
 they know about is DirectX and OpenGL feature levels.</p>
<p>The libraries used by graphics device driver devs. contain the bulk of the generic driver code. The&nbsp;chipset/GPU specific code is up to the&nbsp;ISV/OEM to implement, they are extremely complex and&nbsp;protected as
<em>trade secrets&nbsp;</em>. The specifics&nbsp;can vary from one chipset/GPU&nbsp;to another, they can even vary from one HW revision to another. This model makes it much easier for ISV's to develop graphics drivers, the bulk of the code is already written, they only have
 to take care of the specifics.</p>
<p>The feature set defines the features that must be presented through code and/or FW (Chipset/GPU).</p>
<p>For instance WDDM 1.1 defines HW accelerated rendering, that means that the GPU must handle it, else it&nbsp;must be emulated in driver specific code.</p>
<p>WDDM 1.3 requires casting feature (say Miracast).</p>
<p>WDDM 1.1 was required for Windows 7, 1.2 was Windows 8 and 1.3 was required to qualify Windows 8.1 devices.</p>
<p>That means that OEM devices (PC's)&nbsp;shipped with Windows 7, must have been WDDM 1.1 (minimum)qualified.</p>
<p>The requirements for new&nbsp;devices shipped with Windows 10 (on sale since summer 2016) is WDDM 1.3. That's why MSBDA is WDD 1.3 qualified,&nbsp;it's build using the WDDM 1.3 libraries (just like on Windows 8.1) and consists of two drivers, a Display driver and
 a Render driver.</p>
<p>The full feature set for Windows 10 , is defined by WDDM 2.0, most (if not all) OEM ship new devices with WDDM2.0 or 2.1.</p>
<p>Does that mean that WDDM 1.1 cannot be used with Windows 10? No, but don't expect things like video rendering or &nbsp;Miracast to function, don't expect real HW acceleration and don't expect power management to function correctly.</p>
<p>Does this mean that WDDM 1.0 does not work on Windows 10, probably not, all depends on the implementation, some WDDM 1.0 drivers may implement WDDM 1.1 features but are not qualified so they may fail or have issues.</p>
<p>Would this mean that new devices can run with WDDM 1.1, NO they can't, they won't even&nbsp;install (why would you?).</p>
<p>Another feature is overall device integration, for instance UEFI and power management. A graphics driver running on an UEFI enabled device must handle UEFI events, for instance switching power states (Sleep/standby).</p>
<p>A driver which doesn't handle UEFI state transition may fail to enter or return to/from&nbsp;standby, resulting in glitches, incorrect sync settings, reverting to MSBDA, &nbsp;black screens (video blanked)&nbsp;or hangs at worst. You see, even when your device seems to
 work correctly with WDDM 1.1 drivers, you may have issues. Sure, you won't have such issues &nbsp;running them on old hardware that doesn't implement UEFI and power state managent (think laptops), but may have issues on more recent desktops equipped with
<em>Old </em>graphics cards.</p>

</p><p>This is from the Insider download page, where you can either download the Redstone 1 build, or the Redstone 2 build.&nbsp; The System Requirements for 10 in general is WDDM 1.0.&nbsp; If Redstone 2 requires a more current driver, then the System Requirements should
 reflect that.&nbsp; Good Lord people, that's all I want is current information.&nbsp; I don't want to reinvent the wheel, just update the bloody webpage guys.&nbsp; Maybe pass the info on in Announcements.&nbsp; I know that someone's job is to put information there.&nbsp; They promote
 pointless PR programs all the time.&nbsp; You mean to tell me that a bunch of nerds can crash the internet on the whole East coast with a DDoS, and MS can't post a single paragraph of current information on their own informational app? OK.&nbsp; Also, UEFI? Are you
 saying that all these Insiders can solve their display issues by backing up their systems, activating legacy boot in BIOS setup, wiping their partitions, clean installing with an MBR configuration, and Bob's your uncle they'll have functioning "modern" rendering
 when installation is complete? Frankly, I don't know why I didn't think of such a simple solution.&nbsp; I must've been distracted.&nbsp; Hey Richard, problem solved. &lt;-Possible sarcasm interspersted within genius post.</p>

            <p>I have to agree with you on the subject of just how contentious HP's relationship with MS is and frankly has been.&nbsp; We discussed it at length, last year before RTM.&nbsp; HP, Dell, ASUS, Acer, and a few others were going back and forth with MS, saying it was
 all their fault and that MS and the hardware manufacturers bore the onus of making it all work together.&nbsp; In early November, they all sent out notices that if users has upgraded, they should revert, and if they hadn't not to.&nbsp; Supposedly this was in the interest
 of their customers.&nbsp; Then, just before Christmas, HP started a major sales campaign for new systems "Optimized for Windows 10".&nbsp; Hilarious.&nbsp; Absolutely not disingenuous at all.&nbsp; It did show their estimation for exusting customers though.&nbsp; Beautifully mercenary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A database would be awesome, but l think that if it's going to be built, it will have to be by one of us. In my Feedback and threads on this subject, I've been asking for people to post their problem equipment so that I can post a list to Feedback, but maybe
 I should just start a database and post it on my website. I would probably have to start a neutral site as well, since my web address is autofiltered.</p>

</p><p>Speaking of the effectiveness of Feedback, I looked at my profile and saw that I have all but a couple of the "merit badges?".&nbsp; All this tells me is that I waste a lot of time on Feedback and the only people paying attention are other Insiders.&nbsp; Eh, what're

            <p>Where the did I say that they could solve their display issues by switching to BIOS mode? Switching&nbsp;to UEFI mode can result power managent issues like failing switching power. Hangs when returning from standby/sleep are one these. Devices that are UEFI enabled
 come with UEFI <em>capable&nbsp;graphics</em> and run WDDM 1.3 or higher.</p>
<p>Windows 10 installs and run a WDDM 1.3 qualified driver (yes, it runs all the time, you can't disable or remove it). That's the driver that handles the UI during install, recovery and boot, it's the driver used on most server SKU's. You can run it on EOL
 equipment,&nbsp; problem solved.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the "TEXT" function to do this</p>
<p>=CONCATENATE("There is a minimum monthly fee of $",TEXT((Pricing!P5),"#.00"))</p>
<p>You can also save a bit of work by using the &amp; operator</p>
<p>="There is a minimum monthly fee of $" &amp; TEXT((Pricing!P5),"#.00")</p>

            I don't understand how updating the OS/Office can make any change, this problems seems to be with the document/settings. I mean, Excel is probably disabling the menu on purpose because of something.<br />
<br />
If I create a new empty spreadsheet and select a cell, all items in the Insert meny are enabled. If I click the header, all items are disabled.<br />
<br />
I have been able to use the insert menu in a different spreadsheet. But after making some changes, the menu was suddenly was disabled again.

            Hi Craig,
<br />You can place a call to the phone numbers in a contact - then you'll either need to take notes in the contact notes field. You could use onenote instead.

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>Thanks for&nbsp;your private message.</p>
<p>I have checked corresponding DNS records of the custom domain and found that you have added two SPF records for the domain. I’d like to explain that Office 365 supports only one SPF record (a TXT record that defines SPF) for your domain, including the following
 domain name: spf.protection.outlook.com. If you want to add IP addresses to the SPF record, you need to customize the existing SPF domain other than adding another SPF record. So please delete the second SPF record and leave v=spf1 ip4:74.202.104.128/29 mx
 -all.</p>
<p>Meantime, you can add IP addresses to the SPF record by referring to the following article:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Customize an SPF record to validate outbound email sent from your domain</a>.</p>
<p>Note: It may take 72 hours&nbsp;to update the DNS records.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after referring to the information above, feel free to let us know and we will further assist you.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

<p>Hi Anshu,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. Is the sender of the problematic mail message inside or outside your organization?</p>
<p>2. If the sender is outside the organization, is the sender an Office 365 account&nbsp;user&nbsp;or non-Office 365 account user such as Hotmail, Gmail, etc.?</p>
<p>3. Would you mind providing us with the problematic email’s<em><strong> message header</strong>
</em>via the private message for further analysis?</p>
<p>4. Also, would you mind running a <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
message trace </a>to diagnose why the messages are delayed for couple of hours?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the message header. Please follow the link below to read it:</p>

<p>Hi Anshu,</p>
<p>Thanks for the private message.</p>
<p>From it, I got to know that the error message occurs when a non-Office 365 sender sends emails to an Office 365 user.</p>
<p>Right now,&nbsp;the message header is not enough&nbsp;to help us figure out the root cause.&nbsp;So, given the situation, to narrow down the root cause of the issue further, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. Would you mind asking the Office 365 recipient to run a <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
message trace </a>and double clicking the message trace result to see why the messages are delayed?</p>
<p>2. I noticed that the message send from the non-Office 365 sender was delivered to more than one recipient, I’d like to know if other recipients except for those whose domain names are basecompany.be have received the email message sent out from the non-Office
 365 sender.</p>
<p>3. Since the sender is a non-Office 365 user, I’d like to know if the sender is an Exchange server account or third-party account. If the sender is a third-party account, did the third-party account mail service provider has an outgoing message limit? If
 yes, did the message sent by the third-party account reach the outgoing message limit?</p>
<p>4. Did this issue happen to all the recipients whose domain name is basecompany.be?</p>
<p>5. Can the recipients whose domain name is basecompany.be receive emails immediately from other senders except this non-Office 365 user?</p>
<p>6. After checking the domain basecompany.be, it seems your organization has the DirSync enabled. Under this circumstance, I’d like to know if the recipient is an Exchange server account or Office 365 Exchange Online account?</p>
<p>Your continued efforts and patience are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<p>Hi Anshu,</p>
<p>By saying “Remote admin (recipient on O365) raised case with MS and were told that our (non-O365 sender) IPs are blacklisted on O365”, do you mean that the recipient has opened a service request? If so, would you mind contacting the recipient to provide
 us with the service request number so that we can check the status of the service request?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I’ve sent you a private message to collect the service request number. Please follow the link below to read it:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.office365.com/user/conversations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">community.office365.com/.../conversations</a></p>
<p>Also, please check to see if you were placed on the Office 365 partner block lists by referring to the following article:</p>

<h2>            Bundled Outlook 2016 scheduling assistant doesn&#39;t work, VL version does</h2>
                    <p>Have a handful of users with new Dell laptops running OEM-included Office 2016. When they open the scheduling assistant to add other user's calendars, it only shows a grey bar and if you hover over the bar it states "We're checking everyone's calendars..."
 as seen in this stolen screenshot:</p>

<p>
</p><p>OWA works properly, and through Powershell I verified permissions were set correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the OEM-bundled Office, installed our VL copy of Office 2016 to test, and it works as expected. What's going on with the bundled version that breaks checking availability?</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;ijustwanttoreadthings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to have a better understanding of your concern, we’d like to know more details about your issue. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When had the issue first occurred?</li><li>Exchange, POP, or IMAP email server?&nbsp;</li><li>Are you using a personal or company email account?</li><li>Have you tried to reinstall the OEM Office version? Does the same behavior occur?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The version of OEM Outlook version might be outdated and from the time that you have installed the Volume Licensed Office 2016 it automatically gets the updated version. Since Office is having the latest update you did not encounter it after installing the
 Volume Licensed one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more updates and other support needs, you can also follow our official YouTube channel:

<p>Thank you for the quick response; answers below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue first occurred a couple months ago, shortly after receiving and deploying new laptops.</p>
<p>Exchange -- using O365.</p>
<p>Company email account.</p>
<p>Attempted to reinstall but ran into issues with click-to-run not being compatible with previously installed Visio/Project. Reinstallation was not performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agreed on OEM Office possibly being out of date, but according to Windows Update it was fully updated. I didn't see a way to force Office to check for updates from within Outlook (File-&gt;Account Options).

<h2>            Outlook 2003 keeps running in system process and task bar even after it is closed</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows XP with Outlook 2003 on both my desktop and laptop.</p>
<p>On my desktop computer when I close Outlook 2003 the icon stays in the task bar at the lower right.&nbsp; You cannot reopen it from this icon.</p>
<p>However, if I am exporting contacts to my laptop I am told that the system is still running on another system and I have to go back to the desktop and bring up the Windows Task Manager and shut down the Outlook.exe in processing.</p>
<p>I have been using this program since 2003 without any problem; this just started about 6 months ago and is really annoying.&nbsp; Can anyone Please tell me how to correct this?</p>

<p>I am running Windows XP with Outlook 2003 on both my desktop and laptop.</p>
<p>On my desktop computer when I close Outlook 2003 the icon stays in the task bar at the lower right.&nbsp; You cannot reopen it from this icon.</p>
<p>However, if I am exporting contacts to my laptop I am told that the system is still running on another system and I have to go back to the desktop and bring up the Windows Task Manager and shut down the Outlook.exe in processing.</p>
<p>I have been using this program since 2003 without any problem; this just started about 6 months ago and is really annoying.&nbsp; Can anyone Please tell me how to correct this?</p>
