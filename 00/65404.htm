            Many products have product keys - which program is asking for it?<br />
<br />
<br />
To find your Windows product key:<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Product Key - Where To Find Product Key</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>1) If you bought a computer with Windows preinstalled there should be a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer, on some laptops it’s in the battery bay. It will
 have a 25 character alphanumeric code on it - that is your product key. If it's not on your computer look in your paperwork or on any CD/DVD cases that were included with the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2) If you bought a retail copy of Windows the key should be included in the box.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) If you bought Windows online and downloaded it the key should have been sent to you through email. If you bought Windows from the MS Store you can log in to your account to view your key:</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoftstore.com</span></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A common program to ask for a product key is Microsoft Office:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>
<span>Only an Office key will activate Office.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Some new computers come with Microsoft Office Starter, which is a free version of Office with reduced functions. If you want to add more features you can buy the full version of Office. If you did buy
 Office you should have a key that was included with it.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Also, some new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase
 a Microsoft Office license. </span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Microsoft Office Starter info:<br />

<p>
<span>If you need to buy a key for Office:</span></p>

<p>Spending 30 minutes on a file to download is somewhat tedious. Please configure your system to create minidumps:</p>

<p>I might try downloading that file tomorrow, but if after configuring the system to create minidumps any BSOD happens, please share the minidumps.</p>

                    <div>Iam deciding whether to go over to apple or stay with MS. This depends on whether there is a patch for picture it 2002. I am running vista and will upgrade to windows 7 if there is a patch for that. MS i feel has turned there back on its users. Sure they
 offer live gallery, but it is not even a close match. I have looked every where and found a lot in the same place as i am. So either MS just doesn't care or....! Maybe after enough people switch they will get the message. Sure Bill don't care he has enough
 $ for a 1000 life times. But you would think he would care about all the people working for the company that would get laid off due to people switching. If anyone knows of a patch, please let me know. thanks</div>

    <title>Win 7 to Win 10 UG - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardrylander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 to Win 10 UG</h2>
                    <p>System: 120gb SSD for boot an essential programs. 1tb internal WD Black 7200 rpm hdd for data. nVidia 660 VC. 8gb of system ram. DVD drive. Logitech G19 kb/mouse. Plantronic usb headphones. Anti-virus (have used Bitdefender and Kaspersky).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process:</p>
<p>1) Tried 4x to install from win (with download) and then burned a cd and fails at 40%</p>
<p>2) Deleted the AV and Plantronic headphone software - failed</p>
<p>3) Disconnected the hdd - failed</p>
<p>4) Removed Logitech and went to standard kb/mouse - failed</p>
<p>5) Ran file integrity check as well as the various MS tools (from FixIt to the others recommended in various posts) - failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point either I wait until MS gets their act together or I start over from scratch and completely reinstall Win10 on a clean drive. Can't think of anything else to try. Multiple other systems (none with SSD's) have upgraded with no issue but this
 combination won't UG.</p>

            <p>Downloaded the update again and burned a new DVD (and verified the disk). Removed one stick of memory. Started the update process and said YES to download updates. After the updates were completed but before the update started I unplugged the wireless usb
 and proceeded. This time the update completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged the usb wireless fob back in after the update but it wouldn't read. I moved to a different usb and it did recognize. I rebooted the system and as it started to reload Win 10 said it needed to repair drive C: (which it did). I put the 2nd stick
 of ram back in and now we are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually think the issue may have been the usb wireless.</p>

            Hey there Richard :)<br />
<br />
Congrats on successfully troubleshooting the problem. I would suggest testing all components that may have caused the issue just to be on the safe side that your system is fully healthy. I'd run some memory tests in order to verify the full healthy of the two
 memory sticks. I'd also run some stress tests to see if the other components are good. I'd check all the external peripherals on another computer and see if they are working properly there.&nbsp;<br />
For the storage I would recommend using a diagnostic tool from the manufacturer and check the drives' S.M.A.R.T. statuses. For the WD Black drive I would recommend using WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic tool. Check if the drive passes both the quick and the extended
 tests. Here's a link to the tool: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=samYJ3<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have questions or other concerns :)<br />
<br />
Captain_WD.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When exactly do you get the prompt to install SpareBackup.msi?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would recommend you to perform clean boot as this issue could be caused by some third party software.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.
</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:

<p><b>Note</b>: </p>
<p>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also download and run a full system scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if the issue is caused by Virus/Malware.</p>

<h2>            Is the Preview&#47;Reading pane still a risk in Mail app &#40;or other modern clients&#41; these days&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have certain relatives who are phobic about using any mail client with a preview pane because they believe it is risky. Since the Mail app has no option to disable previews,&nbsp;I have been wondering if the claim that previewing email will give you Trojans/viruses
 remains valid today.&nbsp; Most articles I've found on the subject refer to older clients, but this article (<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/safe-reading-pane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/safe-reading-pane/</a> ) suggests there may be something
 to my suspicions.&nbsp;</p>

            It's a myth.&nbsp; Unless you load code (open a file attachment or click a link) then the reading pane is completely passive now.&nbsp; It won't execute any code.

    <title>Cannot purchase anything due to MS insisting on me answering a phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dongwaffle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot purchase anything due to MS insisting on me answering a phone number I haven&#38;&#35;39&#59;t had in 10 years</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the same Hotmail account since the late 90s (before it was a Microsoft thing), and when time came to create a Live account, I used Hotmail as that appeared to be the preferred solution.&nbsp; I've been using this account with Live for years, first
 on the xbox, then the 360,&nbsp;and now using Games for Windows.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago I purchased Dirt 3 via Steam.&nbsp; I installed it, connected it to my live account, and then bought a track pack via DLC without any trouble.&nbsp; Just today I've managed to resolve a months-old problem with my hardware setup so I figured it's
 a good time to dig back into Dirt 3 and maybe pick up the other track and car packs.</p>
<p>When trying to purchase anything in the marketplace I'm now prompted to enter a code sent to what MS thinks is my phone number.&nbsp; The problem is, the phone number that Microsoft has on file is a number that used to belong to a work-provided cell phone at
 a place I worked 3 jobs and just over 10 years ago.&nbsp; Changing the number in my account settings says that I cannot use the new phone number for 30 days.&nbsp; The site gives me no other options to validate my identity.</p>
<p>As noted before, I've been able to purchase content through the marketplace in the past without needing any phone.&nbsp; Why is it that when MS decides to dredge up a literally decade old number that I now cannot purchase any content for 30 days?&nbsp; Who the heck
 made that decision?</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do here?</p>

<p>Support's answer was to wait 30 days, and that I should feel lucky because it used to be 6 months.</p>
<p>I never used this phone number with Xbox Live, ever. &nbsp;It was a hold over from Hotmail, and now I'm stuck not being able to use the marketplace because one bit is stuck in their database and nobody appears to be willing to do anything about it. &nbsp;I'd just
 make a new account but I already have DLC on this one.</p>
<p>As it stands, it's serving to reinforce my suspicion that I shouldn't buy games or DLC outside of Steam.</p>

<p>Same answer all around - we screwed up, nobody has any idea why, just go ahead and wait.</p>
<p>It's a garbage answer from an ineffectual support organization. &nbsp;Nobody has any authority to address an issue of your own making and the customer is stuck in the middle. &nbsp;The official answer is "welp sorry", not "let us see what we can do to address the
 issue". &nbsp;I hope you do at least see the difference. It's not that you can't help - MS owns this user account somewhere. &nbsp;It's that either the support representatives either cannot (likely) or will not do anything to address the issue. &nbsp;From the customer perspective,
 the result is the same.</p>
<p>I'm not going to mark this answered as the response isn't an answer, it's an acknowledgement of MS's inability to deal with their own customer records in anything approaching a rational manner.</p>

<p>"Not doing anything about it" is exactly what the response has been. &nbsp;"Just wait 30 days" is a cop-out answer, which says that either MS support is either unable or unwilling to actually lift a finger to address a customer issue. &nbsp;Both options do not reflect
 well upon the organization and it speaks to a larger indifference to the customer.</p>

<p>To clarify a point - I'd be far more understanding if at some point I had created an XBox live account and entered this phone number for use as a security contact. &nbsp;That never happened, due to the simple fact that I no longer had possesion of that phone
 when XBL launched back in 2001. &nbsp;This phone number is a left over of a leftover system. &nbsp;It has never been required for me to make purchases in the past, the most recent of which being March of this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, sometime between March and October, MS has dug up some ancient phone number from my hotmail account that literally predates the entire XBL service and has decided that I need to use that phone to do anything on the marketplace.</p>
<p>If this was all the result of my own actions then I would understand why nobody seemed interested in doing anything about it.</p>

<p>I downloaded the wolf skin on the xbox 360 but it hasn't transfered over to the xbox one. Anyone have any clue how to fix this. I shouldn't have to buy another. My season pass transfers and so should the wolf.</p>

<p>How is it ripping customers off? They never guaranteed anything other than the Season Pass to transfer, and it took me all of 5 minutes to get in a chat with a support agent and find that answer out. If people were informed buyers instead of rushing into
 things, then they'd know exactly what they're getting.</p>

<p>The only reason I'm asking is I have multiple clan members who had theirs transfer. I'll just talk to them directly, reverse the purchase and switch it manually.</p>

<p>With a used computer the first thing to ALWAYS do is a clean install. This will take care of any inherited problems. If you have a branded OEM computer (HP, Dell, etc.):</p>
<p>Most laptops and many OEM (HP, Sony, etc.) desktop computers come with a factory restore image on a special partition on the hard drive. The factory restore process is normally invoked by pressing a Function key (like F11) at computer startup. There will
 be a message as to which Function key to press on the screen when you first start your computer. You can also refer to your computer manual, or the computer mftr.'s website, or contact its tech support to see how to restore your computer to factory condition
 since each computer mftr. does it differently - sometimes even between models.<br />
<br />
These machines also usually have a utility with which to create physical recovery discs in case the hard drive needs to be replaced or the factory restore image is somehow damaged. If you did not create the physical recovery discs and/or damaged the recovery
 image, contact the computer mftr.'s tech support to order a recovery disc set. This is normally very inexpensive, around $25-50.</p>
<p>If this is a generic computer:</p>

                    <p>I was told by <strong>MLBTV to download the app via Windows Store</strong>.&nbsp; Yet, it's telling me that it's

<strong>Common Sense tells me that they are making room for the 2017 app for Win 10?</strong>&nbsp; Am I wrong or Is it something on my end (doubtful).. Does this happen usually this time of the year before Baseball season?&nbsp; I would be a first time subscriber to

    <title>USB 2.0 drivers for Windows 8.1 &#40;64bit&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul_985  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 2.0 drivers for Windows 8.1 &#40;64bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Intro/Problem: &nbsp;</strong>I installed 64bit windows 8.1 on an old computer. &nbsp;Everything was working fine, except the motherboard maxes out at 2GB RAM (and I saw a capacitor had blown out) so I bought a newer motherboard (MSI G41M-P33 combo) that still
 supported the old CPU (Pentium D). &nbsp;The USB ports are not working on the new motherboard once Windows boots up (but they work in the BIOS e.g. I can use my USB keyboard to set the BIOS). I have a PS/2-usb adapter on hand so I can still use the mouse and the
 onscreen keyboard to work in windows. &nbsp;When I try to update the USB drivers through device manager, I get a message saying the drivers are not compatible with Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To elaborate: there is not a warning icon by this item:&nbsp;Intel(R) N10/ICH7 Family USB2 Enhanced Host Controller - 27CC</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it looks like each USB port is listed separately as a subset of the above item, with a warning icon over them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Where can I find USB 2.0 drivers for Windows 8.1 64 bit? Google searching is not helping me much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other option is to deactivate these USB ports and just buy a PCI card with USB ports on them. &nbsp;Would these also require special drivers that might be problematic?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>-Paul</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing at this moment. I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Run the fixit using the link below as it can automatically diagnose and fix problems with hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Performing Windows updates. Running Windows Update will check for operating system updates required for your computer. You may refer the steps mentioned below to check for updates. If you find any pending updates then install and
 check. </span></p>

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If still the issue persists then update the Chipset driver and update the<span>&nbsp;
</span>BIOS from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please let us know the status of the issue.</p>

<h2>            Lync plug-in with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to Windows 10 and having an updated Lync Client installed, I am often (3-4 times out of 10) unable to connect to a meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I log in as a guest to my customers Enterprise Lync solution and often cannot get past the lobby. I have resorted to dialling in via phone but this is not acceptable as often I am required to share my desktop during these meetings with the participants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling the client and running Windows Update several times but still with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what other settings I can check?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards.</p>

            Hi SM.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            That is a sound controller which is in error and it needs updating from its manufacturers or the PC manufacturers website. I gave you all possible ways to do this.

<p>I'm sorry Greg, but I've tried downloading the sound controller from MSI's website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/B360-GAMING-PLUS#down-driver&amp;Win10%2064</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed both the Realtek HD Universal Driver and the Realtek High Definition Audio Driver, and Nahimic 3 but the weird thing is, is that it never appears in the Device Manager. I've done a fresh install of Windows 10 and the problem persists. I can't
 do Steps 1-5 because my computer doesn't detect any sound devices AT ALL. I've confirmed it's not a problem with my headset because it works on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it do with this?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Just had this issue crop up on a brand spanking new msi ge73 laptop after upgrading from 1803 to 1809. Have installed and uninstalled the latest nahimic and realtek drivers from msi multiple times, but for some reason this device is being listed as a system
 device and not a sound device. Because of this, the driver install process is not recognizing the proper drivers. And to make things worse, M$, in their infinite wisdom, removed the hardware troubleshooter from 1809, because analytics showed it was the least
 used troubleshooter. I call bs on that decision. If the troubleshooter was still present, it might, just might, be able to help solve the issue.</p>

            Although risky, and not for the faint of heart, I wonder if we could go in to the registry and move the devices location of the device manually from system to sound, video, and game controllers.

            When i try and install the latest drivers from Msi, manually, windows blocks me saying the .inf does not contain drivers for my device. I know for a fact that this is not true. I believe the driver install is being blocked because the system thinks the
 device is a system device, which is wrong. I unhid the devices in device manager, and any device listed related to related or a-volume, usa listed as not being attached to the system. There is even a phantom realtek device in the sound category. I tried removing
 it, as well as a the erroneous entry in the system listing,&nbsp; but it won't accept the driver.

            I tried removing all phantom devices related to the realtek device as well as the device listed in system, and then manually added the device using add legacy device option, but when I did so, immediately after the driver install process started, I got
 a good, system thread exception not handled from rtkvhd64.sys. I may end up having to return to 1803 at this point.

<p>Also lets assume that there is no association between MS and the NSA and that privacy is not an issue with the device and no answers simply saying its crap, i want to know your reasons as to why you think its crap. Can you also not compare kinect 2 to kinect
 1 i want to know what you think of kinect 2 from the information we have seen about this device not how the kinect 1 performed.</p>
<p>Please no trolling and/or flaming, if we can stick to these guidelines i think we can have a very informed discussion.</p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to <em>accurate</em> voice controls, especially with it being linked to TV channels. I&nbsp;think that will be sweet. Also something&nbsp;else I thick&nbsp;will be&nbsp;good&nbsp;is bring up the profile of the person who switches the console on.</p>

<p>I will use it to its fullest extent.. &nbsp; I do not see it as being "forced" upon me.. buying XB is an option in itself... if you do not like what is included in the package.. by all means go buy another package... I see the Kinect as a step forward.. with
 all this "Nex Gen" talk ans wars... XB1 is the only console I see that is taking that step.... Ive been around since pre Atari days... with the speed tech is released and generated.. to have a console released 8 years after its predecessor and only have "better"
 graphics seems like a waste of the last 8 years to me...</p>
<p>As for you OP... &nbsp;the fast switching.. the hand gestures for games.. seems very good and to think this is all pre release stuff... think about how XB360 looked in 2005... compared to what it looks like now... imagine what XB1 and kinect will be able to do
 in 2020</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>It's will allow for a novel way of navigation</p>
<p>It could led to interesting game experiences if used smartly by developers</p>
<p>Allows access to features like Skype</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<p>Can't be used for full control in 3D games. Any game where you have control over your character's movement in a 3D environment will require a controller</p>
<p>So far nothing really innovative has been done with the device by developers. Kinect game play consists of quick time events and other commands that could be handled just as well by a controller</p>
<p>Adds to the cost of the console</p>
<p>Could be used in annoying ways such as validating licenses, heavy use in advertisements etc.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>At this point it's pretty much an unknown and there are a lot of things it has to prove. It doesn't just get a free pass because it's the new big thing. It could be great, it could be a gimmick, it could be a nightmare. It all depends on how it's used. I
 personally am not holding my breath or giving the major corporations involved the benefit of the doubt that they will deliver on all of its hype without confirming the hype of the concerns that surround it.</p>

<p>Advantages </p>
<p>All of what everyone said pluss the ability to control your entertainment experience, as far as 3d games, I think yes as the device is fully implemented then developers will be able to make shooters, 3d character movements and other games of that nature
 for this thing</p>
<p>for me i dont see any real disadvantages all if you look through the negative people that done want it, there are good things, videos and talk about it, but that is just talk untill we have it we cant really know if its bad or good, it has the possility
 to be great.</p>

<p>I only have one concern... And lord help me for posting this again, as I've copped some heat over this already... But here goes:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I occasionally like to take my Xbox and lan party with friends... That means: unplug/pack/transport/unpack/plug-in/unplug/pack/transport/unpack/ plug-in... There's lots of room for damage to occur which means I'm sol if it breaks and I want to play "insert
 game here" multiplayer with my buddies and that game has zero Kinect applications, but I still cannot even have basic controller based functionality. That, and it's not covered by warranty.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This isn't a showstopper, but it's a concern of mine. And I'm awaiting further info to either allay my concerns that it's not just a money grab, but a fair reason Kinect MUST be plugged in at all times.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Time will tell, but voice for me isn't something I'll use very much, motion controls either... But the physical response applications could be interesting if used the right way... Whatever the right way might be. I mean we've heard of some possibilities,
 like for survival horror games.</p>

<p>My primary question would be how much power its draws. its got to be sitting there 24x7 processing every sound it hears just to interpret the phrase xbox on. This processing does not come for nothing, it must drawing compute power to run those voice analyitcs.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. What is the exact issue that you face with the web cam?<br />
2. Do you get any error message?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to update the video and the webcam drivers from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: If the issue is not resolved you may try to update chipset and other device drivers&nbsp;from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
