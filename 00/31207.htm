<h2>            Windows is not detecting Guitar Hero Explorer Controller</h2>
                    <div>I was told to repost this question in the Xbox forums. Unfortunately there is no hardware category for Xbox so I have placed this in Video Applications for lack of a better forum.</div>
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-is-not-detecting-guitar-hero-explorer/ff7bfae9-1ecb-4d2f-9134-e194e6cbfed3?tm=1392535709776&amp;rtAction=1392692491927
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"I own a Guitar Hero (Xplorer) Controller for PC that I have used with my laptop to play Guitar Hero 3 for many years. My laptop is running Windows 7 64-bit. I recently purchased a gaming desktop also running Win7 64-bit. While my Guitar Hero controller
 works fine on my laptop, the device is not recognized when I plug it in to my desktop. I have installed the Xbox controller accessories found here, http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows, but it made no difference. The device
 shows up under device manager with an appropriate name, however it has the yellow warning symbol next to it and is not recognized as a game controller. I have tried letting Windows Update search for the driver but it finds nothing.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It appears that my laptop is using a driver from the XNA framework as the certificate path is "C:\Users\Daniel\system32\drivers\xnacc.sys". Oddly enough, even though both my laptop and desktop have the latest version of XNA installed, xnacc.sys doesn't
 exist on the desktop. Both of my systems are completely up to date. I also ensured that the USB port on my desktop that I plugged the controller into was working and powered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to know how I can get the controller working on my desktop."</div>
</div>

            After a lot of fooling around, I found a solution.
<div><br />
<div>1) Open "Device Manager".</div>
<div>2) Right click the Guitar Hero Explorer Controller (even though it is not working properly) and select "Properties".</div>
<div>3) Goto the "Driver" tab and click "Update Driver".</div>
<div>4) Click "Browser my computer for driver software".</div>
<div>5) Click "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer" rather than browsing.</div>
<div>6) Select something like "Microsoft Common Device", I don't have the option anymore so I can't search for it.</div>
<div>7) A new list of Models will show up for Xbox controllers, I chose "Xbox 360 Controller for Windows [2/15/2007]".</div>
<div><br />
<div>To test if its working type "game controller" into the windows search bar and select "Set up USB game controllers". The guitar hero controller should show up in the list if it is now recognized.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove the local file so you cannot see the messages, but the messages can't be deleted completely. Mood messages work the same way as email. Once you sent one, it is stored in your contact's computer and you cannot reach to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to delete those messages so you don't see it, you just hace to find a file and delete it. The file is located inside Skype files, you can go there from the Go menu in the Finder. Select Go / Go to folder, and paste:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">~/Library/Application Support/Skype/</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Inside your user folder, find the file&nbsp;<strong>keyval.db</strong> and delete it. You will not see the messages, but your contacts still will have their copy. This won't delete your history.</p>

<p>The revised UX for Skype makes it way too easy to create and post a Mood message that is intended as a (private) chat. Just to be clear: this is ridiculous. And annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. It should be possible to edit/remove Mood messages across your network, not just delete them off your local client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. The UX should NOT allow trivial creation of mood messages, which could easily be chats.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
There doesn't need to be one.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should try installing a W7 driver in compatibility mode...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, are you implying that you have the W8 version which was created in April of this year?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that there is supposedly a "Universal driver" available?&nbsp;&nbsp; Try the appropriate one (e.g. 32 or 64 bit) and see if it has XPS support.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I don't know what PLC6 means.&nbsp; You could try researching that for yourself.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, a lot of IE's printer
 problems seem to go away if&nbsp;an XPS&nbsp;tack is taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Good luck</p>

<h2>            Lego Super Heroes 2 &#64;Pharao Egypt Part&#58; Captain America can&#39;t Jump &#38; Hang on to go through final</h2>
                    <p>I bought Lego Super Heroes 2 for my son four days ago and he has been playing since then. But today, he got at  the Pyramid Part, where there's some kind of action needed from Captain American that he can't do at all. We just saw videos at youtube and my son is doing exactly the same but it's not working. He thinks that the game has a problem and he is so mad he stoped to play. So I've tried and couldn't do either.&nbsp;I don't know what to do to complete this action. In this part Hulk stays above a botton sign wich makes appear some bars and  Captain America needs to jump and hang on&nbsp;in order to get to the other side. This action is impossible. Captain America jumps but never reaches the bars and falls. Every time we try he misses the bars. In the videos I've watched this action is simple done. What do I have to do? Is there any problem with the game?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface book 2 keyboard and trackpad not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, even though my keyboard is connected to the screen, the keyboard keys and the trackpad are unresponsive. They used to work when I first purchased this device but stopped working after I closed the lid on the surface book. It would start
 working again after I detach and re-attach the screen but now nothing seems to work anymore. The backlight turns on and the LED indicators on the Fn and Caps key work but nothing I type or do will have any effect on the device. I have tried using the surface
 diagnostics tool but nothing came up. Please could somebody help me with this issue please?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>There was an update that was pushed to Windows last Weds/Thurs (Jan 11, 2018) that disabled the USB Controller in my Surface Book 2, so keyboard, mouse, and Bluetooth were&nbsp; crippled. Only touch screen worked, although the tablet unlock button&nbsp; on keyboard
 did work. No amount of rebooting, or even hard rebooting would solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked at the Device Drivers in control panel, and discovered that the driver for the USB controller was not working, which explained why Bluetooth mouse and USB keyboards would not work, since they are all connected to the USB controller. Tried getting
 the latest USB drivers and reinstalling, but that too did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought it might be a hardware issue, so took it to my IT Support team, and they were able to boot the Surface Book 2 over the network, and the keyboard and mouse started working, pointing to a SW issue.&nbsp; They too tried to reinstall the USB controller driver
 and also did a System Restore, which did not solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when they re-imaged my hard drive with a completely fresh copy of Windows 10, the hw and USB controller started working again. So the belief is something in latest fw update from Jan 11 caused this failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, my system is back to normal now, with the reimaging of the system, but price I had to pay was that everything was lost on my drive, that wasn't in the cloud.</p>

<p>I had the same problem. I did all the re-boots- tried everything and then I found a comment about a security update on the 24th Feb...</p>
<p>I uninstalled the security update KB4074588 and now my keyboard and trackpad works.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>and I hope this helps others with the same problems :)</p>

<p>The Answer was not MY answer, but 32 people marked the Answer in that thread as working for them. I had referred others to that thread who were all helped by it for bad image .dll error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete the files you may need to Take Ownership of them first:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
[Tip] Add "Take Ownership" Option in Files and Folders Context Menu in Windows - AskVG</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had other fixes that always eventually work if that one didn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00<br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.&nbsp; Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>About EFS problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderleonov  say:</h3>
<h2>            About EFS problem</h2>
                    <p>Recently I was in Moscow. I got some kind of the malware in my PC during I tried to communicate with wireless Internet connection and install CityGide from
<a href="http://www.probki.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.probki.net</a>&nbsp; navigation system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(the reason for fixing was that: in Moscow I did not have any Internets and I needed the bluetooth to communicate with some kind of Internet from iPad or download pictures from iPhone - I had the hard time to attach my SD card to PC because of some kind
 of remote to microchip or virus prevented me from doing that - the PC did not recognize the SD card or did not want open it and asked to erase all the data from - I had the microchip replacement in Eleron PC Service center on Prospect Mira - they replaced
 "south Bridge" in authorized Toshiba fixing center).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I had some important encrypted files in my computer but after I tried to reinstall Windows it did not go from external Hard Drive Image restoration.; the Windows was like frozen and I could not change the startup options from Recovery Screen at boot - the
 Windows did not see any additional Hard Drives - I used the Iomega Ego but without encryption on. So, I desided the Windows sytem looks like corrupted. I tried to reinstall Windows ; I desided to loose my files - but I had the 1)Image on backup and 2) backup
 on DVDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Actually I did mistake, I had the renamed backup on external Hard Drive in one folder and another one came on the recent backup - that erased my last Image because I did not renamed it and the new Image came on the top of the old one. So, I lost my&nbsp;last
 Image&nbsp;backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now If I see like that I had the old - from May 2011 DVDs. I desided to restorate the old Image and old DVDs - the think I would loose the only two monthes job from the point I left USA for Russia in September-October.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I repartitioned the Hard Drive but it did not make great. I placed all my Vista Home Premium back, Then I recreated all my user accounts, I took all updates from Internet, then I reinstall all my Toshiba drivers as like they recomend it and - I replaced
 the Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade back. I tried to reinstall Image restoration but it did not see the Image, so I did that mistake - I replaced the the old copy - as like I told you before with new Image, and after that my PC began to see the all external DVDs
 and Hard drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, after another time reinstallation of everything - I understood I lost all files, I tried to fix everything another time from scratch.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;That time I replaced partition, but I did not swipe the BIOS - I did not flash the system board buttery - I put new clean Windows Vista and then Windows 7.</p>
<p>I tried to run DVDs with backups but they did have probki.net files which I could not erase. I did another time reinstallations.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now I got fully reloaded eberything. I run the DVDs with old backups and I have the encrypted filed on my PCs Accounts but from first time I saw them they desappeared after I reinsalled the fingerprints encryption and injected token from admin account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;My PC has EFS from Windows 7 Ultimate, also, the Fingerprints Reader encrypted too, I have the .PFX keys and some of .CER certificates from the May. But when I tried to insert them in my secpol, they did not go. I found on Internet that I need to install
 them into "trusted root certificates". I did but I can not see the same time backup files on my PC. Than, I did the reccomended by Microsoft manipulation -</p>
<p>&nbsp;I came to MMC,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I added the snap-ins for computer users, I can see the three certificates with settings of the on on very earlier april time, the another one on the beginning of the May, another on the end of May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How can I change the settings for the Recovery Agent, for the EFS only certificate and for another .PFX&nbsp;certificate to be able see the encrypted files on my desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Even if I lose them, should I erase the first certificate from EFS in gpedit and replace with freshest one? I scare to do something because the next changes will not be&nbsp; operatable, but I lost all month for the reinstallations of the software - from end
 of October till the today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did not expected that somebody might make a look into my backups and erase the files or just make them unoperatable; the Iomega Ego might have itself drivers from USB 3.0 drivers but all the drivers I tried to reinstall did not work from that point.</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now, I have the last updated PC, the DVDs with old backups, the Image restoration on external Hard Drive of the same old time, but... the PC asked me the drivers if I look in the renamed folder of my Image, and there are not any drivers on that Image files
 or in the folders of the Wndows in my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I make a look in the partitional folders from DVDs backup I can not see the staff insidethe folders ias like as&nbsp;I saw it before few days ago. I suspect the keys got changed or certificate got operated from another side on my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, how to exchange the keys in my Recovery agent .PFX for the next .PFX - I scare to uninstall the key because I scare to loose my possibility to see the screen at all. What could You reccoment to do with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Feedback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xarcell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Feedback</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft has made so many changes, and over hyped so much stuff, that I just don't know what to believe anymore. &nbsp;I want to get some things clarified. Because so far, my experience have been per utter crap...</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I have purchased games, movies, and music on the Xbox 360. I cannot re-acquire some of &nbsp;those purchased games, or re-acquire any of the movies &amp; music I previously purchased. I called support, and the purchase history doesn't go back far enough(2010) to
 prove I purchased these products. Although, I do realize that the music I purchased cannot be re-downloaded after some time(which is why I canceled my music pass when I found out). Now I can't even re-download or access movies that I purchased.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>That being said, why in the hell would I purchase anything else from Xbox Live? Has anyone else have these problems? I feel that when I spend my hard earned money on something, I should be able to keep it, not have the purchase basically be a long term rental.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Yesterday, my daughter turned 6, so I bought her Disney Infinity. I created a Microsoft Account, and Xbox Live(silver) account for her. To put myself has her parent, so I could have parental restrictions for her, but to prove I was an adult, I had to pay
 50 cents to Microsoft. WHY? YOU ALREADY KNOW I"M AN ADULT! I already pay for my own gold account, purchase things regularly, you have my credit card on file, yet I had to be charged 50 cents to put her account under mine just to say I'm her parent?</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I used to have the Family Gold pack, but Microsoft canned that. Which really hurt us 360 owners. Xbox One owners get to have a home console for everyone to use gold services on, but us 360 owners got left in the dark. Not only do we NOT get a home console,
 but our paid Family Pack options were removed.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Lately, I've been wrestling over some security issues. When I visit my Microsoft account online, it keeps asking me for my password. WHY? Every two or three links I click I have to enter my password. It's annoying! Then there is the issue with Xbox Live
 Sign-in. It keep asking me to verify by adding more emails &amp; phone numbers. I already have 3 emails and 2 phone numbers listed on my account. WHY, does it continue to prompt me? It's annoying! I purchased a pre-paid phone just to add a number to it in hopes
 that it would stop asking. Today, it kept kicking me out saying there is a problem with my account. So I contacted support, and they say nothing is wrong. It's annoying!</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Then there is the Microsoft points issue. It was recently converted to currency. I have a little bit &nbsp;cash on my account that will probably never get used. Yet in 2015, I'll lose it. So my options are, add money to it and buy something, or Microsoft is just
 going to out-right take it without compensation. WTF? I feel like I'm being strong-armed here. Heck, I that is even border-line stealing. I wonder how much Microsoft is going to make in 2015 after taking everyone's left-over change in their account?</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I don't have a Xbox One yet and really wanted one, but I'm seriously considering not getting one and canceling my Xbox Live Membership.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Xbox Movies and Music:<br />
Frankly I'm surprised that any content licenses would simply expire when they're full purchases.&nbsp; Is the content still available in the marketplace?&nbsp; If it was removed, that's one thing, but if the content is still there, it seems that your account should still
 retain the license for it.&nbsp; Are you sure you're logged into the same account you used to purchase the movies?&nbsp; Might be worth another call to Xbox Customer Support.&nbsp; They should be able to look back to the beginning of your account.&nbsp; No purchase is hidden
 from them.<br />
<br />
Adult Verification:<br />
The adult verification thing is Microsoft's compliance with COPPA (Child Online Privacy Protection Act) which requires businesses to confirm an adult's consent to have their child's information collected. &nbsp; The most commonly used method of online age verification
 is a small fee to the credit card. &nbsp;This is not unique to Microsoft. &nbsp;Microsoft does not keep the money. &nbsp;Part of it pays the bank's transaction fee (because any transfer of money comes at cost), and the rest of the $.50 goes toward charity, namely the National
 Center For Missing &amp; Exploited Children.<br />
<br />
Family Pack:<br />
Once upon a time, there was no Family Pack.&nbsp; Everyone paid $59.99 a year for their own Gold (or they opted for Monthly $9.99 payments, or Quarterly $24.99, though I have no idea why).&nbsp; Then, a few years ago, Xbox introduced the Family Pack, which dropped the
 price significantly to get groups of people online.&nbsp; But this system was abused.&nbsp; Accounts that were broken into were converted into Family Packs, and dummy accounts were added to the Family Pack in order to add points to the child account, then disassociate
 it from the Family.&nbsp; These dummy accounts could move from Family Pack to Family Pack, collecting points before either the points were spent by the thieves themselves, or the account was sold to another party.&nbsp; So now we have no Family Pack on the 360.&nbsp; Hopefully,
 that will change someday.&nbsp; But for now, yes, we have to return to the old style of shelling out for each account.&nbsp; Either stick with annual because it's the cheapest, or use promotional sales to offset the cost.&nbsp; That's my recommendation there.<br />
<br />
Security:<br />
You need to make sure the security proofs on your account are fully verified.&nbsp; Unverified proofs aren't really proofs at all, and can't be used to get you back into your account if you get locked out.&nbsp; If there is an error on your account, however, I would
 expect an error code.&nbsp; If you have one, check that out with Xbox Customer Support.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Account Balance:<br />
The currency that is set to expire is also set to be used first before any other currency.&nbsp; If you have only a small amount of currency, and you're worried about not being able to spend it, don't sweat it.&nbsp; If you try to buy something with your credit card,
 it will offer to let you use the online currency first, and then cover the difference with your credit card.</p>

    <title>Audio device unplugged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aniket820  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio device unplugged</h2>
                    <p>I was in the middle of watching movie when suddenly my sound stopped to come showing no audio device found. I went to the device manager and not found any driver tab for sound there. I tried reinstalling the driver but it did not work. On deep searching,
 I figuered out that my audio device has been unplugged. It's drivers are shown in unplugged drivers zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the internet for this problem but did not get any solution for this. Any help regarding this will be appreciated.</p>

            Hey there, Aniket
Welcome to the Microsoft Community! I am Nathan, one of the Community Experts. 

This will be quite frustrating, I can imagine. So lets see if we can get this sorted for you. 

Please can you click onto your sound icon, on the task bar. Then select Playback devices. I am wanting to know if you can see a list of your disconnected speakers in there?

If so, you will be able to set it to default where it should work. 

Let us know how this works, 
Regards,

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be due to certain drivers on the device. To resolve your concern, the initial troubleshooting is to

            Hello IntenseJames 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />There are serveral ways to swith Windows 10 accounts on PC:
<br />
<br />If you just started your Windows 10 PC or device, the first thing you see is the sign-in screen. Also, if you are already signed in, you can press Windows + L on your keyboard to lock Windows 10 and then click or tap on the Lock Screen to display the sign-in screen. 
<br />
<br />By default, Windows 10 loads the most recent user account that was used to sign in. The list of available user accounts is shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
<br />
<br />In this list, click or tap the user account that you want to switch to and then enter the login details. Windows 10 requests the last thing that was used to sign in: the password, the PIN or the picture password.
<br />
<br />To get more info  and find more methods please visit the link below:

<p>GMail and Hotmail are email accounts. They aren't Windows accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sign in to your GMail account, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.google.com/mail</a> and enter your email address and password when prompted. To sign out, right-click on your photo (or avatar) in
 the top right corner of the page and then click on 'Sign out.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail was discontinued long ago, so I don't know how to sign in or out of it. The successor to Hotmail is Outlook.com. You can sign in to Outlook.com with your Hotmail email address and password. Just go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook.com</a>.
 All your old email from Hotmail will be moved over.</p>

<br />If you want to use your account on this computer, just add it from the WIndows 10 settings. After adding it, (via Settings, account, add account) you will see it when you restart your computer.

<p>Hi KimiDB,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. For better understand your description, can you help us to provide more information about “overlay a customizable message banner or intermittent sound”? you can send some screenshots about it if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want to change the notification about the Skype for Business, you can set your preferences for receiving notifications and alerts, in the Skype for Business main window, click the Options settings button. The Options button in Skype for
 Business , and then select Alerts. If you want to change the sounds for the Skype for Business, you can also go to “Ringtones and Sounds” in the Setting of Skype for Business.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

Any further help would be GREATLY appreciated!<br />

            Thank you so much for your response. I was able to run the two steps you suggested. In step 2, it indicated that it "found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them". It then gives instructions to view the details to find the corrupted file, but
 I can't get that to work. I type the command, and get an error window. I tried several times to be sure I wasn't typing the command incorrectly, but I'm just stuck. Guess I'll just have to muddle through until I can afford to take it in for repair!<br />
Thanks again for taking the time to respond!!<br />
