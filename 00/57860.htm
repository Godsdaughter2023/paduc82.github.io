<p>When you load any 360 game up after its loaded hit the start and select buttons (small round buttons on controller next to big xbox button) at same time this will bring up the 360 dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that loads up there should be a choice of download profile click on that it will ask for email and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this will download profile with your new gamertag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not work and if this is your first 360 backwards compatible game make sure that your password is not longer then 16 characters the 360 including the emulator on the ONE does not like passwords longer then 16 characters.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only thing that doesn't work properly is the popup window that indicates it's printing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I upgrade from Win 7 everything does in fact work perfectly... But the printer needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled in a non-standard manner for it to work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Devices and Printers, REMOVE the Printer and Fax (1st) if you have one... Then unhook the printer from the computer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel... Administrative Tools... Services... right click on the Print Spooler, and select STOP...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the Lexmark software and reboot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again... STOP the Print Spooler...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall the Lexmark software with the SETUP file set for XP SP3 Compatibility Mode...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hook the printer up when instructed by the installation, and hopefully you will be good to go.</p>

                    When I try to play a game on Facebook since upgrading to&nbsp;Windows 10 on my HP Stream my mouse pointer disappears. This also happens when I try to use Fresh Paint. I do not know how to fix the problem and have yet to see what other applications this affects.
 How do I fix it? Is there a setting to make it to where it does not disappear?

<h2>            Cannot wake laptop from sleep with keyboard or trackpad. Using Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    I cannot wake my Dell XPS 13 9370 from sleep using the keyboard or track pad. I end up having to hit the power button to restart so that the laptop can wake up. (I've set my power button up to shut down whenever I click it) I've recently converted to Windows
 again after being a Mac user for about 10 years. Would appreciate any help with this. I tried looking through the control panel settings but did not see anything that specifically would allow for the laptop to be woken up using the keyboard.&nbsp;

            Seasons is the only blue deck that I'm seeing. It's possible that your computer manufacturer had the cards customized then when you changed the appearance, the changes were lost.

<h2>            I deleted my screenshots folder Windows 8</h2>
                    In Windows 8, my screenshots folder got deleted, maybe when I restored my files through Mozy, went from Vista to Windows 8, and it asked if I wanted to use my old folders and I said yes. Tried to just add the screenshots folder manually but that does not
 seem to work. So after researching, I need to change my registry, yes I backed it up. So I am supposed to go to&nbsp;

            <p>That's very odd it worked for me. I deleted the folder, made a new one, and my screenshots still go there when I press Windows+PrintScreen.&nbsp; Note that the Alt-PrintScreen or simply printScreen will not generate files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it's still not working, I'd suggest using System Restore to go back to before the problem began. It only takes 2 minutes, it won't touch any of your files, and you can undo it if you don't like the results.&nbsp; It truly is the safest, easiest, fastest option.&nbsp;
 Just press Windows+R to show the Run box, and run <strong>rstrui</strong> to get started.</p>

            Ok, one of the things I noticed, when I press the windows key and the print screen together, my screen does not dim, like the instructions I see say it is supposed to do. I have a Samsung Laptop. I never used the printscreen on this computer, the one day
 I wanted to use it, I googled how to do it for windows 8 and that is when I realized I did not have that folder, &nbsp;I thought maybe it accidentally got deleted when I used my Mozy restore, again, just guessing how it got deleted.&nbsp;Anyways, I added the folder
 manually, but the screenshot didn't show up in the folder I created.&nbsp;

<h2>            What size and aspect ratio do I save my movie in&#63;</h2>
                    My movie is finished and I am ready to save it again.&nbsp; However, the first time I saved the movie (720x480 widescreen)&nbsp;and viewed it on my 42" HD widescreen, some of the images were cut off on the top and bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which format would I use to eliminate
 this?&nbsp; What I see is HD 1080p - 1920x1080 widescreen; HD 720p, 1280x720 widescreen; widescreen 480p 720x480p widescreen and standard definition 640x480p.&nbsp; Guess I don't understand what they all mean and I appreciate your time.&nbsp; Thank you.

            There are two ways you might be able to install the game:<br />
<br />
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers: </span></p>
<p><span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p><span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p><span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

            You will need a print driver that uses the same name as the 32bit print driver.<br />
<br />
What is the 32bit print driver name?<br />
<br />
what is the 64 bit print driver name?

<h2>            WLM 2012 just useless with outlook.com and imap</h2>
                    <p>Since Microsoft have started to upgrade accounts for those using Windows Live Mail, I have been migrating my customers to use imap. &nbsp;However, this is proving incredibly frustrating. &nbsp;Many customers are experiencing frequent timeouts and disconnects. &nbsp;They
 have duplicate special folders and sometimes when an email is sent, the sent email is duplicated in the Sent folder. &nbsp;Today I have set a customer up and their delete folder doesn't work. &nbsp;When an email is deleted, it simply dissapears, it isn't placed in the
 deleted items folder?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is incredibly frustrating, since it appears entirely random. &nbsp;I have set people up in the exact same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had to spend a large amount of time finding "corrupt" emails. &nbsp;Some customers have over 30,000 emails in the account going back to 2004. &nbsp;Not only does resynchronising this take a lot of time, no matter how fast your broadband (100Mbps here),
 but some of the earlier emails caused errors during download, so I have had to use the webmail to locate the email and either delete or move to another folder which I dont sync with WLM to continue the email sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know what the correct special folders should be? &nbsp;As mentioned above, I sometimes get duplicate folders, or one called Sent, and one called Sent Items. &nbsp;Sent Items might be the special folder name, but sent emails actually go to the sent folder,
 and not Sent Items.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be. That's why I wrote an article giving detailed steps for the move from using DeltaSync to using IMAP soon after the migration of Outlook.com accounts started last year. You might find it helpful:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/wiki/livemail-email/windows-live-mail-and-outlook-mail/6edb5ba6-f9f2-40fd-80a1-fc23cc6fbfe0">
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Live Mail and Outlook Mail</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As regards synchronizing accounts with large numbers of messages, I think there's some throttling in place to ease the pressure on the servers as so many users try to migrate at the same time. If the sync appears to stall - no progress for some time, for
 example - then I found it best to stop the sync and close down the program to allow the index to catch up, at least a bit. I then re-launched half-an-hour later in the hope that the data quantity limit had been reset at the server so the sync could resume
 at full steam again. For an account with around 100,000 messages in lots of folders, it took five or six sessions to get it up-to-date in the client.</p>

            <p>Thanks for you reply. I am sure this is how I have it set up, but I have more customers compaining about their LiveMail and hotmail / outlook.com accounts so will be sure to double check against your settings.</p>

            <p>I forgot to mention: if the special folders aren't mapped properly when first setting up the IMAP account, the existing native folders in Windows Live Mail may be replicated at the server and possibly
<em>vice versa, </em>causing confusion at both ends. After IMAP folder mapping is in place,&nbsp;any extra folders for sent, junk and deleted messages should be emptied at&nbsp;<a href="http://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mail.live.com</a>&nbsp;(e.g. by moving their contents to the proper
 native folder) and then deleted. Once they're gone, the folder list should again be reset in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For users with no POP3 accounts, there is no need to <em>Save a copy of sent messages in the 'Sent Items' folder</em> at
<em>Options &gt; Send</em>; messages are in fact dispatched by SMTP from the server and saved in the
<em>Sent</em> folder there, so they'll be downloaded at the next sync. Otherwise, you'll end up with two copies of each sent message.</p>

            <p><span>Ok, so today I checked the special folders on one client, and changed them to match your settings. &nbsp;Changing "Sent Items" to "Sent" had no effect on the folder name in Live
 Mail, it remained "Sent". &nbsp;However, it did cause all sent email from that point in to be duplicated. &nbsp;I noticed that when the special folder is set to "Sent", WLM then performs a move email to sent folder action on the tasks tab of send and receive.&nbsp; This
 is where the duplication appears to happen as I assume outlook.com automatically puts the sent email in to the sent folder server side, and this then replicates back to WLM.&nbsp; For now, I have set this special folder back to âSentâ for this customer as it appears
 to work well this way.&nbsp; This could however all be a side effect of not setting the special folders first.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the other complaint of the imap implementation, there was one email today that WLM refused to download via imap.&nbsp; My customer asked their friend to try resending the email
 and WLM again refused to download it.&nbsp; The header was downloaded, but the contents were not.&nbsp; Every time a send and receive was performed, it always resulted in a server connection terminated error.&nbsp; When looking on outlook.com, the email was perfectly viewable
 but it did contain an 18MB attachment.&nbsp; Two files, one 8MB and the other 10MB, so I assume there is a limit placed on attachments from the server via imap?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A similar issue occurred to the customer in the original post, where some email from pre 2010 refused to download and similar server disconnect errors were received.&nbsp; We
 had to bulk move all these emails to another folder and set it not to sync with WLM to get round this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I might test your solution with my own Hotmail account, although this does currently work via the ActiveSync patch MS have since pulled, so I am not sure I want to risk breaking
 that.&nbsp; I guess I could try the patch on customers PCâs and if it works, then great â although I wouldnât want to leave this as an official fix as MS have now dropped support so who knows how long the patch could continue to work?</span></p>

<p>An 18MB attachment could well after encoding create a mail message over 25MB, the limit for Outlook.com accounts using POP3, IMAP or SMTP.</p>

<p>I don't see why the patch shouldn't continue to work. It was withdrawn because of all the other problems it caused, e.g. for Windows 10 users who found that it crashed the application. I would hang on to it for as long as it works.</p>

<p>Assuming that you have the second edition of the patch, which updates Windows Live Mail to build 16.4.3564.1216, there's no harm in trying. If it&nbsp;works for email, well and good. I don't think we'll ever see calendar sync again in Windows Live Mail, but contacts
 seem to work pretty much as before.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Ok, the patch does seem to do the job, as I can use the hotmail / outlook connection method for her email and it appears to work well apart from the sent items issue where
 it shows the from rather than the recipient field. &nbsp;I have noticed under the connection details, the server still mentions deltasync so not entirely convinced it is working properly, however, it didnât work before the patch as her outlook account had been
 migrated â¦</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have now uninstalled and reinstalled WLM to remove the patch and reverted back to trying the imap method and it must be set up with âSentâ as the special folder and not
 âSent Itemsâ otherwise all sent email is duplicated.&nbsp; Annoyingly, even after installing, the Sent folder still shows the âFromâ field and not the ârecipientâ field, so this bug appears to have carried through.</span></p>
<p><span>I have now gone to start the synchronisation process and literally 20 seconds in to it I get the error</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;âUnable to send or receive messages for the Outlook (accountname) account. Header download for the 'Archive' folder did not complete. Your server has unexpectedly terminated
 the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity.</span></p>
<p><span>Server Response: Your IMAP command could not be sent to the server, due to non-network errors. This could, for example, indicate a lack of memory on your system.</span></p>

<p><span>Port: 993</span></p>
<p><span>Secure(SSL): Yesâ</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is absolutely infuriating, and it happens under Thunderbird and emclient.&nbsp; emclient supposedly supports EAS but I cannot get it to connect to a outlook account via EAS,
 it will only do imap and their air sync for calendar and contacts.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the imap service is so poor and unreliable, I cannot recommend it as an alternative to my customers as it is costing me a lot of time to support it and therefore
 will have to recommend gmail.&nbsp; Although I dislike the gmail web interface and they make it awkward to use âinsecure mail clientsâ I havenât had any issues with customers who have a gmail account and we have set up imap for them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am going to contact emclient regarding their EAS and outlook.com support and I there is no joy, then I will have to tell my customers that they will need to use the outlook.com
 website (or purchase MS Outlook which they will never agree to).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thanks for your help, but I am going to give up now!</span></p>

</p>
<p>I'm doing a clean install on all new hardware of my Windows XP Home.&nbsp; I've now tried to install several times, and even tried removing all hardware and that doesn't work.&nbsp; Still crashes halfway through the driver setup.&nbsp; IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

I then used nLite to create a Windows XP SP3 setup disc to see if I could at least get past that point and it worked great all the way up to the product key entry.&nbsp; Of course the product key comes up as invalid there.&nbsp; I've tried leaving the product key blank
 but it says it's invalid and won't let the install continue.<br />
<br />
And so how do I use the correct genuine disc and stop the system from crashing, or how do I use the SP3 slipstreamed disc and put in a code that allows me to use my software?

            Most common cause of STOP errors during XP setup on modern hardware is that XP doesn't have any drivers for SATA disk controllers. &nbsp;You can either find a floppy disk (yes you heard right) and find the relevant drivers or go into the system BIOS and change
 the SATA mode to "legacy" or "IDE" or whatever the vendor calls it.

<h2>             Windows 7 hangs then crash after waking from manual and timed sleep.</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Somebody throw me a bone - unresolved Windows 7 hang then crash after waking from manual and timed sleep.</p>
<p>Hello folks,<br />
<br />
I am writing you in desperation, as I feel like I have exhausted all possible solutions to this problem and yet it persists. I built a desktop with Windows 7 Pro 64-bit on it not too long ago with a friend of mine and started noticing that my computer would
 hang and then crash after resuming from sleep. Since then, here is everything I have done: I have reinstalled and updated all my drivers, I have flashed my BIOS and its components to the latest versions, I have gone in safe mode and eliminated all third party
 programs to see if it was something I installed, I have gone into my power settings and messed around with just about every option including shutting off hybrid sleep and not letting the hard drive shut off, I have installed the windows hotfix suggested by
 others (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977178/#top), and I have even performed a clean install of Windows - all of which has proven unsuccessful in eliminating the problem. I have even repeated all of these steps with a Microsoft support representative over
 chat - after which they told me that the case was unsolved and that I needed perform a clean install to fix it - they never got back to me when I told them it didn't work...<br />
<br />
However, a few things during this process have led me to some conclusions. I've noticed that as soon as I wake up the computer I can know almost immediately whether or not it will crash by looking at the hard drive indicator light on my computer. If the indicator
 light stays on and doesn't flicker, the computer hangs and then crashes. Now I don't even bother to wait for it to crash since it hangs forever, I just force a shutdown or restart. This pattern, along with the type of hotfix I used (its description) and messing
 with the hybrid and hard drive power settings - which has led the computer to sometimes successfully wake from sleep every now and then (more often manually than from timed sleep) - makes me think that it is almost certainly some sort of issue with the hard
 disk, not functionally as the check disk was fine, but communication wise or something like that.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm pretty pessimistic about Windows' ability to help me with this issue, as they kind of just left me hanging after I tried to get help, but I'm hoping that maybe somebody on here will have some sort of desire to help out a lifetime Windows
 user who is running out of reasons to continue to support the platform when very obvious, silly, and just downright annoying problems like this continue to persist. I can't think of what's worse, having a much more serious issue with my computer, or knowing
 that such a small issue could be so grossly overlooked in engineering. <br />
<br />
Throw whatever you got at me<br />

PS: I also forgot to mention that my hard drive is 1 TB. There seemed to be some explanation of some sort of issue with really large hard drives at least 1 TB or greater in the hotfix description. Don't know if that's relevant, but there's definitely something
 going on with the hard drive - I can see my login screen and enter my password, but it will either not go anywhere or get me to the desktop where nothing works except my mouse and highlighting when I move the cursor over stuff.</p>

Didn't work. Crashed every time and when I went back to device manager the boxes were all checked again. Tried to uncheck them all and sleep but every time it would hang and then I had to force a restart. Even when I went into power options and disabled the
 USB selective suspend - which seemed to keep all the boxes unchecked - the computer would still hang after waking from sleep.<br />

<p>I am having the exact same problem with an HP Pavilion A6600F desktop running Windows 7 (upgrade from Vista) and have tried all of the suggestions including running on the ADMIN account. I also noticed that the HD activity indicator would stay on when the
 system hang occurred. HP has no information on their site but since so many people are having the exact same problem, I am leaning toward a serious problem with Windows 7, perhaps an unreported incompatibility with a driver that Microsoft has said was compatible.<br />
It could also be a problem between Windows and the BIOS since many vendors use basically the same BIOS with different branding. I have disabled sleep and am currently experimenting with hibernation to keep from pulling the rest of my hair out.<br />
Wake up Microsoft! It looks like this problem is keeping a LOT of longtime Windows supporters awake nights.</p>

            This may sound stupid, but I have been having problems with the bios on my vid card. I noticed that while the Windows Standard Generic video drivers were installed my computer had no problem Sleeping or Waking, or shutting down for that matter. My PC crashes
 when I try to shut down also. Try changing your graphics driver to Windows Generic and see if the problem persists (I know this is no fix whatsoever, just looking for causes :-/). I also have a 1TB HD so I am looking for all causes of the crashes and inability
 to Sleep/Recover.

<p>Sorry, I clicked on the wrong selection, and marked Hast's comments as an answer, which it is not -- I meant to do a reply to ahhoss.</p>
<p>I have been working with MS support on similar problems to ahhoss and TParkhurst.</p>
<p>My system is an HP Pavilion a6600f, with the original Vista Home Premium x64 OS and 3 GB memory.&nbsp; I decided to upgrade to Win 7 Professional, which forced a new install, and kept my old Vista files in a separate directory.&nbsp; I found that when the system went
 to sleep, I had similar problems in recovering, namely:</p>
<p>1) BSOD problems on recovering from sleep (error 0x80070002),&nbsp; 2) loss of recognition of an External 1 TB hard drive using USB connection, both on recovery and at random times and 3) the DVD drive would disappear randomly, generally when the USB HDrive disappeared
 (I had to reboot to restore it).</p>
<p>Part of the problems (BSOD and DVD drive disappearing was due to an nVidia chipset-Win7 driver incompatability) were resolved by applying the HP Napa-GL82 Motherboard BIOS patch (sp44647.exe).</p>
<p>The external hard drive would still disappear randomly and/or when the system went to sleep.&nbsp; In addition, I found that win7 backup still did not work properly and failed with an error 0x80070002.&nbsp; That problem has been partially resolved, but is still in
 work with MS support.&nbsp; I am currently running with the power options set to never sleep for the display and the computer, which seems to help with being able to get some backups to work with only a missing path/folder error at the end of the backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are successful with finding a good solution to the problem, I will report back to this forum thread, or report it as a new item.</p>

<p>Thanks Andrea,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That didn't work this time because I couldn't download I-net Exp 6! So I decided to go with Deluxe Sunset which gave me an error that it required an elevation! (?) So, just for the hell of it, I tried Deluxe Sunset Home &amp; Business - or whatever - and that
 worked! And you know what? It looks &amp; works EXACTLY like My Money! You just can't import My Money files. So, I'm just gonna start a new "account". But first I'm gonna take a nap. Thanks again &amp; Happy New Year!</p>

    <title>Windows support chat sucks badly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows support chat sucks badly</h2>
                    <p>Today has been an overwhelmingly bad day for microsoft and myself.&nbsp; I have historically had little to complain about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, out of the blue, Microsoft made me change my password (said my outlook settings had some problem, although I literally have never used Outlook) and I am now having to make highly complicated passwords since you can't reuse the passwords- that was
 my original complaint why the heck wont they let me reuse a password, it's my **** password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Major issues-</p>
<p>-No reusing passwords</p>
<p>-Microsoft support page has so many redirects when opening in chrome that it causes an error and can't show the page (I deleted some cookies as that was a suggestion to make this work, but it did not help and I wasn't going to wipe all the cookies off my
 computer)</p>
<p>-Microsoft support chat had multiple failures when trying to change to a person from the virtual assistant</p>
<p>-Microsoft support chat could not enter me into a phone call back queue</p>
<p>-Basically the virtual assistant for support chat is completely useless and malfunctions during normal use.</p>

<p>That's just a rule they have. You can't reuse an old password (for Security reasons).</p>

<h2>            MAIL app Windows 10 in wrong Language</h2>
                    <p>I checked the forums already and the so-called solution posted is no good. I go to my Region/language settings, but there is no "advanced" button, and therefore I cannot override anything. The&nbsp; MAIL app keeps coming up in Thai language, even though I set
 my display language as Australian English, and restarted the computer. What can I do about this? I want to keep Thai as one of my alternative keyboard inputs, since I use it sometimes, but it shouldn't be overriding the main display language, which as I said
 is Australian English. </p>

            Hey there Jezza, could you try this one more time? Ill add where to find advanced settings.
<br />Go to Control Panel\Clock, Language and Region\Language
<br />Ensure that English is at the top of the list of languages
<br />Go to Advanced settings (use your search bar on the bottom left to look for advanced settings)
<br />Select English in the "Override for Windows display language"
<br />Hit Save and then restart computer

<h2>            Glance Screen Clock Lumia 950XL</h2>
                    <p>I had my glance screen set up to show the clock permanently on with Night mode set to Blue from 10pm - 7am.&nbsp; After rebooting the device I now have NO clock showing in the Glance Screen mode at all and no mater what settings I play with I cant&nbsp;get it to show
 and have a black slab instead of something useful......yet another crappy bug that is adding to the already pretty long list.</p>

</p><p>I am using a brand new out of the box Lumia 950XL which has the shipped build on it.&nbsp; I have posts in other forums around the Windows 10 Mobile (10.0.10586.29) Update Lumia 950 XL Downloading error and also one around severe lag issues when trying to type
 in this forum, and others, &nbsp;from my Lumia in the Edge browser.....there are numerous other issues and things not right which others have highlighted, eg: no&nbsp;email alert&nbsp;etc etc so I am hoping there will be fixes for these soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device has still&nbsp;not picked up the .29 update, I had to hard reset my device twice and Microsoft removed it from the update servers finally agreeing there was a serious issue with a large number of users, so at present my device is running 10.0.13053.0&nbsp;OS
 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since discovered the issue with my Glance Screen Clock and I will hold my hands up and apologise but give a warning to other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To protect my screen I purchased a FiimiTempered Glass Screen Protector For Microsoft Lumia 950XL, 9 H Hardness, 0.3mm Thickness,Made From Real Glass (Lumia 950XL) from Amazon and fitted this......but it appears
 it must interfere with the sensor and blacks out the screen....removing this completely and my device started functioning as previously expected.&nbsp; Not sure how I can pass this information on or what screen protectors Microsoft recommend for this device, but
 on my experiences this one does NOT do the job properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Again apologies for the false alarm but this was right out of left field and people should be made aware.</span></p>

    <title>System Restore and Automatic Repair Won&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loprojoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Restore and Automatic Repair Won&#39;t Work</h2>
                    Hello I have two Windows 8 machines in my home; my gaming desktop and my wife's laptop. We have both been using Windows 8 since the preview days and upgraded to Pro as soon as the retail release was available. We were both impressed with the OS right from
 the start, and completely happy...when it worked. I will start with my problems with the OS, then get into my wife's problems with the OS (her problems are what prompted this post).&nbsp;
<div>I had a windows vista machine that was upgraded to Windows 7 (not clean install), and then I installed the Windows 8 preview followed by purchasing the retail release. After purchasing the Windows 8 Pro upgrade I had several occasions where system errors
 kept my machine from booting properly. System restore NEVER worked, no matter which of the 10 restore points I chose. Restore points were all after the retail upgrade. It got stuck in Automatic Repair loops that ALWAYS failed. And it was always because of
 an 'unknown error'. I was forced to do a refresh of the PC no less than 3 times in a few months. Sorry I do not recall any of the error codes.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I decided to sell the machine and buy a gaming rig from CyberpowerPC that came pre-loaded with Windows 8 Pro. Worked great for a while, but then I had the same Automatic Repair loop that always failed to fix anything. Guess what....System Restore failed
 too. Forced to refresh the PC again. Because it was under warranty, and to rule out hardware problems, I requested a new hard drive. I already had to refresh so I wasn't worried about starting completely over. Been a few months and no problems yet.</div>
<div>My wife has a Windows 7 laptop, and purchased the Windows 8 Pro upgrade (not clean install). On October 10th she started a Windows Update and left the room for about an hour while it was installing. When she came back her screen was flashing on and off...but
 not displaying anything. After 30 minutes of watching it flash on and off, she did a hard reset. It booted to the flashing screen after a brief flash of the windows 8 logo. After a few hard resets with the same result she let me know about the problem.</div>
<div>I attempted to do a System restore from disc. Failed. Gave me 'unknown error 0x81000204' It directed me to run 'chkdsk /r' on D: So I ran it...it took like 5-6 hours. It did find some errors and correct them. So I tried to run System Restore again with
 the same restore point as first failed attempt.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Failed. Same error. Ran chkdsk /r again. Yet another several hours. Found no errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ran system restore with same restore point.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Failed. Same error.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Ran System restore from another Restore point.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Failed. Same error.&nbsp;</div>
<div>an System restore from a third Restore point. Failed. Same error.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Ran System restore from the last of 4 available restore points.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Failed, but this time a different error 'unknown error 0x80070571'&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;At this point I ran the Dell Boot diagnostic that checks all of the hardware components. I ran a thorough Hard Drive analysis that took about 3 hours to complete....said it passed with no errors on the log. So after wasting 15 hours trying to NOT refresh
 the pc, I am at a loss. Time to do a damned Refresh...the very thing I wanted to avoid having to do.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I guess the point of this post is simply this:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;If Refresh/Reset is the only damn thing that works in Windows 8, why are Automatic Repair and System Restore even part of the OS? I am about ready to switch to Mac because I am tired of having to start over with Refresh/Reset. I never had to do this with
 any previous Windows versions (back to 95), and on later versions System Restore actually worked.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Also: I am a bit perplexed at the lack of information Windows 8 gives the user when an error occurs. The OS obviously knows enough to generate an error code. But how is it that some error codes seem to be unknown even to Microsoft? Why does Windows tell
 me to run ChkDsk? In my case, I ran it once to correct problems. But the system didn't seem to know I had already run it...and continued to tell me to run it again and again. Just seems like there should be a better way for an OS to troubleshoot itself. Like
 keep logs that the OS can interpret to try and fix itself, rather than just create a log file that you need an IT wizard to decipher. Or maybe offer another method to fix a problem if it sees something like ChkDsk was already performed without success.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you able to boot the computer to safe mode? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the issue&nbsp;is occured due to Windows updates, it could be one of the driver installation or any software conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we do not have any major steps to try, let's try to perform Refresh on the computer and get it working. Once after performing Refresh, let's not install any updates for a while and check if it re-occurs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to create some manual restore points to verify if system restore feature works fine or not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<p>I was not able to boot in safe mode. I have already done a refresh. Unfortunately I did not see this response until her laptop started an update automatically. It is in the middle of the update as I type this.</p>
<p>We created restore points prior to the update that I will attempt to restore from after the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate you acknowledging the bottom part of my original post about why the only thing that ever works in Windows 8 is Refresh/Reset. I should not have to keep starting over from scratch.</p>

<p>I want to take my personal files backup before doing any refresh/reset the machine.</p>
<p>My system is Dell All-in-one desktop.</p>

</p>
<p>Appreciate any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Rajesh</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Refresh should leave your files intact. Reset will&nbsp;erase&nbsp;files. I was never able to get it into&nbsp;Safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only solution, after many hours of trying other options, was to do a Refresh. I only made this post because I was angry about Refresh/Reset being the only option. Restore points and automatic repair never do anything at all.</p>
<p>If your computer won't boot properly into Windows, and you are concerned about losing files, you could remove the hard drive and put it into another computer to back things up. If it does boot properly, simply start copying things you don't want to lose
 to a usb thumb drive or external hard drive before doing the refresh. Again, refresh will leave personal files intact, but you would lose any non-windows apps and programs.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are stuck in a repair loop, and cannot boot the system at all, you will be forced to re-install Windows 8 from a boot disc. If you don't have a windows disc, you can make one from Microsoft's website for free, as long as you have your windows key.</p>
<p>When you put the disc in, do not try to use the repair option. This almost never works. You will simply have to choose the Install option. You will be back to Windows 8.0, but then you can upgrade to 8.1 from the windows store...they do a good job of bugging
 you about it until you upgrade to 8.1 lol.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp; a lot quick response. In fact I did same what you suggested.</p>
<p>Yes, I thought of remove hard drive and copy files first. But one of my friend suggested me to try boot with Windows XP bootable CD. But was also not working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did tried by installing&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp; back. That worked. I was in and copied all files. Somehow few folders got deleted(not sure why, but not that important).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You are right, they will bug me&nbsp;to install 8.1.. will do </p>
