<h2>            Transfer digital license purchased in Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <div>Hello everyone,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've a Desktop (PC1) pre-installed with Win8, so it should be an OEM license which I later upgrade to Win10 Home edition. Last year I purchased Win10 Pro upgrade from Microsoft Store to upgrade PC1 to Pro edition so I can access remotely by RDP.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As my project is getting more complex I'm thinking to build another Desktop (PC2) and install Win10 with retail Win8 product key which I purchased years ago. Is it possible to restore PC1 to Home edition and use digital license to upgrade PC2 to Pro edition?</div>
                </div>

            Your old OEM upgraded to Windows 10 Pro is still an OEM license only. OEM license can not be transferred. Only retail license can be transferred. You will have to buy a new license only.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quickly response, so what you mean is once upgraded, the digital license is bond to that OEM licence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I purchase another Pro upgrade for Win10 Home edition wich is activated by retail Win8 product key, in a later time when I reinstall Win10 with that product key, will it automatic upgrade to Pro edition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            You must have purchased $99 Pro upgrade. This doesn't change the nature of the undelying license. If your license was OEM, it remains OEM. If it was Retail, it remains Retail.
<br />
<br />If I then purchase another upgrade for my retail Win8 after installation, next time I reinstall Win10 with that product key will it automatic upgrade to Pro edition?
<br />Ans - Yes as this a Retail license. You will need to install Pro directly. No need to install Win 8 first if you are transferring.

            Hi Oz
<br />
<br />It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass.

    <title>Question About buying a Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imomotaro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question About buying a Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>So i had a xbox&nbsp; long before, but ended up giving it to my step father, since he played it very often. The thing is with my birthday coming up i was thinking about getting a xbox since i miss playing on it. The thing is i downloaded a number of things, DLC,
 arcade games, etc. i was wondering if/when i get my new xbox will i be able to re-download all my things that i bought in the past?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend and he said i "NEED" this transfer cable thing. do i honestly need that? if so how much is it? I personally dont care about game saves. i just want the games i bought downloaded before like Marvel Vs Capcom 2, and south park tower
 defense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><em>As long as you are using the same account you used to initially purchase the DLC yes you can download it to your new console.<br />
<br />
Firstly recover your account to the new 360, then just go to account management and select 'download history', it will all be listed there and you can re download it for free.<br />
If you are using a new console you will need to transfer the DLC licences to it, or you will not be able to play the DLC offline.</em></p>

<p>The transfer cable is only needed for transferring data from one hard drive to another. So if you were transferring your game saves from your old xbox hard drive, then you would need a transfer cable or flash drive. Otherwise, you can just follow GreyPilgrim's
 advice and you'll be all set.</p>

<p>The transfer cable is for transferring game saves mainly. Once you recover your gamertag, you can redownload all the DLC so you don't need the cable for that.</p>
<p>You can use your old hard drive if you buy an Xbox that is the same as your old one. If you're buying a new Slim and the hard drive is from the older models, then the hard drive is not compatible.</p>

<h2>            File Explorer Shows On Task Bar But It Can Never Been Seen</h2>
                    I noticed shortly after I updated to Windows 8.1 that no matter what I do, I can't view the File Explorer. &nbsp;It appears on the task bar, but I can never bring it up to see it. &nbsp;I can't alt-tab to it. &nbsp;I can't click on it. &nbsp;I can't bring it up from the desktop
 or the Start screen. &nbsp;I can't press Windows-E. &nbsp;Nothing works. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;I'm stunned that I can't see something so basic. &nbsp;I had installed FileLocator Pro after the Windows 8.1 upgrade but I uninstalled that. &nbsp;iTunes updated but it's hard to believe that
 would prevent the File Explorer from working. &nbsp;This is amazingly frustrating. &nbsp;I've even tried old tricks like alt-space-m to move the window but that didn't work either. &nbsp;

            <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing works. </blockquote>
<p>You have a Taskbar, so explorer.exe must be running.&nbsp; Find out what else it can do.&nbsp; E.g. Start Menu?&nbsp; Run... dialog?&nbsp; Press Win-R if you can't open it using a mouse.&nbsp; In any case, try opening an Explorer window via&nbsp; shell:Desktop&nbsp; (for example).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may also be able to do it from an elevated cmd window with that as an argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;a directory where you find it so there is no&nbsp;question about your Path&nbsp;environment variable.&nbsp; In particular note that when you open an elevated cmd window it will probably
 be positioned to&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\&nbsp; where there is no explorer.exe.</p>

<p>To check you could enter a command pipeline&nbsp;(either from root as shown or from %windir%):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\&gt;dir explorer.exe /s/b | find /v /i "winsxs"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Otherwise, given the expected directory you would be in from being in an elevated cmd window you might just enter:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd ..</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>explorer.exe&nbsp; shell:Desktop</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(to execute the one in&nbsp; C:\Windows\)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The idea of using an elevated cmd window is both to maximize your chances of finding a workaround and maximize the possibility of getting a usable diagnostic.&nbsp; If you don't get sufficient clues from messages in the cmd window try looking in the Event log;
 even better run ProcMon to find out what is going on and what is failing.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks for starting your own thread.&nbsp; Clearly your symptoms are significantly different from the other poster's in the other thread.</p>

<h2>            Store isn&#39;t available for Myanmar.</h2>
                    I can't believe that Windows Store isn't accessible even I switched to Microsoft account ! I choose home location as Myanmar in Region Settings. I can't update Build in Metro Apps like Weather, News , Music and more. Why I can't access Windows Store? Without
 store, I can't use Metro Apps. When I open these apps, the update pop up message coming out which makes me dump and I can't do anything. Please any recommendations?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2eb68c91-b0bd-42d4-ba5e-20427930ff1f" />

            Thanks for reply, I checked these settings ! I change the time zone to (UTC+6:30 Yangon (Rangoon)).<br />
I set home location to Myanmar. I think that settings are correct. And I reset Windows Store cache and check that you said. Unfortunately, the store isn't still available. Why? I scan the windows with "sfc /scannow" for system file errors. But it doesn't help.
 Is that OS error or not? The Store App is killing me. :( Any further advices? I really need Windows Store !!!!<br />

            Nothing happened buddy, I run that troubleshooter and fix some problems and then restart the computer. But the store is still freeze. Thanks for answers ! I hope Windows Store may be accessible in upcoming Windows 8.1 ! It will be released on October 18.
 I'll try Windows 8.1 to solve that issue. And the update 8.1 is free for Windows 8 users. Am I right?<br />

                    <p><span>In Windows Live Mail, in my contacts, I somehow have 283 contacts just named 'Q', all of whom are identical and contain no other information other than the name 'Q'.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I try to delete them, the option to delete is grayed out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On further investigation, they appear under the "social networks" category, which is presumably why&nbsp;</span><span>they are greyed out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However I have no idea which social networks I am actually linked to or how they came to be originally created. &nbsp;I checked Skype and Facebook and neither of them contain any contacts just named 'Q', however I can't even see any indication
 of which social networks are linked to my contacts, so it's hard for me to know where to check</span></p>

            <p>Hi David,<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your concern, you can only delete the contacts that are saved on your Personal Address Book. The contacts which are linked through the other accounts can not be deleted.<br />
<br />
To assist you better, provide the answers to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the Windows Live Mail version you're using? Is it up-to-date?<br />
</li><li>What Windows operating system are you in?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried deleting the contacts through the Outlook.com?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for this - especially the level of detail in your reply, which was really helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the first solution (signing out, waiting a few hours, signing in) and - as you expected, no change unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the second solution - and unfortunately then there was no change either. &nbsp;It recreated the directory afresh, but it just brought back all the old contacts exactly as they were - even with all the 'Q' contacts in a separate group called 'delete'
 which I had put them in previously. &nbsp;Did I perhaps not wait enough time before re-signing in?</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender quick scan is taking waaay too long</h2>
                    At about 7:50 pm, I got a notification on my brand-new Lenovo laptop that windows defender needed to scan my computer really quick. I thought, Okay, and I let it do its thing while I worked on homework. It is now a little over an hour later and is only
 halfway through the scan. I have to go to bed but I don't wanna lose any progress on the scan that I've made. What do I do?

            It sounds to me as though it's doing a Full scan and not a quick scan. A quick scan should take about 10 minutes.

                    I have given up on waiting for Microsoft to make my Outlook as part of Office 365 to work. How can I remove Windows 10 and go back to Windows 8.1. Windows 8 was pre-installed when I brought the laptop so I do not have discs. Gerard King.

            I ran the diagnostics but couldn't figure out how to make a link for you to access. I went to the Microsoft Store and they didn't know what was wrong with it (they didn't run the diagnostics). Then I went home and uninstalled and reinstalled Skype and
 that worked to bring my camera icon back (although the format is now different). Thanks for your help--I learned something in the process.

<h2>            Bad System Config Info</h2>
                    <p>&lt;<em>Moved from Windows 7 Repair &amp; Recovery to Windows 8.1 Repair &amp; Recovery</em>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Purchased a Dell Optiplex 745 for my son (just to keep him off my puter), he fell in love with Windows 8 screen and wanted an upgrade, so that was done,</p>
<p>I did check to make sure this upgrade was possible. So purchase was made and upgrade to 8 and then on to 8.1 was done. He has been running this
</p>
<p>system for more than 6 months, and yesterday found a<strong> FREE download for
</strong><strong>Easy-Data Mediacenter - EDM2014 Video Player </strong>and followed the
</p>
<p>instructions and after rebooting came up with BSOD and error message about Bad System Config Info.</p>
<p>When I start a start up of system I get the unhappy smile and note that system is searching for additional information and then hangs at 81% and goes into</p>
<p>auto repair and tells me pc didn't start correctly and &nbsp;then gives me two choices
<strong>start or advanced options.</strong> </p>
<p>I do have the disc for MSN 8 UPGRADE, but do not want to be the one&nbsp; to break his computer. So am here asking for advice and HELP
</p>
<p>PLEASE!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diane</p>

            <p>lol, actually I could name many things about his computer and none of them would be user friendly. I know what Windows System Restore is as it used to be GO BACK of which I do have on disc.</p>
<p>Couldn't afford a NEW puter so I purchased a rebuilt from US MICRO-which I won't do again-whatever warranty there was is expired. If all else fails I guess I will have to reinstall Windows 8.</p>

BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E<br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure<br />
of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or
<br />
video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently,
<br />
remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace
<br />
the faulty&nbsp;component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.
<br />
For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this
<br />
resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible
<br />
update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at
<br />
the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting
<br />
Windows Advanced Options menu, choose theLast Known Good Configuration option. <br />
This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem: </em>Disable the program and confirm that this resolves
<br />
the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em>&nbsp; Run Chkdsk /f /r to detect and repair disk
<br />
errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If
<br />
the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help
<br />
pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS
<br />
might also resolve it.<br />

<h3> justnutherdev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visual Studio 2017, Xamarin and Windows Installer, the Story of a Sad Developer</h2>
                    <p>Everyone, I know this has been asked 1000 and 1 times.&nbsp; However, I cannot seem to find one in particular for my case.&nbsp; If I overlooked it, I am sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am trying to develop a simple app for personal reasons.&nbsp; I have Xamarin installed.&nbsp; When I try to change the size of the form I am developing for, I get the notorious "Windows Installer" popup
<del>creation&amp;&amp;deletion</del> <em>rapidly-popping-up-and-terminating-infinitely</em> loop, rendering me unable to do anything with UI development.&nbsp; I am running Malware Bytes now, seeing if it finds anything.&nbsp; When this happens on other MS programs (Word, Excel,
 Access), all I have to do is Enable Content and no problem.&nbsp; However, I don't have a big, shiny button at the top of the form designer for VS17 like I do for other MS products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else ran into this issue?&nbsp; If so, if you've corrected it, how did you do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Just another dev.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Update (10/8):</em></p>
<p>Malware Bytes did not help the issue.&nbsp; It did, however, find a couple of things that Norton did not.&nbsp; Norton is currently disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I modified and reinstalled the VS17 components, I uninstalled the Windows Installer to try to fix it, and I even stopped the Windows Installer services to try to get it to stop.&nbsp; None of these worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any insight as to how to repair this issue, it would be really helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Update (10/9):</em></p>
<p>After some digging and speaking with a colleague of mine, I found out (through the Event Viewer) I am in DLL Hell.&nbsp; My system says it is missing RICHINK.DLL.&nbsp; I have downloaded it and placed it in the folder I thought that was missing it.&nbsp; However, that
 didn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of DLL, my Windows Installer won't connect to the server to install the necessary components.&nbsp;<em>Error: 0x80070005</em></p>
<p>Again, any help with these errors would be a big help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox One Stuck on Black Screen after Green Splash Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Stuck on Black Screen after Green Splash Screen</h2>
                    
<p>Before I go any further, <strong>@ANY OFFICIAL XBOX SUPPORT MEMBER&nbsp;</strong>I've already gone through the troubleshooting multiple times. None of it works.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I downloaded the preview update for Xbox One and things were going smoothly. I powered on this morning and still no issues. I went out to do some errands and when I got back and tried to turn it on, it went to the normal splash screen like
 usual then went black and stayed there. As of right now it is still on the black screen. I've tried switching HDMI, and ports, i've done several cold boots, i've done the resolution reset by holding the eject button, I've tried a different TV.</p>
<p>Im seeing this is a prevailing issue over time but no fix.</p>
<p>My console is also a day one console if that means anything. Help ASAP</p>

<p>4 hours later, no support responce so I had to factory reset my console.</p>
<p>So for anyone else that has this issue. Here is the link. The download files are about half way down the page in the table chart.</p>

<p>I have seen many cases of this helping with your issue. Unfortunately, many times, a factory reset is required using the tool. All of the instructions and files you will need are listed on that page.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer search doesn&#39;t find recent files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bellist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer search doesn&#39;t find recent files.</h2>
                    <p>Opening symptom: I have a folder with yearly folders under it. When I do a search I don't get results from the top folder or from the 2015 folder. I do get results in the others. I am searching for text within the files, not file names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read previous articles in this Community that suggested the problem is likely indexing. I did search troubleshooting. It found nothing to report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into Indexing Options. I got it started indexing both my internal and external drives. It was working quite slowly, so I decided to not have it do the external drive, which is mostly backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make that change I clicked the Pause button in the Indexing Options box. I removed the external drive from the Included Locations list. Then I had no way to resume indexing. I toggled a setting in Advanced Options under the File Type tab that had prompted
 indexing to start the first time. But indexing did not resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the Indexing Options box has at the top "Indexing is not running." The list of locations to index is empty and the Modify button is grayed out. In Advanced Options the File Type tab is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the folder that prompted this exercise and ran a search. It was extremely slow, taking several minutes to show any results. When it finally stopped it still didn't include the files from the last two years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: After posting this note I closed the Advanced Options box. The Indexing Options box shows indexing is in progress, though it appears to have started over. At this speed it is likely to run all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this going to resolve my original problem? Is the only way to resume indexing is to change a setting and let it decide whether to restart? This second time the setting I changed was to remove a file type from the list (one I'm pretty sure I don't use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The indexing program finally ran to completion. It took hours. Afterward I tried to search in the same folder. Again, it did not find files in the top level folder. My original problem remains.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft enhanced features on every update of Operating System. Part of the updates and improvements is the Search Feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modern versions of Windows have so many files that the default search will filter out all the files it thinks Users don’t want to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you check this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-files/can-i-restore-the-xp-style-search-to-windows-7/e1601f87-8aa8-4992-b46e-562071aa1e7e">article</a></strong> for alternative option in troubleshooting
 your concern.</p>

<h2>            word attachments automatically print instead of opening</h2>
                    I used to be able to click on a Word e-mail attachment and it would open. Now, such attachments automatically get sent to the printer. I want to open and edit the document but I cannot figure out how to keep it from automatically &nbsp;printing. I am using
 Windows 8 and Word 2013.

            <p>I can open pdf and excel attachments. It only happens with word documents. I am not using Outlook. I get these documents through my Comcast e-mail and also through my work e-mail that is through my website host. I have also switched browsers from Chrome
 to IE to see if that helped, but it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open saved Word documents fine. The only problem I have is trying to open a Word document that comes to me as an e-mail attachment. What I have been able to do is download the file and cancel the print job. Then open the file from Word. That at least
 allows me to view the document. The problem when I do this is that I cannnot edit the document. I get a lot of documents that I am supposed to fill out electronically and send back. But when I open the document in the way described here, I cannot edit the
 document. I end up having to use my assistant's computer which does not have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any changes recently except installing the 2013 version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I did get it resolved. To be honest, I do not recall exactly what change in settings worked. I ended calling HP support twice (my printer and laptop both are HP products). The second call got me to someone who walked me through some settings issues, and
 it got fixed. But that person was on the phone while instructing me on the details of what to do. So, you might call tech support. Sorry I can't be of more assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Power Options\Edit Plan Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>In "advanced power settings" then under "sleep there" is an option for allow wake timers, this is auto enabled by windows 10, disabling should stop the auto turn on</p>

            I have also been having trouble with this. My computer keeps turning back on. Its a Lenovo AMD A8 originally with Windows 7. I regrettably clicked on the button to switch to 10 and that's when it started. I bought 3 of the same computer for use in my office
 and the one with Windows 10 is the only one that is doing it. Never again. I followed the above instructions and disabled the "allow wake timers" function but it is still doing it. Please help. Thanks.

    <title>Windows 10 - Start Menu Sync across devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seth_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Start Menu Sync across devices</h2>
                    <p>Yeah ok.&nbsp; Goodbye to Win 10 - which except for a few flashy gimmicks - is a polished windows 7....which i believe&nbsp;came out a decade ago.&nbsp; I don't mind a good throwback...but not at the expense of productivity and technological advancement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>case In Point - syncing between machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years, I used multiple machines in many arenas - personal, corporate, and running my own business.&nbsp; In doing this I used multiple machines. I always thought -hey.... it would be tremendous if my basic settings (desktop icons,&nbsp; arrangement, menus, and
 "placeholders")<br />
would sync across machines so i didn't have to waste hours and reconfigure everything by memory just to have access to the things I needed most.&nbsp; I didn't just dream about it...i pined for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then Win 8 came along..albeit with some not so well received changes.&nbsp; But it did introduce the ability to, using your MS account, log onto different machines with the same OS and (by clicking on the right answers to the questions) present you with an
 almost exact copy of your primary PC - start menu, behind the scene settings, even non-connect printers and what IE (metro) tabs were open on any other machine you were using!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Screen: Core apps were installed, and if you opened them they presented with YOUR settings EXACLTY AS THEY WERE ON YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE.&nbsp; WinStore installed apps....were present as placeholder in the exact location you laid them.&nbsp; IF you needed one,
 you clicked it, it installed and presented EXACTLY AS IT WAS ON YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE. The arrangement, tile sizes, and groups..ALL PRESENTED EXACTLY AS THEY WERE ON YOUR PRIMARY MACHINE.&nbsp; This was a valuable time saver.&nbsp; You logged on and literally could get
 right to work (or play) without skipping a beat and without spending hours saying...what was that app....what was that pinned shortcut...how did i log into that, what setting did I use here, how did I access that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This experience was improved upon in WIn 8.1 and worked without flaw.&nbsp; No one else had this - Apple's, Google's, Linux, etc - you log on and there is the companys default layout.&nbsp; Only Microsoft was forward thinking enough to provide their users with a unified
 experience across any device running the same OS...CONTINUTIY!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, unless I am missing something - WIn 10 has brought us back to the painful; days of windows 7....where, after logging into a different machine and clicking on your start menu you are presented with ... THE DEFAULT LAYOUT.&nbsp; Your arrangements - GONE.&nbsp;
 Your pinned apps - GONE.&nbsp; Your groupings - GONE.&nbsp; Your tile size - GONE.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>ZERO unified user experience - oh, your pretty desktop wallpaper&nbsp;is there though.&nbsp; Who cares?&nbsp; Some other irrelevant settings are there (though i have yet to figure out which ones they are...because...really who cares if my screen brightness remains the
 same across devices?) But all my hard work to arrange things as they make sense and provide me with quick and easy access to my essential apps - GONE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously?&nbsp; What brilliant logician said...hey - lets strip out the coolest thing about win 8/8.1.&nbsp; Let's make windows 10 act like windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one drive?&nbsp; Lets consider that for a moment as well.&nbsp; There is a major push to store data on the cloud.&nbsp; On the other hand, device manufactures sell lower end machines with less than optimal storage size.&nbsp; In win 8/8.1 you could store data on in the
 cloud (onedrive - because its baked in and worked well) BUT YOU COULD SELECT FILES / FOLDERS YOU WANTED TO KEEP A LOCAL COPY OF AND WHA YOU WANTED TO STORE IN THE CLOUD - leaving&nbsp;ONLY AND HAVE A PLACEHOLDER so you could easily access it (when connected obvi).&nbsp;
 This was&nbsp;a dream!&nbsp; NO longer the limited by the size of your hard drive for access to old files, databases, photos, videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was too a great idea, especially considering the sales of low storage PC's, or if you simply didn't want ot take up your hard drive storage for photos and videos from 5 years ago..but for obvious reasons don't want to delete them.&nbsp; The same holds true
 for files you worked on 6 years ago, that you don't necessarily need to store locally, but due to your business you do need to keep.&nbsp; Subpoena comes in - all you need to is go to FIle Explorer, OneDrive, and navigate to that file ... and BAM.. there is!&nbsp; Double
 click on it, it downloads and opens.&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; Useful.&nbsp; So important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now..all that is gone.&nbsp; Hello 80's!&nbsp; Goodbye Windows 10.&nbsp; I write this, happily from a clean install of Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Which I'm also happy to say took less than 30 minutes from beginning to end...and I mean end.&nbsp; When i logged in for the first time -
 lo and behold everything was exactly where I left it before (thank you one drive "backup". No time lost, no time wasted.)&nbsp; I make a change to my start screen on one machine, it shows up on another, and another, and another.&nbsp; My onedrive...all my files are
 visible..the ones i need in the now are there...the ones i may need in the further are visible...and with a quick click, they auto download and im in business.&nbsp; Thank you..please hire the peson back that made this a realtiy and reintroduce this forward thnking
 functionality to windows 10!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, unless I am, missing something.....</p>

            <p>Thanks, but completely pointless articles.&nbsp; this was a much welcomed feature in windows 8 / 8.1 from a tile perspective.&nbsp; And (of course) eliminated in win10.&nbsp; If i pin an app from the store, arrange my tiles, etc that should sync.&nbsp; Win 8x would even sync
 as place holders if the app wasn't baked in/ preinstalled on another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Terrible idea to eliminate it..and terrible idea referring me to articles that either a) dont address the issue, and b) provide obscure descriptions to what DOES sync (which after reading the second..my wallpaper (who cares) and my favorites..(nice touch)).</p>

            BY the way..i consistently used the word "APP" throughout my narrative, not APPLICATION.&nbsp; IM sure you know the&nbsp;difference?&nbsp; Honestly, without that feature win10 is simply useless and a step&nbsp;backwards to WIn7, XP, 2000....etc.&nbsp; No need for it&nbsp;since the
 most&nbsp;valuable, forward&nbsp;thinking, most useful&nbsp;piece was stripped (once again) from our purview.&nbsp;

            <p>Why can't Microsoft hire any support engineers with common sense?<br />
It takes 30 seconds to visit the second link which instead of telling us how to sync the start menu just tells us it's not possible. Why couldn't you have just said that?
</p>
<p>The idea that any part of your comment "helps" is ridiculous. I have lost count of the number of times (read: nearly every time) that an official Microsoft account responds on answers.microsoft.com which makes it completely obvious they haven't read the
 comment they're replying to. What the **** are you getting paid for if it's not ACTUALLY READING ISSUES AND RESPONDING TO WHAT IS WRITTEN. Because that hardly ever happens from what I've seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I understand that this approach probably works for a lot of simple questions, but when you're dealing with tech-savvy people, the problems are more complicated and require READING and UNDERSTANDING instead of whatever the standard response you use.
 Any tech support rep should definitely be able to determine from the question what the level of the user is and whether they should post stupid links or actually use their brain; I know I can recognise that.</p>

            My guess is that this feature was eliminated in concert with the OneDrive feature that allowed Windows 8.x to show a "link" to a file that was actually stored in the cloud. &nbsp;The synching that we're needing was tied to OneDrive as implemented in Win 8.x.
 &nbsp;OneDrive likely used the same infrastructure that enabled the "shadow links" feature. &nbsp;As such, when that was ripped out in Windows 10 (due to old style Windows XP/7 users being confused), it also left start menu synching high and dry.

<h2>            Problem with wifi non function after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Since upgrading my Medion Akoya E6221 PC from Windows 7 to Windows 10 today I cannot get my inbuilt Wi-Fi to turn on, neither the Hotkey nor F-F2 combination will allow me to turn on and connect via Wi-Fi. &nbsp;I have tried various sites, had them check the
 Intel Centrino(R) Wireless-N100 for driver issues, non found but still I cannot turn on Wi-Fi I am having to sit on top of my router and connect via cable (no my favoured method). &nbsp;I need help here and the Microsoft chat help line is, surprise, surprise very
 busy.

            <p>I had the same exact problem on a Medion Akoya E6228 laptop after upgrading from Windows 7 to 10. The WiFi was working at the login screen. I could find the WiFi network, and connect. But when I logged in the WiFi got disabled (red X on the WiFi interface
 in the Network Adapter Settings). Also the Fn hot keys was not working. No reaction on enabling/disabling WiFi or changing the volume with the hotkeys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the WiFi problem by uninstalling the hotkey (PHotkey) app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the WiFi is working, but the Fn hotkeys of course still don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now searching for a fixed version of PHotkey, or an alternative. The version (V1.00.0081) on Medions support page is the same as I already have, it has not been updated for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi; no I had no luck at all getting Win10 to do what I wanted, in fact it cost me £55 at my local PC Repair Shop, lost my Video ( screen) so I was stiffed. &nbsp;IT guy put me back on Win 7, reinstalled Hot Key Driver, Touchpad Driver and lastest version of Video
 Driver, now everything is working fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your tip on (PHotkey) app, will keep my eye open for any updates from Intel, Medion etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to tell Microsoft of my issues, after all they did a scan check of my laptop and told me all apps would still function after update except Norton 360, and what do you know, Norton being Norton stepped in and made sure their product worked, such a
 pity Microsoft aren't as thorough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>I have the same laptop akoya E6221.&nbsp;I used the original driver from the installation disk. sort of rolled it back if you like and it worked. I also had a sound issue and did the same thing installed the old&nbsp;driver from the installation disk again problem
 solved. Basically uninstall the Microsoft driver and installed the manufactures driver. but did the opposite for the wifi I installed the Microsoft version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Can any one help me with my other problems I just cant find a solution: If I start the computer by shutting it down fully every thing loads up fine apart from the function keys. I&nbsp;did manage to get the function keys working ounce and like I said I shut
 the laptop down many times and&nbsp;it started fully working&nbsp;and very fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now here is the problem I selected restart from the power option and as soon as the windows logo disappears the screen hangs on a blank screen, I can hear windows loading up in the back ground. So to get it working I have to press the power button. which
 makes it go into sleep mode, then wake it up by pressing the power button again or enter on the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Voila windows is up and running however the function keys have stopped working and now I cant get them to work again no matter what I do. I'm guessing
 the driver, or &nbsp;program is&nbsp;hitting a problem on restart which is causing the restart to hang and the function keys to also fail.</p>

            <p>Hello Nick;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info, your problem with the screen is the same one I had, the Tech guy at the shop tried all that but mine didn't respond like yours did. &nbsp;I am going to wait quite a while before I have another go at the Win10 upgrade, hopefully compatible
 drivers will be available and make the upgrade dependable. &nbsp;Its a shame really as what I experienced on a friends laptop running Win10 after upgrade was very encouraging, I liked it, but am prepared to wait it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>HI&nbsp; John,</p>
<p>just a little update. I did a fresh install with a windows 10 disk I created with the media creation tool from the Microsoft web page.&nbsp; Once window 10 was finished every thing worked the Wi Fi, sound and function keys. All of which I had problems with the
 upgrade from windows 7. </p>
<p>&nbsp;However the restart problem still persists.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;installed a&nbsp;few programs and made restore points along the way. If I restart the computer the same problem, (hangs on a black screen)&nbsp;however once I do the usual trick of pressing the power button to bring
 the computer into then out of sleep mode&nbsp;every thing is still functioning. So I thought at least now devices don't crash anymore when I do a restart. Well so I thought.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is the real problem: ounce I go to windows update and do the updates you have to restart the laptop there is no option to shut down just restart. So being cautious I&nbsp;made another restore point. I proceeded to click restart to install the updates
 and boom restart problem as before, however ounce again the function keys and sound don't work anymore. So I did a restore which said it failed due to damaged disk which it isn't its a brand new&nbsp;HDD, but the sound and function keys started to&nbsp;work again. So
 now I cant update or restart the laptop without it messing everything up. Like you John I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the Medion&nbsp; Akoya&nbsp; E6221 is not windows 10 compatible. (YET)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed windows 10 on 2 other pc's and 3 other laptops 1 of which is older than this one, and&nbsp;not one problem until I met the Akoya. GGGRRR. Which brings me to a question. I am wondering has anybody managed to install windows 8 or 8.1 on this laptop
 without problem? I don't want to have to install it to find it doesn't work either as I noticed there is no windows 8, 8.1 or 10 updates on the website.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Nick</p>

            <p>Hi everyone </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally solved the restart problem. Bios update up to 302 here is the link:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.medion.com/gb/service/_lightbox/treiber_details.php?did=11904</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure ounce you have unzipped the file run as administrator by right clicking it and selecting it. And what ever you do&nbsp;DON'T!!!!&nbsp;shutdown or unplug your laptop during otherwise it will be game over for your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why this update is not on the&nbsp;Medion UK drivers download page, would have saved me a lot of time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every thing is now working as it should. Good luck guys</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello Nick;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well that sounds like you finally got to the bottom of it all, &nbsp;I am impressed and pleased, all the things you advise are just a little beyond my skill level but, I will print off all your e-mails and take them down to my local PC repair man and ask him
 if he can help me get it done. &nbsp;I really can't thank you enough for taking the trouble to to get it done and passing it on to me. &nbsp;I wonder what sort of help or advice I would have got from Microsoft, that is if I could ever have got through to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
