 the original cable set up ( non hd ) i have sound through the tv again. but the picture quality is so poor this is not an option. the tv is a samsung plasma and otherwise works fine. thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi, Sidorenkov.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I am not a TV technician, but it sounds like the problem is with the TV, not with the Xbox (or any other part of the setup). if anything it sounds like the programme board may be malfunctioning (specifically relating to the HDMI ports), which could be due
 to an electrical surge. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The only things I can advise are to rule out each item one at a time. for example, do you use the same HD cable with the Bluray, xbox and PC? if yes then borrow a different cable and try it. Also, just to make double sure change the HDMI port you are inputting
 to on the TV.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Beyond that I would recommend going to a forum for the TV and asking there, or even contacting the manufacturers directly.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't be more help than that. good luck!</p>

<h2>            Skype name</h2>
                    I´m often asked for my Skype name or ID. Where can I find that? When others search for me with my ordinary name, there are several in that list. My Skype name is however unique as I understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>The Skype name is different, it is a unique ID which you can use to sign in to Skype. If you created your account before Skype and Microsoft migration, you'll have an option to choose or create your own username. However, if you just recently created your
 account, and using an email address to sign in, what you have is a technical ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view your technical ID or Skype name, sign in to Skype application then click your profile picture. See sample picture below:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, there are many Skype versions. However, it will have the same steps in finding one's Skype name or technical ID:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>• Sign in to the Skype app.</span></p>
<p><span>• Click any contact.</span></p>
<p><span>• On the messaging box, type
<strong>/dumpmsnp</strong> and hit <strong>enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>• Look for
<strong>*Skype name</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Or use
<a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>• Click on Profile picture</span></p>
<p><span>• Skype name or ID will show under the
<strong>Skype display name</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are showing a different profile picture, it may be possible that you are signed in to the incorrect account. To find accounts associated with your email address, please click this link:
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find Skype names</a></p>

<h2>            Digital License renewal</h2>
                    <p>My problem is this: after replacing the motherboard I couldn't reactivate Windows 'after hardware change', it just gave me error all the time, and as a last resort I tried removing my PC from the list of 'My devices' in Microsoft account. Well, now I know
 that was stupid because Microsoft now thinks I no longer have that PC and my digital license does not support changing the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can my digital license be restored? Could I have any official answer here because person on the phone gives a very strange response that while I don't have a product key they can't help me. As if he/she never heard of digital license while working for
 Microsoft official support.</p>

            Hi Alex, thanks for your question. Hopefully I can help!
<br />
<br />There are a few steps you can follow here to see if you can retrieve your digital license. See this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />According to the information on that page, if you don't have your computer linked to your Microsoft account before you make the significant hardware change (such as a new motherboard), you may not be able to link it again. There's a possibility you may need a new Windows license, since the hardware that your digital license was linked to is no longer in use.
<br />
<br />Hopefully the link above can provide the information you need. Please let me know if you need any more help. Thanks!

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)

            <div>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant 
layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and 
causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and 
has even been responsible for loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will 
continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br /><a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp; 
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>The most efficient way to do this is to completely remove the 
anti-virus program and then do a custom installation. When the opportunity to 
opt out of e-mail scanning arises, opt out.&nbsp; <br /></strong></div>
<div>If that doesn't do it, please post any error message in its

<h2>            Map app closes after starting</h2>
                    I have updated to the latest release of windows 10. As part of the update on my Dell tablet, I moved the map file to a secure digital card as disk d. Every time I start the map application, it starts up fine then just goes away with no error message. I
 have tried re-installing it by first uninstalling it. I also have my apps now being installed on the same card (disk d). I have also used the setting's panel to uninstall the maps and re-install them.

    <title>Surface Keeps Crashing &#40;BSOD&#41; And Refuses a Complete Refresh - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m nikoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Keeps Crashing &#40;BSOD&#41; And Refuses a Complete Refresh</h2>
                    <p>Since this morning my Surface keeps crashing, rebooting, trying to do the repair and then does the same cycle again. It was up to date with the latest security updates before this happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time it is a different driver and error message. It happened to the sound driver first, then the wireless driver and now I cannot get the wireless connection to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It gives me a few minutes to work with the device but it then crashes again. I have tried refreshing the device completely. It starts the refresh but then it crashes in the middle of refresh and says nothing was changed. So I am stuck as it keeps crashing
 and I cannot refresh the device. I will call the UK store support tomorrow (Monday) but wanted to see if anybody else is experiencing the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BDOS messages I have received are: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had a few driver and IRQL related faults too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not using any SD card in the Surface and the problem happens with and without the touch cover. There is no pattern for the time that it takes to crash but it does it consistently within the first 5 minutes of booting, even if I don't use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**UPDATE**</p>
<p>I&nbsp;restarted it with advanced restart options and then initiated a complete refresh. It stopped during the process and rebooted, and my Surface is now in an endless loop of trying Automatic Repair, Diagnosis and Reboot and does not allow me to choose any
 other option. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have talked to the technical support team and they are suggesting that I should create a replacement order and that means I might end up with a refurbished device :(</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When the Surface is starting up, once it reaches the <strong>"Preparing repair"</strong> message hold the power button until the unit powers off completely. Once it turns off, start it up and do the same thing again.
<strong>Repeat this a total of 3 times </strong>and your Surface should take you to a Bitlocker screen where it asks for a key,
<strong>click on "Skip this drive"</strong> and on the next screen <strong>choose "Advanced Options."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here, choose <strong>"Troubleshooting"</strong>,<strong> "Reset my PC"</strong> and
<strong>"Completely reinstall Windows."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work you will definitely want to set up a replacement for the device. Since the Surface is such a new device it is unlikely that you will receive a refurbished unit but as it is part of the replacement policy it is a possibility. If you have
 a physical store nearby and still have your packaging and receipt, or printed invoice in the case of online purchase, you can take your Surface there and request an exchange thus ensuring that the unit you receive is new and not refurbished. I can't guarantee
 anything, though, so if you decide upon this option I would recommend first contacting the store you are going to take it to and verify they can and will do this before making the trip.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I tried this but it doesn't work. It keeps going back&nbsp;to the "Diagnosing your PC" screen before restarting again so I am not given the opportunity to reset the device or skip the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am based in the UK so there are no physical stores and the only option is Microsoft Online Store so that means I could end up with a refurbished device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though I have the recovery media (created a bootable USB drive) I am not sure why Surface refuses to boot from USB (I hold the VOLUME DOWN button when turning it on). Do you know how I can force the boot from USB?</p>

    <title>blue screen of death... HELP. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aragonbattlebone  say:</h3>
<h2>            blue screen of death... HELP.</h2>
                    <p>so around the beginning of march 2018 I got a bluescreen suddenly that said DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION we will restart for you.</p>
<p>But it doesn't restart. doesn't have a counter. it sends the error message to 100% and then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left it on for hours thinking it would restart on it's own. But to the main problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it doing this? it happens randomly and without warning. my computer runs fine. I haven't changed any programs or much. just watching youtube and playing steam games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did a bit of digging and it said to uninstall some windows updates. so I uninstalled the march one. and nothing it would still do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime it won't do it for hours. or it will do it within minutes of bootin up.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think that went wrong is that I was using a usb for ready-boost and someone ripped it out of the usb without ejecting first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that is the only thing I can think of if it is not a windows update thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help it has been plaguing me for almost 2 months and i'm getting pretty sick of BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and my drivers are up to date. I don't have the IDE-IDTE whatcha ma call it. so I couldn't update that. I turned off fast-startup. (from it being on since day one.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it has to be a microsoft error. cause I haven't done anything differently for the past 2 years on my computer. and I have owned it for 6 or so years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time. I will provide whatever information that might help.</p>

            Hi Aragon battle bone,
<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Please try the <b>Windows App Troubleshooter</b> mentioned here and see if that helps:</div>

<h2>            Minor build quality issue with Surface Pro 2017 where screen meets bezel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Has a<span>nyone else noticed this on their Surface Pro 2017?</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve noticed a potential build/assembly quality issue with the new Surface Pro 2017.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It isn’t a deal breaker, but I’m putting this out there in case anyone else has also noticed this and wonders if they are alone.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to wipe away what appeared to be smudges along the border where the screen and the bezel meet in the upper left-hand corner near the left-speaker, then following up along the edge and around the rounded corner of the device.</span></p>
<p><span>If you hold it in the light just right, it appears that glue (or a glue strip) may not have been applied/or over applied beneath the screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’ve checked a store demo unit and it has the same issue in the same area (in the upper left).
</span></p>
<p><span>My Surface also has the issue along the lower left-side edge of the screen/bezel as well, and a bit in the upper-right near the right-hand speaker.</span></p>
<p><span>Taking things in perspective, as long as you don’t look for it under the right light, this is a non-issue and, at most looks like smudges along the edges where the bezel and screen meet.</span></p>
<p><span>I had a look at demo units of the Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro 4, and neither exhibit the same issue along their bezels/screens edge, so this must come down to the Surface Pro 2017’s assembly process.</span></p>
<p><span>There is always going to be something not quite right, and I prefer this over the bottom edge light bleed issue of the initial Surface Pro 4 release.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m still very happy with my Surface Pro 2017</span></p>

<p>The retailer acknowledges the issue and has offered to swap my Surface (as I'm still within my satisfaction-guaranteed window), however demo models that I've seen have this problem to some extent as well.&nbsp; Whilst it's not ideal, the 'glue strip' issue, or
 whatever it is, at least draws a very tidy line along the left-hand side of my unit.&nbsp; You could almost mistaken it for some sort of antenna component.&nbsp; The demo units to which I've compared mine, also have the issue to some extent but aren't nearly as tidy
 and it looks more like the screen is coming away from the bezel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for now, I'm holding out.&nbsp; Although the retailer has offered to swap, I don't want to risk getting a unit that might have light bleed (which I've read some people are experiencing), or a unit with this issue, but not nearly as neat and tidy as how mine
 manifests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have this on their Surface Pro 2017 as well?&nbsp; I have the i5 8GB model.</p>

            Based upon the lack of responses, I assume that most don't consider this an issue or can't be bothered to raise it.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; On a day-to-day basis I don't think this anomaly will be an issue as the display is gorgeous and there really isn't any reason
 to be focusing upon the bezel anyway.&nbsp; For me, Microsoft Support has always been excellent and uncompromising in customer satisfaction, and so, I can live with this first production run anomaly.&nbsp; I'm sure Microsoft will correct it eventually.&nbsp; It isn't enough
 of an issue for me to pursue now as the overall experience of the Surface Pro 2017 is excellent.&nbsp; And should the cosmetic issue turn into a functional issue, I have every confidence that Microsoft will make good.

            I don't think this is a glue strip - it's more likely the oleophobic coating that prevents the screen from getting too grimy. It's just not applied very well along the edges. If it's that, clean the screen with a microfiber cloth and it should appear to
 go away.

<p>Unfortunately, the blemishes are back this morning and in the exact same places as depicted in my photos previously despite the micro-cloth appearing to fix the issue last night.&nbsp;

<br />
Since last night, I've been experimenting with playing games on the i5 fanless so the blemishes may have reappeared due to the chassis getting hot.&nbsp; I will experiment further to see if the issue arises under normal day-to-day office workloads, or if it only

<p>Solved!&nbsp; (Really this time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that there is no oleophobic coating in the problem areas.&nbsp; If I try to clean it with my fingers, it leaves my skin oil there (which is why I couldn't wipe it away with my fingers).&nbsp; Whilst a fibre cloth will temporarily fix the issue, any contact
 from my hands will bring the problem back until I wipe it again with a cloth.&nbsp; It is unsightly and obviously a build quality issue with hopefully just this particular unit.</p>

<p>RESOLVED:&nbsp; I received yet another i7 8GB unit today, and it could easily be used as a demo unit for the press.&nbsp; It's beautiful.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The bezel is securely attached to the screen above the camera and so there is zero light escaping from between the bezel and the screen even in a pitch black room (or closet, as it is now day here).&nbsp; In addition, the oleophobic coating has been applied to the
 entire screen, unlike my i5 unit which had a 3mm gap in the coating along the left-hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I was prepared to live with the oleophobic issue of the i5 unit should this i7 unit had arrived today faulty as well</strong>.&nbsp; I was also would have been happy if the light leak between bezel and screen was only noticeable in a darkened room (with
 the camera light on).&nbsp; Happily this unit doesn't suffer from any of the issues of my previous two units. So, both the oleophobic coating and bezel light leakage are both manufacturing build issues.</p>

<h2>            Is there a REAL fix for the Homegroup icon problems in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried many things: editing the registry, the "network icon" thing, the "view options" thing, nothing has ever worked as a permanent solution... and since this is such a minor problem it really annoys me that Microsoft doesn't take the time to fix
 it. How much longer?

<h2>            In Device Manager, OTHER DEVICES has yellow question mark</h2>
                    I'm still having problems with sudden black screens with automatic rebooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that I get a new video driver, so I went into&nbsp;Device Manager, and since there was no listing for Video Devices, I looked under Other Devices&nbsp;(which has
 PCI Simple Communications&nbsp;Controller,&nbsp; SM Bus Controller, Video Controller, and Video Controller - VGA&nbsp;compatible) there was a yellow question mark beside each one. &nbsp;I opened each one of them and read, "Manufacturer Unknown", and "The drivers for this device
 are not installed (Code 28)"&nbsp; How do I find out who is the manufacturer&nbsp;and the model and version?

            I thought you were all fixed up.<br />
<br />
You are in good hands with Tech-Geek, but for those unknown devices, you can still tell what they are by looking at the Details tab where you will see something like this:<br />
<br />
Check the Details tab and if you see something similar to this example:<br />
<br />
PCI\VEN_<span style="font-weight: bold">1039</span>&amp;DEV_<span style="font-weight: bold">0190</span>&amp;SUBSYS_73091462&amp;REV_A2\3&amp;267A616A&amp;0&amp;38<br />
<br />
Now you have a VENdor ID (1039) and a DEVice ID (0190) which you can look up using a variety of methods, one of which is:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.pcidatabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcidatabase.com/</a><br />
<br />
For the example above, that reveals it is a SiS191 Gigabit LAN &amp; SiS0190 LAN device, so I would look on the SIS World Wide Web page for the latest driver and find all kinds of good information. Now that I also know where they live, if I need to give them a
 hard time about their adapter, I would be happy to do so:<br />
<br />
SIS<br />
NO.180, Sec.2, Gongdaowu Rd., Hsin-Chu, Taiwan 300<br />
Rm A202, 1355 Jinjihu Avenue, Suzhou Industrial Pa<br />
Taiwan, Suzhou (China)<br />
5542589664<br />
http://www.sis.com<br />
<br />
Sometimes just Googling&nbsp; VEN_1039&amp;DEV_0190&nbsp; will also tell you what you need to know.<br />

            No problemo. <br />
<br />
I can't stand those yellow question marks.<br />
<br />
If you have not checked it out on your system you can take a look at the device Details (you don't have to have a yellow question mark), take a look even if your devices are working.<br />
<br />
This method of using the VENdor and DEVice is also useful for certain BSODs for which I do not have any example handy and don't recall it at the moment - you can instantly identify the device responsible.&nbsp; I posted one here one day but it did not make it into
 my notes (grrr...)<br />
<br />
If Daniel would send his msinfo32 and the Component Display information therein and any BSODs, he might get further along too!&nbsp;

    <title>ICS not working on windows 10 even though network is established - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prostolyubo  say:</h3>
<h2>            ICS not working on windows 10 even though network is established</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I have a laptop with connected usb modem which provides the internet. Let's call this laptop a Host. I created a wi-fi hotspot using hostednetwork. I established connection with my other laptop (let's call it a Client). It works fine - both computers
 can ping each-other. I shared the network connection created by my usb dongle. I choose my hostednetwork connection to share to and checked all checkboxes in the settings menu where you can choose which services can be shared. At this point I could see on
 my Host PC in Network and Sharing Center that both connections had access to the internet. On Host I could surf the net. On the Client i saw an yellow triangle on the wi-fi connection icon in tray saying that there is a limited connectivity.</p>
<p>I checked again and I could ping both computers. I then assumed DNS issue. I used BIND to try and resolve an address from the Client. To my surprise it worked correctly. That means that TCP/IP and DNS configuration must be working correctly. I also tried
 accessing webpages by directly typing their IP addresses (the webpage I tried to access this way worked on Host computer so I was sure there are no htaccess restrictions) but with no luck.<br />
I enabled services that internet posts recommended (including ICS and Network Manager).<br />
Even though I tried resetting winsock, renewing ipconfig, flushing dns, etc. At my best I'm stuck with a working connection with working DNS resolving (I can also share files and network locations between computers). Even when I completely disabled Avast and
 firewall on both computers.<br />
I am aware that there is a "Mobile Hotspot" option in network settings, but it says that I am not connected to Ethernet, Wifi or mobile connection (which is dumb because I obviously am).</p>
<p>I also tried to make a network using Direct Bluetooth Connection but I can't share my internet connection to this type of network (since in Windows 10 it is mandatory to select a target network to share a connection to).</p>
<p>So, any ideas how may I further debug what is going on?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

            <p>Where are you going to add the printer? Do you see it in your printer list when trying to
</p>
<p>print? If you search settings using windows key + W and type device manager is it listed there? If not do you see a yellow warning on an unknown device?&nbsp;Try these to see if it helps. Use a different USB port, try a different USB cable, uninstall the driver
 restart with the printer on and connected to the computer. Thus should grab the driver for you. Also check you have the correct driver sometimes they make 32bit and 64bit versions. Good luck let me know if those help</p>

<h3> blackriv  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Hdmi function after windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP DV7 with an AMD Radeon HD 6300m integrated video and ATI Radeon HD Mobility 4200. After windows 10 upgrade, video is slow and stilted especially full screen and there is no HDMI connectivity. No secondary display detected, which always was before,
 and AMD adapter stops functioning. Windows says that PC can't project to another screen and to reinstall drivers or use a different video card. I have installed many different old and new drivers including recent and final HP updates from Nov/2016. I had done
 a refresh of windows 10 which warned that going back to windows 8.1 was not an option.
</p>
<p>Poor video delivery and no HDMI make this Notebook a word processor alone &nbsp; :(</p>
<p>

    <title>Audio distortion with Windows Audio Graph Isolation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catzenjammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio distortion with  Windows Audio Graph Isolation &#40;Audiodg.exe&#41;</h2>
                    Like many people, I have been having trouble with Audiodg. I have an HP Envy Touchsmart laptop that has and IDT HIgh definition audio adapter with driver version 6.10.6491.0. It is running Windows 10 Pro. Unlike most people, my problem is that several
 times a day, the sound get very distorted with a crackling, raspy effect. &nbsp;It does seem to use more cycles and memory than it should, but not excessively so. The distortion occurs with all sound, playing music with Windows Media Player, video clips on news
 sites, and others. &nbsp;If I stop audiodg in task manager it restarts without the distortion, but it will recur later. &nbsp;I have all the latest Windows 10 updates as of three days ago. Any ideas or suggestions?

<h2>            window key &#43; x key not working</h2>
                    <p>My task bar and start menu isn't working, so I've searched through Microsoft website and found someone previously had the same question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/task-bar-and-start-menu-stops-working-on-windows/ab89ec31-071a-433e-8cb5-aaefc975a023</p>
<p>
</p><p>So firstly I p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ressed the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Key + R</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;to open run command. and typed&nbsp;</span><strong>ms-settings:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and
 hit Enter key. I received an error message saying:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Ms-settings:windowsupdate-history&nbsp;</em><span><em>The wait operation timed out.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ressing&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows logo key + X</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">, to select&nbsp;</span><strong>Command Prompt(Admin)
</strong>and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm stuck with a task bar that's not working and any methods I can see to fix this problem isn't working either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me how I go about fixing this? The task bar was working just fine until this morning. There was a major Windows 10 update a few days ago, but I've done nothing different since then. I also haven't added any new apps or progams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
