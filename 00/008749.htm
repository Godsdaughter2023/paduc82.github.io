<h2>            Macro to set paper size when printing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Just wondering if the following is possible, I was hoping to see if a macro could;<br />
<br />
1) Set paper size before printing to A3 and apply this to all sheets in the work book.<br />
2) If the printer did not have&nbsp; A3 printing ability to return a message box saying this.<br />
3) Set orientation to Landscape and apply this to to all sheets in the workbook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Regards<br />
Newbeetle<br />

<h2>            Access 2013 Import Wizard Not Recognizing the last column of  an excel spreadsheet .xls</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure If I'm doing something wrong or if this is a bug or something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Access 2013 Import wizard it doesn't see the last column of an excel spreadsheet. This happens on other spreadsheets that have 13+ columns and its always the last column that is missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens</p>
<p>Spreadsheet .xls is emailed to me daily and save in a folder on my desktop via an Outlook Macro (SaveAsFile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the spreadsheet.. it has 14 columns (see names below) and approx 150-200 rows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue: I Open Access and Click on Excel in the import menu, &nbsp;select .xls file and and then either link, New table or append (it doesn't matter) the wizard opens up and only shows 13 of the 14 column missing the last column.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried rearranging the spreadsheet columns (changing the last columns) and no change.. **changing the columns at the source which send me a new spreadsheet via email. Same issue.<br />
</p>
<p>** noticed that if I open the spreadsheet make a minor change/save it.. Then the wizard shows all fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>** noticed that if you have the spreadsheet open when you use the wizard it will see all fields..&nbsp;</p>
<p>** I use the wizard only when setting up a new report and save it in "Saved Imports", Once setup I use automation to perform the import daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the issue be with the Outlook Macro using SaveAsFile?</p>

            <p>I don't see how Outlook could mess up a file, but it could be the issue. How is the excel file being created? Maybe the last column is corrupted in some way. If it has a header is there anything unusual about the name like containing special characters or
 a carriage return?</p>

            <p>Service Now Reporting scheduler send the file not sure how its actually created. Will check with the admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for special characters I don't see any.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the file its in read-only and if I save it and try again it see all 14 columns.. &nbsp;Do you think it has some to do with read-only? If that is the issue I would have thought it wouldn't see any of the columns.</p>

</p><p>I don't have an answer for you. I've never seen this happen before. Sounds more and more like a bug. What happens if you link to the sheet instead of importing it?</p>

<h2>            Build 17661 issues.</h2>
                    After installing this build all seemed to be fine but within a couple of days Windows Explorer and the Taskbar began randomly crashing and restarting. Restarting the laptop would solve the issue for several hours but now the crashes are just a couple of
 minutes apart and restarting has no effect. I have made no drastic changes to anything to cause this issue. I ran SFC and it reported "no integrity violations". I also ran DISM Restore Health which completed but also had no effect.&nbsp; Usually when Explorer crashes
 everything onscreen stops responding completely until Explorer restarts. I am also experiencing delays on all programs in responses to inputs.

    <title>Windows Insider Update April 1 2018 ISSUE &#40;MAJOR ISSUE&#41; NEED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin evalle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Insider Update April 1 2018 ISSUE &#40;MAJOR ISSUE&#41; NEED HELP ASAP</h2>
                    <p>So I'll cut straight to the point. This morning (early morning like around 4am), I got a notification stating that my laptop needed a restart to install the new updates available. Seeing as how I'm in the "Insider Program", I did so just like every other
 time there was an update available. My laptop went through the procedure just like every other time. Percentage on screen stating how much of the update remained or has been done. Message in the bottom stating that the laptop will restart several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, when it was finished (Took about 45mins-1hr), my laptop restarted like it always does. Dell screen, loading windows screen, lock screen and finally once I hovered with my mouse, the sign in screen. First 2 things I noticed were, had to sign in with
 my account password and not my PIN which is my preferred option, no internet connection available through Wi-Fi, only through LAN. WTV, I paid it no mind thinking to myself,"I'll just troubleshoot the issue". I input my password, get the "welcome" message
 with the dotted loading circle next to it. Takes about 2 minutes or so to let me in, which is longer than usual. Then, I get the "We've Got Some New Updates For You", "This Might Take Several Minutes", "These Updates Help Protect You In An Online World" (so
 hilarious considering my issue), "Leave Everything to Us"(ironically hilarious), &amp; "Almost Done". At last, I am in my laptop desktop just to get a BLACK SCREEN and a LONG and confusing message which I can only understand as "You got served, you're hdd has
 been erased, damaged, broken, sacrificed to the Window Gods and forever lost".</p>
<p>The Message:</p>
<p><strong>Location is not available</strong></p>
<p><strong>X </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable. If the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the
 network or Internet, and then try again. If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried troubleshooting my Internet connection and get a message saying "An error occurred while troubleshooting".</p>
<p>Error Details:<br />
Unknown<br />
Unknown<br />
0x80070426<br />
Engine<br />
Desktop-C3FQ3T4</p>
<p>Restricted<br />
<br />
Can't select settings, Start, No icons, I practically can't do a thing. No Cortana (probably got sacrificed as well), no search option, not even CMD works. Restarted my lappie, diagnosed the hdd, sign out and restarted again, sign in again, and still nothing.
 PLEASE HELP!!!!&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ok, everything sounds like a normal Insider update until you get to the end where it sort of says "You've been had".&nbsp; That sounds like a virus or an April Fool's thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you&nbsp; saying that you now mostly have a paper weight for a PC?&nbsp; IF so, then you are likely headed for a clean install using the Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fried more than a few W10 Insider builds, mostly my fault.&nbsp; I have had other PCs with a faulty O/S.&nbsp; I treat these PCs just like a PC that I built in the garage.&nbsp; They do not have an O/S or they have a non-functioning O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My routine is simple.&nbsp; I use the Media Creation Tool to get the latest Public Build.&nbsp; I ask for use on another PC which gives me a "bootable" USB.&nbsp; I then go into the BIOS to change load to the USB.&nbsp; I insert the USB and start the PC which reads the USB.&nbsp;
 I go default for partitions and I get the transfer of data from the USB to the hard drive.&nbsp; I am then asked to remove the USB.&nbsp; I go back into BIOS and change the load order back to the hard drive.&nbsp; I then just sit back and let it install public build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of weeks back, I wanted to get rid of an W10 Enterprise and go to W10 Pro.&nbsp; I also wanted to replace the HDD with a SDD.&nbsp; I just swapped in the blank SDD and hit it with the ISO from the Media Creation Tool that I created on a bootable USB.&nbsp; It
 was pretty boring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a virus, you might want to format the hard drive.&nbsp; If it is an April Fool's skip the format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will lose you apps and your personal data.&nbsp; However, with a dead O/S, your options are limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may get other options but I give you 1 option.&nbsp; As you stand now, you are likely facing the re-load of W10.&nbsp; In about 10 days, the Media Creation will be offering the Spring Upgrade of 17133.xxx.&nbsp; The latest Insider is at 17133.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem quite knowledgeable on your PC.&nbsp; You will likely follow what I am suggesting.&nbsp; If not, there are good links on this site.&nbsp; Your last working Insider build would also be nice to know.&nbsp; ISO files have been released lately for the Slow and Fast lanes
 but the Media Creation Tool is likely the best choice because you start off with a bootable USB and not have to fool around with Rufus or other.</p>

I had totally forgotten it's April Fools Day. I should've put (not April Fools Joke) on the headline. LMAO
But its real. Come to think of it. Would Microsoft do an AF joke on ppl? I wonder. I sure hope so cuz this sux. That's what I'm dreading. I DO NOT want to or, better yet, I can't lose my data on my HDD. I have tons of documents and programs I can't afford
 to lose. I was, slowly but surely, transferring most of it to my (should not mention as to not anger the Window Gods)-book because I somehow knew it was the right thing to do if I was going to continue the "Insider Program". Only reason it was taking me awhile
 was that I'm still not comfortable with the unmentionable's format. It looks similar to a PC but the commands and OS are way way different. So I wanted to familiarize myself with it before I made the full on transfer. So I wouldn't make any unnecessary mistakes
 or have to keep on looking through tutorials to understand certain functions. 
Seems like the Joke is on me. You got me Mi

<p>Hard to say just what your issue is.&nbsp; Looks like you got a 99% install until the gods hit you right at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery may get you back on track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I get a good install of an Insider build, I create my own ISO of the current build.&nbsp; This has saved me a couple of times.&nbsp; I usually keep 1 or 2 of the latest ISOs before I dump them.&nbsp; I have a 17133.1 ISO.&nbsp; I just fed this to all of my public builds
 as the spring RTM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This little routine is also fairly simple.&nbsp; I use an easy to obtain program.&nbsp; Immediately after the install, I go to Windows.old and then Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Downloads\ and then look around for a folder with a ton of files in it.&nbsp; I just copy this
 file location into the little gem program and I get the ISO of the current install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am replying on a Public Build PC so my notes may be a little loose here on exact detail.&nbsp; I can be more specific on my Insider, if asked.&nbsp; Just another weapon to have.&nbsp; I suspect any recovery would come from Windows.old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might not help here but might be useful going forward.&nbsp; With this gem, you would have the current&nbsp; or at least the prior Insider build.</p>

<h2>            Windows 6.5 text input crawls</h2>
                    Anybody have any solution to keep Mobile 6.5 on ES400 from crawling when doing text input. Our team got these from Corporate about a month ago, everyone is experiencing slow text input rates. We've done the usual, cleared stored entries, cleared alert
 folders. Will deleting unused apps help? (see Program usage in next sentence) &nbsp;If so, not sure how to uninstall them (such as Bing). my memory usage counts are VERY low, (Storage 84 of 661 MB, Program 139 of 178 MB) I'm not sure what else to try short of 1-9
 option 5. Corporate tells us not to do that. Should we just have them issue us new handsets. Or, is there a file or unneeded dataset somewhere in file manager we can delete so these things will run like the day we got them. These are our field dispatch units,
 so when they don't run efficiently, they cut into our core metrics.

            Hello. You might try disabling word completion/prediction (Start&gt;settings&gt;personal&gt;input). Also, have you soft reset the devices recently? If these are corporate admin-locked devices, it may not be possible to delete any apps. Your memory situation does
 not appear to be critical. Not sure what you mean by "1-9 option 5"? Is that a factory reset?

</p><p>- My Hotmail account</p>
<p>- My Gmail account</p>
<p>- My Yahoo account</p>
<p>- My office account which is based on Gmail server</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pre-installed Outlook app does not receive emails promptly in most of the cases. Although my office email account is set to receive emails "as items arrive" still when I open it, it says at the bottom "Last update 1 hour ago".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time when I open Gmail email, it says "Up to date" but still it does not receive emails instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not talk about Hotmail and Yahoo account here because I have set them to receive emails "based on my usage".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is whenever I am reading or marking emails as "read" or deleting any email, it is not updating on main servers, it always show as Unread email there. This is happening with all the above 4 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I would like to tell you all that I am already using above 4 email accounts on my Note 5 (Android device) simultaneously with my new Lumia 650, and on Note 5 I am not facing any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me so that I can completely switch to Lumia 650.</p>

                    <p>I had a very lengthy email (including photos) that was composed using the iPhone mail application. &nbsp;It was Saved many times and I was reaccessing the draft. &nbsp;When accessing the email under the Drafts folder, I accidentally swiped the email too far left,

<h2>            Incorrect password error</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have set up a new account with outlook.com and have synced up both phone and ipad with this new email. During the synchronisation it had asked me to change passwords on both phone and iPad, I followed the instructions but the problem is that on
 the emails on my iPad (IOS 8) &nbsp;when I try to access my emails in shows 'incorrect password - enter password for the outlook account "outlook"' I have repeatedly done this and have tried all passwords associated with this new account (which are only three).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the problem myself I have;</p>
<ul>
<li>taken off capitals&nbsp;</li><li>logged in on the web, on both phone and iPad (which works)</li><li>two-step varification&nbsp;</li><li>looked up on other sites to help solve the problem but due to lack of information I could not find a solution</li><li>changed passwords</li><li>shortened the password&nbsp;</li><li>Deleted and re added my account&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>None of this has worked for me and I am now unsure of what to do to solve this irritating problem as I can not access my email as on my iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also found another problem with outlook.com but on my phone this time. When wanting to add a new email account and for outlook to authorise it, it has said they need to take it to the internet page. When I clicked on the hyperlink it just sent me
 back with an error message saying 'oops! We're having a problem that we can't solve at the moment. Try again later.' When going back to 'try again later' it said the same thing for the 20+ times I've tried this, unless you have a problem that you can never
 solve I would like this sorted out or explained to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sara.</p>

</p><p>Just to clarify, when you say that you tried it the other way, do you mean with using a different email address to try and gain your password? If not, which ways have you tried recovering the password??</p>

<h3> usrksy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2013 - Prepopulate a subform based on criteria selected in the main form PLUS a list of items from a query</h2>
                    <p>We have a board of directors database to capture all board member data, as well as meetings they attended.</p>
<p>The Admin Asst would like to easily capture the attendance from each of the specific meetings within the db.&nbsp; Right now they are doing it within an excel ss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a tblMtgDates that contains the Board Year, Meeting Type, and Meeting Dates associated with said year/types.</p>
<p>The selection of the dates is associated with the type - and is filtered in such a way that it only shows the dates related to the types.</p>
<p>Okay - so that part I'm good with.</p>
<p>Now this part is where I'm having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I make the appropriate selections in the main form, I want to click a button that has a query behind it that will query what board members were a part of the committee selected during the board year selected, and prepopulate an editable form so all
 they have to edit are two fields "Attended" and&nbsp;"Comments" (if appl) and Append that information to the table tblAttendance for historical reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to be able to pull up that list of attendees in the future for reporting, OR - if I need to make adjustments.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another button on that main form that says 'edit attendance', but I think that might be a bad idea because someone may click&nbsp;ADD 'again', and cause duplicate information.&nbsp; Note - I have the primary keys set within the tblAttendance with the AutoId,
 MemberID, MtgType, and Mtg Date fields, so maybe that's not an issue.</p>

<p>Actually - I also think that on selecting the Add Members from Meeting, the call should be to use qryAttendanceExecutive if Type selected is executive, OR qryAttendanceFullBoard if Type selected is Full Board (these are the options with the unbound 'Type'
 (aka cboMtgType)&nbsp;field noted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?&nbsp; Because there are 3 tables related to this: </p>
<ol>
<li>tblMemberData that has their names and other pertinent information.&nbsp;</li><li>tblBOD that contains members that are a part of the full board</li><li>tblCommitteesServed that contains members that are a part of various committees (including Executive)</li></ol>
<p>So a way to run the query related to the two types, based on the cboMtgType selection - THEN to query based on the Board year so only those that were a part of that board/committee during that term will populate/append into the subform below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cboMtgDate will be auto-appended to the form based on the above, but is NOT related to the two queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp; The subform is called frmAttendAppend&nbsp;with the source of tblAttendance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, Board of Director Members can also be a part of various committees.&nbsp; But not required.&nbsp; Committee members will always be a part of the Board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make sense?</p>

            I would not do it that way. I would just record who attended. So your subform should have a combobox to select the board member and then add their comments. You can filter the combobox for just the members who would be attending the selected meeting.

            Firstly, the inclusion of the autonumber ID column in the primary key of tblAttendance is pointless.&nbsp; As an autonumber its values are distinct, so the column is a candidate key.&nbsp; By including it in a composite key that key becomes a trivial key as it contains
 a candidate key.&nbsp; If you delete the unnecessary ID column from the table and include only the other three columns in the primary key, it will then not be possible to insert an invalid row which duplicates the values in these three columns, as this would violate
 the key and raise an error.<br />
<br />
As regards the insertion of rows for all legitimate members into the table, I would in most circumstances tend to agree with Scott with regard to inserting rows only for those who attended, but you might have a valid reason for wishing to record non-attendees
 also.&nbsp; It's for you to decide in the context of your business model.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example of something similar in StudentLog.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file, an 'All Students' button in the Courses form inserts all students registered for a course as attendees of a session of the course with the following code:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO CourseAttendances" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "(StudentID,CourseID,CourseDate) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT StudentID, " &amp; Parent.[CourseID] &amp; ", #" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(Parent.[sfcCourseSessions].[Form].[CourseDate], "yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss") &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "# FROM CourseRegistrations WHERE CourseID = " &amp; Parent.[CourseID]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery<br />
<br />
As you can see this executes an INSERT INTO statement to insert rows into the CourseAttendances table by selecting those students registered for the course in question.&nbsp; The date of the session (CourseDate) is inserted as a date literal into each row.<br />
<br />
In my case the facility to insert all registered students is provided as it is often easier to insert all possible attendees and then delete the non-attendees, rather than inserting each attendee individually.&nbsp; However, the methodology would essentially be
 the same in your case.&nbsp; You would of course have to devise the SQL for the INSERT INTO statement so that it inserts the correct members in your case<br />

<p>I re-read your posts and I think you have other issues about structure than Ken mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"there are 3 tables related to this: </p>
<ol>
<li>
tblMemberData that has their names and other pertinent information.&nbsp;</li><li>
tblBOD that contains members that are a part of the full board</li><li>
tblCommitteesServed that contains members that are a part of various committees (including Executive)"</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>tblBOD should probably not exist. What you have is a many relationship. One member can be on multiple committees and one committee can have multiple members. So, instead you should have your tblMemberData then tblCommittees and finally&nbsp; junction table: tjxMemComm.
 tblCommittess would look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblCommittees</p>
<p>CommitteeID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>CommitteeName</p>
<p>(note: Full should be listed as a Committee in this table)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have: </p>
<p>tjxMemComm</p>
<p>MemCommID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>MemberID (FK)</p>
<p>CommitteeID (FK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So each member that is part of a committee has a record in this table for each committee they are on, including a record for the Full board. From there your queries would include tjxMemComm filtered for the committee the meeting is for.</p>

<p>The BOD list contains the 'history' of the board of directors back to 1970 something.&nbsp; Each board member could serve on a 2 or 4 year term (depending on other factors).&nbsp; This information contains and is treated very differently than committee participation,
 e.g., join dates, term limits, and a host of other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tblMemberData uses the MemberID through the db to link.&nbsp; That is the one to many.</p>
<p>This table also contains potential candidates for the board, </p>
<p>the tblBOD again contains all the Board&nbsp;information as it relates to the specific member.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;this db has been in existence for 2 years already and there are a TON of reports, queries, forms, etc that are involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But even if I did have it as you suggest, I still don't know how to get the form to pre-populate with the current board members so we can note who attended, was absent, or who sent in a stand by.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to click the button - have all the 'current' members for the specified board or committee&nbsp;show up so the Assistant can quickly go down the list and selected the attendance option related to each one, and note any comments if necessary.</p>
<p>I want the table to prepopulate with the meeting type and meeting date that I selected for the filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this information to be tracked in an Attendance table so we can track and report historically.&nbsp; Basically, if you're a part of the board and don't attend 1/2 the meetings, perhaps you shouldn't be on the board or committee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with 'that' part?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            We need to know a lot more about the structure of the individual tables and the relationship types between them before we can advise you further with any degree of confidence.&nbsp; The easiest way to supply this would be by posting an image of the relationships
 window, set out in such a way that the full structure of each table is visible, and the relationships between the tables are clear.&nbsp; The image below, for instance is of the model for the StudentLog demo which I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; As you can see the overall
 structure of the model is readily apparent from this.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d008abe-efb3-4f8f-94d5-d8ecbe6e1480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d008abe-efb3-4f8f-94d5-d8ecbe6e1480" /></a><br />
<br />
To assign members to a meeting you will need to build an 'append' query such as that illustrated in my earlier reply for assigning students to a course session.&nbsp; In essence this means that you are able to build an SQL statement which selects the MemID values
 of those members who are eligible to attend the meeting, along with the relevant MtgType and MtgDate values, which can be derived in various ways.&nbsp; The SQL statement I posted gets the analogous CourseDate and CourseID values by means of parameters which, in
 the case of the CourseDate, builds a date literal by referencing a control in the parent form, and in the case of the CourseID, by restricting the CourseRegistrations table by referencing another control in the parent form in the WHERE clause.<br />

            Again, why do you need to prepopulate ALL the members? Why not just record those who attend. To make it easier, you can use a Multi-Select Listbox. The user can then just click on the members who attended and then you can run an Append query to just append
 those who were selected.

<p>
</p><p>They want to track very specifically who attended, who didn't, and if they didn't attend, did someone come in their place, or were they just absent.</p>

<h2>            Scrolling down in Excel Online App</h2>
                    
<p>I am using&nbsp;Excel Online via Firefox 41.0.1 with a file size of 80.33KB and whenever I scroll down the page automatically brings me right back to the top of the page.</p>
<p>I need to be able to scroll down.</p>
<p>After reading other posts that appear to have reported similar issues I know that people put the problem down to using Google Chrome as their browser but I am using Firefox.</p>
<p>I am not particularly tech savvy but I really need to find out how to get around this problem.</p>

<p>Hi Kim,<br />
<br />
You can try the following suggestions and check the results:<br />
1.Use the IE browser to open the same Excel file to check if you can scroll down.
<br />
2.Use Firefox to open other Excel files to check if all the Excel files have the same issue.<br />
3.Change to another computer.<br />
<br />
Moreover, we have a specific support channel for this kind of issue. It is suggested you post a new thread in our
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/officeonline-excel_online?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=threads&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;tm=1444270348337">

    <title>Collapse a spreadsheet with subtotals - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelao  say:</h3>
<h2>            Collapse a spreadsheet with subtotals</h2>
                    
<p>I have a large spreadsheet that I have subtotaled on a "Charge Code" and Subtotaled the Qty.&nbsp; I then copied the description for the entire spreadsheet, and re-pasted the description 1 cell lower so that the description of the charge is displayed next to
 the Charge Code with a "Total" following the charge code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I would like to collapse the spreadsheet to get rid of all of the itemization detail and leave me with just the rows with the charge code "total", description, NDC code, and Qty fields.&nbsp; Excel help suggests that I collapse the spreadsheet rather than
 try to "sort" out the data without the "Total" in the cell.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by using outline grouping.</p>
<p>Select the entire rows of&nbsp;itemisation above the first subtotal row,<br />
then use the data ribbon to select outline &gt; group.</p>
<p>The rows should now be linked together on the left hand side by a line, and the subtotal row will have a little block with a minus, click on this to clooapse the rows...</p>
<p>Repeat this for other itemisation rows per sub total.</p>
<p>You will also note two little boxes appear i n the top left, just under the name box. These are level buttons, which can be usued to switch on and off the 'levels' of groups and subgroups.</p>
<p>Hope this helps...</p>

            It's Amazon that has published the app and controls what people can use to access their website, none of Microsoft has anything to do with this, hopefully though when windows 10 is released some more functionality is given due to the ability to port IOS
 and Android apps over to windows.

<p>hi danny,</p>
<p>did you encounter the error when you tried to edit the user property? if yes, you could try the following cmdlet to convert the user account from guest to member:
<em><strong>set-msoluser -userprincipalname *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -usertype member</strong>
</em>and then try again.</p>
<p>if it is not your scenario, we need to collect some more details for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>1.what operation were you doing when encountering the error.<br />
2.please provide a screenshot of the error. to upload a picture, please click <strong>

<p>hi alex, i am currently in the process of setting up the tenant. the user did have a&nbsp;hebburn.onmicrosoft.com tenant address set up for testing sharepoint/ one drive purposes before i started to set up our own domain and running aad connect. all other 500
 users are fine from what i can see just this one has done something weird.</p>
<p>if user tries to access portal /&nbsp;sharepoint in any way using his ad credentials then he gets this error</p>
<p>if the user tries to add sharepoint service to office 2013 they get this error</p>
<p>if the use tries their personal account on sharepoint then they get this error however their personal one drive works fine and shows personal documents.</p>
<p>before i followed your suggestion and changed the user type to member they were getting this error when trying to log into the portal</p>
<p>thanks </p>

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation. It seems you posted some screenshots but they cannot display correctly. Can you send us the screenshots again to help us better understand what this user encountered? To upload images, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then select the<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, regarding “<strong>If user tries to access portal / sharepoint in any way using his AD credentials then he gets this error</strong>”, do you mean you enabled<strong> password sync&nbsp;</strong>in ADSync tool?

            These forums are for Windows Mobile Phone users so the best help I can offer is to advise getting a Windows Phone Santana_21714.&nbsp; They are awesome!

            This is called "radio buttons."<br />

            I am not good with macros, is there another way.&nbsp; Also found out that in the form, these checkboxes will be on a separate line.&nbsp; Would I still be able to do this?

            I know of no way to do this, in Word, without vba (macros). Now might be time to dip your big toe into that water.<br />

            Hi Muz2,<br />
<br />
Please make sure the email address is correct using “<strong>Get-Mailbox</strong>
<em><strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></em>”<br />
Then try adding the permission with “<strong>Add-MailboxFolderPermission</strong>”. Here are my commands:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c173450-71e5-4fe5-aa6f-a022a8b07e5a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c173450-71e5-4fe5-aa6f-a022a8b07e5a" /></a><br />
<br />
If it doesn’t help, please show me the screenshots after running these two commands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alison<br />
