<h2>            ID3 Tag 2.4 support in Windows 10, Explorer, Windows Media Player 14, and Groove Music</h2>
                    <p>Almost three years ago, in October 2012, when Windows 8 has been just released, I published a
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-pictures/id3-tag-24-support-in-windows-81-explorer-and/8f438599-fa69-4377-895c-a08a485a679c" title="ID3 Tag 2.4 support in Windows 8.1, Explorer and Windows Media Player 13">
post</a> about the native support of&nbsp;ID3 Tag 2.4 in Windows.&nbsp;Now, we are in the mid 2015, Microsoft released the brand-new Windows 10, which is full of new features and gigas of bloatware, but there is no such usefull feature, such as support of the latest
 version of standards. FYI, iTunes supports <em><strong>ID3 Tag 2.4</strong></em>&nbsp;at least for a decade!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these days Microsoft ships Windows 10 to the stores. According to Microsoft's claims, Windows 10 is the most innovative version since Windows 95, but if this statement is true, so what about native support of
<em><strong>ID3 Tag 2.4</strong></em> by <em><strong>Explorer</strong></em>, <em>
<strong>Windows Media Player 14</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Groove Music</strong></em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems too strange, that the brand new OS, that will be a new Microsoft's flagship till the end of 2018 does not have a native support of such kind of basic stuff, like
<em><strong>ID3 Tag 2.4</strong></em>.</p>
<p><br />
I hope, this lack will be corrected in Windows 10.1 in near future!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to be able to use a meta-data stored in my mp3s out-of-box, without any conversion, like I can do it in MacOS or Linux.</p>

thread</a></p>
<p>As is common when MS messes up (which is also too common) there is a registry fix.</p>
<p>To enable recognition of&nbsp;<strong>ID3v2.4&nbsp;</strong>tags in Windows Explorer you'd need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take ownership of&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\SystemPropertyHandlers</strong></li><li>Remove/rename registry lines that contain files you need Windows Explorer to read&nbsp;ID3v2.4 tags from (e.g.&nbsp;<strong>.mp3, .wav, mp4</strong>)</li><li>Install&nbsp;<strong>AudioShell 2</strong>&nbsp;and select all files you need Windows Explorer to read tags from</li><li>Restart your PC</li></ol>
<p>This basically allows&nbsp;<strong>AudioShell 2</strong>&nbsp;to manage those extensions in Windows Explorer instead of whatever the default arrangement was.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, it works, but I'm talking about the <em><strong>native</strong></em> support of such basic and relatively old format as
<em><strong>ID3 Tag v2.4</strong></em>. I don't want registry workarounds, we're waiting for an out-of-box solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This format has been released 15 years ago! I believe, there was enough time to adopt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why any other OS (Linux, MacOS X, Android, iOS) along with even low-budget mp3-players&nbsp;support this version of tags, but the brand-new 2015 released OS, which is stated as the most innovative OS ever from Microsoft does not.</p>

            <p>Yeah, well, that can take another 15 years :(</p>
<p>Apparently no one at Microsoft is aware/cares about this blunder and whichever body sets the tag standard sucks at promoting compliance (I've been going nuts trying too understand the issue of every single tag management utility writing incompatible song
 ratings).</p>
<p>Windows is just bad at these kinds of things - they can't even implement a way more common feature in explorer - simple tabs!</p>

<h2>            Help Please-Xbox Support is TERRIBLE</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I was hoping I wouldn't have to bash Xbox Support, but they are the worst. I have been trying to switch my Microsoft Account to a new one for about a month now. I have dealt with them three separate times and they have not helped one bit, in fact they
 have made it worse, making me reactivate all my apps I run on my 360, and I am about to give up. I have a simple request, Move my gamertag to a new microsoft account. The new account has never been used with a gamertag before, and is completely separate from
 my current Microsoft Account linked to my gamertag. When I attempt to switch to the new account I get the error code 80154023. I have waited more than a day to try again and have tried to use the Xbox Support and honestly, they were useless. Can anyone here
 help me?&nbsp;</p>

</table>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Scroll right to <b>Your Information</b> and select <b>Account Security</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Microsoft account</b> (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/microsoft-account-windows-live-id" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Your Windows Live ID is your Microsoft account</a>.)
</li><li>Do one of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>If you already have another Microsoft account, select <strong>Yes</strong>. </li><li>If you don't have another Microsoft account, go to <a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If you try to switch your Xbox Live gamertag (or Xbox Music tag) from one Microsoft account to a different Microsoft account that's already linked to another Xbox Live gamertag, you'll get the following error message:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Microsoft account</strong> (or Windows Live ID)<strong> you’re switching to is already linked to another Xbox account.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before you can switch your gamertag in this case, you must first remove the existing gamertag from the Microsoft account you want to use. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider the following scenario:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>Gamertag A</b> is linked to <b>Microsoft account 1</b>. </li><li><b>Gamertag B</b> is linked to <b>Microsoft account 2</b>. </li></ul>
<p>In this scenario, your gamertag is <strong>Gamertag</strong> B, and you want to move it to
<strong>Microsoft account 1</strong>.</p>
</li><li>At <a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">accounts.live.com</a>, create a new Microsoft account. You'll only need this account as a temporary means of moving your gamertags.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>Gamertag A</b> is linked to <b>Microsoft account 1</b>. </li><li><b>Gamertag B</b> is linked to <b>Microsoft account 2</b>. </li><li><b>Microsoft account 3</b> is free. </li></ul>
</li><li>Switch the gamertag that's linked to the Microsoft account you want to use to the Microsoft account that you created in Step 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>Microsoft account 1</b> is now free. </li><li><b>Gamertag B</b> remains linked to <b>Microsoft account 2</b>. </li><li><b>Gamertag A</b> is now linked to <b>Microsoft account 3</b>. </li></ul>
</li><li>Switch your gamertag to the Microsoft account that you want to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>Gamertag B</b> is now linked to <b>Microsoft account 1</b>. </li><li><b>Microsoft account 2</b> is now free. </li><li><b>Gamertag A</b> remains linked to <b>Microsoft account 3</b>. </li></ul>
</li><li>To complete the switch of gamertags between the two original Microsoft accounts, you must wait 30 days. After 30 days, switch
<strong>Gamertag A</strong> from <strong>Microsoft account 3</strong> to <strong>
Microsoft account 2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>Gamertag B</b> remains linked to <b>Microsoft account 1</b>. </li><li><b>Gamertag A </b>is now linked to <b>Microsoft account 2</b>. </li><li><b>Microsoft account 3</b> is now free. </li></ul>
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/cancel-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cancel the Microsoft account</a> that you created in step 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><b>Gamertag B</b> is now linked to <b>Microsoft account 1</b>. </li><li><b>Gamertag A</b> remains linked to <b>Microsoft account 3</b>. </li><li><b>Microsoft account 3</b> is cancelled. </li></ul>
</li></ol>
</li><li>When you change to a new Microsoft account, the current funds in your original Microsoft account do not transfer to your new Microsoft account.
</li><li>You can move a gamertag to a different Microsoft account only once every 30 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>This includes new gamertags downloaded from Xbox Live. </li><li>If you try to move a gamertag before 30 days have passed since the last time you moved it, you’ll get the following error message:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p><b>Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account right now.</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p>THAT DID NOTHING. I know how to switch a gamertag, I am not new to Xbox Live. I have changed and switched gamertags before. It won't let me now is the problem. I have waited well more than 30 days, and I have spent HOURS with the worst customer service ever.
 I am seriously done with Xbox Live. I have been here since it started, It's so sad how they treat their customers and provide zero service.</p>

<p>Have you recently made any changes to either account? &nbsp;Password resets, downloading the profile, adding proofs, etc? &nbsp;Some account changes will lock the Change Microsoft Account option from functioning for 30 days. &nbsp;This is so that if anybody manages to
 reset your password to gain unauthorized access into your account, they won't have the opportunity to further lock you out of your account by changing your email on you, or issuing other changes that might make it difficult for you to log in, and easier for
 them.</p>

                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting subject error since yesterday, I can't open Windows 10 in safe mode, and mouse and keyboard stops working after Windows 10 brings me to repair screen, I did check other mouse and keyboard and it still not working. I did some search and try some
 things like cold reboot 3 times as soon Windows logo appears,&nbsp;and it didn't help.&nbsp;The mouse and keyboard is working when I open BIOS, the lights are on, but as soon the repair tool starts it freezes it, I also tried to reinstall/repair using Windows CD and
 it is not doing anything&nbsp;, I can hear CD running in the drive but it's not starting, doing anything, just getting BSOD, then repair screen and everything freezes.&nbsp;It happened after I installed last update. If there is any solution to this problem, please help.</p>

            Hi,  Greg 
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />Downloading the ISO already comes with the Windows 1809 updates
<br />

<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

</p><p>It's not working at all, I used my son laptop to download ISO earlier to burn the CD, now I just moved a file to the stick, attached the stick to broken PC, pressed ESC to&nbsp;change to booting device, select it , nothing happened, screen just got black with

<p>Any new idea?</p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

            Hi Carol,<br />
<br />
Files that are transferred via Bluetooth are stored in a folder named <strong>Bluetooth
</strong><strong>Exchange </strong><strong>Folder</strong>. You can find the default folder in
<strong>Documents</strong>. If you can't find the Bluetooth Exchange folder, we suggest you to try searching the documents/picture using Search in Start menu. You can also search the file using the search option in the File Explorer. Every time you pair your
 device with Windows, Windows will prompt where to save the received Bluetooth file. You can change the location from there.
<br />
<br />
If you encounter any Bluetooth issues in the future, you can check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>So i have the game pass trial and i wanted to get halo wars definitive edition on my PC. I am able to download and install on the Xbox one but when i view the PC version of the Microsoft app it does not have the popup to download with game pass.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Halo Wars Definitive Edition (PC) store page has the "XBOX Play Anywhere" which means it should be available on all platforms with game pass such as other titles i have tested like "Halo Wars 2".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to play halo wars with a mouse a keyboard and keep the ability to obtain achievements.&nbsp;</p>

Halo Wars: Definitive Edition is an Xbox Play Anywhere game. What does that mean?
</div>
<div>
<p>When you purchase an Xbox Play Anywhere game digitally, it’s yours to play on both Xbox and Windows 10</p>

<p>Hi Luc667,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research on this matter because you should be able to download that game from your PC with the Xbox Game Pass subscription based on how the Xbox Play Anywhere titles work. A friend of mine was able to download Forza Horizon 4 on his PC with the
 Game Pass and he doesn't have an Xbox One. Just to make sure, you are signed into the Xbox app with the account that has the trial correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did come across something unusual in that they have two version of the game on the Microsoft Store, one for Xbox One and the other for PC.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/halo-wars-definitive-edition-pc/9nblggh5wlr0?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/halo-wars-definitive-edition-pc/9nblggh5wlr0?activetab=pivot:overviewtab</a></li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/halo-wars-definitive-edition/bprpqskxtd1l?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/halo-wars-definitive-edition/bprpqskxtd1l?activetab=pivot:overviewtab</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed only the Xbox one version shows it's available for Game Pass. I don't think that's how it's supposed to be listed on the store and I believe that might be&nbsp;a mistake. However, I think the work around for this is to download the Xbox One version
 to your Xbox One and then access the game on your Windows 10 game library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you purchased the game on Xbox and want to play it on Windows 10, sign in on your Windows 10 device. If the game is already installed on your device, it’ll appear in your list of apps; otherwise, you can install it by opening the Store and selecting
<strong>My library</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a try and let us know if it worked.</p>

                    I love this keyboard shortcut that allows me to open the Mobility Center right away. I tried to open it using the regular shortcut (Windows Key+X) but it no longer opens. I could go to the Control Panel to open up the Mobility Center, but when I try the
 keyboard shortcut, it doesn't work. I am thinking a Registry Key got deleted....I'm not sure....

    <title>Xbox was reset and now everything seems to be gone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox was reset and now everything seems to be gone</h2>
                    <p>Seems we have been reset and now all our accounts are gone. All our saved games appear to be gone. Why please someone tell me....Why would we waste any more time and money on another XBox if this is how we are going to be treated. All I want to do is play a silly game and watch a few movies....how hard can it be? I buy your games. I bought your console. I pay for the privilege of access to the internet I already pay for, to&nbsp;be able to play the games I already bought. But all that is gone with all my accounts and my saved game files. Why on earth would you do this?</p>

    <title>Capslock key not working and won&#39;t light up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> godofsmurd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Capslock key not working and won&#39;t light up.</h2>
                    I am trying to get my capslock key to work. I am using Windows 8.1. I have tried uninstalling device drivers, performing a hard restart, and checked ease of access. What's strange is it works when I enable the "on screen keyboard". I can turn it on, and
 it lights up, and works fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am unable to manually press the caps lock key though. Does anyone have any advice?<br />
<br />
It began after leaving my computer on for some time, and I went to log in, and there was MAJOR delay in typing my password in. I finally logged in, and again, major delay when typing in a web URL. After that, I noticed my caps lock key was stuck ON, and restarted
 the computer. Now it's stuck off.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!<br />
<br />
<br />
**Update: I ran a hardware test by pressing F2 while restarting the computer. It's a built-in function with HP laptops. I was able to test every key, except the Capslock key. What's strange is when I depress the keys H + N, or G + B at the same time, it toggles
 the capslock on and off. I'm quite sure there is no dirt or debris under the key. I'm afraid it could be a wiring issue? Could my computer have been affected by something malicious? Could registry entries have been tampered with? I could remap the key perhaps...Very
 strange to me. I have some computer certifications, and can't figure this out for the life of me. I'd like to manually reinstall my keyboard drivers, but am unsure which driver to replace. I have 2 listed under keyboards, one is PS/2 keyboard, other is HID
 keyboard device. Also, on HP's website, I find no keyboard drivers listed under my specific laptop model...The laptop is out-of-warranty, so taking it in for service is probably a bad idea...<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated! I'm quite sure it's a software issue, and not a hardware issue, as the capslock key can be enabled and disabled using the On-screen keyboard, though not certain because depressing certain keys toggles the capslock on and off....&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows crashed after the update on Jan 18th.</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone encountered similar problems with your win 10 yesterday? </p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop had an update yesterday, but it turned blue screen after some time, and it just repeated ran the automatic diagnosing and repairing thing. I tried to enter the safe mode, but it did not work. Also the recovery from a recovery point did not solve
 the problem. Then I turned off the automatic diagnosing, then some error message popped up, saying&nbsp;Acpi.sys in the drivers folder is corrupted or missing (actually it is missing when I used the shell to look at the drivers folder). I managed to copy this file
 from an another win 10 laptop, then&nbsp;Vdrvroot.sys is missing. I replaced it as well, and now the windows update starts again and it is working on updates. But it is extremely slow (about 1 hour for 1%). Not sure how long it takes to finish, and I am indeed
 afraid of an another failure and crush.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any idea with similar problems? Any suggestion will be appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Xiaodi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have caused by a system file corruption. In this case, we will need to wait for the update to finish. In case that the issue happens again after installing the update, we suggest that you perform an in-place upgrade.</p>

</p><p><span>An <strong>in-place upgrade</strong> is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system. Follow the steps given on this forum article created by

            Thanks for your suggestions! Luckily the windows update works and I am able to login again. But sometimes the windows update just automatically leads to blue screen, which can be very frustrating. Hopefully this will never happen again.

<h2>            How do I get rid of ghost circles</h2>
                    <p>There are these two ghost circles that have just appeared on my screen when I was in tablet mode on my Thinkpad X1 Yoga. I tried restarting thinking that they would go away but they haven't. They are there whenever the computer is on and have made my keypad
 useless. Luckily my Thinkpad button still works as a mouse! Also the touch screen is very flakey and will stop working if I touch the screen too much. What should I do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We acknowledge that you're having issues with your device and as we understand your situation, it seems that you're having symptoms of having a ghost touchscreen issue. Ghost touchscreen, also known as phantom touches, happens when you see the laptop screen
 reacting as if it is has been touched with an invisible finger, but in fact, it has not. The cursor moves automatically and prevents you from controlling the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the issue that you're experiencing, there are many factors that can trigger this. Those would be the working conditions while using the device, which means the environment you're currently in while using the device and includes temperature, humidity,
 lights, or other other conditions that interfere with the screen features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible reason is a hardware issue that should be checked by your local technician. The most common reason is improper drivers that should be checked if it's updated and they should be fully compatible with the current version of your operating
 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the issue further, kindly provide the information we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer that could have triggered the issue?</li><li>Have you checked if you have any other pending updates for Windows 10?</li><li>To remove any possibilities of unsuccessful updates, are you using any third-party antivirus programs? If yes, have you tried to disable them and check for necessary updates?</li><li>Have you checked for any updates for your drivers fully compatible with Windows 10 from the device manufacturer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

    <title>If the Future 32-bit Version of Windows Support 64-bit Applications... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickloveless  say:</h3>
<h2>            If the Future 32-bit Version of Windows Support 64-bit Applications...</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I know there are so many tablets based on Intel 64-bit ATOM processors running 32-bit version of Microsoft Windows, limited by the manufacturers, those tablets have very limited system memory (1GB ~ 2GB) and HDD(16GB ~ 32GB). For the special specification
 of Intel ATOM processors, those tablets are only equipped with 32-bit UEFI firmware, no CSM at all. In other words, even though the ATOM processor is 64-bit, but for those devices, no 64-bit software could be used at all, for the whole span of life cycle.
 So I have a question toward Microsoft, will you in the future extend the 32-bit version of Windows to support 64-bit APPs?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got in touch with Microsoft products, when I was a student, and then many computers in our school were running Microsoft DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.x, and since then I have experienced almost all the versions of Microsoft Windows, including 2000 through&nbsp;10.
 &nbsp;And I know there are two versions of kernel in Windows 2000, normal kernel and PAE enabled kernel. So I have a question, if Microsoft provides a second kernel and some system libs for 32-bit Windows 10 to support limited 64-bit APPs might help those devices
 to expose all their potential powers and benefit from Windows and Apps, and even benefits Microsoft too. In 2007, I sold some Apple MacBook computers, and some customers asked me to help them install beta version of Mac OS X 10.5, I occasionally found 32-bit
 kernel could run 64-bit applications on those MacBook computers, which have equipped with only 1GB system memory. The performance is a little bit better than&nbsp;the same configured notebook from SONY&nbsp;running&nbsp;Windows XP Professional x64. &nbsp;Even though today all
 those things passed, and few and few people would love to stick with laptop and desktop. But for the tablets, tiny and easy-to-take, I think the similar situation have already come back to Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for future Microsoft Windows, I know the 32-bit version could be dropped out, so before it's coming. I do suggest Microsoft to develop a interim&nbsp;edition of Windows, hybriding the &nbsp;32-bit kernel and 64-bit applications. And I believe this thing would
 eventually help future 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows to merge together for today's x64 only processor based computers.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. But there are something I have to point out from your viewpoints.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. "<em>Although the CPU may in fact be 64-bit capable, the rest of the system may not be ready to run 64-bit Windows"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the processor is 64-bit, x64, it&nbsp;is already&nbsp;prepared to run 64-bit version of Windows. x64 is different from IA-64, the latter is a revolutionary 64-bit platform. But x64 is essentially an
<strong>extended </strong>64-bit system. I emphasise <strong>extended</strong>, because this 64-bit computing is set up on the IA-32 platform, and extends its computing capability to 64-bit. Even if the firmware is 32-bit UEFI, but a third party loader is able
 to up-stage it onto the 64-bit mode, or down-stage it onto the 16-bit real mode. like what&nbsp;CSM essentially does. This is only the software or firmware level limitation, rather than the rest system may not be ready to run 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. "<em>Apps written for 64-bit systems require the entire operating system&nbsp;along with the hardware to be 64-bit ready. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, those Intel ATOM processors are 64-bit, and it is always true currently. But as you know those tablets are designed to be the clients or Microsoft Windows Store, running Apps primarily. So the wish to allow 64-bit Metro Apps run on the 32-bit platform
 is reasonable, possible and feasible. And this is my suggestion to it. If WoW64 container could allow the 32-bit applications run on 64-bit Windows, why there would not be another kind of container to allow the 32-bit Windows support partial 64-bit metro apps,
 further exploit system resources? This is really meaningless towards the most desktop applications or HPC, but do really something good for mobile devices, such as Windows based Phablets and Phones. I believe you understand the overhead produced by 64-bit
 O/S is quite terrible!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. "<em>Besides, the systems that are sold with an x32-based architecture are limited to 1-2 GB of RAM. Therefore, placing x64 hardware/software is unpractical in this scenario.&nbsp;"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This <strong><em>unpractical in this scenario </em></strong>has already been proven to be practical for Desktop and Laptop computers from Apple, about 8 years ago! And all those computers then were only equipped with 1 or 2GB system memory. This question
 in turn would also judge why Microsoft would love to consume too much system resources for those mobile devices today! if low configured tables or smart phones would work well for iOS and Android, but out of work for Windows, I would think Windows does really
 have something to change!</p>

            What's more, frankly, this is not a discussion, but frequently question, from me and other users who possess 64-bit Intel Atoms based tablets or phablets running Windows 8.1 with Bing, to Microsoft! The advertisement for those tablets and phablets mentioned
 that the stronger 64-bit computing power for those devices, but in fact, no 64-bit applications could run on those devices at all! No matter how cheap those things are, the consumers will not buy it, and it would further set blocks for future Windows based
 tablet or phablet&nbsp;products. Because frankly the consumers find no reason to&nbsp;believe! This is not&nbsp;a casual discussion, &nbsp;but a serious question towards Microsoft through Microsoft community! I love Microsoft and&nbsp;Microsoft Products, but if the community continue
 to make such thing inviolate my benefits, changing my post. I would leave a question to Microsoft that will I have to stick to Microsoft products at all?

            <p>If the tablet is marketed with a true x64-based processor, then x64-bit Windows will be installed. If it's not, the processor in your system is not a true x64-based processor. It may be ARM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also say again that in order to run x64-bit based programs, both the operating system and the hardware must be x64-bit ready. It is not possible to have a "container" like as WoW64 for x32-based systems. It simply would not work. There is a reason
 why x64-based systems produced the overhead they do. The apps are compiled and written for x64-based systems, not x32. You cannot create libraries and APIs for x64-based software to run on x32-based hardware. It simply would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you will never find a&nbsp;<strong>true</strong> x64-bit processor inside a system that does not support more than 1-2 GB of RAM. It would be impractical. In those systems, such as the iPhone, the processor is not a true x64 based processor; rather an
 ARM version.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I thank you for your reply! But take the most economic processor, Intel® Atom™ Processor Z3735E,
<a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/80273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ark.intel.com/products/80273</a>, for example! It is found on large number of Tablets and Phablets computers based on 32-bit&nbsp;Windows 8.1 with Bing. And those tables or phablets are designed for Microsoft
 Windows only! This processor could only support 1GB system memory, but it is real 64-bit processor. But for those Windows Tablets, they are equipped with 32-bit only UEFI, making only 32-bit Windows work! No 64-bit support at all, the computing resources for
 those kind of processors are wasted for the only possible operating system, 32-bit Windows. I've sold computers since 1996, and I would not believe I lack the basic capabilities to separate the sheep from the goats.

            <p>How can I turn my question from discussion to question back? </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"It is not possible to have a "container" like as WoW64 for x32-based systems."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>As is known to us, Windows 2000 provided us two kind of kernels, normal kernel and PAE-enabled kernel, for the latter one, the paging scheme has been changed, extended from 2-level paging&nbsp;extended to 3-level, and the physical addresses also been expanded
 from 32-bit to 64-bit (36-bit in effect), addressing more physical memory than&nbsp;32-bit application could directly access.&nbsp;Today in 32-bit Windows 8.1, it is the only kernel, in other words, PAE must be enabled before it's working. If there would be another
 kind of kernel could bring all the remaining codes onto the compatibility mode and let the entire 32-bit&nbsp;operating system and applications working under IA-32e or Long Mode, the upward support for 64-bit applications is possible. And it has already been proven
 to be possible by Apple for their Mac OS X 10.4.7 through 10.7.5. </p>
<p>
</p><p>WoW64 is a container, a special 64-bit application for 64-bit Windows. It provides a temporary environment for 32-bit applications, and
<em>interpret</em> 32-bit system calls to the native 64-bit system calls. Above WoW64, no 64-bit applications would find it special than others, but within this container, 32-bit applications could share all the resources like what they did in real 32-bit Windows
 before. So if 32-bit applications want to share the 64-bit libs, the WoW64 container must predefined some additional
<em>interpreters,</em> which would further assist this special communication. But this is always using another method, rather than directly 32-bit call to 64-bit libs. Imagine, if an EM64T-enabled kernel supports the entire 32-bit Windows and applications on
 the IA-32e mode (mostly running under compatibility mode), there would be another container such as W64oWEMT, 64-bit Windows on 32-bit&nbsp;EM64T-enabled Windows. It is a special 32-bit application, it provides a temporary&nbsp;environment for 64-bit applications. It
 interprets 64-bit system calls to the 32-bit native or enhanced system calls. Like WoW64,&nbsp;64-bit applications running under W64oWEMT does not need to share 32-bit application libs. Because&nbsp;both 64-bit mode and compatibility mode are parts of IA-32e mode, so
 the mode-switch found on Intel 64 processor would not provide over much&nbsp;overhead, and limited physical memory addressing only to 4GB, there would be&nbsp;almost no differences comparing with running within protected mode even though the paging scheme has been extended
 onto 4-levels. If most time 32-bit applications are the only ones running, then it would be no different. And the overhead for the 64-bit applications only happen to appear&nbsp;when 64-bit applications&nbsp;are about working. This mean could make the resource cost
 at the most economic way, especially for mobile devices. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have to say that this is completely an upside-down implementation! W64oWEMT is a virtual container, in fact, 64-bit applications are running natively! But there is an invisible container provided by EM64T-enabled kernel, which enable not only the
 32-bit applications but also the 32-bit devices drivers, kernel extensions and all the remaining&nbsp;system codes running within compatibility mode. Especially the interrupt handlers should be indirectly running under compatibility mode rather than 64-bit mode,
 so this kind of idea might be resemble to the third 64-bit edition of Windows XP, beside 64-bit(Itanium) and x64, abandoned by Microsoft&nbsp;more than a decade ago. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Someone changed my question into discussion, so this time I change the content of its title.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As more and more modern computers are only equipped with 64-bit EFI with or without CSM modular. 64-bit Windows have already dominated personal computer market. leaving the room for the 32-bit Windows narrower and narrower. If in the future, CSM modular
 is not provided, then there would be no chance to install 32-bit Windows at all! Then many developers would attempt to drop future versions of 32-bit Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in my opinion, the future 32-bit version&nbsp;Windows should evolve into legacy version of Windows, which provided maximum support for legacy products, or in other words, for still capable old computers and thin computing devices. So many people&nbsp;are still
 using Windows XP right now, even though it had already reached the&nbsp;end of support last year, but it is still&nbsp;a mainstream Operating System. The most reasons for that might be the computers which&nbsp;is still&nbsp;running is incapable to run Windows 10 properly, maybe
 for its limited GPU capabilities, or for its 64-bit processor could not&nbsp;64-bit Windows at all. So for those reasons to keep the 32-bit version of Windows&nbsp;as the same level with 64-bit version of&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;seems to be meaningless.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple provides <em>Boot Camp</em> help Windows users to migrate into Mac OS X eventually, even though many Apple users also migrate into Windows with the help of
<em>Boot Camp</em> too. So the future legacy version of Windows should also help Windows XP users or users stick into old computers to migrate to the latest 64-bit version of Windows too, rather than provides another 32-bit version of 64-bit Windows, like it
 in today's Windows 10. So the requirements towards this legacy version of Windows should be comparably lower than today's 32-bit version of Windows 10, and it also needs to support 64-bit application for 64-bit processors besides 32-bit only applications for
 32-/64-bit processors. This would help the old 64-bit processors from AMD could also benefits from this legacy version of Windows. When users are interested with thing they are grasping, they would find ways to persuade themselves to buy new computers with
 new 64-bit version of Windows. And on the other hand, like the words I said above, this legacy version of Windows also made those tablets usable at maximum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in my opinion, there would need&nbsp;four editions for future Windows products,
<em><strong>Windows</strong></em>, <strong><em>Windows Mobile</em></strong>, <strong>
<em>Windows Legacy</em></strong> and <strong><em>Windows Servers</em></strong>, and there is no separate edition for different architectures.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 desktop icons, start screen apps disappeared. Can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holynub  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 desktop icons, start screen apps disappeared. Can&#39;t right click start button.</h2>
                    All my desktop icons are gone except for the recycle bin. I can't right click on my start button to pull up the menu but I can left click on it and it brings me to the start screen fine. My start screen doesn't show any apps or the desktop return app.
 Have to hit the windows key to return to the desktop. It does show the user account and power option in the start screen in the upper right of the screen.
<p>
</p><p>So I did a safe mode boot and it seems all the icons and start screen menu works properly. (Not sure where to go from there)</p>
<p>I tried a clean boot and didn't seem to do anything and was still having all my missing icon problems.</p>
<p>I tried disabling all/certain in msconfig services and taskmanager startups for the clean boot and nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So quickly this is what I did before and after I had this problem.</p>
<p>Before everything worked fine. I pulled the hard drive out of the computer and plugged it into my other PC "via SATA into motherboard" to transfer some files over easier. Only transferred files like pictures and video clips to the user account video and
 picture folders. Got that done and then put it back in the original computer and then started having all these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I transferred the files and put the hard drive back into the original case. I booted up and windows seemed fine at first. I clicked firefox on the taskbar and then it said something like "this program is already in use". After that I decided to do
 a reboot and got back into windows and that's when all the icons went blank like I explained above.</p>

<h2>            Automatic Repair Loop in Windows 10 pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I've recently updated to windows 10 from windows 7. Everything was working fine until I had a power failure and my computer switched off incorrectly. Ever since then I've been stuck in the automatic repair loop. I've tried almost everything including
 trying to disable the automatic repair boot up using the command prompt (bcdedit). I've tried using all the tools that automatic repair comes with and none of them seem to fix the problem or sometimes those tools don't even work. I've tried booting up into
 safe mode and still nothing. I've also tried checking to see if in the boot priority list if windows boot manager was the first on the list and it was not. &nbsp;It gives a message about E:\Windows\system32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt . So I used the command prompt
 and opened that file and this is what it had :&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to use command prompt in the automatic repair troubleshoot menu. Using this I tried to start the computer in safe mode but when it restarts it goes back into the loop. The exe you want me to run is the restore program. I've already tried using
 that program but it says no restore points were created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows 10 on my lap top is locked into a continuous loop at start up and will not let me get into the safe mode window. It asked for me to sign in then immediately starts the Automatic Repair loop.</p>
<p>I tried all methods of repair and none of them work.</p>
<p>I used the guid command prompt method also on c:\windows\system32\config all the way to Backup and backup&gt;dir and backup&gt; regback until the end of fall commands and nothing.</p>

            Check BIOS SATA settings.&nbsp; If they have defaulted to a different setting, i.e. RAID instead of AHCA or ATA, that was my problem and it booted normally without any loss or damage.

<h2>            Windows 10 Safe Mode - Surface Book 2 is Bricked and Stuck in Loop</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Book 2 running Windows 10. It is completely bricked at the moment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some files that Edge corrupted when it downloaded them, but will not let me delete. So I quickly looked online and it suggested that I go to systems configuration and reboot in safe mode (so I could delete them). Unfortunately, I did not select safe
 mode with networking. Now I am stuck in a vicious loop where I cannot authenticate into Windows because it cannot accept my password (because of the lack of networking). This password is the same for my windows live account, so it cannot authenticate without
 networking. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the shift key to reboot my surface book into the special menu and told it to reboot into safe mode + networking (F5), but it is still stuck in the safe mode + without networking. If I attempt a restore, repair, and or any other way to get out
 of this safe mode, it defaults into asking for my windows password...continuing my vicious loop. Every option I have tried on my surface book 2 (command prompt, restore, repair) will ask for authentication and continue the loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a recovery Windows 10 recovery&nbsp;USB, but would this help? I have an old surface book pro 4, but my concern is that the USB recovery drive that I would create on that surface 4&nbsp;would harm my surface book 2 if I attempted a restore off of it (driver
 differences/etc). Is there anyway I can use this USB recovery drive to get into a command prompt though and run the msconfig command and get back into Windows 10 proper on surface book 2?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, what is the best way forward for me to get out of the vicious loop above? I'm losing a lot of productivity by having this surface book 2 bricked. Any suggestions, tips, comments that can be offered to get me out of this issue would be greatly
 appreciated. </p>

<p>Hi hlyates,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm here to help. Let's find options on how we can fix your Windows 10 boot issue. Since you have a working Surface Book Pro 4, we can use that to create a recovery image for your Surface Book 2.&nbsp; You just need to download the correct recovery image for
 your device. You can get it from <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Under
<strong>Select your Surface device</strong>, select <strong>Surface Book 2</strong> for Product and then type in your device serial number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we have the recovery image that we need, you may now create a recovery Windows 10 recovery&nbsp;USB Flash drive/ Follow the video in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know how. You can use this to access the Windows Recovery environment to troubleshoot
 or if you would like to reset your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Genius idea for Halo &#40;ALL Halo fans read&#41; </h2>
                    
<p>This wouldnt go under this subject, but I have a very good idea for all true XBOX fans. I believe that Microsoft should develop a double pack for the original 2 Halo's so all real XBOX fans can play the original 2 Halo's and still be on &nbsp;XBOX Live AND play
 online with other people. I just thought that maybe if I had started a blog on this and many people might have agreed with the idea, Microsoft really could consider the idea and it could happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I want all XBOX fans to comment on this blog and tell me what you think about the idea and maybe Microsoft will see the post. I also believe it is smart for Microsoft because I'm sure that it would get a lot of
 sales and could make Microsoft a couple extra million dollars. Thank you guys!</p>

<p>well i've all way's have hated halo mainly because it's a strange spacey game so i've only ever played halo wars which i hated but i downloaded the halo reach demo and i liked it so your idea sounds cool and if after microsoft have fix the currant problems
 they could do a free 1 week demo but do it so that players can play with people with the full game or with demo players and have most of the different options on the full game it might get more people like me buying the games</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I'm glad to see that some people like my idea. And yeah that is a really good idea. That is really genius. Good thinking. Thanks for saying that, because I meant to put that if you have any ideas say them. I'm hoping Microsoft does
 this. I've e-mailed them and everything and the guy replied and said that it is a great idea and that they'll present the idea to some big part of the company. And if you can help, please try to spread the word around about the idea. Like around this website
 and on XBOX Live. I dont know much about this website, so if you could help. it would be appreciated. Thank you michael008ja. &nbsp;You don't have to help, but if you would like this to happen, it would very much help to spread the word around.</p>

<p>I loved halo until reach, such a disappointment. but Halo: CE was the reason i bought the xbox and i think it would be a good idea but halo: CE had no online, only LAN, halo 2 was a reason i got live, and i played it until halo 3, but bungie shut the servers
 down to halo 2, and forever lost.</p>

<p>the problem with your idea? microsoft only allowed a remake of halo CE because its the 10 year anniversary. halo 2 came out back in 2004? 2005? &nbsp;i think? correct me if i'm wrong so i can get the correct date. which means we're still a few years away from
 getting a halo 2 remake. i sure wouldn't complain tho if they remade it sooner rather than later</p>

<p>I posted the same subject in the old forums. I don't see how releasing a double pack of the first two Halos would not generate a large sum of money for M$. Great idea, I know I would buy it.</p>

<p>Well if CE Anniversary sells 343 might consider making a Halo 2 remake. The thing is they would need to test multiplayer repeatedly and judging from this standpoint they would probably just have Single Player with Halo 4 multiplayer tacked on.

<p>I know Halo 2 is on the computer and still playable(You even appear online on Xbox Live when you play it). You can get a adapter to use your 360 controller on the PC.
</p>
<p>But, as other said they won't come up with a remastered Halo 2 until the 10 year anniversary.

            Hi, 
<br />I may say this information is useless for end user. MTBF is statistical value, It has no meaning relating to single devise and cannot be used to forecast the certain device lifetime. Some companies now point this in documentation obviously.

            I suppose it is better to send a paper mail to Microsoft with this question. However, I think there will be no a MTBF number in answer. But at least you'll may show this answer to a customer.

    <title>Option to disable Thumbnail Preview of windows on taskbar in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgesgibson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Option to disable Thumbnail Preview of windows on taskbar in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Can I change this?</p>
<p>Just for the record, I'm not super tech-savvy.</p>
<p>So I have Windows 10 and when I have multiple windows open on the task bar and my mouse lands on any of the windows, a little mini view of the window will pop up. I absolutely hate this because the dang thing won't go away until I click one of the windows
 (clicking on the screen I'm on does nothing, it has to be a mini window.) I have a lot of windows open sometimes and usually I end up clicking the one I am not on. Plus it is very distracting when I'm trying to concentrate on my task and have to divert my
 attention to getting rid of the stupid thing. I've been through the settings but didn't see any obvious way to disable that feature. I'm not even sure it is possible to do, but I hate it so much that I thought I'd ask.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p />
