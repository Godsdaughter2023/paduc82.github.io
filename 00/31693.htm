<h2>            Windows 7 Minimize Bug</h2>
                    Since I bought a brand new Windows 7 laptop a few years ago I have had a constant problem with a bug that minimizes everything, this seems to be the most common bug in windows 7 and no one seems to know how to fix it! I cannot watch a film, a you tube
 video, play a game or do anything without it minimizing every 10 minutes, after a couple of years of this I have had enough, I paid a lot of money for windows 7 and it has never worked, and I get referred to your answer desk, but they never ever answer, I
 have seriously tried calling the answer desk online for entire months at a time, they Never answer, please help, it is your responsibility to have windows working, I paid a lot of money for a product that never worked. I am getting sick of all your staff just
 passing me around the system with no help, this is a major flaw in your operating system, fix it or give all windows 7 buyers our money back!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are sorry for the inconvenience caused when you contacted us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to your computer ever?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:<br />
Step 1:<br />
Start your computer in safe mode and check.</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue does not persist in safe mode then perform clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does not help, then use method 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Run an online scan<br />
<strong>Run Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<br />
I never had this issue, and nobody I know ever had this issue, never heard of this issue, so how do you know it's a bug?<br />

            I guess I will have to try the scan because I tried several times to do a clean boot and the application that runs the clean boot always freezes on the last step.

            <p>Hi, I tried the safety scanner which took nine and a half hours and told me my entire system was clean with not even one infected file.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just finally managed to get into Safe Mode, my laptop his quite well how to do it, and I tried running film files in windows media player as this is where this minimize bug started, and everytime I tried to open a film file in windows media player I got
 the following error "Server execution failed" however the film files had no problem playing in other media players!
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also tried to test gameplay in safemode as the bug started extending itself to minimizing games too, but cannot test this in safe mode as because the soundcard is shut down in safe mode it will not open games, get the following error "Requires a sound
 card in order to run"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So now I will try your final solution, I hope this works as I am loosing tremendous work time doing all this, and it is costing me a fortune and stressing me out"</p>

            <p>Right, I just now ran the system file checker, I took a screenshot of the report but your system here keeps failing to load up the screenshot, so I will have to write out what it says.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did not pay good money on a pc to spend years with a faulty system and months on end trying to fix a microsoft error, I am getting really sick of this!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The report says;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p>Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logos\CBS\CBS.log. For example</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So now what?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p>The network issues in Windows Live Mail may result in send/ receive and synchronization errors such as 0x80048820, 0x80070057, 0x80072EFF or 0x80048849. These network issues may occur due to one of the following reasons:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You were not connected to the Internet when you tried to synchronize your account
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mail server that you are attempting to send or receive data from may not be available</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DNS may have incorrect cached data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The MTU setting on the mail client is larger than the MTU settings configured on network devices between your mail client and the mail servers
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You were not connected to the Internet when you tried to synchronize your account
</p>

<h2>            BOOTMGR is missing</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to swap HD drives in my Lenovo x230. &nbsp;Migration to new HDD in same PC. &nbsp;I have a 4GB USB drive, single partition on it marked in DISKPART as Active with an .ISO of MS windows 7 64 bit. I pulled the old drive, inserted the new drive and now all
 I get is BOOTMGR is missing when I power up, checked the boot order in BIOS and all looks OK. Any ideas guys?</div>
                </div>

            <p>How to repair and reboot to Windows 7:</p>
<p><br />
a) Insert the Windows 7 System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot.</p>
<p><br />
If you do not have access to either disc: ISO download with SP1 included<br />
<a href="http://techdows.com/2011/07/download-windows-7-integrated-with-sp1-iso-official-direct-download-links.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techdows.com/2011/07/download-windows-7-integrated-with-sp1-iso-official-direct-download-links.html</a></p>
<p><br />
Create a Bootable Windows 7 DVD using the .ISO file<br />
Burning a Windows 7 ISO File on a DVD<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/977640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/977640</a></p>
<p><br />
b) Select the correct keyboard input method and click ‘Next’.</p>
<p><br />
Note: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the display.
</p>
<p><br />
c) The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that “Windows found problems with your computer’s startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?”
</p>
<p><br />
d) Click ‘Repair and restart’ and reboot again to the Windows 7 System Repair environment.
</p>
<p><br />
e) Click ‘Next’ at the keyboard selection prompt and when the ‘System Recovery Options’ screen appears verify that the “Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows” is selected.
</p>
<p><br />
Note: On a Dual Boot system there may be only one operating system listed if you have removed one of the two versions of Windows 7. Click the ‘Next’ button.</p>
<p><br />
f) Now from the menu list select the ‘Command Prompt’ option.</p>
<p><br />
g) At the DOS prompt type the following four commands:</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixmbr</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixboot (may return an 'Eliment not found' message)</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /ScanOs&nbsp; (Optional)<br />
The /ScanOs option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7.<br />
Additionally, this option displays the entries that are currently not in the BCD store.
<br />
Use this option when there are Windows Vista or Windows 7 installations that the Boot Manager menu does not list.</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /RebuildBcd</p>
<p><br />
h) Close the command prompt window and click the ‘Startup Repair’ option. </p>
<p><br />
i) The repair process may take some time, so wait until the process completes at which point you will see two messages
</p>
<p><br />
“Windows cannot repair this computer automatically” and “Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically”.</p>
<p><br />
These messages are the result of the radical changes made by removing the other drive. Ignore the Send/Don’t send options.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Please perform step j as detailed below, startup repair must be run multiple times (At least 3 times).</p>
<p><br />
J) Close this message window by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the Send/Don’t send window. Next click on the ‘View advanced options for system recovery and support’ option and from the main menu once again click ‘Startup Repair’. This time the
 repair process may only that a few seconds and when prompted “Startup Repair could not detect a problem”, click ‘Finish’&nbsp; and run the ‘Startup Repair’ option one more time, click ‘Finish’, and then remove the System Repair DVD and click ‘Restart’.&nbsp; Reboot
 the computer.</p>

            J-Dub,
<div>Thanks for the info, after reading the first few steps it occurred to me that all I did was cut and paste the Wins 7 ISO to my FDD which may not have packaged it correctly for install. &nbsp;Therefore I just went to DVD route and used the Burn ISO utility in
 Wins 7 on my other laptop. &nbsp;plugged in the DVD and its going well now, checking memory at the install screen which looks all good.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm guessing I therefore dont need to to go crazy with cmd instructions right? &nbsp;It was likely an issue with the way I put my ISO on the FCC before I went to DVD and burned correctly. &nbsp;Thoughts?</div>
<div>Thanks a million!</div>

            <p>That it, the .iso itself can't install Windows, you need to burn to a DVD (as you did) or create a bootable USB drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you know soon enought as when the install completes you should be able to boot.</p>

                    <p>My laptop (Lenovo S410) frequently appears Blue Screen with CODE "FAST ERESOUCE PRECONDITION VIOLATION". After rebooting, the laptop can work again, but the Blue Screen may appear by accident again and again... I have re-installed the OS, it does not help.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br /> 
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />Do you would try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />First, try to reboot your modem and then see if that works. 
<br />If not  try the following steps:
<br />
<br />1. Run the Network troubleshooter followed by networking commands  
<br />2. Update the network adapter driver  
<br />3. Roll back the network adapter driver  
<br />4. Temporarily turn off firewalls  
<br />3. Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software  
<br />5. Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart  
<br />6. Use network reset to reinstall network devices
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections Troubleshooter  
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter  
<br /> 
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there

            <p>K. You've updated the BIOS. Did you reconfigure the BIOS settings after?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would turn it off, remove the CPU clean it then reapply thermal paste then reinstall it</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you touch the CPU while it's installed does it feel hot? What temp is the BIOS showing for the CPU?</p>

            <p>Sorry for the long reply. I just replaced the thermal paste a few days ago and it seemed to help. But now I have a new issue. My CPU is running at 40 degrees with nothing open and goes up to 50 with a game running. Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>These are the new crashes I have had. They have been occurring when I was just surfing the Internet. Neither Chrome or IE are not working well.</p>

            Are you trying to send messages or log in? If your account has been sending too many messages it can be stopped for suspected spam. If you feel it was your brother I would recommend changing your password and adding two step verification to prevent him
 from using it. Your account is your responsibility at all times.

<h2>            Windows 10 fails to boot properly</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 on my Hp Pavilion d7 laptop. &nbsp;It worked fine at first, however, after restarting the computer a day later I have not been able to get past the sign-in screen. &nbsp;I am able to restart, shutdown, adjust accessibility settings, and
 view wifi, but there is no way to login and interact with the desktop. &nbsp;I have tried restarting the computer in Safe Mode (shift + restart), but it will not work either. &nbsp;It only restarts the computer again. &nbsp;I have also tried testing the memory modules (2x4gb)
 but each appears to be working. &nbsp;Please advise on watch to try next. &nbsp;If I'd known installing Windows 10 was going to render my computer useless, I wouldn't have done it. &nbsp;Thank you for any assistance you may be able to provide.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your assistance.&nbsp; Let me try to explain the steps that I went through to try to fix the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>It was not able to boot in Safe Mode, as I was never able to get past the login screen, and my attempts to manually boot in safe mode from this screen were unsuccessful.</li><li>I tried to do a Startup Repair, however, I was received a message indicated Startup Repair could not be completed successfully.</li><li>I went ahead and performed a system reset.&nbsp; I had not had a chance to backup my files, so I elected to "Keep my files"
<ul>
<li>This actually worked and I was able to boot and use for computer for about 2 days before a new error occurred.</li><li>This time when booting the computer would not get passed the screen with the Windows symbol (in blue) and a spinning circle of dots.</li></ul>
</li><li>I set forth to perform another system reset.&nbsp; This time, it wouldn't complete the reset.&nbsp; After several hours I had to perform a forced shutdown.</li><li>At this time, I went through the lengthy process of trying to backup my files.&nbsp; This is now completed.</li><li>This morning, I tried one more time to do a System reset without saving my files.
<ul>
<li>This didn't work either.&nbsp; It seems that I have several "volumes" on my hard drive.&nbsp; It simply stated that the "reset could not be completed"</li></ul>
</li><li>It seems at this point my only option is to complete a "Clean Install"
<ul>
<li>My concerns with this are that I am not able to retrieve the product key (I have the original Windows 7 key)</li><li>I have a partitioned hard drive with HP recovery tools installed.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this is important to have, however, it did come in handy when trying to recover my files.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>So at this point, I am stumped as what to do next.&nbsp; Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Clean Install Windows 10</a> and it should reactivate.&nbsp; With HP I would delete all partitions except OEM tools (bootable Diagnostics via ESC key) and Recovery which both should still run after Clean Install via their hotkeys.&nbsp; After deleting all other partitions
 into Unallocated Space using the Drive Options on "Where do you want to install Windows?" screen, highlight Unallocated Space and click Next to begin install.&nbsp;

Clean Reinstall Windows 7</a> with the Product Key on the COA sticker (not the key which was read from the factory install using a keyfinder which will not work for reinstall), then run the Upgrade again.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If Recovery will boot from F11 then look for Minimal Recovery option which is nearly the same as a Clean Reinstall.&nbsp; The problems you're experiencing with Upgrade almost certainly are due to the HP Factory install which is the worst in the industry, larded
 with bloatware and duplicate utilities that interfere with better versions built into Windows.&nbsp; These cause the update to choke and create endless issues.&nbsp;

<h2>            Code &#40;0xc0000005&#41;</h2>
                    I am Simply trying to play a great classic game known as "Age of Empires II" and it's expansion "The Conquerors" and for some reason when I activate the game, I literally get no reaction........ The icon lights up then fades back to translucent on my start
 bar after I click it to load the game. I got that code after I decided to open the setup from the CD and selected Web Connection. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it and restart the computer, nothing works. It isn't the code that I care about, I just want
 to play my game. Can some one help me, please.

<p>Hi Zell</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling my skype app but I still can't access echo call testing. The call just gets dropped with the "line busy" message. I had a problem connecting about 2 weeks ago just after it upgraded itself. I got no video and all
 kinds of strange static on the voice channel. He managed to see me a few times but mostly we just got unobtainable in both directions. Since then I've managed to make a normal voice and vid call but that was too weeks ago and now its all gone strange again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost all my contacts by the way. I can go and find them all again using another phone book. But really, I'm too upset to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">If you choose the option “<b><i>Obtain the IP address automatically</i></b>”, then you are choosing the Dynamic IP address and on the other hand, when you choose to enter it manually, then you are choosing Static IP address
 for the computer. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>As the name implies, Dynamic IP addresses are temporary IP addresses which changes each time the computer access the Internet whereas, the Static IP address does not change over time unless it is changed manually by the
 user. </font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The dynamic addresses are actually borrowed from a pool of IP addresses that are shared among various computers and is very commonly used by most Internet Service Providers. Here, the automatic IP address assigning is done
 by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). The Static IP address will be provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and that will be the permanent for your computer, unless you change it in the future. This type of address is generally used for
 the use of VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), online gaming, or any other purpose where users need to make it easy for other computers to locate and connect to them.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>People may think that the Dynamic IP address is more secure than the Static, as it changes with each session on the network and it becomes difficult for the hackers to find the computer. In contrast, a static IP address
 can become a security risk, because here the address is always the same and it is easier to track the computer for data mining purposes or someone who is really determined to find your computer and cause damage to it has a better chance of doing so or has
 more time to work on getting past your security. But, according to me, the type of IP address assigned has nothing to do with the security of the computer when you have a good security program or a firewall installed on it.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>So, no matter what you use - a Dynamic IP address or a Static IP address, following safe Internet practices and using a good and updated security program on the computer keep your computer secure and protected from the Internet
 threats.</font></font></font></p>

            <p>Static or dynamic addressing has little implications for security. The initial stage of the connection is the wireless security authentication which sets up the encrypted link between your computer and the wireless base station. Only once that secure connection
 has been established is TCP/IP traffic initiated. If the WiFi security is broken almost every data packet contains the IP address in the header and makes no difference whether that address has been assigned or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that your DHCP&nbsp;address is assigned by your ISP, most often it originates from the network of the WiFi base station and in the majority of domestic networks the router itself. Also in those home networks the DNS server is the router as
 well. The router accepts requests from the client PC and it is the router that actually makes the request to the internet DNS server and relays the response back to the client but at this level the security is primarily the point to point nature of the connection,
 only the WiFi link is encrypted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main different network type is what is labelled public and on a public network the services which your PC advertises as available to devices on the LOCAL network are very limited. With proper firewall security nothing on the local network is accessible
 from outside anyway. The sort of locations you should really use the public option is cafés, libraries etc., inside your own home network you should know what devices are in use.</p>

 since then. The one that won't run that baffles me is microsoft office for 2003; autoplay doesn't recognize it. In fact, when I go to "computer", it doesn't show that anything is being read in the disk drive. I have updated driver per computer. Could it be
 something is wrong with my drive? It works on some disks....on computer it is called HL-DT-DVD-RAM GSA-H22L ATA. Device. Disk plays on other computer and is not scratched.&nbsp; Some other CD's and Software previously played on windows 7 won't run either, but some
 will.&nbsp; Autofix says files aren't recognized, but they should be.&nbsp; Is driver corrupt? I am using driver that came with windows 7 for cd-rom.&nbsp; This is a custom built computer.

            <p>This issue may occur if the "Deny logon locally" policy is set on your computer.</p>
<p>Go to Local Security Policy. <br />
Go to Security Settings<br />
Local Policies<br />
User Right Assignment<br />
<br />
Find the Deny Logon Locally. Remove users that can't logon. <br />
However, do not add the Everyone group as then no one would be able to log on locally.
<br />
You will need to log off and log back on for this to take effect. <br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Networking issue - Error&#58; 0x80070426</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am having trouble using the network and sharing center in windows 7 Proffessional.<br />
The network icon in the notification area has a red cross in it and says that no connections are available.<br />
if i select "Troubleshoot" from the icon, it opens a window with the following details:<br />
<br />
<br />
An error occurred while troubleshooting<br />
<br />
A problem is preventing the troubleshooter from starting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Package ID: Unknown<br />
Path: C:\Windows\diagnostics\system\networking<br />
Error code: 0x80070426<br />
Source: Engine<br />
User: Kris-PC\Kris<br />
Context: Elevated<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with my home network, and i am still connected to the internet with no issues on the effected computer. (i am using it now...)<br />
However, it is preventing me from viewing any other computers on the network and using the network and sharing center.<br />
I have tried accessing the troubleshooters via the control panel however none of them work (either networking or other troubleshooters) as they all get the same error.<br />
<br />
The network and sharing center says "Unknown" instead of showing a network, and instead of showing the network tree (computer, router, internet) it says "The dependency service or group failed to start."<br />
<br />
I have not recently installed anything out of the ordinary on the machine and it was working perfectly fine last night. I only re installed Win7 2 days ago due to the OS becoming corrupt as my system went to sleep mode and turned off 1 of my HDD's (Im running
 RAID 0 and have corrected this issue this time around by changing the power settings)<br />
<br />
I have removed all overclocks and updated network drivers. although it is mainly only noticeable by the networking issues that have surfaced, i don't think it is directly caused by a networking issue as none of the troubleshooters in the control panel are working,
 and it appears that it is a service that is failing.<br />
My computer is still visable to other computers in the network and all shared drives/folders are accessable, however i am unable to connect to any other computers on the network even from Run (Or search... Whatever you want to call it in win 7...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity i ran a scan on my HDD's to confirm that they are not faulty. They passed a full scan with HDTune.<br />
<br />
I have also noticed that the Network Location Awareness service is not running (the only service set to automatic that is not running) and when i tried to start it i got the following error:<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows could not start the Network Location Awareness service on the Local Computer.<br />
<br />
Error 1053: The service did not respond to start the control request in a timely fashion.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am pretty much out of ideas and am considering just re-imaging the machine. Thankfully i created a restore partition shortly after installing Windows and updating the system/loading basic software ect...<br />
However i would prefer not to.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas please let me know, otherwise i guess i'll just re-im.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Win 7 BSOD, MEMORY_MANAGMENT, caused by driver&#58; ntoskrnl.exe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last few days/weeks I have had several BSOD. The first few I didn't take serious at all. I don't know what the reason is. I am tending towards the&nbsp;memory being corrupt. I reinstalled windows, after reading that there might be a problem. Formated the hard
 drive and this morning it happened again. Also windows is not installing certain updates (ex. KB976002)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded BlueScreenView to view the dmp file that has been created, and it mentioned the crash was caused by ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have researched various problems and solutions. I want to make sure what the problem is before buying new hardware.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I have been unsuccesful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---Not sure if the question is in the right place?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best thing to do is <a href="http://www.mypchealth.co.uk/GuideTests.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">run a memory test</a>. See if it the memory is faulty or not. If the memory appears to be ok, then it is also worth running a harddrive test as the computer can use the hard disk as
 virtual memory.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Please wait while browsing history is deleted&#34; pop up</h2>
                    <p>I was having some issues with my Dell Inspiron 15-5555 touch screen laptop running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Dell website to try get help and installed Dell System Detect which is a program that automatically finds the information for any Dell laptop so you don't have to enter a service tag or anything like that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up requesting to start a chat session with a support tech from Dell and had to install Dell Support Assist and Dell Support Assist Agent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While chatting with a tech from Dell, he set me up with GoToAssist Corporate so he could control my laptop and installed Dell Click 2 Fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all of this, while ruining tests on my laptop, I got a pop up that said "please wait while browsing history is deleted" and had a progress bar. I closed out of the pop up thinking it was from one of the programs the Dell support tech was using because
 I did not want to have my browsing history deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few minutes before I posted this, I got another "please wait while browsing history is deleted" pop up so I uninstalled Dell Click 2 Fix thinking that was the issue and haven't seen another pop up yet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm just curious if anyone knows what might have been causing the pop ups so I can avoid them in the future?</p>
