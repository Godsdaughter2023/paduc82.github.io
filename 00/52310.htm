    <title>Fable Legends NDA still valid&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord vandekieft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fable Legends NDA still valid&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I was in the Fable Legends Alpha and beta, but there was a strict NDA, and now that the game has been canceled and LionHead shut down.</p>
<p><strong>Is the NDA still valid? Could we get in trouble for sharing information on the game?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;I cant seem to find any answers. All the old fable legends and lionhead studio sites redirect to Xbox.com</p>

<p><span><span>I appreciate your efforts. I will surely help you. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to pull the Battery out and reinsert after few seconds (on devices where&nbsp;that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from the phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I open a picture on my desktop</h2>
                    When I click on a picture I've saved to my desktop it won't open. I have to right click and choose another program other than my default Windows Photo Gallery. I never had to do this in the past. I could just click the pic and it would open.

Maybe the following file association fixes would be useful:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before editing the registry)<br />
<br />
File association fixes for Windows Vista<br />

<br />
(the fix for Folder and the fix for JPG may be worth a try)<br />

Good luck...<br />

<p>I used EaseUS ToDo Backup and cloned the old HDD to the new SSD.&nbsp; You need to have some hardware and cables to attache the SSD to the computers USB port.</p>
<p>By cloning you get all if the stuff moved then all you have to do is to replace the HDD with the SSD.</p>
<p>You may have to have some other stuff if the drives are not the same size.&nbsp; Check with HP.</p>
<p>I have Lenovo laptops. 8 here in the house.&nbsp; Most are used with the Microsoft Insider testing.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Best Free Cloning software is Macrium Reflect. A Clone is the exact copy of the other drive. You can make one to the same size or larger disk - SSD. Hybrid, or conventional hard drive.<br />
<br />
Macrium Reflect - Free<br />

<p>Seems extreme for a minor flaw..Either way,Windows 10 requires special software/drivers for SSD,&amp; the MB storage controller.If you run Intel based hardware,foolow the link.</p>

<p>
</p><p>edit the 3 tabs for more options,plus as Intel says,after the OS installation,the Chipset software/driver should be 1st,then Storage controller software/driver..</p>

            Looking at the size of your current C:\ drive It would seem that you need to use Disk Cleanup and get rid of some garbage.&nbsp; Make sure that you click to clean up the System part of your drive.&nbsp; Also you might think about moving some of the Data files off
 to another drive.&nbsp; I have a 500 GB SSD and the C:\ partition is using only 61 GB of the 183 GB that it has.<br />

            Hi Abdullah , you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

&gt; hi, i'm an italian guy with an american laptop. i need to know how <br />
&gt; to type accented letters (for example "é") from this USA keybord. my <br />
&gt; windows 7 is home edition.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's more than one way to do this, but the one I think is far and <br />
away the best is AllChars. I use a little freeware background program <br />
called AllChars. This lets me (in all applications, type many common <br />
special characters (many of these are used in other languages) by <br />
pressing the ctrl key followed by a two character mnemonic <br />
combination.<br />
<br />
For example, for ñ the two characters are ~ and n. For ç it's c and , <br />
For ü it's u and "<br />
<br />
Go to http://allchars.zwolnet.com/<br />

    <title>unable to lock tiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arizona willie  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to lock tiles</h2>
                    <p>Please please please, tell the powers that be that we desperately need a way to lock tiles in place on the Start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is incredibly frustrating to move a tile into a group and have tiles scatter all around according to some arcane rules that remain known only to the high priests at Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I have a group I want them to stay where I darn well put them, and when I move a new tile into the group, the existing tiles should retain their present position, unless I unlock the group. Actually, locking individual tiles would probably be even better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what we have now is pure chaos.</p>

            <p>Expand to the right, just like it does now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I add a tile to an existing group ... the group gets larger by expanding to the right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding a tile shouldn't be a problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, they could go the route of locking the entire group and then if you want to add a tile you have to unlock it and then re-arrange them to suit yourself again and then lock the group again. If they didn't like locking individual tiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the existing system is very aggravating. You get things set just the way you want them and then if you add another tile everything moves around all over the group, or screen if you don't have groups. And then you have to fight&nbsp;( sometimes ) to get the
 tiles back exactly where YOU want them and not the programmers rules.</p>

<p>Shawn, </p>
<p>Thanks for answering.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;A.M. was typical:&nbsp; of 37 tiles in Main group, about 20 were scrambled/moved after boot, leaving 4 holes,&nbsp;&amp; some were moved long distances on the screen.&nbsp; I can't make sense out of this; &nbsp;it seems random.</p>
<p>It's certainly a waste of time to repeatedly hunt for tiles I frequently use and&nbsp;rearrange them ... only to have my desktop trashed during&nbsp;morning power up or at other times during the day.</p>
<p>This is definitely Not like a desktop icon ... I'm still running 2 XP machines with icons aligned to grid and NOT auto-arranged.&nbsp; They stay where I put them ... for years.</p>
<p>Should I give up on MS's new Tiles interface and use these like our XP machines?</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; Highly unlikely to be "very corrupted" ... </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 different PC's (HP Pavillion, Asus Transformer), </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 different retail channels (Best Buy in store, Costco direct ship from HP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 different hardware architectures (HD vs. SSD, i-5 v Atom, et al)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both machines have &nbsp;factory-installed Win 8.1 +&nbsp;current updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very different applications environments&nbsp; (MS Office/Outlook/datacomm/misc vs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sophisticated highly active trading app - 12+ complex windows active, calcs, etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a hint of any problem on either machine other than the Tile Shuffle mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Both machines have done this since first usage after purchase apx 2 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; A&nbsp;further clue might be ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; This appears to happen more often and makes a bigger mess on the HP, which has 2 monitors and a bigger desktop, even though it has a more singular usage;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Several Tiles have been pinned to Start Menu that either launch apps or access websites on the much smaller Asus, but they still get scrambled ... just not as often or as badly as the larger HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; All of this is such a waste of time!&nbsp; I'll start collecting Screenshots of pre- and post-scrambled desktops on both machines to try to figure out specific details of what and why.</p>
<p>The results of talking to 2 MS techs are:&nbsp; 1 hung up after 20+minutes (didn't know what Tiles are), and the 2nd didn't know the difference between icons on the legacy desktop vs. Tiles on the new "Tiletop" that only uses Tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I'm now aware via internet that I'm not alone in this issue.&nbsp; However, it's hard to get a sense of magnitude.&nbsp; Perhaps many low-usage users don't know or care?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for dogging this ... I'm surprised MS hasn't more directly responded to this.</p>

            If you can tell us how to demonstrate it, we'll get a case opened and a developer on it.&nbsp; But so far, adding tiles, rebooting, hasn't made them move on our test machines.

            <p><span>Okay, here's a specific case today, with screenshot(s):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; BEFORE:&nbsp; Last night, just before normal shut down of the H-P Pavilion, Screenshot was taken of Desktop Tiles, with 38 primary tiles arranged (again) in the Main Group.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2.&nbsp; STARTUP:&nbsp; This morning, a normal power on, sign on and Windows 8.1 launch were performed;&nbsp; nothing unusual occurred.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; COMPARISON:&nbsp; A cropped preview of last night's screenshot was placed on Monitor #2;&nbsp; the primary Monitor #1 had the current Desktop Tiles.&nbsp; A careful comparison of all 38 tiles in the
 Main Group (and some smaller groups) showed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
no changes whatsoever</span>.&nbsp; This process and other administrivia took apx 1 hour.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp; SURPRISE:&nbsp; Before using the H-P PC, I turned away for some administrative matters.&nbsp; When I turned back to the PC, 31 of the 38 tiles had been rearranged;&nbsp; &nbsp;while all of the same 38 tiles
 were still in the Main Group,&nbsp;the arrangement was very different.&nbsp; Again, nothing had been done, run or even touched on the H-P PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp; SCREENSHOT of Before and After:&nbsp; The screenshot was taken after the rearrangement was observed, before anything else was done on the H-P PC.&nbsp; The Screenshot shows:</span></p>
<p><span>The Before - Monitor #2 on left, taken last evening, same as launch this A.M. -and-
</span></p>
<p><span>The After - Primary Monitor#1 on the H-P PC, showing Desktop Tiles after scrambling.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp; AN OBSERVATION:&nbsp; In this occurrence of Tile Scrambling, it appears that all 38 tiles in the Main Group fit back into the same-size rectangular space on the desktop after the 31 tiles were
 relocated. &nbsp;In many of the past occurrences, the rearranged tiles did not fit so neatly -- holes were often left and sometimes new column(s) of tiles were created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, this failure of Windows 8.1 is a waste of time, and creates disorder.&nbsp; I certainly look forward to Microsoft standing by the integrity of their Operating System, which in other respects
 might turn out to be an outstanding product.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for any help y'all can provide,</span></p>

<h2>            How to perform trace route to Xbox Live servers&#63; &#40;high latency&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to run a trace route for Xbox Live to test the connection between my ISP and the Microsoft servers. However, I could not find any information on which servers I should actually ping.</p>
<p>Some background on why I'm asking: I've noticed that I get <strong>very high latency</strong> values (around 170 to 180ms) when I run the network connection test tool on my Xbox One. This doesn't sound right to me, because when I perform a speedtest on any
 other device, I usually get a ping of below 25ms.</p>
<p>My Xbox One is connected over ethernet, all the ports are open and I'm using a static IP for the console.</p>
<p>Since I suspect that there's something wrong with the routing of my ISP, I would need a trace route log prove this and get it fixed.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>If you have an open NAT and a low packetloss 0-5% you shouldn't worry about the high latency as this can give a false image. The latency shown on your Xbox itself does not have a direct impact on gaming.</p>

<p>I have exactly the same issue, and with all due respect, @FearedNightmare, your answer dated January 9, 2015 wherein you stated, "<span>The latency shown on your Xbox itself does not have a direct impact on gaming."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Really??? Then what, may I respectfully ask, does it directly impact? The amount of latency in your upstream bandwidth's&nbsp;ping to the server is the WHOLE PURPOSE for providing the latency figure, please correct me if
 I'm wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I mostly use my Xbox to play&nbsp; Halo: Reach multiplayer online. In the game's menu it has a specific submenu entitled NETWORK STATUS that informs you, on an ongoing basis, of your NAT Rating, Packet Loss Rate and Upstream
 Bandwidth. The status of my Upstream Bandwidth says: WARNING!, in a nuclear red alert rectangle.</span></p>
<p><span>The accompanying description of my network state explicitly declares, "Suboptimal networking conditions will affect Matchmaking and gameplay."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is Xbox Live basing their characterization of the quality of my Upstream Bandwidth on? Is it not the latency they detect when they ping my console? Here's what endlessly fascinates me (with fluctuating infuriation...):
 I have almost the very best internet service money can buy: 300 mb downstream and 30 upstream. I live alone and am the sole user of my internet service. My console is Ethernet wired to the router, and all my other networking parameters EXACTLY match the initial
 inquirers, to be brief. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>MY latency, as determined under the console's Network settings, Detailed network statistics, is only 49ms, compared to the initial inquirer's 180-190ms. But, just like him, when I run speed tests on my laptop and my
 cell phone, the latency is only 12ms.&nbsp; Well, they're obviously pinging different servers, hence the discrepancy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have the same suspicions about my ISP&nbsp;as the initial inquirer, so likewise need proof.</span></p>
<p><span>Why is it SO catastrophically difficult for Xbox Live to post a simple overview of the methods they use to determine latency and the quality of our connections to their servers?&nbsp; AND, provide a server address that their
 highly valued paying customers can use to run a simple diagnostic traceroute to?</span></p>
<p>To be crystal clear: ALL LATENCY DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF GAMEPLAY in TWITCH-BASED GAMES, such as the first person shooter genre. If my lag is 49ms (milli-seconds - thousandth of a single second) and your lag is 180ms, and we're shooting machine guns
 at each other, I can shoot you with a dozen bullets before you are even aware you're being shot at. And while you may appears to be moving and grooving with the game, closer analysis of the action will show you moving 25 mph, me moving 35 mph, and the dudes
 with completely lag-free connections moving 50 mph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please: help us Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're our ONLY hope!</p>

<p>Hi Jesse1987,</p>
<p>When drivers required by a PC's USB interface are not installed correctly or are out of date, an iPhone or iPod connected to the computer may not be recognized properly.</p>
<p>This could be one of the reasons why the iPod is not recognized as a disk.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, please follow the steps from the knowledge base article below.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone or iPod is not recognized properly by computer when USB drivers are not installed properly or are out of date<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538</strong></a></p>
<p>That should be it.</p>

    <title>I want to remove Parents Safety - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m3g4  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to remove Parents Safety</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My email was hacked using a family safety feature or something, every time I login my messenger it tells me that I'm under family safety, I don't have the family safety program installed on my PC, but when i go to https://fss.live.com/ I see my account as a
 "kid" account, I'm worried that the person with the parent access can see and read my emails and contacts! I want to delete and remove everything related to Family Safety and I don't want anyone to see and check my emails.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>Windows Update offering me Asustek updates, is this normal&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update offering me Asustek updates, is this normal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everybody.</p>
<p>I started this thread because I wanted to know if it is normal for Windows update to offer me Asustek updates.</p>
<p>The reason why I am asking this is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who don't know, Asus was targeted the past year by a hacking group and was victim of a distribution chain attack, which meant users with Asus Live update would download an infected Bios update that was infected by a backdoor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus and Kaspersky already distribute a fix for those few affected and the details can be read in tech news websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the thing is that, during all the time I have been a Windows user, this was the first and only time I have been offered a Firmware update by Windows. I have been trying to get this update to happen again, but it only happened once with no evidence of
 it ever repeating itself or ever being installed. I wanted to know if it is normal for Windows update channel to offer me these updates, furthermore I did not have the option to update other windows products enabled at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a group policy to prevent&nbsp; the installation of drivers and devices as it is a maintenance task that I do manually once a month at most which explains the error below, but I have never seen this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently asking Asustek if the Windows update channel is used, which would be preferable to using Asus utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any information about this I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>
<p>

<br /> 
<br />Yes, that is perfectly normal and will be more and more the case in the future. Microsoft is working closely with system and device makers to provide the 3rd party updates via Windows Updates. However do keep in mind that many makers do not yet provide all the most current updates.
<br />
<br />At some point in the future all major system updates as well as driver updates from 3rd parties will come via Windows Updates.

    <title>How to log in after removing domain name&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to log in after removing domain name&#63;</h2>
                    I wanted to set up a client PC running XP professional as a stand alone PC. I removed it from the server (Microsoft Small Business Sever 2003) then went into My Computer and removed the domain name by selecting workgroup option (stand alone) Now I can
 not login to the workstation regardless of what combination of log ins I try. How do I get around this?

<p>Microsoft has an article on this problem:</p>
<p>"You cannot log on after you remove the computer from the domain"<br />
&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317049</a> &gt;</p>
<p>Bottom line is that you have been logging into the machine based on cached credentials from the domain.&nbsp; Removing the machine from the domain invalidates the login as the domain membership is broken.&nbsp; You will have to login using the built-in local Administrator
 account and either create new local users or do a System Restore to restore it to a time that it was on the domain.&nbsp; The default password for the local Administrator user is blank (nothing).&nbsp; If it has been changed, you will need to obtain the current password.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

<h3> henrar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange error &#40;exception&#41; when trying to launch .NET Framework apps and Batman Arkham Asylum on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem when launching certain applications on Windows 10 that are using .NET Framework. To begin with, I decided to install Microsoft Web Platform, but I received an error that said: "Customized cultures cannot be passed by lcid, only by name".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same error I received, although in much detailed form is when I tried launching Batman: Arkham Asylum (Steam GOTY Edition).<br />
The whole exception is posted at the end of this post. After clicking continue the game launcher turned on, but there were no subtitles on it and clicking on any options and I couldn't launch the game at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming this is somewhat related to language settings. I am using Windows 10 Professional, upgraded from 8.1, with language set to English (United Kingdom), with region and keyboard set to Poland. I tried to use UK as a region/keyboard, but I received
 the same error. Any solution?</p>
<p>

just-in-time (JIT) debugging instead of this dialog box.<br />

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check and install the latest&nbsp;.NET framework for windows 10 from Windows update to see if it fix the issue. Ensure that the system is&nbsp;configured with all compatible features that are required for running the&nbsp;Game in Windows 10. Please check and make sure
 those things from the Game Official Website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try enabling and disabling the .NET framework from <strong>Turn windows feature on or off
</strong>under Programs and Features in Control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query. </p>

            Windows is updated, i also tried to turn .NET (both 3.5 and 4) from <strong>
Turn windows feature on or off. </strong>The issue is still there, both in <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Microsoft Web Platform and Batman Arkham Asylym. The game will probably play fine, but since I cannot launch the game without launcher (I checked game folder and tried all executables) I won't be able to play it.</span>

            <p>And I actually found solution to this problem. It seems that my Windows Calendar settings (it was set to English (Europe) and had customized date) was causing problems with this one. I switched that to Polish (Poland) and now it stared working. After going
 back to previous setting, the app started throwing the same exception. So I guess the solution is not to have customized calendar settings.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We've had the same issue with a .Net2 based app on Windows 10.</p>
<p>It was a similar situation where the machine had been upgraded from Windows 7 to 10, and left the format locale as "English (Europe)".</p>
<p>Changing this to "English (United Kingdom)" fixed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On further tests, I can trigger the same behaviour by setting it to any format locale that does NOT have an associated language pack available (regardless of whether it's enabled or not), but this is not conclusive.</p>

<p>Hi Dennis Zac</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for answer. But there are many people with this problem (ssd slow in writing), you can read a question below. For example, one have 256gb ssd and about 330Mb/s in writing, other have 512gb ssd and about 630Mb/s in writing or 1Tb ssd and 1200Mb/s.
 You can see that the math proportion ssd/speed is the same of mine (128gb and 175Mb/s). I think that Microsoft can solve this problem with a firmware update.</p>

<h3> j.f.d.  say:</h3>
<h2>            All web browsers cause an ntdll.dll heap error 0xc0000374&#33;</h2>
                    <p>We are working on an SCCM-based Windows 10 1803 Enterprise deployment, and all is proceeding well enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One pernicious problem we have noted is that all web browsers we have tested tend to crash, all with the exact same error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe, version: 11.0.17134.48, time stamp: 0x5ae3f17b<br />
Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.17134.1, time stamp: 0x207580e2<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000374<br />
Fault offset: 0x00000000000f4eeb<br />
Faulting process id: 0x23a0<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d3f8f7658624b1<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\MicrosoftEdgeCP.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll<br />
Report Id: d92afe2b-7d8e-4134-b016-2051a215c2b8<br />
Faulting package full name: Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_42.17134.1.0_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe<br />
Faulting package-relative application ID: ContentProcess<br />
</p>
<p>The crash seems to be at least in part content-driven. Some web sites/pages seem to cause crashes more than others, but like I said, all 3 browsers tested (Edge, IE, and latest stable Chrome) will crash ntdll.dll with the same error code and offset.<br />
</p>
<p>Possibly related, the backgroundTaskHost crashes a few times a day as well, with a slightly different error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I'm not having much luck tracking this down. There are no "dumps" that I can see, and trying to run chrome.exe from windbg made the problem go away (did not crash for several days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled our AV client (Sophos), but the problem seemed to remain ... had a few more crashes a few hours later. I may test a workstation with Sophos having never been installed, see if that changes anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machines are domain joined, and have GPO's set. They are basically the MS Security baselines combined with some of the DoD STIG policies as well. We are a small organisation so I have to admit we haven't gone through every possible GPO setting to see
 if that might be the cause ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might anyone have any idea what might be going on or how to debug this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Brand new I see! So no, not yet. I can give it a try ... the previous updates didn't change anything ... this problem was sometimes seen in 1709 as well BTW.

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While I'm not sure if that's possible with Live Mail, I have a much simpler (rather quirky) suggestion.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Take a screenshot of your Inbox (mail folder) displaying all your emails and print that out instead. If it extends to more than one page, you can print back to back.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Use the Windows Snipping Tool for screenshots.</p>

<h2>            Encounter with a clan of hackers selling 15th prestige for 1600 MP, proof and we need Xbox do something about all these hackers&#47;boosters&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Clan of hackers selling 15th hack to hundreds of people and making a lot of money off of it! MORE BELOW.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately I have seemed to encountered tons of 15th prestige hacks that people are trying to pull and a ton of people using aimbot.</p>
<p>Last night I was playing with a friend online when a guy offered us 15th prestige hack by using a Jtag device? We decided to "play along" and then report him if he anything that wasnt right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We told him that it doesnt work so then he told us that he had sold for 1600 Microsoft points to over 100 people the 15th prestige hack. After that he said that his whole clan which isnt that big, had all been sellingthis to people and had been making money
 by doing so. We know this is true because there accounts only had a few days played and they were all 15th Prestige. They also said that they used the Jtag to get Free CoD points in order to buy gold guns.</p>
<p>After all that he insisted on putting us in a private match to prove that it works, we went for about 1 min and all this crap popped up and asking us if we wanted to prestige. It was very strange and we then told them that we got contact by microsoft and
 that our accounts, they thought we were telling the truth and then they &nbsp;shut off there Xbox. We were smart and took down his gamertag though :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im not trying to be a little snitch, but if they need to cheat there way in a video and also ruin everybody elses experiance I find it very wrong and someone at Xbox should get these guys out of the system. It isnt the first time I have hard of these guys
 and they need to be gone, because they are ruining the lobby and making money off of hacking the system and messing it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the one guy who claimed to have sold it to people gamers tag: <strong>
[GT Removed]</strong></p>
<p>The clan tag is: <b>[Removed]</b></p>
<p>This happended on SUnday July 22nd around 12:00 o clock Pacific standard time and persisted until arounsd 2:00 o'clock on Saturday July 23rd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do something about these guys and get them out so they can stop messing up mine and a lot of peoples gaming experiance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No wonder a lot of 15th Prestige's suck.....&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Upgrading to Windows 10 PRO from Windows 8 Single Language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falguni bharadwaj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10 PRO from Windows 8 Single Language</h2>
                    <p>Well, there has been a lot of confusion regarding the licensing of Windows 10. I happened to buy an HP Envy k-102tx, which came preinstalled with
<strong>Windows 8.1 Single Language.</strong> Which means, if i were to avail the
<strong>Free Window s 10 Upgrade, </strong>then I would be upgraded to <strong>Windows 10 Home edition.
</strong>However I want some more freedom and want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro edition. For that, I already had a reserve copy of
<strong>Windows 7 Professional, </strong>which I was unable to install due to <strong>
2 reasons. </strong>1st, being the <strong>UEFI mode </strong>enabled, and the second being all the
<strong>partitions in GPT format</strong> by default. In addition to that, just like new laptops, my laptop to has the Windows 8.1 Single language key embedded to its bios. I thought, may be deleting all partitions including the recovery and installing media
 may remove the embedded key, as I was quite uneducated about where the key was actually embedded to. I though it was embedded to the recovery media partition. (P.S. I didn't need the recovery media, as it was full of bloatwares, and in case of re installation,
 I had already downloaded the "Windows 8.1 Single language" iso file using Microsoft's
<strong>Media Creation Tool, </strong>and have also retrieved my product key by using
<strong>Advanced Token's Manager</strong> &amp; <strong>Microsoft's Toolkit </strong>
(useful for MS office product key retrieval as well).<br />
So for installing Windows 7, I had to reconvert my partition into Basic MBR, then prefered
<strong>legacy mode to UEFI mode. </strong>There was no option to disable UEFI mode, but for legacy mode. Hence I switched on legacy mode and
<strong>disabled secure boot. </strong>Now Windows 7 installed successfully. Later i updated to service pack 1, and now even i got a Windows 10 upgrade notification in the taskbar as well<strong>.
</strong>But somehow, if <strong>i disable the legacy mode</strong>, Windows won't boot and shows
<strong>No operating system found. </strong>The Secure Mode too can be disable only if Legacy Mode is enabled. Hence I have always kept the legacy mode on. Now upon checking my product key using ATM and Microsoft's Toolkit, it shows me the Windows 7 Pro key,
 but when i use <a href="https://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="BIOS Embedded Key Checker">
<strong>this tool</strong></a> to check the BIOS Embedded product key, it still shows me the Windows 8.1 Single Language Product key, which I retrieved earlier.<br />
<br />
<strong>Now the confusion is,</strong> if i click on the update to windows 10(after July 29), or if I manually upgrade using the iso upgrade, during installation, will it pick-up the BIOS embedded key or the Windows 7 Pro key. I have found many statements from
 developers mentioning that MS may develop a tool that will interchange the BIOS embedded key with the corresponding version of Windows 10 key. But in my case, if the upgrade plays with my BIOS, then I will be upgraded to Windows 10 Home version and not the
 Pro version. But if it pick ups only the Windows 7 key, then I shall get the Windows 10 Pro version.
<strong>(My windows 7 Pro license is being shown as "OEM_COA_SLP Channel", installed via DVD).
</strong>If I get Windows 10 Home version, how to I upgrade to the Pro version. Will I have to buy a Pro Pack, even though I am eligible to get Windows 10 Pro for free as I have Windows 7 Pro license, just because that my BIOS has a Basic version key embedded
 into it? <strong>(This will be very unfair, if it happens). </strong>Again what will happen, if after installation, I again disable the legacy mode, as Windows 10 is supported by UEFI mode? Will it even boot, or will it get converted to Basic edition just
 because my Bios has basic key installed(but I don't think so), or will I face no issues at all once upgraded? Moreover, how can i take a backup of my activation, in case i want to reinstall Windows 10. Till date I have been
<a href="http://joshcellsoftwares.com/products/advancedtokensmanager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Activation Backup software">
<strong>"Advanced Token's Manager"</strong></a> to take backup of already activated license(As i had fears, will using the keys after a certain no times for activations won't activate). Windows 10 has no such activation backup softwares.
<strong>NOTE: I am talking about "ACTIVATION" backup and NOT License Backup.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have installed Windows 7 Pro only to get the professional version of Windows 10.<br />
The second stanza mentions some of my curiosity, which I would be thankful to be enlightened about.&nbsp;

<p>I ve some doubts from the comment you made. 1st of all,Ii came to know from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/the-free-upgrade-to-windows-10-for-windows-7-oem/b622ef33-ac69-4ca1-b7d1-9aa08321809f">
here</a>&nbsp;that, if users have Windows 7 installed and if installed Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview, then they might have to revert back to Windows 7, to prove that they have a genuine license eligible for the upgrade. On the other hand, Windows 8.1 users(for
 those who have it preinstalled with product key embedded) may not need to revert back, as there might be a possibility for MS to grab the key from bios during installation. Now my problem is combination of both.</p>
<p>Now coming to your suggestion you recommended, if MS gives all Insider Preview members a free upgrade, then any people, even a pirate too, will no longer need to crack the activation. Its like Windows 10 will be free not just for Windows 7 till 8.1 users,
 but <strong>anyone can get it free.</strong> Even a linux user <strong>just by signing up for the Insider Preview and downloading and installing Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview</strong>, as signing up for the Insiders Preview is completely free of cost. Isn't
 it? In that case it won't even matter if users have their copies legitimate or not, as just by doing the above step will get the. Windows 10 Pro for free. And probably that is why, MS is still silent to this confusion, whether to provide Inside Preview members
 a copy of Windows 10 Pro free ir not.<br />

    <title>Assassins Creed 1 not playing full screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr.rockit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assassins Creed 1 not playing full screen</h2>
                    I have an AMD 3.2 Quad with a 5770ATI graphics card all my gaming graphics is great, and all my other games run to full screen with no boarders (stretch from graphics card is OK).&nbsp; OH an Windows 7,great. My problem is only with&nbsp;assassins 1 which seems
 to run with a windows boarder of some type that i don't recognise, it has in the top left corner a white rectangle with a small blue square&nbsp;in the middle an to the right of that the name Assassins Creed. the bottom also has the task bar, the best i can do
 to make it full screen is right click on the top bar an hit move then just click the bottom bar an the task bar disapears but the top one remains. An if i go to close to the top during a game with my right mouse button on the move box comes up again. I don't
 know if this problem is with the game or a windows setting, i'm not very good with my new computer or windows yet. I hope i have given enough info for a soloution, thanks for any help you can give, i have not used forum

<p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using Microsoft answers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try installing codecs and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may use your favorite search engine to download and install Codecs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the link below for more information on codecs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions below to disable filter and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Windows Movie maker</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Tools, and then click Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Uncheck all the filter listed and click on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some audio and video file formats are not supported in Windows Movie Maker and cannot be imported. However, if you have a video or audio file that is not supported, you
 may be able to use a non-Microsoft video editing program to convert the file into a format that Windows Movie Maker supports, and then import the resulting audio or video file into Windows Movie Maker. Some files also require you to install a codec before
 you can use the files in Windows Movie Maker.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
