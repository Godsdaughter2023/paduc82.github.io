<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>403 forbidden means that the authentication was provided, but the authenticated user is not permitted to perform the requested operation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please navigate to
<a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 subscriptions</a> page and check if you have SharePoint Online license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have that license, please let your company global admin navigate to SharePoint admin center (via this Url:
</span><a href="https://tenantname-admin.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://tenantname-admin.sharepoint.com</span></a><span> for example:
</span><a href="https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com</span></a><span>), and then go to User Profiles&gt;People&gt;Manage User Profiles&gt;enter your user name in the Find profiles box&gt; Find to check
 if your user profile exists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, please try accessing these SharePoint sites via URL to see the result. For OneDrive for Business sites, please try accessing via
<a href="https://joneslee-mhttps:/tenant-my.sharepoint.com/personal/user_tenantname_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspxy.sharepoint.com/personal/jones_joneslee_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://tenant-my.sharepoint.com/personal/user_tenantname_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the 403 Forbidden error persists, in addition to the results of the above attempts, please help provide the information below for investigation:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Can other user in your organization access these SharePoint sites?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Please let site admin navigate to these SharePoint sites&gt;Click Gear button on the upper-right corner&gt;Site Settings&gt;Site Permissions&gt;Check Permissions&gt;Enter your user name and check your permission
 on the sites.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Could you describe more information about "Is there any way of deleting the files without being able to access the file itself?"? Does it mean you want to delete files on these SharePoint sites
 and OneDrive for Business?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Please let us know the detailed steps about how you access these SharePoint sites and OneDrive for Business and the detailed steps you perform before the error prompts.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Please capture a full screenshot about the error message.</p>

            Unfortunately Google started blocking the Windows Phone app from Microsoft.. The workaround until Google stops acting up, I suggest you pin the YouTube mobile site to your start screen instead of using the app.

<h3> bcp&#47;&#47;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook error messages 3259 &#38; 3260 - emails stuck in outbox &#40;previously working fine&#41;</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2011 for Mac (with Lion OS) and my emails have suddenly stopped sending and are sitting stuck in the outbox. The error messages received are either 3259 ("an operation on the server timed out.....") or error 3260 ("Outlook cannot connect
 to the server. Verify that your computer is connected to the network") with 3260 being the most recent and frequent. This is not an internet connection issue as all other internet programmes are working.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its a small business POP account, I set it up myself and it has been working fine for for the last 3 months. I initially had this same problem (but can't remember the error message) and managed to sort it out by overiding the default port 25 and using
 587 instead (picked this up on another forum and it worked fine). I have tried reverting the default port, rebuilding the outlook database (holding shift or option when starting), and emptying all folders and restarting the programme.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Obviously I have tried using the email account remotely and this is working as normal so its definitely an Outlook issue. Have there been any recent updates or patches I've missed?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We're a small business (3 staff and no IT department) and I'm the only one having a problem. Any help or suggestions gratefully received</div>

            If someone in your office has this working then you want to mirror his or her settings. You'll find these settings under&nbsp;<b>Outlook</b> menu --&gt; &nbsp;<i>Preferences...</i> --&gt;
<b>Accounts</b>, selecting your POP account and referring to the Outgoing server area. Be sure to click on
<b>More Options...</b> and include those settings as well.
<div><br />
<div>Your email service provider will ultimately have to tell you the correct settings if these don't work. Settings can vary and you must choose what your service provider uses.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Do you have any messages stuck right now in your Outbox? If so, you should remove them and test. See this for details about how to view your Outbox:</div>

<h2>            Custom Domains on Outlook.com Using Outlook 2016 Desktop - Fixed</h2>
                    <p>I've had an issue for the past week. &nbsp;I assumed it was due to my custom domain on Outlook.com not being compatible with Outlook 2016 desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I received an e-mail from Microsoft titled "[Action Required] Re-connect Outlook 2016/2013 to Outlook.com after upgrade...". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While, Outlook 2016 is unable to use the Autodiscover, which it could before, you now need to set it up, manually, and choosing Exchange ActiveSync. &nbsp;For the Mail Server, I used eas.outlook.com, and it was able to find/sync my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm more relieved, than happy, that I don't have to use the web, or Mail app.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 has grayed out toolbar and fails to load home page on launch</h2>
                    I'm not sure what happened but upon launching IE11 the toolbar is all grayed out and the homepage does not load. If I click on any favorites they will open but the initial load fails and the gray "toolbar" persists. Previously I rolled back to IE10, reapplied
 IE11, then disabled all toolbars and the issue seemed to have gone away. However, today it returned and I'm at a loss. If I launch IE with no addons it works fine, no toolbar, and loads to the page stating addons disabled (expected). I've never seen this before
 and not sure what else to do.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that an add-on is causing the issue. You have also mentioned that Internet Explorer works&nbsp;well by disabling add-ons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Run the Microsoft Fix It.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer add-on problems when IE hangs or freezes<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, you may disable add-ons one at a time and check which add-on is causing this issue.<br />
<strong>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer<br />

<p>Please be informed that the Drafts folder on your inbox functions as a storage for emails that are unsent. It allows you to save your emails that you are currently working on. By default, the draft emails you created will be moved to your Sent folder once
 the message was sent. If you wish to save the emails sent from your account, you can drag the message to your Archive folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies your issue. Let us know if you need additional assistance.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Recently my son had a problem with his Xbox. (Which is connected through my email) One of the solutions to his problem was to alter the primary alias of my email from @msn to @hotmail. Unfortunately, after this was altered, it was unable to change back. MSN
 which was the original primary alias is no longer able to revert back from Hotmail. Instead, I now have a Hotmail inbox, and my old MSN email is a sub-folder underneath it. This is really causing a huge problem with receiving important E-Mails. Please provide
 any help that you can!!!<br />

 installing 10 Insider, but we are both unable to find the product code. </p>
<p>Are the codes still being provided by Microsoft? I can't seem to find it... </p>
<p>

<p>You need to upgrade install&nbsp;into an activated&nbsp;win7 - 8.1 or 10 - Or use a&nbsp;win7 - 10 key for at least&nbsp;the first install.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>What was the windows key before it became a pirate version.. use that original&nbsp;key.&nbsp;

<p>Hi August,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if the program that you try to uninstall is having a system conflict. We have an article here in the Microsoft community that we can use to remove the program. We suggest that you click and follow the steps provided on this

<p>This was not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program has no product code. &nbsp;It found its own way onto my computoer. It only has a version number, which is 6.2.19.899 . The download wants a product code and I don't have one. &nbsp;The program is not something I ever ordered.</p>

Tell us about your computer?&nbsp; Make, model, OS history, previous AV programs, etc?</p>

<p>Does the computer belong to you or to your employer?&nbsp; If used as part of a commercial domain did you seek advice from the responsible IT personnel?

<p>Your reply in of itself was not helpful, but repeated contact with the Parent/Sister(?) company Solarwinds eventually took care of the problem. &nbsp;Essentially there was a &nbsp;second program in my program and features list that eluded my noticing because it was
 labeled&nbsp;"Windows Agent" and was sandwiched in-between several Microsoft Windows programs. &nbsp;Solarwinds pointed the program out to me, to their credit, but they didn't tell me that once I uninstalled that program that the other program that needed a password
 for uninstallation would automatically disappear&nbsp;from the program and features list. &nbsp;A subsequent call from the company helped me to check the rest of my computer and another file was deleted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big problem is that Solarwinds could explain to me how their programs got on my computer to begin with. &nbsp;They insisted that a company I was associated with had installed it on my computer, and that I needed to contact them to find out more. &nbsp;However,
 there is no such company, and if there was, I was not informed that they would be installing the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've done a number of things to secure my computer since. &nbsp;It's working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please contact me if you would like to know more, or have any questions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for being there!</p>

<h2>            OneDrive files STILL taking up too much space on D AFTER moving from D to E.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter painstakingly uploaded all my files and pictures with numerous folders to OneDrive. We did not know at the time that it would practically take half of the drive capacity. In my system, I have two physical drives, each 1 TB: Drive 1 partitioned
 into C (OS) approx 380 GB and D (Data) approx 540 GB. Drive 2 w/o partition E, stores backups of Drive D. We moved the location from D:\Users\Eddy to E:\Users\Eddy. However, the capacity of D did not increase. (The Capacity of E decreased.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the properties of the OneDrive folder and it is correct (E). I also looked in the old OneDrive folder on D and it is empty. I rebooted and synced, hoping that would resolve the issue. No Joy. Why did I not recover any space on D? What can I do
 other than deleting OneDrive (and quit paying a monthly fee to MS to rent space in their cloud storage)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Info below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            I'm not sure why that is happening, but would you want to turn on Files on Demand for your OneDrive? 
<br />
<br />This will keep the files online only until you want to download them to your computer, which will keep the space on your hard drive free.

</p><p>No, I need to keep them local. Our internet/cable has a bad habit of having lines cut. There is a lot of construction going on locally and it is a pain. Also, there is no internet at the cabin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss of why the disk did not recover the space.</p>
<p>

<h3> philcombs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 inbox mail disappearing after a week. Archive files not showing up&#63;</h2>
                    I set up my Outlook 2007 account with AutoArchive rules that were a bit too aggressive. I had the program supposedly clearing out my email after 10 days, supposedly archiving them.&nbsp; I've noticed over the past two weeks that my inbox emails have been disappearing.
 I'd assumed they were being archived, and in looking at the folder containing my .pst files I see five archive.pst files (archive1.pst, et cetera).&nbsp; When I look in the program's left pane under archive folders - &gt; inbox, i only see emails going back from July.
 August and September's aren't showing up. The newer archive files show creation dates within the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; I turned off all AutoArchiving last night and got up this morning to find that more emails are "missing."<br />
<br />
Is something perhaps corrupted, or are there some other settings I need to adjust? Is there a way to combine all my archive files into one?<br />

<p>Hi JEGrant3,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>We can only use multiple email address to email notes to OneNote from Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, you are using Work/School account, I have tested it, it can’t email notes from multiple email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check the detailed information via the following article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-email-to-send-notes-to-onenote-notebooks-f513b641-ab0d-41cc-8dab-2a66f5d141e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use email to send notes to OneNote notebooks</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could understand your feeling, I know it is more convenient if we can use the feature for Work/School account.</p>
<p>Given the situation, we suggest you vote for your requirement to
<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/328602-onenote-clipper-or-me-onenote-com?query=Email%20to%20OneNote%20from%20multiple%20addresses%20Work%2Fschool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            OneDrive for Business - Sign In button does not do anything</h2>
                    
<p>Oh look, a day after an Office upgrade gets downloaded stuff stops working. What a nonsense O365 is.</p>
<p>So.... I can sign on to O365 online and access One Drive fine. I am signed in within Office e.g. Powerpoint. This is NOT a credentials issue.</p>
<p>However on the desktop the OneDrive I am being prompted for credentials.&nbsp;I have put it in (correctly) and the Sign In button does nothing. If flashes with a yellow box, goes nowhere, no error, no nothing.</p>
<p>Great work guys.</p>
<p>I have found another hit from December 2015 which says clear your credentials in Control Panel (done), run repair (done)..... and then the only option left is to reinstall office. What&nbsp;a load of nonsense.... I think I have already said that.</p>
<p>Luckily I can still get to One Drive online but that is not the issue.</p>
<p>Any more suggestions on how this may be fixed. </p>
<p>(ps the Back button is similarly disabled and flashes yellow when you press it).</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We understand it was an poor experience, and sorry you were impacted. I hope you’ll stick with it, and continue to give us feedback.</p>
<p>Now we have a new sync client of OneDrive for Business, if you only need to sync your personal OneDrive for Business library, you may try using it to sync files. To learn more, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Windows</a>. It can also be
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploying-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-an-enterprise-environment-3f3a511c-30c6-404a-98bf-76f95c519668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
deployed to users computers by admins</a>.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If we use the new sync client to sync OneDrive for Business library, the legacy sync client won’t sync that library anymore. We can use the legacy sync client to sync SharePoint Online team site libraries.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the other hand, if you choose to use the legacy OneDrive for Business which includes in Office suite, you can firstly
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remove the cache of OneDrive for Business</a>, and then check the outcome. If the issue persists, please let us know is there credential needed error message with the sync client. When will you get the
 sign in prompt? You may also check if you can directly click the Enter button for signing in after entering the password.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Please back up the important files before you remove the cache. It will take you some time to finish the process.</p>
<p>@LeeA, to give you a better support, we can focus on your thread for further investigation.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />

<p>I've encountered this issue on more than one occasion recently and like a lot of other people wasted enormous time on trying to figure it out, having to wade through post after post and one MS article after another discussing sync issues. This is not a sync
 issue - it's a GUI problem. The Sign In button doesn't work, pure and simple. If you press Enter, you're golden. I found that on a couple of different sites
<a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/419813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">community.office365.com/.../419813</a> and
<a href="http://cyberblogue.com/windows-10-one-drive-business-365-sign-in-button-not-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cyberblogue.com/.../</a>. However, the same dialog when presented through Word 2016, worked just fine to get logged into SharePoint so I could open documents. The only difference I noted was the Word dialog for the ODFB sign on was themed in blue whereas the
 dialog presented by the ODFB client was themed in red. Microsoft can't make a mouse click work???? WTH? In my other recent instance, the ODFB started working on its own after I went to Connected Services in Word --&gt; File --&gt; Account, and noted that there was
 a message saying I needed to login in again, and logged in without an issue. The 2nd article has a follow-up post indicating the issue appears to happen after a password expiration, and that was the issue after my 2nd occurrence but not for my first - ODFB
 just out of the blue one day started asking for credentials.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My security is by McAfee.</p>
<p>I looked at the link and it is asking for a key. Would this be my Win7 key which I am searching for?! or Win10 which I do not have?</p>
<p>Help...</p>

            <p>I have finally managed to upgrade.</p>
<p>There is advice and link in a reply from Jacinta Rosario to Keith Cordwell, some of which I followed.</p>
<p>i ran troubleshooting on windows update and system maintenance.</p>
<p>I uninstalled programs that I no longer use.</p>
<p>I disconnected all peripheral devices.</p>
<p>I disabled security.</p>
<p>I hope this helps any of you who are still having problems.</p>

<p>Hi Lenelnce,</p>
<p>Currently we get several reports for the issue when downloading Office 2016 for Mac via the Office 365 portal, if the issue can be reproduced from your side, we’ll send you a private message to collect some information and logs so we can escalate this issue
 to our related team for further investigation. You can review it and then reply via
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.<br />
We’ll post on the forum if there are some updates.</p>
<p>Now we’ve created a workspace for you to get and download the installation package.<br />
For how to access the workspace, please also see it in PM.</p>
<p>@Adam,</p>
<p>What you post is extraneous because you are using Windows operation system. I also see you have posted on our forum. Please return to the post and the engineer will continue to help you on that issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>
