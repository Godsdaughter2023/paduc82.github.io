</p><p>It appears that DirectPlay is fortunately still present, just has to be enabled.</p>
<p>The comments on that video also suggest exiting Skype when enabling DirectPlay (just another thing wrong with Skype).</p>
<p>It worked for me and SMAX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for trying Xbox forums... well, it isn't really intuitive to go to Xbox forums to ask about PC&nbsp;games that came out before the first Xbox was even announced. It isn't intuitive to go to Xbox forums to ask about any PC games for that matter.</p>

            <p>This answer is not helpfull at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem meaning I can't play a game (Age of Empires III) on my pc because now Windows 10 has decided that some features were
<span>"deprecated" and obsolete.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically you're telling us no solution at all to be able to keep playing a game that in my case was running just fine in windows 7. You're only redirecting us through other pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"When writing new applications, you should avoid using these deprecated components. When modifying existing applications, you are strongly encouraged to remove any dependency on these components."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a developper....I am something you really should considerate better. I am simple USER. And as USER&nbsp; I am VERY disappointed by this Windows 10 that you (I mean Microsoft) were constantly telling me to install...I actually finally did to stop being
 arrassed by these messages. Well, I am really not convinced at all of the beauty of windows 10.... slower, unstable, and making me loose my time around technical questions. (like many others I had issues with loss files in the update process...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the 1st time in my 43 years life, I am really considering Apple may be a good choice after all....thanks Windows 10.</p>

</p><p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/400470/discussions/0/496879865903140399/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Steam forums
</a>suggest letting Windows update (in case&nbsp;activating DirectPlay may&nbsp;require some extra package that has to be installed via Windows Update)&nbsp;and rebooting. In many cases 'have you tried turning it off and on again' is a ridiculously effective piece of advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1568181/help-installing-directplay-on-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overclock forums</a> and the previously posted video suggest turning off Antivirus temporarily for the activation to work. I think this
 might have the best chance of working. The video also recommended exiting Skype for the activation.</p>

                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>My skype account was compromised/stolen yesterday by an executable I was dumb enough to click on that one of my contacts sent to my skype. After looking at the file I can see it send all passwords to some encrypted email address, the hacker promptly changed
 my skype password and recovery email address to his own, now I cannot use the pass recovery or get into my skype which I have had for about 10 years, All my work contacts are in there,without it I will be out of work.</p>
<p>I still have the executable&nbsp; if your security team want to look at it, a few of my contacts that have my email have told me my skype user also sent it to them.</p>
<p>This person charged/purchased a bunch of itunes gift cards with my bank account.</p>
<p>Please help me to get my skype back.</p>
<p>I do not have access to my hotmail account either right now as they have changed the pass on it also.</p>

            What I suggest you do is setup another Microsoft Account on a non-affected computer.

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account</a>
<br />
<br />From the non-affected computer using the new account, I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose and close the affected account or reset the password for you. 
<br />
<br />Go to the following link to get assisted live support:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/s...</a>

<br />
<br />If you believe sensitive information such as bank passwords might have been compromised, go to another computer and change it immediately. Contact your bank to let them know of any suspicious activities.
<br />
<br />Change your other passwords for services such as emails and other important web sites you visit.
<br />
<br />Have a notepad near by so you can write down the new passwords. 
<br />
<br />Enable two factor authentication on your Microsoft Account:

<br />
<br />Let friends and family know on social media, they should not accept any request begging for money or disclose sensitive information, since someone might be pretending to be you. 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />Look through the list for any entries for suspicious software installed
<br />Select it then click uninstall
<br />
<br />Reset all your web browsers to their original factors state

<p>Thanks for the reply, I was on with chat for an hour this morning, the problem is the hacker changed the email on my skype and the auto recovery will not allow me to try to recover it anymore, I guess 3 times is the limit, it says wait 24 hours and try again,
 and it has been more than 24 hours but every time I try it now it just keeps saying to many attempts.</p>
<p>They chat person was no help, they said the only way to recover is to use the auto recover tool "which does not work"</p>
<p>I use a static ip for last 10 years that does not&nbsp; help and they cannot even attempt to ask some question from this decade about it, I cant believe it is this difficult to get it recovered. I do not want to resort to hiring some other hacker to get me back
 into it, but it has 10 years of work in it and hundreds of work contacts, it will cost me big and crash my business if I cannot get into it, I am really screwed here, seems there should be some way to recover hacked accounts besides auto recover tool that
 does not work.</p>

            Hi Rich,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the difficult time you are having with this. Unfortunate, there is not much else we can do, our role here is as volunteers and since this is an account issue, it is beyond what we can do. 
<br />
<br />In case that resetting of password will be unsuccessful, we suggest that you use theaccount recovery form as the last option to get you back and access your account. <a href="https://account.live.com/ACSR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ACSR</a>
<br />
<br />In the mean time, I will re-route this back to Microsoft Community since it is really an account access issue. I do hope you get the issue resolved.       
        </p>

<p><span>I hope somebody can help I'm running Windows 7 Pro on a new HP 6000 PC after installing various applications I noticed that my LAN icon
 in Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connection disappeared, also the LAN icon in the system tray is crossed out, all works though, Internet access, loop back ping, external ping etc.&nbsp; I have installed the latest drivers from HP website but these
 don't work at all, and I have to system restore to a previous working version. </span>

<p><span>I did notice on this site somebody suggested running the commands below from a cmd prompt and then restarting PC:<br />

            I am having the exact same issue. I have an Asus ul50vt. HAve tried removing regestry entries and reinstalling the driver also resetting permissions networking permissions. I have seen a lot of people with the same problem all over when I search for the
 issue. Hoever I have yet to see this problem fixed. I am planning at this point on reintalling from the factory partition back to factory default install. Would love to find the answer.

            I don't have an issue with icon(s) missing from the system tray, the sys tray network icon is there just red crossed out.However in Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections there is no network icon it's simply not there?<br />
<br />
I did try the reg amendments but unfortunately no joy I'm afraid, all is exactly the same.&nbsp; I have also tried booting into safe mode with networking and the symptoms are the same, no network icon in Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections and
 network icon in sys tray still red crossed out, network connection still fine, loopback ping fine, drivers fine etc undoubtably a Win7 software issue.

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for the quick reply.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to format the sticky note according to your preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, we can't delete the wrong numbers or letters written in sticky notes as there is no option to do so using stylus. it is only possible by using on screen keyboard or the keyboard on a tablet.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Thank you</p>

            LD49,<br />
I know you said you used canned air to blow out the keyboard, but did you try turning it upside down and gently tapping on the bottom to see if anything falls out?&nbsp; The keys you are having trouble with are all in the same general area of the keyboard, mostly
 using the same finger to activate.&nbsp; You could have something like a paper clip, a small scrap of paper, or anything like that embedded beneath the keys.&nbsp; Or is it possible that something sticky could have gotten on there from your hands, like&nbsp;a few drops of
 soda or candy?&nbsp; That could be making the keys stick.&nbsp; You can take some cotton swabs with a tiny amount of alcohol on them and clean in between the keys to see if they are sticking together.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you can try unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in, reloading the driver, and checking any macros that may be assigned to those keys.<br />
<br />
Also check the keyboard settings in control panel and play around with the repeat delay and repeat rate to see if that will resolve your issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need additional assistance.<br />
Thank you,<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Photos app -- not refreshing, can&#39;t edit albums, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edmond gozo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photos app -- not refreshing, can&#39;t edit albums, and can&#39;t update app</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My W10 Photos app has been broken for about a month now. &nbsp;In the COLLECTION and ALBUMS views, it only shows pictures up to mid- August 2015. &nbsp;No new pictures are being picked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those pictures that have already been sorted into albums, I'm finding that I can't edit albums -- can't select/unselect pictures to include, can't edit the title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the app, I see the "refresh" icon spinning endlessly but then nothing happens, no new pictures show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw on Windows Central that a new version of the app is available, but when I go to the store, I don't see the option to update, and I still have the old version -- stuck in "refresh", and no FOLDERS view. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't uninstall this app to try and get the latest version. &nbsp;And this current version is so terrible that I've actually stopped using it -- I only opened it today because I saw that there was an update. &nbsp;But I'm stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help.</p>

            <p>Hi Edmond,</p>
<p>I am sorry you are having issues with the photos app. There is something&nbsp;you can try but that would mean that the photos app will recreate your entire collection, albums&nbsp;.... and so it would look like it has started from scratch. If you think that would
 be ok then you can try the below steps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click on Start button and click on run </p>
<p>Enter the following <em><strong>%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Photos_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState</strong></em></p>
<p>Click on Ok </p>
<p>Delete the contents from the LocalState folder and then relaunch the app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver </p>

            <p>Okay, that KIND OF worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what you said and relaunched the app, and it refreshed and is now showing current pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT it deleted all albums, including the ones I painstakingly created before using the ALBUMS view. &nbsp;That's pretty dumb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it's still not updating. &nbsp;When I go to the Store, it shows as INSTALLED, with no option to update. &nbsp;I want to update so I can simply use the FOLDERS view and not the horrible COLLECTION or ALBUMS view.</p>

</p><p>The app finally updated today, so now it's showing the FOLDERS view. &nbsp;But now I'm encountering another problem: when I click on "choose where we look" and select folders, they don't show up anyway. &nbsp;The only folder that shows up in the main screen is still
 just the Pictures folder.</p>

<p><strong>What happend to WMP 12? does anybody know?&nbsp; I have been using WMP for years and now I don't even know what to say about it accept it is a huge waste of time to even attempt to fix.&nbsp; Why microsoft why!&nbsp; SOme of my many problems are listed below</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am running it on Windows 7 Ultimate on a very strong machine</strong></p>
<p><strong>Missing art work ( once it decides It doesnt like the art it never allows me to place it again even if I delete the artist and reinstall on another cpu it will erase it once back on WMP 12-___)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Library is never there and when you have a huge music library it takes forever to reload it in so whats the use. I dont leave my cpu on for days like some people so everytime I trurn it on to do work it takes an hour at least to import library if
 not longer.&nbsp; And when it does finally load it constantly says uploading library?&nbsp; ___)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duplicates artist WTF? This is a constant thing it loves to do</strong></p>
<p><strong>Often freezes or if it is duplicating and I close the program to reopen(which will often get rid of the duplicates) it will not let me open WMP 12 again (have to go into a music folder and double click on a music file and this is the nly way to get
 it to reopen&nbsp;- WTF</strong></p>
<p><strong>I think there is more that pisses me off especially the lack od Advanced Tag editor so to any one from Microsoft that may read this you forced me to get GodD___ iTUnes.&nbsp; How did this great program get so messed up?&nbsp; I have given up playing with it
 and will be getting iTunes or anything else within the week.&nbsp; I may try to download WMP11 by following the how to instructions that are easily found online.&nbsp; Way to drop the ball Microsfot Windows Media Player Team. Sweet Job</strong></p>

            <p><span>Vinod,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for a fix that does not address all of the other issues listed above.</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer these:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Why was the Advanced tag editor REMOVED???? is it available but hidden?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Why is the album information so BAD!<span>&nbsp;
</span>You DO realize that letting Media Player “Update Album Information”<span>&nbsp;
</span>very often messes up the correct information that already existed?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Why does it lock up so often?<span>&nbsp;
</span>And WHY is it impossible to just SHUT IT DOWN – when I choose to shut it down – IT SHOULD NOT SAY THAT IT IS TRYING TO RESTART THE PROGRAM!!!!</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Why when media player locks up – I loose control of EVERYTHING on my laptop????</span></p>
<p><span>These questions were asked above – but you only addressed the media reset.</span></p>
<p><span>PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSOMERS!!!!</span></p>

            1 Year Later and WMP12 is still buggy...   My current issue is that when i restore my media library I end up with a folder at the bottom of my list called Unknown, it is full of thousands of songs and albums. When i open the file locations, it shows all the info, (ie: artist, album, year, track #'s, etc...) however all these songs show up as Unknown Album / Unknown Artist in my WMP12 music library. When I use the "Find Album Info" option, and when i select the correct info and save it; the files get moved out of the unknown folder. However, If I restore my library again. They all end up in the unknown folder again. So I have 2 questions.   First, Why the **** doesn't WMP12 save the info to the files' ID tags PERMANENTLY??? Cuz having to re-find album covers and info every time i open media player is annoying as ****.   And second, Why aren't files with info in them showing up properly in the library?..  STILL?!?!?

            Suggestion: &nbsp;Fire the current dev team and replace it with one who will actually use Windows Media Player.
<div><br />
<div>I, too, have given up on WMP completely. &nbsp;If you specify more than one Genre for a video, BOOM, the whole media library refuses to update. &nbsp;The entire streaming system breaks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seriously looks like the folks who wrote this don't actually use it. &nbsp;It could be WAY more intuitive.</div>

            <p><span>I really have tried to give Windows Media Player 11 and 12 a chance, for almost 2 years, but now I am really close to give
 up. If I decide to give up and change to another media player I will never ever try WMP again. With about 300GB of music ripped to a NAS It is a lot of work to change media player. Now a list of reasons why;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you set WMP to rip CD automatically it will miss to tag at least the first track of an album.<br />
As sobaixu say these tracks will be Unknown and put in a huge folder with Unknown album/artist. The reason seems to be, WMP start to rip before album info is retrieved from the internet data base.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>As WAV seems to be the only lossless standard format that can be played on any kind of equipment I decided to rip all CD’s in that format. The problem is that it seems to be
 impossible to permanently save updated tags and album art on the NAS (at least in a WAV file/folder). When re-loading the media library, everything is messed up again. As default WMP seems to use an internet data base (often with wrong info), if that is turned
 off it will not update album art at all. Because of this I now have 3 PC’s with somewhat different album arts, but all are connected to the same original library on the NAS.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Sometimes the music library is lost (without reason) and when retrieved suddenly every track appears two times. If I now remove “included folders” completely one of the tracks
 disappear. However if I rip a new CD library will not update.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>For some CD’s it is impossible to have the correct album art, and correct track list.<br />
The reason seems to be that a completely different info is stored in the internet data base for concerned CD. And it is not possible to update and save tags permanent.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When an album art is updated in WMP a “pop up” say file is in use and not possible to update. Anyway the album art is updated and visible as soon as I change from artist to
 album or the other way.</span></p>
<p><span>This is just some of all problems I have with WMP 12. On Internet I can also see a tremendous lot of comments about other
 problem. I and probably many others would appreciate some help from Microsoft to fix the problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope Microsoft hasn’t given up WMP and just leave it to die, because layout is good and if it worked it would be a nice
 media player.</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards, Lars</span></p>

            I know nothing about the bootcat file and why deleting it should fix your problem but I suspect that you were looking for it on drive X: while in Repair Mode. This is the wrong drive - have a look on drives C:, D: or E:,
<div><br />
<div>A "Repair Installation" of Windows will leave your programs intact. A full re-installation will wipe the lot. This is why it is essential to keep all installation media, all downloaded programs and all licence keys.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The normal way to restore data files after a re-installation is from backup on the external backup medium. If you skipped this step up to now then you are in excellent company - lots of people believe that backing up files is what wimps do. You would have
 to do it the hard way by booting the machine with an Ubuntu boot CD ((http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/), then copying your files to an external storage medium.</div>

<p>Computers won't go to 128 bit for a very very very long time..</p>
<p>A 32-bit address register meant that 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; addresses, or 4&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GB</a> of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RAM</a>
 . This is the MAXIMUM THEORETICAL TOTAL AMOUNT OF MEMORY a 32 bit system could handle. So if you have 32 bit, and you have 4 GB or RAM, and 512MB of GPU RAm, your computer will only use 3.5GB of RAM for the main system.. 4GB TOTAL. The 4GB max was implemented
 on almost all 32 bit systems..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>64 bit however does not double this.. infact it does much more than that.. currently on windows 7/vista i believe the maximum memory is 192GB (that's only if you have prof/enter/ultimate) If you have Starter/Home it's 8 GB if you have Home Premium it's 16GB</p>
<p>The theoretical MAXIMUM for 64-bit is actually 16 EXABYTES. 1GB=2^30 an exabyte is 2^60th.. now to give you another sort of referance of how large an exabyte really is.. "As of March 2010&lt;sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display: none;"&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Exabyte&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">[update]</a>
 &lt;/sup&gt; , the global monthly Internet traffic is estimated to be 21 exabytes"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So i suppose to answer your question.. don't listen to your friend he doesn't know what he's talking about. I've never even heard of a 128bit CPU. I've never heard of Windows 8. And any modern notebook will run vista or windows 7. Your CPU will be
 most likely be 64 and 32 compatible (if the computer was made in the last 3 years) Windows is either 64 or 32 bit, but if you have the 64 bit, like I do, then 32 bit apps will still work just fine.. But in theory you can get more performance out of a 64bit
 application/software. The biggest reason to get a 64 bit version of windows in my opinion is to allow for more than 4GB of memory on your system.</strong></p>

<h2>            Changing Versions of Windows 7</h2>
                    I read earlier, can't remember where. That the new Windows 7 will have all the versions on a DVD and that the Product Key "Unlocks" the features. I was really excited to hear this. Well I installed Windows 7 (with the Ultimate DVD) and tried putting a
 Professional Key.<br />
<br />
It tells me it is an invalid key for this installation and is requiring me to reinstall??? Does anyone remember&nbsp;where Microsoft&nbsp;was&nbsp;toting this as a great feature for Windows 7... no need to carry around 6 DVD's to help customers?

            No, Windows Anytime Upgrade does not apply to Windows 7 Ultimate since it is the most complete edition Windows you already have installed. Only customers running Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium and Professional will be able to use Windows Anytime
 Upgrade.<br />

<h2>            What are your thoughts on the Kinect&#63; Is anyone else sad to see it go&#63;</h2>
                    I actually loved the Kinect. The 360 model was great and offered a lot of content. It is one of the reasons why my old Xbox 360 is still parked next to my Xbox One X. It was disappointing to realize the lack of support the Kinect had on the Xbox One. It
 would have been great if they at the very least, they made the Kinect 360 games backward compatible. What are your thoughts?

            Very much so. I loved having access to voice control of the Xbox without a headset and motion-controlled gaming. Dragons Lair was great fun. My kids miss Kinectimals too :(<br />

<p>I am ready for a sequel to Alien: Isolation! Man, that was such a great game. I just recently played it and finished it a couple months ago. I saw it on gamepass and decided to give it a try. I could not put it down!</p>

</p><p>I personally think the focus on family-friendly, "wii" type games may have been the best direction at the time. They were trying to tap into the Nintendo Wii sales. But pretty much any grandma that was going to buy that type of system, already had a wii.
 The Kinect wasn't a necessity and only added to the Xbox, it didn't take anything away.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it as a webcam for streaming directly from my Xbox One but never really did anything else with it. Interestingly they use the Kinect at the major airport in New Zealand as a bag scanner when you go to drop off your bags!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Purple,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue with being able to install Fable III onto your Windows PC and are receiving an error involving an invalid product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you explain in what way the PC was formatted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Fable III being downloaded through the <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox App</a></strong> or through a different source?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clarify this for us and we'll be awaiting your response.</p>

            Well I bought the game as a disk. I completely resetted my pc. Maybe it just means that I can't use the product key more often than 2 times. I bought a new disk now since I couldn't find a solution. Thank you for your response but I thought there wouldn't
 be a better solution.

<h2>            File History does not back up blocked files.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>It appears that File History does not back up blocked files. This means that any attachments or files I download are not being backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest this is a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I can find is to disable blocking as per </p>
<span>
<span>
<p>http://winaero.com/blog/disable-downloaded-files-from-being-blocked-in-windows-10/#comment-8834</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a better option I would be happy to find it?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>The problem exists since upgrading to windows 10. The log reports that it cannot back up the file because it is encrypted or i do not have access permissions. In fact the file is not encrypted and i do have permissions. Actually the file is blocked because
 it is from an online source (my email account). I just spent one and a half hours with Microsoft online support, so please ensure you understand the question before suggesting fixes. In particular please ensure you know about blocked files and what File History
 should do with those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>from my conversation I have been told there is no fix for this. This is either the desired behaviour for File History or it is a bug. I think it is not the behaviour I would expect, so it is a bug in my opinion. My understanding is that the techs here are
 able to file bug reports. If you think file history should back up blocked files then please submit a bug report.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Menu tiles do not display correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> o.meesook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu tiles do not display correctly</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've been hit with the issue wherein the Start Button did not respond. First time was yesterday, and I was able to find a fix (I used the method where new net users were created and then I copied the new database folder from AppData folder to replace
 my corrupted one). I lost the old setting of the tiles and they all reset to default. But that's not a big deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today after restarting my PC, the updates were installing itself, and my PC restarted again before it even entered Windows. Then it kept doing it repeatedly, for about 6 times, saying "We couldn't complete the updates. Undoing changes. Don't turn off your
 computer." every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it finally launched Windows successfully, I found that my Calculator (pinned to task bar) is missing. The app is still *somewhat* there but the icon just became blank. I could click the Calculator blank icon and it would start. BUT it will terminate
 itself in a few second, never even complete loading the interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worse yet, my Start Menu Button stopped working again. This time, the method I used no longer worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried about 5 more methods and my Start Button finally got back to working. However, the Calculator icon was still missing. When I looked in the Start Menu, the tiles are all weird. Many of them have the name starting with @{microsoft. ..... something.
 As attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. It is not only hard to navigate, but all these tiles cannot launch the app, as the app would kill itself within a few seconds and never function like they used to.</p>

            <p>Hello! Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Upon booting my PC again, now my Start Button also stopped working. Worse yet, network button also stopped working. I am using wireless internet connection and now am only able to connect to my default "connect automatically" one, unable to switch connection
 or open network menu. Additionally, other program icons and folder icon on task bar stopped responding to Right Click.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I tried both of these:&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div>
<p>Your PC isn't working well and you recently installed an app, driver, or update.</p>
</td>
<td>
<div>
<p>Restore from a system restore point</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<div>
<p>Your PC isn’t working well and it’s been a while since you installed an app, driver, or update.</p>
</td>
<td>
<div>
<p>Reset your PC</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I tried second one first (because I hadn't installed any new apps for a while), and then first one. &nbsp; The reset method had installation failed after installation went for a while and it was executing first reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The installation screen then was stuck in a loop where it kept saying (on blue screen)
</p>
<p>"<em> :( Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart for you. If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE
</em>"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>After a few repeated reboots, the black screen with a window logo then said <em>
"Undoing changes"</em> and then after next reboot, it said <em>"Scanning and repairing drive (C:)"</em> when it was eventually completed, it managed to launch windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I checked Restore options, but my PC doesn't have any restore point. So I cannot do anything.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I then tried <strong><span>sfc/scannow </span></strong><span>method, and it said something where I failed to take note. If my memory serves, it said it found some errors but was unable to repair some of them. Rebooting after this point didn't solve any of
 my problems. I have, however, made a copy of the scan detail, as advised by other online source and saved it as sfcdetails.txt. Please let me know if you need its content to further help me in this.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After that, I also tried <strong>dism</strong> method, all three steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First one returned:</strong><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</em><br />

<em>The component store is repairable.</em><br />
<em>The operation completed successfully.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>Second one returned this:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</em><br />

<em>[==========================100.0%==========================]</em><br />
