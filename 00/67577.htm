    <title>Controller no longer charging&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Controller no longer charging&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently my Xbox One controller has not been charging properly.<br />
I bought my Xbox One back in March when Titanfall was released, and at the same time I bought the official play and charge kit.<br />
I had an issue with my original controller and sent it back to MS for a replacement.<br />
I updated the controller when I received it and all was well.<br />
<br />
These past couple of weeks however the battery isn't charging.<br />
It runs flat, so I plug in the USB cable, but after about a minute the orange light turns white and the on-screen display shows the controller as plugged in but not charging.<br />
If I remove the lead from the controller, the on-screen display shows the better is in the red.<br />
I've tried updating the controller, but this changes nothing.<br />
Is there any way I can resolve this issue?<br />
I'm going to be extremely *** off if I have to buy another play and charge kit so soon.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the application?  Are you downloading it from the maker's site only?  
<br />
<br />Can you try another browser like Chrome or Firefox?
<br />
<br />Extract if necessary then right click the installation setup file to Run as Administrator.
<br />
<br />Do you have any other performance problems besides this?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            What is the name and version of the application?
<br />Probably a corrupted download.
<br />
<br />I would try downloading again and see if it works.
<br />
<br />Do the following to ensure it downloads and installs successfully:
<br />
<br />Its a new feature in Windows 10 1709. For users who might be getting that error, here is how you remove.
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />Also in Windows Defender Security Center
<br />
<br />Open App &amp; browser control
<br />Set 'Check apps &amp; files' to off 
<br />
<br />You might want to do the same for Microsoft Edge

<h2>            On Acer Aspire 6920 builtin speakers stopped working in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>On my Acer Aspire 6920, the built in speakers have stopped working. They started not working, on and a few times, about 6 months ago. Eventually they stopped working all together. A red light is being emitted from the headphone jack. Any external audio devices
 that I plug in (external speakers, headphones) work fine, but the built in speakers continue to not work. The sound controls are all turned on, playback devices are set to default on speakers (High definition audio device), and they all are listed as "working".
 When I do a sound test, the test runs, but no sound comes out. When I run the test with external speakers plugged in, the sound works fine. I have reinstalled the audio drivers already. It almost seems as though the computer in constantly reading that the
 headphone jack is occupied. I hope you can help me. It's obviously not the sound card, because external devices work, and I don't think the speakers are shot, because control panel/ sound says they are working. I have Windows Vista and Windows 7 both installed.
 The problem started happening while there was only Vista installed, so the installation of Windows 7 did not affect it. The problem does also occur while Using the Windows 7 OS however.&nbsp; I appreciate your help.<br />

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Dan,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Since your External speakers work fine as expected and the issue is only confined to your internal speakers; evidently the issue is
 related to internal speakers itself. </span></p>
<p><span>You may want to check for any settings in BIOS to enable your internal speakers</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Modifying<strong>BIOS
 (Basic input output system)/</strong>complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may want to check with Acer for any known issues with your internal speakers</span></p>

<p>Hello davdo, welcome.<br />
<br />
How long has this issue been present?<br />
<br />
You can try to run an System File Checker (SFC) from Command Prompt to see if it will fix the problem.</p>
<p>1. Click START<br />
2. Type 'cmd' (without quotes). Right click the result (there should only be one)<br />
and select 'Run as Administrator'<br />
3. Type 'sfc /scannow' (without quotes) and press enter<br />
4. When prompted, insert your Windows XP install/recovery CD<br />
5. Once finished, restart your computer<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps,<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;just commented on another post about this topic, I'll provide you with the same info I&nbsp;did for them, if after reading this you are an IPv6 customer, I&nbsp;will walk you through the changes you need to make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost your ISP (internet service provider) needs to actually support and offer IPv6 protocol. Your equipment may be capable of handling this updated protocol but unless they offer IPv6 you won't have the benefit of the new technology. Most providers today still have not updated their systems to provide their customers with this technology. Hope I&nbsp;could help.</p>

<p>There has to be a verification from the OP, if their ISP support IPv6, and from there, we're able to assist. There's no difference in the setup between IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>That is as long as you use DHCP for IPv6 and not SLAAC.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Laptop stuck on &#34;Repairing disk errors.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I got a new laptop the week after Christmas and it has been working fine until now. Yesterday, while I was using it, it froze and went to a screen that said there was an error called exclusion-store-exception, it wanted to restart, and I could look up the
 error after it was finished. It then turned back on saying, Preparing Automatic Repair &gt; it went blank for like 20 minutes &gt; diagnosing your PC &gt; Repairing disk errors. This might take over an hour to complete. Then it gets stuck and has been doing that for
 about 8 hours. I tried turning it off and back on and it just does it all over again. If anyone has a solution to this that would be great!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop model is Toshiba Satellite C55t-C5300 if that helps. Also it had windows 10 on it when I bought it.</p>

    <title>Game Data Transfer Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tapferer wulf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Data Transfer Problem</h2>
                    
<p>My problem is this: I recently upgraded to an xbox 360S with the small on-board memory. I moved my important data and a few games onto this small memory unit and later on I upgraded with the larger internal unit.&nbsp; My problem is that while most of my data
 moved to the larger unit with ease, when I try to move my game data over to the larger unit, it won't transfer the data and tells me "Cannot transfer data between profiles".&nbsp; What does this mean and how can I successfully move my game data over? It wouldn't
 be a big deal, however the memory that comes with the 360s is entirely inadequate and almost completely consumed with this data.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To fix the internet, use a working machine that is able to connect to Asus's support website. Locate the drivers page for your machine and download the Wireless or Wi-Fi driver for Windows 10. Then transfer that driver to the problem machine via a USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install the latest wireless driver to see if the internet connection reappears.</p>

    <title>Buying apps from other countries&#47;languages store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> decatec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buying apps from other countries&#47;languages store</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got it. I bought mine from MS Germany, but live in Italy. I want to buy some apps for my kids, but they're not available in Italian so I want to buy them from UK or US store. If I set my region to US or UK&nbsp; I cannot pay with a&nbsp;CC as the check of the
 set region with the italian billing address of my CC is preventing me to buy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way around it? Non english stores have very few apps at the moment, if I have no chance to buy some stuff from english stores for the kids I will return it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, buying stuff from MS online stores is&nbsp;not very userfriendly be it as MS certified partner, &nbsp;MCT or private user, MS ought to spruce it up a bit to make it more userfriendly.
</p>

<h2>            Password reset via mobile phone not working</h2>
                    <p>I am locked out of my Microsoft account as I forgot my password. The account has 2FA enabled. I have tried to get a code sent to my registered mobile. Its not coming. I have been told by Microsoft that this feature is not working at the moment. I find this
 unacceptable as I am now locked out of my account with no way of recovering it. How many other people will be in this situation shortly I wonder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No-one at Microsoft appears to have any idea when this may be fixed (If its true that its broken)</p>

<h2>            How to recover&#47;decrypt my encrypted files, or recover my private key&#63;. Same computer, same user, but lost everything after I deleted the account and recreated it. Please help me.</h2>
                    <p><span>On the 22nd of this month, my computer shut down when I was away. I still have no idea whether it shut down by itself or it was a power cut.
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>But when I reached it, and started the PC I found that all the apps and user data missing. Nothing configured as before, no shortcuts, none of any application that I own has its configurations.
<br />
I had to finish work and had to have my user account configured files, as before in. So I made a local account, deleted my Microsoft user account, then re-add it again, same Microsoft account, same email, same password; I thought it would sync everything, and
 everything would be fixed (</span><span> It didn't.)</span><span>, in that rush, when asked by windows (while deleting my user account) whether to delete user data or keep, I like instantly
 chose delete data.</span><br />
<span>What's more disastrous to soon realise, is that I didn't take caution about my encrypted files. Which later I
<span>What's more disastrous to soon realise, is that I didn't take caution about my encrypted files. Which later I
</span><span>couldn't manage to access any of my windows encrypted files at all, my life are in those files.</span><br />
<span>All encrypted files are under the sword of just a private key or a certificate or whatever windows is saying, I can't figure anything anymore.</span><br />

<p><span>Now everything seems horrendous, those files are literally my life, without then I'm..., don't know what to say.
</span><span><span><span>These encrypted files are my life my work and my family, I am seeking any help that could aid in recovering anything.

</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>The night that I left my computer and went away, I, for no reason, but feeling anxious &amp; worried, from the constant windows 10 crashes/bugs since my upgrade, was decrypting all my files on the disk ( I
 hope it did that earlier), and because it showed that it'd take long time, I left the computer for the whole night, doing it, which by next morning, found it shut down as I said earlier.<br />
</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Since the problem occurred, and till now, I have managed to recover deleted data, as I could, there are many files, some are from the user folders in the windows Users folder.</span></span></span></li><li><span>I managed by going to machine certificates to recover all the available certificates, even the one that has the same thumbprint.<br />
</span></li><li><span>Another thing to mention ( I don't know whether it would help or not), is that before upgrading to windows 10, I was using a local account, and when I made the a new user by my Microsoft account, Outlook email address,
 the user name for the user profile has been named after the first few letters of my email address. I wanted to change that to be my usual user name that I always used, so I went and renamed the user (first few letters of my email address) to be what I wanted,
 from 'Computer Management'</span><br />
</li></ol>
<p><span>I wish someone has a real technical solution, I have been doing everything I know since the problem occurred, but all boils down to my own limited&nbsp;knowledge.
<br />
</span><span>Any legal procedures needed, will be taken by immediately. I have nothing more important than to recover my files.</span></p>

<p>Hi Eeshwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which data you are meaning here?<br />
1-I have an older backup of my computer when it was on windows 8.1.</p>
<p>**This backup is an image backup of the windows; I doubt that it has the same user certificate or encryption key, as I remember I mostly have changed them after I upgraded to windows 10.<br />
2-I don't care about the data in my user account folders on C:, I do care about my encrypted files on other partitions. ( But I know that the importance of data on C, is of those files that were representing the User certificate or key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as I mentioned in detail, in my question, I have recovered many files and folders that were deleted from the /users folders; I really believe that this should help in something.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Please, it's very technical, I believe someone with intent to help, could aid in solving it.</span><br />
<p><br />
Is there any application, any way of solution?</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Overheating and Shutting Down Without Notice or Reason - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turtletom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Overheating and Shutting Down Without Notice or Reason &#40;2017&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Surface Pro 3, 128gb (i5 processor) for 12 months and 3 weeks. The warranty expired 3 weeks ago, so I am out of luck there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason the computer started shutting down without any notice or warning. After it shuts down, I have to wait about 30 mins to an hour to get it to finally turn back on (Assuming this for the computer to cool down). When turning it back on, I have
 to hold down the power switch for 30 seconds to get it powered up and it doesn't give me an error or reason for shut down when I get it started up. I noticed that the fan gets a little louder just before it shuts down and looking through posts, this appears
 to be a fairly common overheating issue (Although I cannot seem to find anything recently). &nbsp;I also notice it tends to get hot in the top right corner near the USB port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep it updated to the latest software and OS updates and I disabled all background apps that were not necessary. &nbsp;The computer will shut down when I do minimal tasks or even when there are no applications running and sitting idle. &nbsp;I haven't restored
 my computer and want to try out other options first, but will do that if that is necessary (which I am kind of afraid to do since I don't want it to overheat while restoring and causing other issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this issue recently or with newer software updates? I am seeing lots of posts about putting it in the freezer, getting an external fan, and other temporary fixes, but that doesn't really resolve the overall problem. &nbsp;Based off of the information
 I am seeing, people had this fixed with a system update, but those are older posts so I am not sure if that is what is needed for me. I tried to contact Microsoft, but they will not talk to me unless I pay $30 since I am out of warranty. &nbsp;If I cannot resolve
 this myself, then I will contact them, but I wanted to ask around first and try to troubleshoot it first.<br />

            <p>The First thing I would tell you to do is to bring it to a local Microsoft store if you have 1 near you. They will look at the unit for you without charge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of your updates are good, I would clean install the OS and see if the issue stays but this is the fastest way of knowing if you have a hardware defect or a software issue. Make sure after you do that run all of the updates.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem, &nbsp;reading some older posts from November last year; it would appear that unplugging external devices inc. the kinect seemed to sort it! Weird.</p>

<p>Try holding the Xbox logo on the front of the console for 5 seconds. &nbsp;The console should turn off and clear the cache and what ever else it clears and then turn it back on. &nbsp;This has worked for me a couple times for the same issue. &nbsp;Otherwise I read you
 have to restore the Xbox one to its factory settings which would suck having to redownload everything. &nbsp;Good luck</p>
