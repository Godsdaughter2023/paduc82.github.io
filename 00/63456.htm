    <title>Shared Printer Not Available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Shared Printer Not Available</h2>
                    <div>I have a USB connected printer configured as a shared printer amongst all of my other workstations (running Windows 10).&nbsp; Normally, the printer is turned off and only turned on when I need to print.&nbsp; However, when I attempt to print from one of the other
 workstations in the workgroup I receive an error message indicating the printer is not available.&nbsp; When I run diagnostics on the workstation that has the printer connected to it, it does not find a problem.&nbsp; If I send a document to the printer from the printer
 attached workstation, the printer is able to print the document.&nbsp; Once this has been done, print jobs to the shared printer from the other workstations work properly.</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a problem with Windows 10 not passing a change of printer status to the other devices in the workgroup once the printer has been turned on.&nbsp; Or, when the other workstations send a query regarding the printer status, the workstation owning
 the printer fails to provide a response.&nbsp; There could also be a fault in Windows 10 not recognizing a change in the USB connection indicating the device is now on-line.</p>
</div>

    <title>Black Screen with blinking dash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jheger113  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen with blinking dash</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to TRY to switch back to Windows 10 after I installed Linux. Unfortunately, using my Flash Drive and reformatting it numerous times through various methods and restoring the ISO from Microsoft, it keeps giving me a black screen with a blinking
 dash instead of a boot screen or not bootable. The flash drive is fine because if I reformat and put Linux on it, it will install fine. I have already formatted Linux to a regular formatted drive (a non Linux drive), to no avail. I do NOT have a Windows Computer
 to format the ISO on the Flash Drive, so I used a Mac to try to install the Windows 10 ISO through simply unarchiving the file and copying it on to boot camping it on several formats (I know it doesn't matter, but I thought I try.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? I could not find a solution through Google besides trying what I already did. Does Microsoft have an easier way that I am missing or is all their installation software exclusive to Windows? (Which I won't even get into how infuriating that
 would be.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I've installed many different operating systems on my PC, and I think I can help. What you've described is simiar to what happens when I try to boot from my DVD-RW drive without a disc in it. The reason for this is the drive is not bootable. Niether
 is one of my Audio CD's, which also display that black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first, you can downlod the ISO on your Linux OS, then I need to know what variant of Linux you're using. Is it Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, or any other? This will help me fix your problem by determining how to create a bootable flash drive for that version.
 Also, sorry that you had to wait so long for a reply from someone on this post, I just decided to scroll through this section to see who I can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h3> davidrich2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repair by Microsoft Tech Support with 10 digit case file number&#59; refund&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was working with 4th tech support in windows 10 repair, my setting icons does not activate.&nbsp; They said there was an error and were going to pay me $300 as a refund, then they put in $1,350 from Chase Bank, said it was an error, my bank said nothing was
 deposited.&nbsp; Is this valid?&nbsp; all I want is to have my setting opened to see about windows update and window defender, i do not want the money, I just want to know what to do to get my system restored, tried twice with previous tech reps, got the 10 digit case
 number and e-mails, but still can not open and run settings.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; they ran system restore, I did it once and with back up got it right, but it crashed again.&nbsp; they did it, using Windows 10 and it was able to prevent loss of all files, but then they
 said my Windows would not work any more.&nbsp; they said the computer was no longer getting updates to windows, to my AMD HD Graphics processor.&nbsp; They valiated I have 70 unused reward points in my Microsoft account and that my balance is $0.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>do i go to th Geek Squad at Best Buy for the review and repair, do i just use this as a boat anchor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last guy worked for about 1 hour said he needed 4 more hours to work on my computer with GoToAssist and with Remote PC software apps.&nbsp; I watch as they both failed, he tried 3 times for Setting Icon to run, like me, as I tried, it froze up for 30 to 40
 seconds and went blank.&nbsp; However in the system recover, with just 18 hours of life before failure, the click on the icon to run and go; loading blue circle launched for window defender.&nbsp; Again 2 tries and with 2 more failures to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using other steps, I can get into Windows Defender and all is good, updates are good, firewall and protection, all categories are good.&nbsp; but i can not get into settings.&nbsp; It is looking like a hardware failure, not a software glitch.&nbsp; I think only a bench
 tech can resolve this one, needs an oscillascope to measure voltage flows and ohms, not just programming updates.&nbsp; I hope this is a learning curve practice for me and you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With new lap tops at $129 at wally world, is that the solution?</p>

            Hi David
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Something sounds suspicious about this. 
<br />
<br />Could you point us to the website link where you accessed this tech support? Because this sounds like you might have been scammed. 
<br />
<br />2018 has turned out to be a year when fake scare sites have appeared all over the Internet with fake ads pretending to Microsoft support and insisting you call them. You need to watch out for these sites. They look like a genuine Microsoft website but they are not. 
<br />
<br />Warning: There are "Tech Support Scams" pretending to be Windows 10 Support and Activation Technologies. Please be vigilant. Microsoft never calls or emails users to inform them their license is expiring, accounts will be closed or they need access to sensitive information such as passwords or banking information. Neither should you get an email. Learn more in the following article:

<br />
<br />If you believe sensitive information such as bank passwords might have been compromised, go to another computer and change it immediately. Contact your bank to let them know of any suspicious activities.
<br />
<br />Change your other passwords for services such as emails and other important web sites you visit.
<br />
<br />Have a notepad near by so you can write down the new passwords.

<br />Let friends and family know on social media, they should not accept any request begging for money or disclose sensitive information, since someone might be pretending to be you. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you consider reinstalling Windows 10 using the following steps:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi David
<br />
<br />Please have nothing more to do with the person you were dealing with, this is all a Tech Support Scam and they will empty your bank account if you are not careful - whomever you are dealing with - you are not dealing with Microsoft Support personnel
<br />
<br />1
<br />Please explain briefly what the actual problem(s) you are having with Windows 10 is, and we will try to help you with that . .. 
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. and build No. of Windows 10 are you running?

<p>I have gotten 3 wonderful replies!&nbsp; And with a follow up a validation and authentication from Microsoft by Sanjay, he has confirmed the attempt to fraud by confirming that there is no refund, the repair is free.&nbsp; he did one of a dozen measures and found
 in a test that the Windows 10 would not launch, so a higher level is being sought to apply the right fix.&nbsp; it is not a hardware issue, diagnostics confirm it, it is a system error.&nbsp; As we note it takes 9 hours to trouble shoot and then once we find what is
 wrong, 9 seconds to fix.&nbsp; Perspiration must always be matched with inspiration so that perspicacity will gain the high ground and plant the right seed for purfication and restoration.&nbsp; working with Sanjay was one of the highlites of my life, and like the 3
 responses, I know that his equals also exist in this world filled with who knows what is lurking under the covers!&nbsp; It is a blessing to be poor, but not poor in spirit.&nbsp; I will reply to each of the kind responders for their attention to detail and vast and
 profuse words of wisdom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helping a hearing and visually impaired, disabled veteran has been a joy for me to receive such blessings.&nbsp; I will post a final result, hoping to be a blessing to others and advance human relations into a higher level, we all need to rise up.&nbsp; Sorry to see
 that my issues began when I confirmed my registery to Donate to Life Indiana web visit and got lured into a "you've been picked for a survey".</p>

 on a shallow side of wrong, but had no harm in the end.&nbsp; I have seen these terms powershell, did not understand it.&nbsp; i know enough to be very, very dangerous!&nbsp; I put out a general reply, you are one of the elite wise men that i mentioned.&nbsp; i shall post a final

<p>Andre, your are so right and with a plethora of treatments!&nbsp; others have voice in like you as "Angels" trumpeting the Good News!&nbsp; Vijay and Sanjay have also given wisdom and tactics, with more advanced support coming from Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run windows 10 for more than 2 years, and got hit with an issue, I hope you read my post reply to all, it explains the time line and the issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I boxed in school and as the ref said at the beginning of each fight, "gentlemen, defend your self."&nbsp; I did not see this as a fight and was lulled into the corner guessing that by going through Microsoft Support, getting a case file #, that there were sharks
 out on the edges of the reef, and I did not comprehend how they were aware of my plight, with many wantint to help, there was 1 in 10 with other motives.&nbsp; We want to believe but let our hopes and dream candy coat our expectations and I let my guard down.&nbsp;
 With a shot to the head, It stirred up my defenses and my bank stepped up and threw a wet towel over my head, put smelling salts under my nose and told me to take some deep breathes!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>you wisely mention to wait on the computer to process.&nbsp; &nbsp;Like most 69 year old visually and hearing impaired disable american veterans, I do not equate patience with computers.&nbsp; I only like them because they put me on my knees where i can praise my Lord
 and Saviour.&nbsp; He humbles those Whom He loves, and I need to learn again what I learned in Kindegarden, it is good to take a nap and have graham crackers.&nbsp; If you keep down and stay down, most of what is flying overhead will not bother you.</p>
<p>Thank you for the very positive and very impressive deeply thought provoking advise!</p>

<p>As my windows 10 is down, and with Cortana, I can not access the last version level installed.&nbsp; It was last put in and was sustained on 18 May 2019 when i did a system restore, it all worked then, but the restore proccess failed me and the tech reps twice
 as they also tried.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not open the setting ICON, in the big blue box with the white gear.&nbsp; It opens but the cursor does not spin, stays as a white arrow for 30 to 40 seconds.&nbsp; then it drops out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>He said it is an issue that needs higher level correction, the profile is corrupted.&nbsp; he said they do not do refunds, and that the 4th guy was a fraud, Microsoft does not do $1,350 refunds let alone $300.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi David
<br />
<br />You are most welcome. This is a big problem we are seeing and I think key to battling it is education. Thats why I had to be so verbose in my reply. I really want users to be aware of this problem and know the signs so they can protect themselves. 
<br />
<br />Just know that anyone asking for money or bank information should immediately be dropped.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have an appointment for the Tech Support to go to the next level in the free no cost, no charge repair of my Windows Software.&nbsp; I have 70 Reward points in my account, my account balance is $0.00.&nbsp; This last rep said there is no refund, that it was a scam.&nbsp;
 I have documented proof that the scam came from the same 1 800 267 3214 Microsoft technical support phone number.&nbsp; 5 out of 6 technical reps have confirmed the fraud, but no one has any idea who go on their phone line.&nbsp; This one person asked me on the phone
 and on the screen if I did on line banking.&nbsp; I said no, he was not given the codes to use the card on which he said a $1,350 transfer was made.&nbsp; My bank confirmed it was not made and they recommended that I close out the card, which was done and shredded,

Yes, I have, run that&nbsp; and deleted all I&nbsp; am sure I could delete. Neverteheless, that only brought it to 1.19GB free of 27.7 GB. I can't add any GB in this notebook, 27.7 BG is the total of it and IDK what else I can delete without hurting the system

<p>Look down the list and see if there is any ref to old windows files, or anything where the size&nbsp;is shown in GB. Make a note of items size in GB and post back here. I'll try to advise if they can be selected for removal. You can also select the More Options

            <p>Yes,</p>
<p>I ran it a few times including the system cleanup, and oddly I now have&nbsp; even less free space left than before . The only GB's on the list is
<em>temp. Windows install. files, 4.27 GB.</em>&nbsp; that the scan did not&nbsp; check off. The rest is a few small&nbsp; MB's ("total amount of disk space you gain: 18.7MB")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presently, the local Disk C: NTFS is now&nbsp; 2.65 MB free of&nbsp; 27.7&nbsp; </p>
<p>Are those temporary Windows install . files expendable? Thanks!</p>

            Acctually, neilpzz, I did gain a little more than I thought, 500 MB's. Now I wonder if I shouldn't just go transfer some of the more important files&nbsp; to a new laptop w. more space&nbsp; and then clear off everything to just restore this notebook to factory&nbsp;
 condition so that I can use it again for&nbsp; a while longer.&nbsp; Can this be done? The notebook came as an 8.1 that got the WIN 10 "upgrade" that it may not have been equipped to&nbsp; handle. Back then, the Assure&nbsp; tech said that it was compatible and could handle it
 - but it appears that 27.7 GB is not nearly enough. It sure would be nice being able to use&nbsp; it for daily little stuff. I do not&nbsp;use Assure anymore,&nbsp; as I had&nbsp;several bad experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Mechelle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Reset has failed.  I would go to another PC to create the bootable media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  Mechelle318
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />

<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Mechelle
<br />
<br />That reset operation has not completed correctly, your recovery image may be corrupt . . .
<br />
<br />Try resetting your PC again, and if that fails, your best option is to clean install Windows 10, which will also repair your recovery image . . 
<br />
<br />1
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset 
<br />
<br />2
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Change Default Color of Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimpalatini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Default Color of Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>When I was first setting up my surface, one of the things it does is asks you to pick a color, which was all very exicting. However I tend to be extremely indecisive, and I now that I've been using it for more than a week I'd like to know how to change the
 color that appears when you change the PC settings or click the Windows button on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been clicking around for a while now and I'm not sure if the color is associated with the Microsoft account or the computer itself, but it doesn't appear to be something I can change by just going to the Personalization menu.</p>
<p>If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t play facebook videos</h2>
                    I Have Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit), Internet Explorer 9, on a HP G60 laptop.I also have Flash Player 11.1.102.63. When I click play on a facebook video, the video disappears, and leaves a blank spot. I've tried MicrosoftFixit.IEAddon.Run.exe and MicrosoftFixit.Codec.Run.exe.
 They&nbsp;did not help. I can play videos on youtube with no problems.

<h2>            Windows 10 and DLNA Devices</h2>
                    <p>With Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, I could connect to my PC from my Onkyo receiver via my home network and DLNA. I could easily access and play music from my MP3 library stored on my PC. I could access individual titles, albums, artists or
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Media Player playlists.</span>&nbsp; Since installing Windows 10 Professional 64-bit,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I can no longer access my playlists</span>. I can access individual songs, artists and albums
 and, using Media Player, stream to the Onkyo. I've check all setting in the media and streaming center and I believe they are correct with the Onkyo having access to all files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I access my Playlists with the Onkyo now that I am running Windows 10?&nbsp; Have they been reformatted by Groove Music?&nbsp; When I attempt to reinstall Windows Media Player, I receive an error message to the effect that my O/S in not compatible. Can I reformat
 the playlists to the old file format?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're unable to access Playlists with the Onkyo device since upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp;I suspect the issue might due to incompatible drivers. Suggest you to check and install the latest drivers from device Manufacture's website and see
 it fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If no updated drivers available for your device on the manufacturer’s website for windows 10, then trying installing the available one&nbsp;in compatibility mode.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on

<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists</span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query.</p>

                    &nbsp;The printer is connected to my desktop and is a part of my network. However, I have tried both installing the printer and troubleshooting (which is what it said it needed next to status of the printer in the network) and neither of the options worked.
 What do you suggest I try?

            <p>Thanks for the advice! I appreciate your kindness and a good solution that you may have thought of or searched it up from the internet but here was the actual problem I have actually found out before.</p>
<p>The troubleshoot app says that Simcity 4 Is an incompatible application after I were trying to find another solution with the troubleshooting application. So is there any other accurate solutions you could probably try giving me so I don't have to deal with
 the incompatible version of Simcity 4 please? Thank you for everything. :)</p>

                    Love my Surface Pro 3 but the screen automatically locks if I don't touch it or use the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm reading&nbsp;something or&nbsp;walk away&nbsp;for longer than 30-60 sec. &nbsp;the screen will locks&nbsp;and I have to enter the password etc. to unlock it.&nbsp; It's extremely
 annoying!&nbsp;&nbsp; I did adjust power settings as suggested in one of the other posts, but it still did not resolve my auto-lock issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoughts..?

 doesn't work .and there is not tech support for ea.com and if there is they don't bother to contact me when I try to send a help request to them so I guess I'm **** out of luck sorry but I'm beyond frustrated and very dissatisfied with windows 8.Origin tech
 told me that Sims 3 isn't compatible with windows 8 but others on sims3.com said it is which is it .I do not want the run around anymore I want the problem fixed I do not pay almost 50 bucks at times for these games to not get to play them

            <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I don't believe the issues you are having are purely down to Windows 8 or indeed Windows 7.&nbsp; I'm currently running Windows 8-64 bit edition and my Sims 3 works fine, no issues at all.&nbsp; It also worked without problems in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
My only conclusion to your issue I can think of is that your computer either does not have the latest drivers or the Sims 3 is not compatible with your PC's hardware configuration.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me what your PC Specs are? Or the make and model of your PC/Laptop?<br />
<br />
I can't promise anything, but I can take a look.</p>

            I had the same problem after installing windows 8.1.<br />
It seems to be a rights issue.<br />
ALthoug the game wouldn't launch in a normal account with administrator-rights it plwyed well as administrator in the administrator-account. And, you won't believe. After playing as administrator in it's own account the game launched well in all the other accounts.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />

uninstall your existing adobe reader.. to unstall you need to go to Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features and select adobe reader and select uninstall..
<br />
<br />
then install latest adobe reader.. <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/reader/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
To find your old downloads go to press widows and R key together and type downloads and click ok
