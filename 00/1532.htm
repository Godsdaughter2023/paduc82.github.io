<h2>            My sms messages from France sent on skype do not reach my friend in Dubai, why &#63;</h2>
                    I don't know what has happened since yesterday. I have a friend at the hoospital in Dubai. I have sent him 5 messages ( texts). &nbsp;He didn't receive one. How come ? I think it's the first time I am experiencing such a disappointment. Is there a special reason
 ?

            For some reason Skype doesn't work too well in the UAE, I'm not sure if the government is blocking it. I use imo with my contacts in these countries.<br />

<p>Thanks for letting me know that my skype messages can't reach my sick friend. But previously he always received my texts. So I think it must come from Skype itself and I regret it very much because it was far less expensive than by any other phone provider.
 How can I get in touch with Skype operators ?</p>
<p>I am grateful for your answer.</p>

            Thanks for your answer. You are right. I must try another media. From my mobile I can send messages to the UAE in Dubai but it is much more expensive than from Skype. Some time ago teh skype messages could be read in Dubai. Since they have upgraded the
 system it seems impossible. And I regret it. Sincerely.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most common reason why your contacts will no show up is because you are signed in to&nbsp;a different account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a specific Skype Name/Username, please sign out from the Skype application and then sign-in again using your Skype Name/Username instead of your email.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Activation error with Office</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to activate a renewed Office license via Word, I'm able to sign in to the account. It then says the computer is associated with the account. However, it will then give me an error code when attempting to complete the activation. It says the

            <p>Hi Chelsea, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To address your concern, you may try the following methods to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: Temporary disable your antivirus software</span></strong><br />
<br />
Disabling your third-party antivirus software before activating Office may also help. You can re-enable or reinstall the Anti-virus software once you have finished installing Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2: Turn off the Windows Firewall temporarily<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;<strong> &gt; Windows Firewall &gt; Turn Windows Firewall on or off.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 3: Activate product through phone<br />
</strong></span></p>

 &nbsp;I have rebuilt the identity and recreated the profile.</div>

            I see the same behavior, so I don't believe anything is working
    incorrectly. This is more than likely by design.<br />

<h2>            Conditional Formatting row based on a cell</h2>
                    Hello. I am using Excel 2007 and I am having a problem with the conditional formatting. I would like to format the entire row based in information found in one column. This is the problem: I am using column A to P and rows 1 to 66 with row 1 being the
 header row. I have four Universities spread across column A they are USF, FIU, UF, FSU. I would like everything affiliated with the USF row to be highlighted in red, FIU rows in green, UF rows in blue and FSU rows in purple. How can I get this to work? I keep
 doing it but it will highlight some but not all or it will highlight both USF and some of the other schools in yellow as well. Thank you.

<h2>            Last 20 builds have all crashed daily. But not if I switch back to Vista</h2>
                    I have an old drive with Vista and when I plug it in, there are no problems. With every Win 10 build of the last 6 months, there have been frequent "DPC WATCHDOG" crashes. My most recent build? That is very hard to find now, but it's Version 1607 OS Build
 14915-1000&nbsp; I admit it took 2 days for the first crash on this one, fooling me into thinking the problem might be solved. Now it's Daily Crashes. What's the answer? Go back to Vista and stay there long as I can? The last 6 month of builds have all been the
 worst thing since DOS 4.0 (which I never owned). Heck, Win 95 would be better than Win 10 BTW I found something a month ago about submitting crash files, but in the end, the "Wiky" or whatever it is called doesn't tell you where to send them. I complain and
 and told I should go back to second grade and learn how to read. Well, I read quite well. Instructions for where the send the dmp files are NOT THERE.&nbsp; I work mainly with Wordperfect which does not run on a Mac.&nbsp; I

            As you didn't supply any info about your system, but you did mention that it works fine with an old Vista Hard Drive, my thoughts without seeing any info about your system is that it is probably border line for running Windows 10, so if you can post some
 info about your system, and being a Beta version/build of Windows (14915 which has a few issues) that you are using, we as unpaid volunteers might be able to help you with the issues. As pointed out by MS we should not use Beta Preview software as our everyday
 system, as you stated that you have thousands and thousands of pages being used on a beta system, I hope you have saved them to some kind of back up system as beta version have been known to crash, delete files, glitches, ect's &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for your response. By the way, the first several builds did not have this problem. I got the first build about a month before the OS was offered for sale to the public. (I am not considering Windows 7 as an option because it takes hours of coaxing
 to get downloads to begin with it. I'm waiting for over 60 opdates on another machine and no go. But that's a separate issue.) I didn't supply HW info because Win 10 will not let me copy/past it. So here it is longhand typed:</p>
<p>AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4800+ 2.50 Ghz (It's a Dell OPtiplex 740)</p>
<p>3.00 GB Ram</p>
<p>32 bit operating system x64 based (2.87 GB usable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Just read the rest of your response, the really insulting part. My first computer was an IBM 360. From that I went on to a Univac 1108 which had 36 bit words. That was the first assembler I ever learned.&nbsp; 36 bit words. No such thing as a "byte." Octal
 Arithmetic.&nbsp; Were you the guy that told me to "read the Wiky" a month or two ago?&nbsp; Either way, I am sick of being patronized. Just because I am 68 years old people think I am senile. I am not. Oh, on the hardware side, I had a state machine I had designed
 running at 50 Mhz back when Intel was running about 1 Mhz. It would have run faster by the idiot tech refused to run coax and insert a 50 ohm terminator resister. He won out because the thing didn't need to run nearly that fast.
</p>
<p>PPS:&nbsp; No need to respond. Soon as I hst "submit" I am copying all my data files to a flash drive and going back to the Vista drive. If this is what being an "insider" with Microsoft mean, I'd muc rather be on the outside.

            Insulting? all I was saying is that beta testing software should not be used as an everyday system if you find that as insulting sorry but that comes from MS info that is posted about being an Insider, as for the the age thing I didn't say anything or
 assume as I'm 73 myself, and I do work on a lot of Dell's and to be honest with you a 740 enhanced version (With AMD)&nbsp;is at the lower end of working with Windows 10 as at the start of the program I installed the beta insider's preview on a couple and ran into
 to many issues but they were Intel Dual core and just had issues such as crashing and running slow they got scrapped. as my first home computer was a Vic 20 and a trash 80 did work on IBM 24 systems I'm not a programmer just a electrical/electronic engineer.

            <p>Assuming Vista is on a separate drive, remove the drive and connect the drive you use for the Insider builds. But instead of installing an Insider build try installing the Windows 10 Anniversary edition and see if you have the same issues.</p>

            <p>Visa is indeed on a separate drive, with almost the same desktop/customizations etc&nbsp; as the Win 10 preview. It just so happens I am back to that (Visa) now. What you are suggesting seems to be to wipe the other drive clean and start over with a new install
 of the same build? But if I do that, what I have been struggling to preserve will be lost. If I thought it would work I might just go out and buy Win 10 professional. But I don't. Plus, if I am going to do all that migration, I might as well do it on newer
 hardware. The only option I see is to clone the Vista drive and dry to upgrade the clone to Windows 7, which has more time to run than Visa. I think Visa ends in some 8 months. 7 gives me a couple more years which might be enough to complete my project. If
 not, I will just stop connecting the machine to the internet and continue on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What bothers me most is that Microsoft Corporation isn't the least bit interested in looking at the dump files. They claim that they are using the insider program to find bugs, but when an opportunity arises to find some, they couldn't care less.&nbsp; They
 also claim (or at least somebody does) to be willing to analyze dump files, but laugh at you, in effect, when you ask where to send them. "Read the Wiky." The wiky tells you all about the file, but doesn't tell you how to read them or where to send them. Notice,
 nobody here knows either. </p>

<p>There are many criteria for creating DMP files.&nbsp; For them to be created you need</p>
<p><span><strong>For dumps to be produced. . .<br />
</strong><br />
▪ Page file must be on OS drive<br />
*If manually set Page file base allocation size must be &gt; than installed physical RAM</span></p>
<div>*Windows Error Reporting (WER) system service should be set to MANUAL</div>
<div>*PREFERRED&gt;&gt;&gt;Set page file to system managed on the OS drive</div>
<span>*Set system crash/recovery options to "kernel Memory Dump"<br />
*User account control must be running.<br />
* Sometimes SSD drives with older firmware do not create DMPS (update firmware)</span>
<div>
<p><span>*Cleaner&nbsp;applications&nbsp;like Ccleaner delete DMP files so don't run them until you are fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The contents of the crash is written from memory to a page file (usually) and this only completes when it gets to %100 so if you force quit before the process is complete it cannot be written from the page file to the *.DMP.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There may be a full memory dump located @ C:\windows called memory.dmp which gets over written after each crash so nothing needs to be created.</span></p>

            <p>OK, I should have said patronizing. Like I am too stupid to know I shouldn't consider beta software reliable. Save that for the 10 year olds, OK?&nbsp; I've known that for decades.&nbsp; That is why I have essentially the same system only running on another another
 drive (with a far superior OS--- Vista) that I can swap in in a couple of minutes.&nbsp; But this principle should be carried a step further: always have a non-Microsoft backup for anything important. All contemporary Microsoft s/w is "beta."&nbsp; But was I complaining
 about lost data in the first place? No. Was I complaining that in 20+&nbsp; builds Microsoft was not capable of producing a build which can go more than 24 hours without crashing? Yes. That's what happens when the #1 man retires.&nbsp; No successor is going to care
 as much. For this reason, 10 will never be as solid as 7.&nbsp; Bill ran a tight ship and kept a watchful eye. But those days are gone. And all that effort to make Win 8 work like a cell phone? What did that accomplish? It sent laptop users to Apple in droves (if
 what I see in coffee shops is any indication) and made Microsoft a virtual non-player in the smart phone market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: the VIC 20 was a toy. TThe TRash 80 was capable of serious word processing, as was the Kaypro, Te Univac 1108 in it's day was one of the fastest scientific machines in existence, even with its 1 Mhz clock. Hey, the RCA Spectra 70, a few years older with
 discrete transistors,&nbsp; ran at only 100 khz. . In any case, you gave me the answer I needed: I was throwing good time after bad in trying to get Win 10 stabilized. Neither you nor anyone else had a solution (other than making excuses and blaming me for Microsoft's
 unstable software).I have now given up on Win 10.&nbsp; </p>

            I produced many dump files. Or rather the flaky Win 10 builds produced loads of them. Over 100. The only question was where to send them. "Read the Wiky" was the only answer I ever got. The wiky was horribly written, but that wasn't the problem. Nowhere
 did it say what do do with the files, or where to send them.&nbsp; Perhaps that wiky was written in Russia? By pranksters? Could be. In any case, thanks, but I'm back to running Vista. A bit slower, but a lot more stable.<br />

            <p>Reading through the above posts, makes me smile. There's a lot of knowledgeable people about BUT there's also a lot that simply like to complain and wont do anything to help themselves or want everyone to do things for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think about it for a minute, the insider builds send back reports to MS, so there's no way in the world if they were receiving 1000's of reports per day, do you really think they are going to reply and sort out a instant fix for them all - NO WAY!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a thought -- being an insider and using the builds, instead of collecting 100's of dmp files to send, why not look yourself and see what's causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders are meant to have a few clues, and by some of the questions in this forum, some don't have the knowledge / Skills required &nbsp;- its simple enough to download the software from Microsoft (free) and read the dmp files. That way you can see what's causing
 the problems and maybe able to sort it yourself, it would give good satisfaction doing that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: lets say some program or driver is giving lots of people problems, its posted in the feedback, others upvote&nbsp; - Microsoft look&nbsp;and investigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice there's no links offered to collected dmp files, again its simple enough to upload to some file sharing site or even onedrive and supply links-- Maybe to much trouble eh !! ;) &nbsp;?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
HOSTS is a hidden file without extension in c:\windows\system\drivers\etc32<br />
<br />
Open and edit it with Notepad. But it since it has no extension, you should start Notepad first and then op the HOSTS file.<br />
<br />
The hosts.ics is omething completely different. See<br />

<br />
Don't use OPEN, just double-click on the file. When prompted, select Notepad to open it.

<p>
</p><p>Using SQL Profiler we can see excel is connecting. It doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the Analysis Services or the SQL Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started a couple of days ago, just after excel was upgraded, however this might be a coincidence.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> lb_695  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010&#58; An unexpected error has occurred when opening Sharepoint 2013 file</h2>
                    <p>We have SharePoint 2013 installed, and we edit files by using Office 2010. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
This worked fine until this week.</span></p>
<p>It might be caused by an update for Office 2010 (KB3101540)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open an Excel file from SharePoint 2013, I get the message: "An unexpected error has occurred", without Excel even showing up.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d87b6cd7-20aa-41fd-9868-8f052a60de31" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I save the Excel file to my disk, than I can open them without any problems. But obviously there's no connection to SharePoint then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried the same with Excel 365 (the latest), which can connect without any problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean installation of Office 2010, without any SP and other updates. It worked then. But when I installed the updates (via Windows Updates) it stopped working</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some details:<br />
Microsoft Excel 2010 14.0.7015.1000 SP2 (64-bit)</p>
<p>I uninstalled the latest update (KB3101540) but this didn't solve anything.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1, colleague tried has Windows 7, same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Apparently uninstalling Office 2010 Service Pack 2 , DOES fix this issue. But i don't think this is a valid solution since I would need to insure that all 200+ employees uninstall this Service Pack. And the service pack is there for a reason...</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Login Crash Loop</h2>
                    <p>I am already logged in using my Microsoft account (IE not a local account). I got an action centre notification telling me I needed to verify my account, so I tried to do so and instead got an infinite loop of the login window loading (see screenshot, also
 the taskbar doesn't always glitch up there).<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ed4cbd2-5012-4415-857b-9f7b5d9f35ce" /><br />
<br />
This happens other places where I try and log into a Microsoft service too, so that includes OneNote, windows feedback. Just tested music which logged in fine (weird)<br />
Anyone else experienced this issue/know how to fix it? <br />
</p>
<p>[EDIT] I switched to a local account and then back to a&nbsp;Microsoft account and the issue seems to have disappeared</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, you may find it easier to install a freeware converter such as CutePDF or PrimoPDF. Either of these installs itself as a virtual printer and the conversion is done by selecting CutePDF or PrimoPDF printer at File | Print.</p>

<h3> m.i.c.h.a.e.l. h.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best option to centralize company contacts</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, folks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are an Office 365 Business Premium subscriber with 21 users. Currently, each user has a local install of Outlook 2016 on their desktop... and each user is managing their own local contacts within their install. We would like to move toward a centralized
 contact list rather than all of these independent contact lists... and we would like that list to be managed by only one or two people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should we be considering a Shared Mailbox?</p>
<p>Or should we be considering a Global Address Book?</p>
<p>Or is there something better that we should be considering?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our best guess at number of contacts is around 5,000... but this will continue to grow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time!</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<div>Hi Michael,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you add the user’ local contacts into an Office 365 public folder. And then assign one or 2 users to manage the public folder. In addition, all the users can view the contacts in the public folder. For more information, you can refer to
<a href="https://www.cogmotive.com/blog/office-365-tips/create-a-company-shared-calendar-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.cogmotive.com/blog/office-365-tips/create-a-company-shared-calendar-in-office-365</a> (You may replace the folder contains “calendar items” with “contacts” there).

<h3> daneliezer  say:</h3>
<h2>            IR</h2>
                    Two points i'd like to make;<br />
<br />
first of all i reckon infra-red is way better than bluetooth in certain circumstances - sending a business card or ringtone (MIDI which are small files generally). by using ir you can have sent the thing long before bluetooth has even established a connection.
 Furthermore, IR is dead reliable it works every single time.<br />
<br />
the other point is i think there is a bug on the 6230i v3.50 when you cancel an ir transmission i.e sending a file, and then retry to send it it says ir busy or in use. you have to go back and deactivate ir and resend it.

<p>Nokia software updater -&gt; Hangs on 15%</p>
<p>Nokia Software Recovery Tool -&gt; works perfect, installed in Dutch, tried to update te phone again with 9.04 software, all with succes but I have the same languages, no Dutch.</p>

<h2>            Access not finding my ODBC connection</h2>
                    I've installed the Oracle 11g client on a new PC and set up the database connections. I am able to connect from the ODBC Data Source Administrator but in Access when select Get External Data / ODBC Database / Link to the Database Source... the ODBC connection
 is not listed as a data source. &nbsp;I have the same problem when trying to connect from MSQuery.&nbsp;This is the first installation where I've had this problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I decide to try setting up a new data source and selected Microsoft ODBC for Oracle. I got an error message that the Oracle client and networking components were not found.</div>

            <p>On some OSes there are two Odbc admins: one for 32-bit (in the syswow64 folder) and one for 64-bit (in the system32 folder). Be sure to use the 32-bit one.&nbsp;I am assuming you're using 32-bit Office as you should.</p>

            Looks like I have the 64-bit versions for both but when I look for data source I find that the ODBC Administrator is in&nbsp;%windir%\system32\odbcad32.exe.
<div><br />
<div>I didn't know I was supposed to be using 32-bit Office. Do I need to uninstall the 64-bit version and see if I can install 32-bit? If I can't, am I up a creek or is there some way to make it work with 64-bit? The disc I have is for a single install.<br />

            MSFT recommends installing 32-bit Office, unless you really, really know what you're doing.<br />
<br />
Typically the install disk will have both on it.. The 32-bit version would be the main install; the 64-bit version is a bit harder to find.<br />
<br />
You cannot have both on the same machine.<br />

<p>I am a little confused? I followed&nbsp;information for the microsoft security ess but this is<br />
the error message I got!&nbsp;<br />
The invitation you are using belongs to another registered account. <br />
I just set up an account before trying to download.</p>

            To be able to access the Microsoft Security Essentials on Connect and download the Beta you will need to have a Windows Live ID. If you do not have one yet or if you have an existing email which you want to use as a Windows Live ID you may try out this
 link <a href="https://accountservices.passport.net/ppnetworkhome.srf?vv=650&amp;lc=1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://accountservices.passport.net/ppnetworkhome.srf?vv=650&amp;lc=1033</a>. <br />
<br />
Else, if there is another user signed in you may try to sign it out (you can close all IE windows)&nbsp;then sign in at the right&nbsp;top most corner using your Windows Live ID to access the site.
