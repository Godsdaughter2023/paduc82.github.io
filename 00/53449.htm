<p>Windows Live Mail is not supported by Microsoft.&nbsp; They want you to use their webmail and keep your mail on their servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That runs against a large number of Windows system owners like you and I who would prefer to maintain our own mail files.</p>

                    I Have installed Windows XP Virtual Machine on Win7 Pro, runs just fine, the problem i have is when I use the "USB" tab, attach
<span style="font-style: italic">any</span> device other than a flash drive or the virtual components i get the message pop up:<br />
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Could not attach the USB device. You can attach the USB device to different USB port or restart the Virtual machine and try again.
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>I have tried different devices and get the same message. I have gone into the settings menu and changed the COM1 from none to physical serial port COM1. and even on COM2 and no success.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Original title:Connection of USB device error " Could not attach the USB device."<br />
I have had previous luck with this on another laptop without any problems but this is a new laptop and now it will not recognize any USB device if its not a flashdrive and even that is "shared", when I select&nbsp; attach, I get the same message as above.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Can someone throw me a bone here? this is costing me a lot of grief and the boss useless time on his payroll</p>

<p>Trying to sign in on my console and it won't let me.</p>

<p>Switch the console on and it wasn't connected t olive, so I connect to live and it then asks me if I want to sign in with my email and password. This shouldn't happen as it should automatically sign in with the password remembered.</p>
<p>So I do as it says and then it seems to sign in as it tells me how many friends I have online then it asks me if I want the password to be remembered, the box is checked so I hit next.</p>
<p>It then appears to load for a few minutes and pops up with "Sorry, there was a problem. Please try again later. Code 8007274D"</p>
<p>Tried a few times and this keeps happening, went on my microsoft profile, everything seems to be in order, have all the security features set up etc. I look up the code on the Error/Status code search page and it comes back with nothing.</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas, pretty peeved with this considering all the BS on Saturday night as well.</p>

    <title>My card reader stopped working after Win 7 installation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yukonlady  say:</h3>
<h2>            My card reader stopped working after Win 7 installation.</h2>
                    My card reader operates sporatically after installing Windows 7.&nbsp; When a memory card is inserted, the green light comes on the reader, but the card contents aren't read.&nbsp; The reader drive letters show up, but when clicked on the message "Insert a card"
 comes up, even though the card is inserted.&nbsp; I changed the drive letters, and I thought that fixed it, as I could read the memory cards once after I changed the letters, but.&nbsp; the next day when I tried to use it, it was back to not being able to read the contents.&nbsp;
 I booted up with the card in the reader, and this worked once.&nbsp; I turned on a printer which also has a card reader on the network, and this worked once, letting the computer read the built in card reader&nbsp; with the SD card.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There has to be some way to fix this permanently, instead of it appearing to be fixed once, and then it stops.&nbsp; When I click on the drive letter in explorer, I get&nbsp; the message "Please insert a disk into removable disk (drive letter).Occasionally,&nbsp; I have gotten
 a flash of a message saying something about&nbsp; "snap" when a card is inserted.<br />
<br />
I thought the problem was with the reader that came with my Dell XPS, as the light often&nbsp; wouldn't even come on when a card was inserted, so I replace it with a new one.&nbsp; The light comes on, but the card isn't being read.<br />
<br />
The pins on the external card readers for the compact flash cards seem to be weak, and bend easily, so it gets expensive replacing these readers.&nbsp; The built in readers seem to have studier pins, and don't bend like the external readers I have had.<br />
<br />
I hope someone has some idea of what needs to be done to stabilize this system so it will read consistently.<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To work with this issue, I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers currently installed for card reader on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;Click <strong>Start </strong>and type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>in the start search box and press

            Dell only has drivers for XP, and not WIn 7 for my system.&nbsp; The drivers for the old Teac card reader do not work with the new generic reader.&nbsp; I removed the Teac card reader as it didn't even light up when a card was inserted, so I thought it must have
 died.&nbsp; It had been sporatic as well before I finally gave up and installed a new one. &nbsp; The new one uses Windows drivers, and I have the latest drivers according to my Windows update.&nbsp;
<br />
I did try the uninstall and check internet for latest drivers, and as I said, I have the latest ones.&nbsp; I was going to try to delete the drivers and try again, but the system won't let me rename or delete the drivers.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;What exactly happens when you try to delete the drivers for your card reader?</div>
<div>2. Which new card reader was installed?</div>

            I&nbsp; went to Driver Agent, and a scan of my system found two different drivers for my card reader,.&nbsp; My card reader is a generic one with no brand name on it.&nbsp; The drivers that downloaded were Taisol and Realtech (Alcor).
<br />
<br />
After running the driver updated, I found if I removed the USB controller&nbsp; for the card reader&nbsp; in Device Manager, it will then automatically find another one, and work.&nbsp; As long as I don't shutdown or restart the computer, this works.&nbsp; If I shut the computer
 off, and start again, the card reader again doesn't work.&nbsp; So I need to go back to troubleshooting, and repeat the process and&nbsp; the card reader then will read the memory cards.&nbsp; All 4 slots show up as drive letters whether it reads the memory cards or not.<br />
<br />
So I guess unless there is a suggestion as to how to fix this permanently, I will need to fiddle with this each time I shut the machine off..&nbsp; I also purchased an external reader that I can use when I need to access my memory cards,&nbsp; and don't have time to
 troubleshoot, when the internal reader fails me.&nbsp; I figure even when the pins bend on the CF slot, it is cheaper to buy another one, than waste more hours trying to get the internal card reader to work.<br />
<br />
I think it is a problem with the Dell computer itself, as when it was new, even then, the original card reader would occasionally stop working, (with XP)&nbsp; but normally restarting the computer, would activate it again.&nbsp; When I contacted Dell about it, they said
 they could send a new card reader to me, but they figured that would not resolve the problem.&nbsp; When Win7 was installed, that seemed to cause the card reader to fail more frequently, and finally stop working entirely.<br />
<br />
So thanks to Vidyaranjan for trying to help me.<br />

            Unfortunately mods go against the code of conduct and are therefore not something we can assist you with. Please be aware it is also subject to action by the enforcement team which could include lifetime account suspension or a console ban. I do not recommend
 it, not worth the risk. Besides the moral issues involved with cheating.

            Yes as Puppy Fujo mentioned we cannot help with mods, hacks or any type of cheating and the forums have the same rules as the Xbox one console so you could get a ban by posting this in here.

<h2>            Windows 7 Installer will not recognize SSD</h2>
                    <p>I have just built a new computer and I want to install 64-bit Windows 7 Professional on an Intel X-25M 80GB SSD.&nbsp; I am doing a clean install on a new drive.&nbsp; When I get to the point in the Windows 7 installation that asks which drive I want to install the
 OS on, it does not show the Intel X-25M.&nbsp; It will show my other drives, however.&nbsp; If I unplug the other drives, it just shows a blank window instead of showing the Intel X-25M.&nbsp; I get a message saying it could not find a valid signed driver.&nbsp; I bought the
 retail version of the SSD, not an OEM.</p>
<p>I am using a Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD7 motherboard and an Intel i920 CPU.&nbsp; The motherboard BIOS has no problem detecting and identifying the X-25M.&nbsp; I have the X-25M configured as an IDE.&nbsp; I updated the firmware of the SSD, but it did not help.</p>
<p>Windows 7 compatibility page shows no compatibility problems with the X-25M, but it apparently needs a signed driver, and I do not know how to get one.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Does it show the SSD at all? I would check to see that it's indeed being picked up by the BIOS and if not, check the cables.<br />
Occasionally, Windows setup can chuck a fit when it discovers a drive with an invalid MBR/boot sector and won't install to it. To fix this, you could try the following<br />
1.Boot up Windows 7 disc.<br />
2.When the welcome screen comes up on Windows Setup, press Shift + F10, which will display a command prompt.<br />
3.Type "diskpart" (no quotes) and press enter.<br />
4.Type "list disk" and press enter.<br />
5.Hopefully you can see your SSD in the list. You should see a number identifying it. Now type "select disk X" (where X is the number identifying your SSD) and press enter.<br />
6.Type "clean" and press enter. This will write a blank MBR, YOU WILL LOSE ANY DATA ON THE SSD if you did have anything on it.<br />
Hopefully one of these tips helps :<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see if a driver
<br />
was updated prior to this occurring. Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you changed, added/installed, or even uninstalled any of those lately?<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else).<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
Generic troubleshooting methods - and you already gave the info. Keep eye on it while testing to see<br />
if the BCCode changes.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />
<span><span><br />
</span></span><br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
BlueScreenView scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes, and displays the
<br />
information about all crashes in one table - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your

<h3> john94028  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open TV Services, element not closed, ZoomOptions.Settings, Line 716, pos. 1</h2>
                    <p>Computer:</p>
<p>HP Pavilion dv6-6150us notebook (out of warranty); 6 GB tot. mem., 750 GB HD)<br />
Processor: Intel Core i5-2410M CPU @2.3 GHz<br />
Windows 7, service pack 1&nbsp; (I don't have the disc since the op. sys. was preloaded.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The main C-drive (750 GB) ran out of space, just 33 MB remaining, when an error
</p>
<p>occurred, Microsoft .NET Framework, "unhandled exception has occurred in your </p>
<p>application" while trying to launch the video player to view a prerecorded </p>
<p>program.&nbsp; The video had been working perfectly just seconds prior to the HD </p>
<p>running out of space.&nbsp; After deleting files (about 70 GB) to make room, the </p>
<p>problem happened when I attempted to watch a video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The failure details are:&nbsp; System.TypeInitialization exception.&nbsp; The type initializer
</p>
<p>for TV services Core.SystemSettings' threw an exception. —&gt; </p>
<p>System.XML.XMLException:&nbsp; Unexpected end of the file has occurred.&nbsp; The </p>
<p><strong>following elements are not closed:&nbsp; ZoomOptions.Settings Line 716, position 1.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restarting the PC did not clear the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested that turning OFF</p>
<p>relevent Windows features (e.g., Media Features, Media Center, Media Player </p>
<p>or .NET Environment, etc.) and&nbsp;restarting the PC might close that the unclosed
</p>
<p>element, restoring video functionality.&nbsp; These attempts were unsuccessful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, repair attempt of .NET Framework 4 Client Profile by selecting option </p>
<p>"return to original state." wasn't&nbsp;successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no image backup of drive-C or a recovery disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to avoid reloading Windows 7 &amp; SP1 because, as I'm told, I'll lose all </p>
<p>the preloaded apps. that came with the Notebook.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be more involved than I perceive but it seems that just finding </p>
<p>a way to close the ZoomOptions.Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What repair program or procdure will resolve this problem?</strong></p>

    <title>Windows XP original disk and key has activation problem with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows XP original disk and key has activation problem with re-installation</h2>
                    <p>My old machine running on Windows XP professional blew up in April. I bought a new one and installed the original software&nbsp;disk (done by a technician here in SA).</p>
<p>Microsoft raised an issue about authentic software, and I have provided all the originals to the Microsoft help team, but my technician had to&nbsp;get Windows running again on 23 May (after 8 days of waiting for a response from Microsoft help centre).</p>
<p>Today the Windows operating system was asking again for activation - but it says it is activated.</p>
<p>However I cannot log on.</p>
<p>The product key is: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</p>
<p>The hologram label bar code says: 99994-625-347-755 b X12-08297</p>
<p>THE CASE REFERENCE WAS: 1177290811 AND THE DATE was 22/23 May 2012.</p>
<p>I was dealing with Jatin Gandhi who has not responded to me since last week when I sent him an e-mail about the warning on the activation issue.</p>
<p>I am running on Windows XP because I have drivers for instruments which are not upgraded to other Windows.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Hi Margie. <br />
<br />
Let me begin by saying what a very bad idea it is to share your full name on any public forum. It is equally bad to post your product key. Fortunately it was blocked or removed.
<br />
<br />
Next, the majority of us who provide assistance here do not work for Microsoft. We are volunteers who donate our time and knowledge. Therefore, your case number and the name of the person who assisted you is of no consequence to us.
<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, let's if we can resolve your issue. It appears from your post, and correct me if I am wrong, that you had a Windows disc that was used to install Windows Xp on your current computer by some techs where you live. Issues of validation/activation
 have arose now with the current computer. Apparently the techs who installed Windows on your current computer gave you the Windows disc. Am I correct so far? If not, please tell me what I am missing.
<br />
<br />
For the sake of time let's assume my understanding of the scenario is correct. I would be highly surprised if the disc you were given is legitimate. It sounds like the computer was in the 30 trial period when you received it which would explain why you are
 now getting a request to activate Windows. The time period seems to be very close to matching the scenario I described as well.
<br />
<br />
Personally, if it were my computer and I had paid someone (the techs who installed Windows) for the computer and/or to install Windows, I would go back to that person and ask it be fixed. I believe that may be where the issue is and who is responsible for this
 problem. <br />
<br />
For the time being, I will provide you with the instructions to reset the trial period. However, the number of times you can do this is limited to four. Therefore, once the new trial has begun you will need to resolve this issue one way or another with the
 techs who installed Windows on the computer. <br />
<br />
Reseting the Activation Trial:<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
1. Turn On your PC<br />
<br />
2. Press F8 repeatedly and go to Safe Mode<br />
<br />
3. Log in as per normal <br />
(note: Administrator password is usually blank, or use the Password Recovery CD if the password is unknown)<br />
<br />
4. Allow the Desktop to fully load (answering "Yes" to continue into Safe Mode)<br />
(note: This is just a long way of saying go to Safe Mode)<br />
<br />
5. Click on Start - Run<br />
<br />
6. Type in exactly: <b>rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk</b> (and click OK)<br />
(note: one space, after "rundll32.exe " also the Oo are two letter o's in "oobe"; capitals and comma are important)<br />
<br />
7. Wait a couple of seconds (although you will Not see any change)<br />
<br />
8. Restart your PC normally (Start - Shutdown - Restart - Ok)<br />

 I added them to the win 10 install they were assigned drive letters J – M and the USB3 drives were assigned drive letters &nbsp;D – G.&nbsp; I need my HDDs to have drive letters E – H because some of my software expects data to be on those drives.&nbsp; In Disk Management
 I changed the drive letters of the HDDs and USBs to reflect drive letters of E – H for the HDDs. &nbsp;While looking at File Explorer I discovered that the HDDs are all listed twice.&nbsp; I looked in Device Manager and the HDDs and the USBs are listed there as Disk
 Drives and as Portable Devices.</span></p>
<p><span>The USBs don’t show up in File Explorer unless there is a drive plugged into them, although the box in Folder Options “Hide empty drives” is not checked.</span></p>
<p><span>Is anyone out there aware of this problem and a solution for it?</span></p>
My hardware is Intel i7 3770 on an ASUS p8z77 - v pro motherboard.

    <title>Minecraft Favorites Edition for XBox One &#40;disc&#41; included DLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airbiscuitalpo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Favorites Edition for XBox One &#40;disc&#41; included DLC map can only be played as trail vers</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I bought Minecraft Favorites Edition for XBox One on disc, but when starting one of the included extra DLC packs\maps (IE Festive), it states they are trail versions and you cannot save games.&nbsp; The extra skins also don't work and direct you to the store to buy and then display a price.&nbsp; Before installing the game, the icon in the menu will show Minecraft Favorites Edition, but after installing, the icon will then always revert to "Minecraft Favorites for XBox One".
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My Console: XBox One S 1TB </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><u>Things I have tried:</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I have uninstalled re-installed several times with reboots and Shut Downs in between and after uninstall/re-installs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Disabled auto install and auto updates, then performed manual install from queue&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Uninstalled game, Unchecked "Make this my home XBox", re-installed game, re-checked "Make this my home XBox".&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Uninstalled, and re-installed from disc with Network disabled&nbsp;</p><p>-Verified extra DLC Maps\Textures are installed via Manage Game -Uninstalled\re-installed DLC packs separately via Manage Game&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Tried running game after re-install without game update, but it won’t let you and prompts you to update&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Sign out\Sign in between and after uninstall\re-installs -Verified all Xbox and game updates are applied&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Verified disc and disc cover shows Minecraft Favorites Edition, and that I paid $29.99 from reputable vendor.
</p>
<p>-Verified I have sufficient space</p>
<p>-Verified permissions are open and no restrictions </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyone have any other suggestions?</p>

</p><p>Some time back I had tried to burn a CD using the manual burn to disc option on the laptop. I think it was unsuccessful and I decided to quit anyway. Now other CDs won't play from my drive at all. What steps do I need to follow to restore this, so I can
 play CDs normally, and also continue to burn the CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other CDs I insert, eject on their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>As I stated in my original question: I try and print; the printer acts as if it wants to print and then stops.

<p>To complete the printing I&nbsp; Go to start, select Restart the computer goes through its process and when it has completed the restart&nbsp; It prints whatever is in the queue.</p>

<div>I think you're using Windows 7, although you don't say. &nbsp;If so, click Start&gt;Devices and Printers. &nbsp;Right-click the printer and choose "Printer Properties" (about four down the menu, not the bottom "Properties"). &nbsp;Click the Port tab. &nbsp;Scroll through the

            So, your printer is connected via USB and not a network connection? &nbsp;If this happened to me I'd 1) try another USB port or 2) completely uninstall the driver and reconnect to the printer from scratch. &nbsp;For USB devices, you should have the device disconnected
 when you install the driver, connecting it only when the installation wizard tells you to connect it or after the driver is completely installed, if the wizard doesn't ask.

<h2>            External Hard Drive no longer detected &#40;Summer Update&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>My USB 3.0 Seagate hard drive no longer works on my Xbox one with this latest update. It is lit up, but not being read.</p>
<p>It just refuses to detect the drive whatsoever, despite working on the 360 and my PC just fine.</p>
<p>I had been using the drive earlier today (Media Player), prior to the update, and it worked fine, however now it is nowhere to be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was the same in the preview update, which I opt'd out of because of it, but now I guess im stuck with it, unless there is a fix which isn't a power cycle or changing USB ports. I've tried the majority of the simple troubleshooting.</p>

Lexmark tells me to use the Microsoft driver that comes with Windows (last line in table below).<br />
<br />
If you think of the driver provided by Microsoft either on the CD or via Windows Update as part of the Windows 7 package, that makes it a Windows 7 problem since&nbsp;Microsoft &nbsp;supplied me with the drivers part of the&nbsp;package&nbsp;(which by the way, Windows Update assures
 me is the most recent version).</p>

<p>If Microsoft provided a driver with Windows, it's the driver they got<br />
from the printer's manufacturer. They don't write these drivers.</p>

    <title>0x80bd0006 Error Code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayjaymd  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x80bd0006 Error Code</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry if this isn't the right place but it's an error code so I assume it would fall under here.</p>
<p>I haven't used by One in months, so I opened it for the first time in awhile the other day. Got the new system updates and now I have an interface that I am not familiar with.</p>
<p>But when I try to play Titanfall, it mentioned that they cannot get my data or something. Tried to check my subscription over on the console but it says the same thing and gave me that error code. I also cannot connect to Xbox Live or access the Xbox Store
 even though my connection says All Services are Available. Clicking the Xbox Live button just gives you the accept sound but doesn't do anything,</p>
<p>I did check my subscription when I logged into this forum and it is still valid. So wondering whether someone here can help me or or not.</p>

<p>To solve the issue you are experiencing I suggest you to remove the account from your console, clear the console cache and download your account again. Follow the step by step instructions:</p>
<p>a)To remove the account from xbox live console:</p>
<p>Scroll left on the Home screen to open the guide.</p>
<p>Select Settings.</p>
<p>Select All Settings.</p>
<p>Under "Account," select Remove accounts.</p>
<p>Select the account that you want to remove.</p>
<p>Select Remove to confirm.</p>
<p>When you're finished, select Close.</p>
<p>b) To clear cache on an Xbox One:</p>
<p>Press and hold the power button on the front of the console until it powers down completely.</p>
<p>Unplug the power cable from the back of the console so that the power brick in not connected to the console.</p>
<p>Press the power button on the console three or four times. This will ensure that any remaining power in the battery is drained, clearing the cache on the console.</p>
<p>Plug the power cable back into the console.</p>
<p>Wait for the light on the power brick to change from white to orange.</p>
<p>Turn on the console using the power button.</p>
<p>c)To download your Xbox profile to the Xbox One console:</p>
<p>1. Scroll left on the Home screen to open the guide.</p>
<p>2. Scroll down, and then select Add &amp; manage.</p>
<p>3. Select Add new.</p>
<p>4. Enter the email address for the Microsoft account that's associated with your Xbox profile, and then select Enter.</p>
<p>5. Enter the password for your Microsoft account, and then select Enter.</p>
<p>6. Read the Microsoft Service Agreement and Privacy Statement, and then select I Accept.</p>
<p>7. Follow the steps to configure your Sign-In &amp; Security preferences and download your Xbox profile to your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you!</p>

<p>First, try signing out and then back in on your console. Double tap the Xbox button to open the "Guide" on the left, go up, and then left to your profile picture. Press A, then go down to Sign out. After that, follow the same steps to sign back in.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, if you have the email address and password for your account, try removing and re-downloading your profile. Go to Settings, Account, Remove accounts and remove yours. Open the guide, go down to Settings, then Restart console. When it
 reboots, open the guide, go up, then left to Add &amp; manage and add your account back.</p>
<p>The updated interface is called the "New Xbox One Experience" and it was a massive change from the previous interface. You can find information about it here:
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/experience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/.../experience</a> . About halfway down the page there are some controller commands listed that may be useful.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your replies everyone. I didn't realize I was getting replies on this thread as my Email flagged all the notifications from this forum as Junk and I just realized it.</p>
<p>I talked with an Ambassafor in the chatroom and he gave me some similar suggestions. I took the link he/she gave me to the Microsoft Accounts page, signed in..........and the problem was fixed immedietly afterwards . I'm not even sure what specific part
 was the one that did it but I am just glad that it's resolved.</p>
<p>Really appreciate all the answers here, I probabaly would have gone further if needed to. For the moment, I am glad to have access to Live again. It has been months since I have played the console.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I'd check with Device Manager.&nbsp; Click Start and right-click Computer.&nbsp; Click Properties, then click Device Manager.&nbsp; Look at the Network adapters entry to see if there's either ! or ? next to any of them.&nbsp; If so, you need to get the correct one.&nbsp; If that's
 not it, right-click the Wireless and WiFi entries and see if there's an ENABLE option there.&nbsp; If so, click on it because something somehow has disabled it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Live mail 2012 &#39;wlmailhtml&#58;&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try and explain my problem as best I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Live Mail 2012 as my email client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a standard template which contains a link in it. The link works ok in the template however when I receive an enquiry copy and paste the template into the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link then converts to this.. 'wlmailhtml:{EA677540-2D2A-48AC-B2FB-1DAC39427C54}mid://00000002/: Meaning I have to manually convert it back defeating the purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer a solution, I've already modified the registry to allow links to be copied using the "wlmail.exe" Dword '2AF9' in internet explorer both 32 bit and 64 bit and double checked the settings to make sure it's right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mail is set to read as html and send as html.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Just to add I have found a workaround after testing, I can copy without issue from a word document, or another email in the inbox. This issue appears when I copy test from the sent items folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for the time being I copy my template from a word .docx on my desktop.. not ideal but will do until I find a solution.</p>

            I'm not sure of the precise mechanism, but it seems that Windows Live Mail uses its own internal format for URLs when displaying messages opened from a folder. They only become standard HTTP links when they're entered in a compose window. You may find

            Thanks Firedog, saving a template won't work as i need the original message included in the reply to keep track of the clients history /query.
