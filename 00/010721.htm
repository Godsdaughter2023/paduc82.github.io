                    Since a resent update to Microsoft, my Outlook email is doing something odd.&nbsp; It is not recognizing the text that I am typing in the subject.&nbsp; I get the message, "No subject, Send anyway ?"&nbsp; even though the subject is entered.&nbsp; Haven't seen anything about

    <title>Excel Online, Share specific Columns of Data with outsiders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnwstadler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Online, Share specific Columns of Data with outsiders</h2>
                    I have an excel spread sheet which contains information in columns A,B,C,D,E. The spreadsheet is located on my company sharepoint site and I would like to share ONLY specific columns of data with 3 outside companies. The data that is shared with the 3
 outside companies will change depending on which company is viewing the sheet. I would like to share a link to the data in columns A,B and C with company (1). I would also like to share another link to columns A,B, and D to company (2). I would also like to
 share a link to columns A,B, and E to company (3). I would like for all 3 links to be working concurrently. Columns C,D,&amp;E contain sensitive information to the (3) external companies. In other words I do not want company 1 being able to see the data in columns
 D or E, company 2 being able to see the data in columns C or E and company 3 being able to see the data in columns C or D. What is the best way to accomplish this?&nbsp;

<p>

            <p>Is Excel online able to link data from online file to another? The master online excel file would be sitting on the SharePoint site where the internal members would be editing the information simultaneously. The 3 newly created company 1, 2, and 3 excell
 sheets would also be located in the sharepoint site so that I can drop an outside link. My question is will the new sheets actually update if someone internal is editing the original "master" excel online sheet from browser. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It needs to be the other way around. The three files is where data is entered. The master file pulls the data from the three individual files with formulas.

<p>
</p><p>No, Excel online does not support external data connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>No. I am looking for a way to have 1 document that my internal team can edit, and then have have multiple external companies view. The problem is the document contains sensitive information which the external companies shouldn't be able to view. As I stated
 earlier in my description of what I was trying to accomplish I need to hide certain columns of information based on which particular outsider is viewing the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Teylyn orginal response to change my architecture to have multiple sheets would work except excel online does not support data connections. Which means if my team edited the master document on our internal company sharepoint site the other documents would
 not autopopulate. And that would become a nightmare quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire purpose was to have 1 wooksheet/workbook that the internal team could edit for simplicity and efficiency. Then share information from that internal sheet to outsiders based on what columns were appropriate for them to see. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could this manually by deleting out the columns that are sensitive to a specific outsider and emailing them the updated document and repeating this process about 30 times everyday but that would not be ideal. I need one static sheet that depending on who
 is viewing it determines what columns are visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you only want to edit ONE file, then the sharing with different external parties with different view permissions won't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a different approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the following model might work:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- three files, one for each external party, are in SharePoint online</p>
<p>- The master file is edited by your staff with Excel for desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The master file has a macro that runs every time the master file is saved.</p>
<p>- the macro opens the three separate files from SharePoint and writes the current contents of the &nbsp;master file to each individual file and saves them back to SharePoint online</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easy enough to build a VBA macro that opens a specific file in a SharePoint online library and writes into that file. This way, there's only one file to edit, the SharePoint online files don't have data links, have different content and can be shared
 with different parties.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Manually Adding Album Art Is Missing In Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly craven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manually Adding Album Art Is Missing In Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>How are we to make edits to album metadata on Windows 10? Groove Music doesn't support it and Windows Media Player has lost a good bit of its editing functionality, specifically was to add or edit album art.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is necessary if album metadata is missing or not found. This happens occasionally for some CDs (minor or local artists releases), and for all custom CDs the data will not exist in any external database.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line is that the functionality to add or edit album art is missing in Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 10. Because Groove Music does allow ANY metadata editing we are forced to use WMP12 to make these changes. Of course, since a good bit of that
 is missing now from WMP in Win10 we are left to use third party apps, but they don't work as expected and will in some cases completely overwrite edited that seemed to take in WMP12.....edit ANY tags in MP3Edit and the album becomes Unknown.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MP3Tag Editor will wipe out the data in WMP, specifically the album, artist, and contributing artist (as seen in WMP). Album art added in MP3Edit is not picked up by WMP. I was told to use that (by someone at Microsoft) as an alternative, but it's not working.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove Music is totally unusable as it is barebones at best. WMP seems much buggier than it used to be.</p>

            <p>What exact album art functionality do you mean? The following still works fine on my Windows 10 system: copy an image (for example from the web with Microsoft Edge), go to WMP, right-click an album art placeholder in the library, and select

 After copying the larger image for the cover both jpg files&nbsp;disappeared and are no longer visible in the folder. Folder view options are for general and hidden files are to be displayed. Seems as though copying the one of these files into the album has caused
 WMP to move them...somewhere.<br />

            <p>File type is irrelevant. I have done both MP3 and FLAC. The original issue that set up the scenario was because the orret album info could not be found, and instead of using none pulled in album info and art from the wrong album.<br />
<br />
I have had the same issue with MP3 and FLAC.<br />
<br />
As above, I was able to update and copy in art at last. File type is FLAC in this case. As mentioned before. File type is irrelevant. I have done this in the past for wav, mp3, wma, and flac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"copying the larger image for cover"<br />
<br />
WMP has used two image files for art in the past, and still does as as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AlbumArtSmall.jpg (75*73 px)</p>
<p>Folder.jpg &nbsp; (200*195 px)</p>
<p>(there are other supported files, such as AlbumArtLarge.jpg,etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could at one time simply place images with these filenames into the same folder as the audio files and they would get picked up and used as art for the album when adding them to the library. That no longer works. This is one thing I tried and was THE
 WAY to do this in years past.<br />
<br />
With these two files in the same folder as the audio files:</p>
<p>Open the folder that has the audio files in Explorer</p>
<p>Right-click Folder.jpg<br />
Select Copy</p>
<p>Go back to WMP</p>
<p>Click to open the album in question</p>
<p>Right-click over the displayed album</p>
<p>Select Paste album art<br />
Album art is updated</p>
<p>BOTH jpg files disappear in explorer (become hidden)<br />
<br />
Where are these files? (seem to still be there)<br />
<br />
How do I know?<br />
<br />
If I try to copy in files of the same file names there is a popup to replace them. Changing view options allows them to be seen. The folder is set to general in explorer.<br />
<br />
Too much info? Of course it is.<br />

            Good to hear that you were able to solve the album art issue. And yes, for the
<strong>Folder.jpg</strong> and <strong>AlbumArt*.jpg</strong> files to appear, Explorer needs to be set to show hidden files and folders as well as protected system files in
<strong>Folder Options</strong>.

            <p>Thanks! &nbsp;Showing protected system files does indeed expose the art files. &nbsp;Not something that should be left that way for general use though. I'm good.<br />
</p>
<p>As a side note, I discovered that MANY ripped albums were placed in incorrect folders, with complete albums being embedded within other unrelated artists' folders, even if I don't have any album by those artists.<br />
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>E:\Kelly\Music\Audioslave\Santana\Supernatural</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not own any Audioslave CDs and have never ripped one. I did rip Supernatural.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just one of many that are not in the correct folder. &nbsp;There are 19 other bands that have albums that were ripped and placed under Audioslave. The only time I've seen this is when directories were accidentally dragged and dropped into others. Yet,
 that doesn't appear to be the case unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not looking for a solution...manually moving them to the correct place has already been done. I'll be keeping an eye on any new rips to see where they end up and will open a separate thread if it repros. (not expecting it to)<br />
<br />
I mention it here because I'm wondering if that may be a result of are a potential cause of the original problem (David Gilmour and Friends CD being mistaken for Keith Richards Crosseyed Heart).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a loyal MS customer for over 30 years but over the past 1-2 years I have had nothing but troubles and I have not been able to get the support that one used to e able to get from MS. I am so close to dumping MS and if I do I will never come back.
 What is MS doing? They just do not seem to care about their customers any more.</p>
<p>My main problem stems from the fact that they obviously have superseded information about me and have created two accounts but can't find the other one. So I was charged twice for the same service and of course I can only use one. I got my bank to get the
 extra subscription back but now I can't use the service. I am now trying to work with no service and as a result could lose my employment. This will mean that I will have to take MS to court to recover my lost income. This is all so messy so why won't MS fix
 their problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there are some technical issues to fix.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say carried out return to "factory settings" do you mean via device menu or by keying in *#7370# followed by 12345 (default Nokia lock code unless altered by yourself)? Be aware that this reset method will delete all data from your 5230, and have
 you removed memory card if present?</p>

            <p>Eventually, I went back to the IT outfit that was providing the support when that PC was installed. They have been able to remotely recover the Office licences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, linking licenses to MS-accounts and not to the PC itself is in my opinion a bad thing for businesses where machines can be transmitted from employee to employee and MS accounts may be lost, forgotten, changed in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was looking at something like this. [....]<br />
=IF(LEFT(B4,1)="9",TEXT(B4,"0000000"),TEXT(B4,"000000"))</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
The problem is:&nbsp; that might presume too much about the length of the value in B4.&nbsp; More simply:<br />
<br />
=IF(LEFT(B4,1)="9","0" &amp; B4,B4 &amp; "")<br />
<br />
The B4&amp;"" expression ensures that the formula always returns text, which "0"&amp;B4 does.&nbsp; It is "good practice" to return a consistent result.&nbsp; However, if B4 is text to begin with -- that is, TYPE(B4) returns 2 -- you can replace B4&amp;"" with simply B4.<br />
<br />
If B4 is not text to begin with -- that is, TYPE(B4) returns 1 -- there might some question as to whether the result of the formula above should be numeric or text.<br />
<br />
Only you can answer that question.&nbsp; It depends on how you intend to use the result.<br />
<br />
If you want a numeric result and if your numbers starting with 9 are always 6 digits, as your examples and your TEXT formula suggests, you might be able to use the following Custom formula in B4 or in a cell who formula is =B4:<br />
<br />
[&gt;=900000]0000000;000000<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
[&gt;=900000]0000000;General<br />
<br />
EDIT....&nbsp; Oh, but when Tushar suggested using XL2007 Conditional Formatting to do effectively the same (his CF is even more flexible), you responded:&nbsp; "I was thinking of using an IF statement instead".<br />
<br />
In that case, the Custom format above might be equally undesirable.&nbsp; But in that case, I have to ask:&nbsp; why use an IF statement when formatting of one form or another would accomplish what you require?<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; It should be noted that no number format will help you if B4 is text -- unless you "convert" B4 to numeric with a formula like =--B4.&nbsp; I don't believe you ever said what the type of the value in B4 is.<br />

<br />If above doesn't work, without looking at your Powerrpoint, it is difficult to say anything.

            Following is a workaround for Vista/Win 7.&nbsp; This defeats the security feature that calls for the scan so all downloads should be manually scanned before using.<br />
<br />
Copy the&nbsp; lines between the stars (but not the stars):<br />
<br />
****************<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments]<br />
"ScanWithAntiVirus"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
<br />
****************<br />
<br />
Open notepad and paste the above into it.&nbsp; Verify that you have it all then File, Save As, (to your desktop) "NoScan.reg" OK (Make sure you includes the quotes around the file name)<br />
<br />
Close notepad.&nbsp; Right click on NoScan.reg and select Merge.&nbsp; Allow it to merge.&nbsp; (If you don't see the Merge option you probably left off the quotes and notepad tacked on .txt)<br />
<br />
What I think is happening is that AVG (or some other anti-virus tho AVG seems to be the most common) attempts to stop Windows Defender and take its place in the scan but somehow breaks Windows Defender.&nbsp; No proof yet.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Sometimes this doesn't fix IE but will fix your other browsers like Firefox or Chrome.&nbsp; I have had to uninstall IE and let it revert back to an older version a few times.&nbsp; Some people claim that removing Windows Defender and deleting the folder C:\Program Files\Windows
 Defender or C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Defender will also fix it.<br />
<br />
If you have Firefox then you can fix it without a registry edit.&nbsp; Open Firefox, Type about:config in the URL box and hit Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down to
<br />
<br />
browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone<br />
<br />
and double click on it.&nbsp; That will change the Value to False.&nbsp; Close Firefox and restart.&nbsp; It should allow you to download files now.<br />
<br />
I've also seen the same symptom with a Zero Access infection so if the above doesn't work that may be what you have.&nbsp; I would need an OTL, Quickscan log to tell.&nbsp; Download OTL from<br />
http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/398-otl-oldtimers-list-it/<br />
and Save it to the desktop of a friend's PC then copy otl.exe to a USB drive and then move it to the desktop of the sick PC..<br />
<br />
Run OTL (Vista or Win 7 =&gt; right click and Run As Administrator)<br />
Click on Quickscan.&nbsp; When it finishes you will get one or two logs.&nbsp; Copy and paste the OTL log.<br />

    <title>Joystick problem with my E70 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rusco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Joystick problem with my E70</h2>
                    After a bit more then a year problems with the joystick of my E70 make the thing almost useless. It first started with the 'down function' that from time to time was not functioning. It became more dificult when it actually started using the 'push function'
 when I moved the joystick down. This ment I ended up in the wrong menu and had to go back every time. It sometimes even sended text messages that I was still editing.<br />
Now the 'down function' is totaly out and replaced by the 'push function'. Last week the same thing happened with the 'right function' of the joy stick, which makes the phone in fact actually almost unuseable, because I cannot scroll through my contacts anymore
 and a lot of other functions cannot be reached.<br />
<br />
I have a two year contract with my provider and the Nokia warranty probably will not cover this anymore, but I still hate to be stuck with a phone that does not even last through one contract period before I have to take it to repair and probably pay quit a
 lot of money to get it to do what it should do.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone has been it this situation and has an advice, otherwise this is just ment as a warning for the poor quality of the joystick of the E70.

            Maybe your are right. I even hope so. But if this vital part of this phone is vulnerable to dust in this way, isn't it also a bit a 'hardware' failure?<br />
<br />
But I have no idea how to clean this area. Disassembling the joystick?? I'm not too technical so I am afraid I end up with more problems. Or is it easy and save to try?

            Its a pity but the problems with joystic is NOT a cleaning broblem, because I get my E70 with the same problem (down button works push) to service, and they made a cleaning procedure. On the second day I had the same problem.. I also dont belive that it
 is a hrdware failure, because very many people has it.. I suppose it is a developers mistake.. The service center sended my E70 to Moscow, and they promised to fix this problem once and forever, so I hope that Nokia developers already know about this problem,
 and know how to fix it.

            So this is why this forum is very useful! Now I don't have to invest time in looking in the wrong direction. The joystick problem is apparantly a software problem. Which make sense, because from time to time my joystick works and on other times I can go
 two or three position down before is refuses function, and when I wait I can go down again a bit.<br />
But the most irritating is the not the error when it refuses, but when it changes function to 'press'!<br />
Maybe some of you know it: you want to put the phone in 'silent mode', but because the functio on the top of this menu is 'switch off', you end up with a dead phone and you have to restart it.<br />
If anyone knows if updates of the phone software solve this problem: I hope they tell it here.

<h2>            Excel file corrupted into a text file</h2>
                    <p>Hi There excel experts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been sent here by a very nice support guy from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working on a very large excel file, full of many worksheets with loads of charts.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was saving it regularly but&nbsp;</p>
<p>I foolishly did not back it up and I don't have a version history.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Today my system crashed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I restarted and discovered it had turned into a text file.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems very small 657kb.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I open it in excel it tries to convert it into excel, but only has the first worksheet.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take four weeks of work to recreate it.&nbsp; Is there any hope of rescuing it or should I give up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Katharine</p>

<p>Hello Rita Ricker,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, to better know about your demands, I’d like to confirm whether this account is still active and in organization address lists? And you want to remove it only from
 your view of OAB (Offline Address Book)? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, OAB is a snapshot of the specific address lists that allow end-user to access while disconnected from Exchange Online, and it is not feasible to edit it directly in Outlook
 client. If you want a custom OAB, you can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/address-books/offline-address-books/create-offline-address-book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new OAB</a> from some address lists in which this account is not included, and create new
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/address-books/address-book-policies/create-an-address-book-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Address Book Policy</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/address-books/address-book-policies/assign-an-address-book-policy-to-mail-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
assign it</a> to your account. This way will not affect other user’s experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this account has already been removed from the organization but still exists in your OAB, issue may be caused by OAB not get updated. By default, it is generated every 8 hours and Outlook
 in cached mode automatically updates the offline address book on the client every 24 hours. You can try to manually update it: On the Send/Receive tab in the Ribbon--&gt;click Send/Receive Groups--&gt; click
<strong>Download Address Book</strong>--&gt;Click OK (If you are using Outlook 2016 for Windows).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to correct me if anything misunderstood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h2>            WP7 Marketplace Hub suggestions</h2>
                    
<ul>
<li>After&nbsp;selecting an app to install, it would be nice if I could launch the app directly from the marketplace, I'm not in the least bit interested in the 'Share' option.&nbsp; I have to navigate out of the Marketplace hub and go find the app or game to launch
 and it's very frustrating.&nbsp; </li><li>Similarly, if I am browsing for apps using the Zune client 4.7, I cannot tell whether the app is already installed on my phone by browsing alone, again it's very time consuming.&nbsp; Perhaps there should be a another list menu showing installed apps so I can
 tell at a glance, when I connect my phone, what I've already got installed?</li><li>When I search the marketplace for apps, I would prefer to have the option to NOT include Zune music and video results, surely that's what the Music &amp; Videos Hub is for?</li></ul>

            I know it's an overstated point, but please consider moifying the marketplace sytem to allow puchase of at least XBLA games with microsoft points, it has really alienated a great deal of your customers.

<br />
<br />There can be any number of reasons for the existence of multiple PST files but the lack of info begs some basic questions
<br />
<br />#1 - Is this a new installation of Office or an upgrade of an earlier version?
<br />#2 - How many POP3 accounts are configured in the Outlook profile? To determine the exact number, go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Email tab
<br />#3 - If more then one POP3 account, does each account point to the same PST file or does each have its own?
<br />#4 - Switching to the Data files tab, is the data file set as the default data file one that is also associated with a POP3 account?
<br />#5 - Ignoring all of the above, have you recently changed any "Archive Settings" whereby there are multiple archive files defined?

<p>1.&nbsp; No</p>

            &gt;&gt;4. Nothing is displayed under Data Files tab, even though 4 pst files appear in Documents AND multiple data files appear in the Folder Pane.
<br />
<br />Need some clarification on the above since it would be impossible to have one POP3 account with no PST file. In addition, would also not be possible to have multiple data files appear in the Outlook Nav Pane without those PST files appearing in the Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab which begs the question if we're talking about the same thing.
<br />
<br />What you see under any Documents folder has no impact on what appears in Outlook. There are all kinds of reasons for multiple files appearing which can be caused by events from a long time ago so would be impossible for anyone to provide a "definitive" answer since some causes could be but not limited to
<br />
<br />#1 - Previous attempts to configure a POP account
<br />#2 - Files copied 
<br />#3 - Files associated with a different Outlook profile
<br />
<br />In short, the only files that are of any concern are those appear in the Outlook Navigation Pane which are data files that would appear under the Outlook Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab (this statement is unequivocal - no ifs, ands or buts)

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Then if that's the case, the profile is corrupt in which case it should be recreated. There's no other explanation for this. Before creating a new profile, click on the &lt;Root&gt; of the folder tree in your current instance of Outlook --&gt; Click on the Advanced button --&gt; take note of the PST file folder path/file name. This is the file you want to use when creating a new profile instead of letting Outlook create a new PST file. A POP3 account must be manually configured so do not just enter the email address/password since that will configure the account as an IMAP email account. 
<br />
<br />Just to cover all bases, how many profiles exist on this computer and is the one you're looking at the default for when Outlook opens?

<br />One data file has just my emails in the Inbox.
<br />
<br />The other one as all my emails up to 2 days ago AND all my subfolders, etc.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />There's something missing from this description. Based on the above, under normal circumstances, the way that would occur is that the email "delivery" location for the account was changed. That would have been done by going into Account Settings --&gt; highlighting the POP3 account --&gt; look at the bottom of that Window for the &lt;Change Folder&gt; button --&gt; beside it is the PST folder path/file name of where the email is being delivered.
<br />
<br />The above file name should correspond to the folder path/file name that has your email of the last 2 days.
<br />
<br />To answer your question, just based on all info thus far, what I would suggest is
<br />#1 - set Outlook "work offline" so that it does not continue to download any further emails for the time being
<br />#2 "copy" the &lt;Inbox&gt; folder from the PST file of the last 2 days to the &lt;Inbox&gt; in the PST file that has the complete folder tree (be sure to take note of the folder path/file name of this PST file). 
<br />
<br />Process to "copy" the items is to click on the appropriate &lt;Inbox&gt; folder --&gt; press CTRL+A to select all items in the &lt;Inbox&gt; --&gt; right-click on the selected items --&gt; select &lt;Move&gt; then &lt;Copy to Folder&gt; --&gt; select the appropriate &lt;Inbox&gt; as the destination. The reason for suggesting &lt;Copy&gt; vs &lt;Move&gt; is to avoid any issues should something go awry during the process. The &lt;Move&gt; process will delete the items from the source folder.
<br />
<br />#3 - Once everything is copied to the old PST file, close Outlook, use the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app to create a new Outlook profile and configure the POP3 account manually making sure to use the existing PST file for the account instead of letting Outlook create a new one. 
<br />
<br />When done, make sure that you set the newly created profile as the default profile to be used for the next time Outlook is opened.

<h2>            17017.1000 GPU Driver Updates - when will Microsoft catch up&#63;.... never it appears&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be an "age old" problem for Insiders and Retail users alike - the many Feedback Hub reports with countless up-votes appear to have gone unanswered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Sunday 15th I was one of the fortunate many (or perhaps that should be lucky few?) that updated cleanly and without any problem from 16299.15 to 17017.1000 (I was away for a while and missed the .19 update)</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>YET AGAIN DRIVERS WERE REPLACED WITH VERSIONS! AT LEAST 3 GENERATIONS OLD</strong></p>
<p>This is what I got.....</p>

<p>Trying to update proved useless....</p>

<p>along with a suggestion to go and "Retry" for any updates - again useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate that 6 weeks many be too short a time for Microsoft to update its database of drivers but 9 months!!! That said, August 21 was when the drivers were released AFTER being signed off by Microsoft. But drivers dated 2016 December 29? As we all
 know a lot can happen in 9 months.... even more in the world of technology!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely it's not beyond the capability of the development team in Microsoft to find a way to prevent old versions of drivers overwriting newer versions? If not, someone needs to be appointed as "Curator of Drivers" so Microsoft knows who to shoot if this
 continues.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone from Microsoft can spare some time between **** and Farcebooking to read this .... PLEASE GET THIS FIXED.... I'm sure you'll make a lot of people very happy.</p>
<p>

<p>This is interesting George because for the last 3 builds I have been getting Nvidia v387.92 for my Insider versions. I only received that version for my Release version along with KB4041676 making Win10 15063.674.</p>
<p>But when I was checking online the latest build at Nvidia.uk was several builds behind.</p>

<p>Interesting indeed.... looks like the Windows 10 Update Process is, at best, seriously fractured, if not entirely broken!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my main/production machine I updated to 15063.674 on the 10th of October but hadn't check the Nvidia driver since then so.... I took a look at the current driver and this is what I found....</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81600da8-a46c-4d11-abf8-21d8407a9af4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81600da8-a46c-4d11-abf8-21d8407a9af4" /></a></p>
<p>The update history shows that was installed a couple of months ago but no updates since then</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/620b932c-98c1-45ce-8025-58e17fecb60e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/620b932c-98c1-45ce-8025-58e17fecb60e" /></a></p>
<p>So.... clicking on "Update Driver" an update was found and, after it ran, produced this result.....</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee184650-a740-42dd-820c-6316cae775c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee184650-a740-42dd-820c-6316cae775c1" /></a></p>
<p>Not quite up to date with your version 8792..... (and you say on an Insider build no less!!)</p>
<p>Then, on checking with NVidia.co.uk <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="http://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/125582/en-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/125582/en-uk</a></strong></span></p>
<p>I found 8792, downloaded it and after the install I found this...</p>

<p>
</p><p>At the moment words fail me but disorganised doesn't even begin to describe the state of the Windows 10 Update process!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts you might have as to why this happened?&nbsp; I'll have to revert to my previous quarterly driver update regime by checking in with the OEM rather than rely on Microsoft which clearly can't get it's act together!</p>

<p>Sorry George no thoughts on that. All I am aware was that since my holidays early September; from Nvidia 387.68 I think ( for me the one that started breaking the night light) Microsoft has given me Nvidia updates and these versions were always ahead of
 the Nvidia.co.uk ones. In fact I checked the forums to see if others were getting them and they were.</p>
<p>Prior to these I was manually checking Nvidia.co.uk for updates because Microsoft seemed to be way behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Davy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience in the past was that the drivers I've received through the Windows Update process have always been behind those I found on the Nvidia site but what you say makes sense in that the drivers are signed off by Microsoft so Microsoft will be the
 first party to be able to deliver them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just waiting for the (Fall) Creators Update to see if the drivers remain current or regress.</p>

    <title>Publisher 2010 Cannot print on 1 page 11x17 Wants to Tile print it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aisannsmookler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2010 Cannot print on 1 page 11x17 Wants to Tile print it</h2>
                    <p>I have a printer that allows me to print 11x17. &nbsp;I am an artist and need that function. &nbsp;I just went from Publisher 200 to 2010 and I cannot change the TILE option to ONE PAGE PER SHEET. Is this a glitch in 2010 version and if so has it been corrected in
 the 2013 version.</p>
<p>I have called Microsoft and they tell me it is my printer. &nbsp;I call Epson and they tell me it is Publisher. &nbsp;I have a feeling it is Publisher. &nbsp;I need some help from anyone. &nbsp;So frustrated and cannot print my art and I have orders to fill. &nbsp;Thank you</p>

            <p>What size is your publication page? Is it 11X17?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to File &gt; Print, and just below where you are seeing the <em>Tiled</em> setting what is the
<em>sheet size</em>? Is it less than 11X17? Click the down arrow and see if 11X17 is available?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you publication page is 11X17 and your sheet size setting is also 11X17 do you still only get Tiled as an option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that is true what happens if you reduce your margins to a minimum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you look for an updated printer driver on the Epson site? Just because your printer worked ok with an older version of Publisher does not mean it will work with a newer version. And no, chances are if it does not work with Pub 2010 then it won't work
 with Pub 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails and until you can work this out save your publication as a PDF and then print the PDF.</p>

            <p>Creating a custom size in Publsher does not necessary mean that the printer can print that size sheet. In fact if the 11X17 is not a built-in option under sheet size I would expect problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting a printer driver is not the same thing as downloading and installing an updated printer driver. Go to the Espson site, find the printer drivers available for your printer and see if there is a newer one than you are trying to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What model printer do you have and what operating system are you currently running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that if from Publisher you Save As a PDF file or File &gt; Save &amp; Send &gt; Create PDF/XPS Document (choose high quality printing option), and then open that PDF file in a PDF reader such as the Adobe Reader or the Foxit Reader, that you cannot
 print that 11X17 PDF file to your printer from the PDF reader? What happens when you try...specifically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you print a 11X17 page on a single 11X17 sheet from Word?</p>

            <p>DavidF - I did exactly what you said to do with the Printer/Driver/Updates...still does not work.</p>
<p>My printer prints 11x17. &nbsp;I have been using it for over a year with no issues in my previous Word and Publisher 2000 versions. &nbsp;I just got a new computer and it has Windows 10 (Had 8.1 with computer-just upgraded to 10 - same problem in both 8.1 and 10)
 and Installed Publisher and Word &nbsp;2010 version. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Epson WF7520 with 2 paper cassettes that print from 5x7 to 11x17. &nbsp;It is specifically designed for larger pieces such as 11x17 which I use in my art daily.</p>
<p>Tried printing in Word 11x17. &nbsp;It does not show 11x17 so I have to make a custom page size 11x17. &nbsp;That size appears on the work area. &nbsp;I insert an image that I want to print 11x17. &nbsp;It looks like it fits the page. &nbsp;I go to print, and again I have to tell
 it 11x17 sized paper. &nbsp;It prints but the image I inserted is 8.5x11...I enlarged it to fit the entire 11x17 page.</p>
<p>When I save, as you suggested to PDF, and it opens in Adobe, the Preview is 8.5x11. &nbsp;I try to change to size and it will not change it to 11x17. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what to do, but I can tell you I am at my wits end with this. &nbsp;I was on the phone with Microsoft for 2 hours Friday and &nbsp;with Epson for 1 hour. &nbsp;There has got to be a way to fix this. &nbsp;I don't care where the issue is...I wish someone would just
 tell me what is wrong. &nbsp;I never had an issue with Word or Publisher 2000 using this same printer. &nbsp;Now with the newer versions of Microsoft software I cannot get it to work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for trying DavidF. &nbsp; Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</p>

            <p>I don't have a lot of time right now but there is a Win10 64bit driver for your printer:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=183585&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=OSF_W_10-64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=183585&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=OSF_W_10-64</a></p>
<p>Try installing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not, try installing your old printer driver. You might be able to roll back to your old driver or download another copy of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More later...</p>

            DavidF..I started all over and I went to Epson and downloaded the Windows 10 Driver/Etc. which I have done before (twice) and this time it took. &nbsp;Working as it should be. &nbsp;I just saw your reply and was doing that as you sent it. &nbsp;Then I had to leave my
 studio to run errands. &nbsp;Got back installed new driver and IT WORKS NOW!!! &nbsp;Thanks for at least taking the time and listening to me. &nbsp;Epson did not help and Microsoft CS did not help. &nbsp;But this did....Happy person!!!

<h3> faruqeahmed  say:</h3>
<h2>            my lumia 535 is hanging repeatedly after some moments</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am from Bangladesh. Some days ago I posted a problem regarding hanging and auto restarting of my Lumia 535. I have updated my phone as per you suggestion.
</p>
<p>However, nowadays I am facing another problem of repeatedly hanging of my phone. When this happens, sometimes the screen does not move or the screen becomes totally black. Then, I need to dismantle the battery and put it on again. After that, the phone can
 be restarted and a screen is displayed telling that "SD card errors occurred. Click Yes to fix it." and I press "YES". However, the problem is not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think it is? Please let me know whether I need to update my phone again or should I change my SD card?</p>

<p>Next time it happens, don't remove the battery but just try a&nbsp;Soft Reset :&nbsp;Press and hold&nbsp;<strong>Power + Volume(down)</strong>&nbsp;keys until the phone vibrates&nbsp;(about 8-10 seconds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the SD Card, back-up its data and Format it. Then check if you still get the problem. Else, get another SD Card from a reputed manufacturer.</p>

            <p>It appears that there is no specific information about cover pages that can be easily retrieved by a macro. There are some signs you can look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the document's first page is page 0, it may be a cover page. However, using Mailings &gt; Envelopes &gt; Add to Document also creates a page 0. If there is no page 0 in the document, it's possible that a user deliberately used Header &amp; Footer Tools &gt; Page
 Number &gt; Format Page Numbers to start at some other number. So this is not conclusive.</li><li>Before working on your macro, create a document and insert the particular cover page that you want to be able to identify. Leave the cursor in the cover page. Click Home &gt; Select &gt; Selection Pane. Make a list of the names assigned to the shapes and text
 boxes on that page, such as "Text Box 465" and "Rectangle 468". In your macro, loop through the shapes in the document (or at least those in Section 1) and check whether all of the names in that list are present. If you find all of them, then the desired cover
 page is present; otherwise, there may be no cover page, or a different cover page, or the user has deleted one or more of the shapes or text boxes.</li></ul>
