<h2>            error code&#58; 0x80070652 occuring i install win 8.1 pro from 8.1 preview</h2>
                    I download windows 8.1 enterprise edition but its not installed (because, the message were display "We couldn't update the system reserved partition"). Afterwards I shrink the volume as per the MS Community Discussion by 350MB F:Drive. Again I tried to
 installed but it can't installed. Then finally I select to install &amp; update Windows 8.1 Pro from Windows Store. The Windows 8.1 Pro was downloaded and the message displays
<i>"Something happened and the Windows 8.1 Preview couldn't be installed. Please try again. Error code: 0x80070652" .<br />
<br />
Now what I do?<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
* I already installed all Windows Updates.<br />
** I have partitions volume for boot.<br />
*** I have no harmful or illegal softwares and antiviruses.<br />
<br />
Please make your answers genuinely ASAP.<br />
Thank you <br />

            Hi,
<div>I had this error, and I think the other answers may be sending people off on a wild goose chase.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This error only occurs because the Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant is running.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Navigate or ALT+TAB to the Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant and close it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This fixed the issue for myself and I cannot believe that this was the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why code an error code into the system? just tell us that the Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant is open and to close it... or... close it for us... Microsoft...</div>
<div><br />
<div>How did I find it, I won't take credit, this page did it for me:&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may uninstall the Asus Update from the AI Suite II application. I hope this will get rid of the error. Asus makes good hardware, but their software quality control is pretty bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also refer to this link which talk about the same issue you are facing.</p>

<p>2. Once, It was replaced pretty much when Win10 was just getting the free upgrades out on their site.</p>
<p>3a. Now has 1.237.1347.0</p>
<p>3b. Now finished updating 1.237.1357.0</p>

            <p>1. So you purchased the Win7 computer in 2009 or 2010 [wasn't available before late October 2009], the HDD failed &amp; was replaced by HP on or&nbsp;after after 29 July 2015 (when Win10 became available; not "three years ago"), does the sound right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Are your MBAM Scan logs still available? [&lt;=that's JUST a question, NOT a request!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>COMMENT: When HP installed Win10 on the new HDD, they would have used the same image they used to preinstall Win10 on brand-new computers. Chances are that image included a Norton - or possibly a McAfee - free-trial (as did the Win7 computer when it was
 brand-new). Doesn't matter if you never used/Activated it. The "leftovers" may be playing a role here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>COMMENT: Some Win10 users&nbsp;have&nbsp;encountered <span><strong>Windows Media Player encountered a problem...
</strong>and similar errors when attempting to play music &amp; videos acquired BEFORE they installed Windows 10 Anniversary Update [AKA Win10 Version 1607] - but if WMP is "crashing," I suspect your problem has a different source since it would appear that you've
 been running Win10 1607 for several months now. </span></p>

<p>Thanks for following up. It looks like the app is not launching properly, therefore I would like to suggest a few troubleshooting steps to address this issue. First, try to uninstall and reinstall the app and see if it helps. simply type
<strong>Apps &amp; features</strong> on the Cortana search box and hit the Enter key. Next, look for Google Chrome, click it and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. After uninstalling Chrome, restart your PC, and download/install the app again.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on the issue. I appreciate your efforts in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When such errors occur, usually reinstalling or doing a repair installation is the best choice of action. However, we can try to repair these files and check if it helps. To do so, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the start page and type "<strong>cmd</strong>"</li><li>Right click on the command prompt and click on "<strong>Run as administrator</strong>".</li><li>Type the following commands and hit enter after each.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you run these commands, restart the system and try the update again.</span></p>

<h2>            2013 MacBook Pro &#40;Non-Boot Camp&#41; Windows 10 wifi drivers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got an issue in need of a solution. I have a 2013 macbook pro 15" that due to some poor choices on my part (neither mac nor windows is a poor choice, but this issue seems to have an easy solution had i kept macos on the device), I have removed the mac side
 of things completely and wanted to run as windows only.&nbsp; However i come to find out that there is no wifi driver for this model / version of macbook.&nbsp; I believe it is the Broadcome xtreme gig model.&nbsp; I can hook the device up via ethernet and it works beautiful,
 but it wont find the wifi driver.&nbsp; Windows wont find the drivers nativly and when I go to control panel &gt; devices and find the missing the device, do find driver online a driver is not found. Everything else works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked around and apple does not provide drivers on their website for download.&nbsp; I couldnt find a legit solution via basic web crawling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I can get this MBP to run as pure windows 10 and get this wifi driver working?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows can be installed using the Boot camp assistant or parallels on Mac machines, the most common being the Boot Camp Assistant. The application helps you to create a bootcamp partition and download the related software
 drivers for Windows from Apple servers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When you run the Boot Camp Assistant, your Mac starts up in Windows and launches and installer for Windows support software. The software delivers drivers to help your Mac run Windows. Sometimes the Boot camp Assistant doesn’t
 launch this installer and as a result Windows support software may not install successfully and in that case you can try installing the software manually, whether you use Boot Camp or parallels, the support software including drivers are provided by the device
 manufacturer (Apple). Please refer to the article below.</span></span></p>

    <title>Why is Windows 10 so atrociously SLOW at night&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exhibitintelligence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 so atrociously SLOW at night&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has a fresh install of Windows 10 and everything runs fine during the day. Programs launch and close instantly. No problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After midnight, just typing anything is delayed. Netflix stutters, hitting backspace takes about half a second for every single letter. I absolutely cannot function like this so I use my Linux laptop to surf and watch Netflix at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am starting to buy hard drives for my other computers so as to install Linux Mint on them as a second operating system because Windows 10 won't run properly at night between the hours of midnight and 2am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT IS GOING ON????!!!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the task manager and it seems as the ram is 60-80% used and the SSD is under a 99% load. "Service Host" has a multitude of instances running. Additionally, Windows Defender is also under a load consuming the resources. This is absolutely ridiculous!
 I guess "FREE" has its hidden costs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some late owls that I know have the same issue so I'm writing in to find out to see if anyone has a clue as to WHAT is causing this ridiculous and absurd load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a fairly new Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook. I should not be having this problem.</p>

<p>I cannot find any information on this subject, anywhere. Since no old accessories are compatiable with the X1 I would think that includes gaming chairs. You could try and ask the specific manufacturer of the chaor you have your eye on for more information</p>

<p>I would try to ask the manufacturer about it for sure. As far as I know the previous accessories will not be compatible with the Xbox One. &nbsp;Ex. Third party headsets won't be available until Early 2014. So I would assume the same would go for the chairs.</p>

<p>You can look here, and find gaming chairs that work for both the xbox 1 and the playstation 4. I hope that helps!</p>

    <title>Windows Update Standalone Installer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update Standalone Installer</h2>
                    I&nbsp;was running Windows 7 x64 OS before I updated to Windows 10 but then things went sour. Win 10 got really messed up so I&nbsp;reinstalled &nbsp;Windows 7, which worked well for me before going to Win 10. Since reinstalling Win 7 the Windows Update doesn't want
 to work. When I run the Updater the Windows Update Standalone Installer runs constantly. It will run day and night if I let it but it never downloads anything. How can I repair this? I can't even manually download updates and install them without the WUSA
 running for hours and hours. Can anyone help me correct this issue? Please!

<p>SUCCESS!! I finally got the Windows Update working on my Lenovo ThinkPad laptop. I tried a total reset and everything else I could think of, then I ran a "file repair" program and it returned that the AMD and the&nbsp;BITS was damaged or corrupted. I reinstalled
 the AMD then went to "cmd" and tried to start the "bits" with net start bits. This returned that there were errors and wouldn't start the bits. Then I opened "systems.msc" found the bits file and manually restarted it from there. Shut the pc down and the next
 morning restarted the computer and checked for updates. Guess what? 259 updates available. Thanks to all who offered help on this site.</p>

    <title>My ideal Halo game would have... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x sne x jeno  say:</h3>
<h2>            My ideal Halo game would have...</h2>
                    
<p>-No bloom. Instead, precision weapons&nbsp;will have a bigger crossairs (less autoaim at long range) and slower ROF</p>
<p>-No fuel rod gun on the banshee</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Grenades that functioned like they did in Halo 2 and 3 (as in, no mini-nuke that kills you if you have only 3/4 shields)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-vehicles functioned like they did in Halo 2 and 3. After getting shot up, vehicle damage would start to impact driver/passenger health. The only way the vehicle would blow up is if driver/passenger health reaches 0 (or weak spot is hit like rear of wraith
 or side of ghost on Halo 2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-vehicle boarding functions like Halo 2. There is no way to destroy a vehicle by boarding it. You can either beat the driver up (who has a chance of getting out and fighting back), or you can toss a grenade and kill him instantly, or you can toss a grenade
 on the back of the vehicle and kill him</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-sniper rifles can't destroy vehicles (unless the driver is sniped or weak spot is hit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Plasma thrower has beta power (as in, it actually locks on and can kill people)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Rockets have lock on homing exactly like in Halo 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Spartan Laser is removed from vehicle heavy maps since vehicles and other anti-vehicle weapons are more balanced</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-2x scope on the AR in order to improve it's accuracy over medium range</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Duel wieldable weapons are back. In most gametypes, players will start with a non dual wieldable weapon and a dual wieldable weapon so that you don't have to waste time picking up two weapons at a time like in Halo 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Plasma repeater is either stronger or more accurate (give it a 2x scope as well)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-melee has headshot functionality. Melee kills unshielded opponent in one hit but in order to knock out shields in one hit, you have to aim for the head, otherwise, it takes two body hits to knock out shields&nbsp;(this will create greater skill gap in close
 quarters)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Armor lock is changed so that it can shield you for 2 seconds at a time, 3 times in a row until recharging. However, there is a 3 second cooldown between uses, melee still does full damage against user, and whenever user comes out of armor lock, there is
 a slight blowback to any surrounding enemies though no damage is incurred on them. This will allow armor lock to function as a shield from explosions of all sorts without giving the user an extra 5 seconds of life, frosting, or advantage in melee battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Roll distance and speed for Spartans is reduced but 3 rolls are given before recharge instead of two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Plasma rifle will have an increase in projectile speed, decrease in power, and cause enemies to move slower (function like Halo CE PR only without pinpoint accuracy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Spiker will fire half as fast but projectiles do much more damage and actuall knock a person back each time they are hit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Decoy ALWAYS shows up as red on enemy radar</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Getting shot will prevent you from sprinting for 2 seconds from when the last bullet hits (this will knock back on sword/hammer users and people who run though it will still be possible to get away)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-In order to balance the decrease in rolling and sprint for sword users, sword blocking is NON-EXISTANT except for when two people with swords fight</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-More interactable elements on the maps like in Halo 2 and 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-More campaign elements in Invasion (covenant wave spawns in dropships on random locations on the map, vice versa with spartans in pelicans)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Weapon editor so that if game is unbalanced, the community can tweak anything and everything to their liking</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-More friendly and smart AI in campaign missions (balanced by more difficult enemies)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of these changes pretty much refer Reach back to Halo 1, 2, and 3. This is because most of the things Reach changed is for the worse. Instead of fixing what isn't broken for sequels, add more that wasnt there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Every feature that I had taken out should be kept in certain playlists. For example, how Reach is now would be kept in playlists called Casual Slayer and Casual Skirmish.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How I want Reach to be would be put into playlists like Hardcore Slayer or Hardcore Big Team Battle. Then a mix of what the community votes for would be in other playlists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed Halo 2 and 3 for their balance in weapons, vehicles, gametypes, and maps. Reach seems to have catered to the noob player and decreased the skillgap by adding bloom, beefing grenades, and practically giving vehicles a timer until they explode. If
 that is what the majority of the community wants, then fine. But please stay loyal to your older fanbase and give us some more hardcore and balanced settings that cater more to competitive players. Everything I listed is meant to be balance the game and remove
 90% of the luck factor that exists in Reach now.</p>

<p>I found that list quite interesting and will probably come back to further explain, but I'm about to be busy.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I must say first off that removing the Laser HAS to be accompanied by making vehicles weaker and putting a whole lot more anti-vehicle weapons on the map. I don't think it's as imbalanced as it seems.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, I don't like it when something one player does affects me too much. The Concussion Rifle is a good example: I don't want to be made immobile while you keep shooting me. For the Spiker and Plasma Rifle to do that too would be awkward.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(I love the Plasma Rifle by the way, sexy gun).</p>

<p>Bloom SHOULD be in the game, it's just the "random" part that should be tweaked. The only complaint people have with it is that spammers can beat a pacer, which shouldn't happen 99% of the time, yet it happens quite often.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Taking the FRG off of the banshee makes it near useless. It's basically just a flying whale shooting really ineffective plasma out of its nose. There are more ways to balance something other than removing a key aspect of it.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Sniper Rifles in Reach are designed to have a specific feature which is to be anti-vehicular weapons. And why would they make one weapon incapable of destroying vehicles? That causes imbalance right there. For that to work, you need to make it so NO standard
 weapons can destroy vehicles as well.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>There's no such weapon as a plasma thrower. Do you mean the Plasma Launcher? That is a weapon which takes competence to use. You need to know how to time it correctly. If you can do that, it's a great weapon. It's perfectly fine the way it is.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Spartan Lasers are designed as anti-vehicle weapons. So why would you take them out of a vehicle heavy map? So the foot troops don't have a fighting chance?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The AR does not and never has needed a 2x scope. It's intended as a close range weapon more than a medium-long range.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>That's probably the worst AL tweak I've ever heard. To balance AL, it needs a time decrease, a frosting distance decrease, and a tweak that fixes the second of invincibility AFTER coming out of AL. It also should disable shield regeneration while activated.
 That's all it needs to make it more balanced.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Evade does NOT need to be changed in the least.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The Spiker isn't even used enough in any Halo game to present a balance issue, why did you include that?</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>A weapon editor would probably cause the most imbalance possible. People would find ways to create a gun empowered by God, and nobody would use any other combination (like Call of Duty). There's no room in Halo for a feature like that. We all start with
 the same weapons, and whoever finds the better ones first has the advantage.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I have to agree with BADMAGIK here. I'm glad you aren't working on Halo. It looks like you put some of these tweaks in just for the sake of complaining about each and every aspect of the multiplayer aspect of the game.</p>

<p>[quote]Bloom SHOULD be in the game, it's just the "random" part that should be tweaked. The only complaint people have with it is that spammers can beat a pacer, which shouldn't happen 99% of the time, yet it happens quite often.[/quote]If bloom could be
 tweaked so that the random factor is completely out, I'd be fine with that. But the thing I don't like about bloom on the DMR is that it gives the gun too much range. I've been playing BTB lately and other than the sniper rifle, it has the most range of any
 weapon in the entire series. I can effectively 5 shot somebody all the way across hemmorage. It shouldn't be so easy to do that.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]Taking the FRG off of the banshee makes it near useless. It's basically just a flying whale shooting really ineffective plasma out of its nose. There are more ways to balance something other than removing a key aspect of it.[/quote]Do you even play
 BTB? The fuel rod on the banshee is the most incredible overpowered weapon in the whole game. The killing blast radius is huge and after you fire, you just do a little backflip again and you can fire on another target nearby. I say remove fuel rod or make
 it weaker like in Halo 3. This, combined with removing "vehicle health" would be way more balanced than it is now.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]Sniper Rifles in Reach are designed to have a specific feature which is to be anti-vehicular weapons. And why would they make one weapon incapable of destroying vehicles? That causes imbalance right there. For that to work, you need to make it so
 NO standard weapons can destroy vehicles as well. [/quote]Later in my list, I make it so that NO standard weapon can destroy vehicles (easily). The sniper rifle has never been able to blow up tanks in the first 4 Halo games. I don't know why it can now. It's
 a broken game mechanic.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]There's no such weapon as a plasma thrower. Do you mean the Plasma Launcher? That is a weapon which takes competence to use. You need to know how to time it correctly. If you can do that, it's a great weapon. It's perfectly fine the way it is.[/quote]I
 meant the plasma launcher. It sucks against infantry because all you have to do is strafe to avoid it. I'm not saying I haven't gone on killing sprees with it (attacking unaware oppenents) but I would rather it be a ridiculas power weapon similar to the rocket
 launcher. It was like that in the beta and it was a lot better.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]Spartan Lasers are designed as anti-vehicle weapons. So why would you take them out of a vehicle heavy map? So the foot troops don't have a fighting chance?[/quote]By removing lock on rockets and adding the Spartan Laser, you have effectively removed
 90% of skill from taking out vehicles. The laser is just point and shoot. It's about as easiest way to take out vehicles. I don't know if it is to serve as a crutch for noobs but I like how you actually had to AIM the rockets in Halo 2 and fire at the precise
 time and angle in order to take out enemy vehicles. This also allowed the vehicles to escape with a combination of skill and luck.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]The AR does not and never has needed a 2x scope. It's intended as a close range weapon more than a medium-long range.[/quote]Yeah, and it's no suprise that it hasn't remained the default starting weapon of Halo 3 and Reach. Now it is the BR and DMR.
 I think the AR needs to be a competent weapon, not some weak little rifle that I would trade ANY gun in the game for.
</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]That's probably the worst AL tweak I've ever heard. To balance AL, it needs a time decrease, a frosting distance decrease, and a tweak that fixes the second of invincibility AFTER coming out of AL. It also should disable shield regeneration while
 activated. That's all it needs to make it more balanced.[/quote]That is probably the worst AL tweak I have ever heard. AL should solely be used for getting out of inescable explosions. Giving a dying player an extra 5 seconds to live just hurts the flow of
 gameplay.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]Evade does NOT need to be changed in the least.[/quote]I beg to differ,</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[[quote]The Spiker isn't even used enough in any Halo game to present a balance issue, why did you include that?[/quote]I beg to differ again. It was a somewhat reliable weapon in Halo 3 (would have been more if it had dual starts) but it is useless in this
 game. I don't know why you support any weapons being underpowered.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]A weapon editor would probably cause the most imbalance possible. People would find ways to create a gun empowered by God, and nobody would use any other combination (like Call of Duty). There's no room in Halo for a feature like that. We all start
 with the same weapons, and whoever finds the better ones first has the advantage.[/quote]Weapon editor would cause imbalance? HOW? It would allow people to play the game the way they want to play it and for a consenses to be reached on how weapons should be
 changed from Bungie's setup. If people want to go back to the Halo 3 Ace of Trades BR, let em. They payed $60 for the game, they deserve that kind of quality. For me, I would go for the weapon balance where every weapon and vehicle is different but balanced
 in their respective nitches, AND NO ROOM FOR LUCK.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>[quote]I have to agree with BADMAGIK here. I'm glad you aren't working on Halo. It looks like you put some of these tweaks in just for the sake of complaining about each and every aspect of the multiplayer aspect of the game.[/quote]The kind of crowd you
 belong to is what has ruined Halo for me. Halo used to be competitive in a way that even though it catered to hardcore players, casuals could still have a blast due to the proper ranking system. But now, it seems that casuals are the $$$ crowd and this removes
 developers' incentive to make the game balanced and fair since casuals won't care if the game is fundamentally broken or not.</p>

<p>Boy I 100% agree there. &nbsp; Me and my friends bailed in 2007. &nbsp; I knew the series was over when I read Frankie post in 2004 that they were having Mom's test Halo2. &nbsp; Fortunately, they didn't figure out the BR and Sniper Rifle were fun before removing their

<p>I think they believe the number of weapons in the game is what makes the game great, when actually it's how the gameplay is with the weapons. &nbsp; BTW I hate most of the weapons in Halo especially plasma times. &nbsp; I hate running to weapons as well. &nbsp; I should
 never feel like I have to run around looking for a weapon. &nbsp;IMHO</p>

[/quote]We are both disappointed but for different reasons. I don't want Halo to turn into Call of Duty. I want Halo to to go back to its roots in terms of balance. I'm against the Halo 3 crowd for having only 5 useable weapons in the game and I'm against the
 Halo Reach crowd for making Halo so accessible for noobs. I remember in Halo 2, if you were even slightly better than the other team, you could slaughter them all with streak after streak because the game favored skill. In Reach, it's like your life is on
 a timer and you will eventually die just because somebody on the other team will get lucky with DMR spam, panic grenade, or your vehicle health runs out.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bungie's philisophy used to be that 2 people would will get into a firefight and the better man will ALWAYS leave. That hasn't been with Reach since there are so many things to help give less skilled players a chance at killing more skilled players.

<p>I don't mind getting killed when I scre w up. In Halo 2 or 3, sometimes my aim would be off in a battle with a less skilled player. I can understand losing in situations like that and losing to people that are just better than me. But for me to be get killed
 at all for any reason other than lack of skill (often) is what makes this game so unenjoyable for me at times. The only thing I really like is Big Team Battle because it is the closest to having Halo 2 as I can get (none of my friends play 3 anymore and I
 never liked 3 that much either).</p>

<p>Not at all. &nbsp;It is the Halo series that went another way. &nbsp;I certainly wouldn't want Halo to go the way of COD. &nbsp; COD is COD. &nbsp;What they did was try and make Halo more accessible, but in the end it's just a blah experience. &nbsp; I mean you can go back and read
 Frankie's weekly post, they were hiring non-gamer Moms to come in and test their games, why? &nbsp;To make them more accessible, but at the end of the day they have basically ruined to me with what started with CE and moved on with Halo 2. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's fun to play, Frankie will call it an abuse and remove the item from the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Halo games are quality products, what I mean is they are very solid and have all the features you could want, but at the end of the day Frankie has removed the soul of the what started with CE/Halo2, this was done on purpose. &nbsp;To me what made CE/Halo2
 good was simplicity and effective mid/long-range weapons plus good map design. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why did my Windows Experience Index decrease when I installed Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why did my Windows Experience Index decrease when I installed Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I purchased and installed Windows 8 yesterday, and I am loving it. it looks nice and is quite fast. However, I ran the Windows Experience Index, and while some of my scores have increased, others have decreased.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Windows 7, my scores were:</div>
<div><b>Processor 7.5</b></div>
<div><b>RAM 7.8</b></div>
<div><b>Graphics<span> </span>7.9</b></div>
<div><b>Gaming graphics<span> </span>
7.9</b></div>
<div><b>Primary hard disk&nbsp;<span>
</span>7.9</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>However, in Windows 8, after several runs trough WIndows Update and the latest nVidia drivers, my scores are now:</div>
</div>
<div>
<div><b>Processor&nbsp;<span> </span>
7.6</b></div>
<div><b>RAM&nbsp;<span> </span>7.8</b></div>
<div><b>Graphics<span> </span>7.6</b></div>
<div><b>Gaming graphics<span> </span>
7.6</b></div>
<div><b>Primary hard disk&nbsp;<span>
</span>8.1</b></div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, since installing Windows 8, when I set the resolution to the same resolution I had in Windows 7, it looks blurry. I am connected to a 47" VIVO LCD. If I go beyond 1024x768 the screen is blurry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I guess I have two questions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) What would be the reason for the drop in the graphics and gaming graphics?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) is a Windows Update sufficient to install all the drivers I need? Or should I also run the CDs that came with my computer? I tried running my ASRock intel DVD of drivers, but it wouldn't run.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div><b>You are seeing the drop in scores since WEI in Windows 8 scores out of 9.9 as the maximum score, whilst in Windows 7 it is 7.9.&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
Looking at your scores, I guess you have an SSD as your primary hard disk, in which case the score increased from 7.9 (max score in W7) to 8.1 (currently, the max score for SSDs on W8).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also note that the score may decrease over time as newer, faster and more capable technology is released such as high-end graphics cards and processors. It is possible to increase your scores for Processor, Memory, Graphics and Gaming graphics, by overclocking
 those components.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>E.g. My WEI, <b>stock clocked</b>.</div>

<div>I had the same problem, since Windows 8 ships with a buggy nVidia driver (Version 306.97) and caused other problems with my 3D TV that I use as a monitor. Performing a clean install solved it for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If that doesn't work, make sure the resolution is being displayed at a refresh rate that is supported by your monitor, or Windows 8 isn't sneakily turning on 3D (this happened to someone before). There was also a bug where the Metro UI had problems displaying
 when Anti-aliasing FXAA was enabled, but updating the graphics drivers eliminated this.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Edit:</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>When it comes to installing drivers for devices/components, the first port of call should be Windows Update. If Windows Update is unable to provide anything, check both the&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;between Windows 8 and the device at the below link and check the
 manufacturers website for support of Windows 8.. Most devices should simply 'work out of the box' with Windows 8, and if that's true for a certain device the site will state "No action required" with a green tick.</div>

</span></div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/compatibility/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Some manufacturers were preemptive and quickly updated their devices etc to support Windows 8, but others have been slow, or simply neglected to support the new OS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that helps! =)</div>

            How To Activate Windows 8
<p>Windows Product Activation (WPA) sends an installation ID number to Microsoft before Windows is verified and then activated.</p>
<p>One is an Installation ID, generated by entering a Windows 8 product key, that the computer owner submits to Microsoft, either over the Internet or by phone.</p>
<p>The second is a Confirmation ID, assigned by Microsoft, which is used to activate the operating system’s software.</p>
Activate Windows 8 Using Internet
<p>The easiest way to activate your Windows 8 is to activate it over the Internet. To start the Product Activation Wizard, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. At the Start screen, swipe in from the right side, or hover your mouse in the upper-right corner of the screen to display the charms menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techapna.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f02%2fWindows-8-Settings.png" /></p>
<p>2. Tap or click the <strong>Settings</strong> charm.</p>
<p>3. Tap or click <strong>Change PC Settings</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techapna.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f03%2fChange-PC-Settings.jpg" /></p>
<p>4. Select <strong>Activate Windows</strong> (If your Windows is activated successfully, you will not see Activate Windows in the PC Settings)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techapna.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f03%2fActivate-Windows-8-Option.png" /></p>
<p>5. Tap or Click <b>Activate.</b></p>

<p>The product key should be printed on the box that the Windows 8 DVD came in or included in an email you received after buying Windows.</p>
<p>7. Windows will now automatically detects whether the product key is valid. If your product key works, click
<b>Activate</b> .</p>
<p>8. If Windows Activation is successful, click <strong>Close. </strong></p>
<p>If activation was not successful, check the key and try entering it again.</p>

<p>8. Follow the instructions from the telephone system and write down the confirmation ID.</p>
<p>9. Enter the confirmation ID numbers into fields A through H, in the same sequence as the telephone system provided them. When done, click

<h2>            TSST corp CDDVDW SU-208FB Drive not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba Satellite L50-B1158 laptop with a&nbsp;TSST corp CDDVDW SU-208FB drive. It was working perfectly until 2 days ago it suddenly stopped reading CDs or DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything you could think of (Uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it - Refreshed the PC - Used windows troubleshooting) but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to think that the device hardware should be replaced. Is there anything I could still do before I replace it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            apologies.&nbsp; New to all this.&nbsp; To figure out the address of a network drive, I went into Word and went to print.&nbsp; In the box that lists the printer, it shows what the address for tne network drive should look like.&nbsp; You just modify it according to the name
 of each drive.

            <p>This is because microsoft has discontinued the app. You are advised to use the band APP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem: What do you do, when you have no bluetooth for example on your desktop?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My Problem:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
too much data on the ms band, so i can not even sync with the band app on mobile. &nbsp;Band Sync App doesn't work anymore on the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what to do? throw the band in the bin .... nice support, really.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
