<br />
Then paste into PowerPoint .- is that better??<br />

<h2>            Gmail nightmare  - cursor disappears, characters do not appear when typed</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems only with gmail. The cursor disappears, takes seconds to reappear, characters I have typed do not appear. It is driving me nuts! It takes so long to type an email.
<strong>Please </strong>can anyone tell me, in very simple terms what to do? This has only started in the last fortnight or so.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1. Did you check with the on screen keyboard?<br />
&nbsp;2. What happens when you type from your keyboard?<br />
&nbsp;3. Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To work with the issue, refer these methods.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
Perform a clean boot of the computer.</div>
<div>Clean boot- It’s a process wherein you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div>
<p>Please refer the following link to obtain information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</p>
<p>

<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the issue persists in clean boot mode.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Ensure you perform the step 7 mentioned under “Reset the computer to start as usual” after you check if the issue persists in clean boot, at the above link.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest you to run an antivirus scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner to confirm that your computer is free of any virus infection. Please find the link below.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
&nbsp;The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following link.</p>

            <p>Thank you I am still struggling. I am so busy at the moment that I am torn between doing something I do not understand and risking making the problem worse and just trying to carry on with it as it us until I have time. So although I have spent ages trying
 different things I have not tried everything. I will try again today.</p>

            I can't agree with this anymore. I've had the same issues, it's really frustrating that you see Skype messages coming in, clearly people can chat you, yet you just can't respond!! What's up with that.

<p>
</p><p>The new look is very distracting and bland, especially in Outlook. Everything is very white, very little contrast. The tab pages text on the toolbar float togheter with the myriad of toolbar commands, and the left hand side with mail folders in Outlook is
 just black and white. A step backward in my opinion, and no fluent design at all - obviously another design team with another agenda?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The web version of Outlook&nbsp; (on outlook.office365.com) doesn't have that much color either, but much more attractive, more contrast and cleaner. Now the desktop version looks awful.</p>

            The look of the icons after the recent update is terrible. No contrast, hard to discern one from another. Why change what was perfectly fine? this is a big downside to the excel and outlook especially.

<p>What is it with these interface designers and their simple bland stick figure icons.&nbsp; Everything looks so monotone and it is hard to find what you are looking for.&nbsp; WTF did you change icons again.&nbsp; I hate this trend.&nbsp; The whole screen rund together not and
 looks so bland and busy.&nbsp; Youi think it ;looks clean and classy...WRONG!</p>
<p>
</p><p>STOP SO CALLED IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THESE.&nbsp; GIVE ME CONTRAST, COLOR AND STOP CHANGING STUFF!&nbsp; Let me edit the icons like the old days too and allow multi lines on the Quick Access tool bar.&nbsp; Make the lines and Test for Icons Black instead of gray.&nbsp; Some of
 us have HARD TIME Reading the gray, even with a 4k monitor and the high contract options are too much geared to almost blind people.&nbsp; We can see, but we are not all in our 20's and 30's.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Personally, I like colorful icons. Industrial control panels (like on power plants) use color coding heavily. Emergency exit is marked with green in theaters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But modern UX trend is to remove color. This works very well for color-blind people. And looks nice and clean. Also it allows use of accent color to match user theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So until now the trend was to remove color completely. Microsoft made it mainstream with Modern UI (Metro).</p>
<p>Many open-source software followed, as usual. For example, Qt Creator 4.7 now also uses B/W icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vector (SVG) icons with just 1 color are easier to draw. So it is not only modern, but also cheap. Just like most of Modern Art, where very simple drawings are sold for $1M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious next step was to think about totally blind people and remove icons altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead Microsoft in year 2018 uses 2 (TWO!!!) colors in the icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This goes against the trend. I am happy already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.</p>
<p>New icons are not bad. I am 40, but I find new icons not worse at least. In a week or two, human brain can easily reroute itself.</p>
<p>And vector format allows support of any display resolutions and scaling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.</p>
<p>We can expect 2-color icons now from other vendors. UX designers will present it as something new in the books, and on conferences. Then 3 colors, 4 colors, and we will get Windows 3.1 back!</p>

<p>its not about the color. You can have good icons without color. You can have good icons in svg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the UX in Office is getting worse.</p>

            Something doesn't fit here. You cannot delete an default folder in Outlook. Clarify what you did and what mail account type you are using. What happens when you drag this folder from your Deleted Items folder back to your root folder?

            It's also the behavior of just about all Mac software, including Apple's. If you compare the ruler in TextEdit with the ruler in Word, you'll see they are identical.
<div><br />
<div>The size inconsistency among platforms dates back to the 80's, then Microsoft decided that 72 typographic points per inch (the first Mac's pixel standard) were not enough to ensure a proper rendition of smaller-size characters (and rightly so) and went
 for 96 pixels per inch, which made most PC displays show images 1/3 larger than actual size.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As screen resolution increases,&nbsp;dot pitch shrinks. iMacs now have up to 109 pixels per inch and MacBooks up to 132. However, computers are still rendering images at 1 typographic point per pixel, resulting in ever-reducing "screen inches."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rather than estimate, grab a ruler and measure the page size on screen to decide what zoom percentage you need to display it at 100%.</div>

            It is Correct. it is showing you 100% of one entire Page.<br />
<br />
To fill the screen go to Zoom and choose Page width.<br />
<br />
what you see on the screen has nothing to do with the size of the document. <br />
<br />
I always use Page width to make it easy on these old eyes see what I am doing. When I print out it’s the proper size for the paper used.<br />

<p>I have tried to delete then download to device whilest connested but it still does not show in list of voices. Maybe only for The States; I am in Holland?</p>

<p>You can't just drop your dude_m folder into&nbsp;../cities/diskcache/voices and have it show up on the list of voices in Settings.&nbsp;The list gets populated from the voice_catalog index files in ../cities/diskcache/voices, these are binary files which I've not
 been able to hack. Instead,&nbsp;I got my Surfer Dude back by "impersonating" one of the existing entries in the voices folder.</p>
<p>Try renaming your dude_m folder as e.g. tamil_m, and inside this folder do the same with the dude_m sub-folder and the&nbsp;skin_dude_male.lua file so they have the same name as the ones in the tamil_m folder. Then drop your new tamil_m folder into your ../voices
 folder. When you restart Nokia Drive, you should now see Surfer Dude in the list.</p>

<h2>            How can my &#34;favorites&#34; list be edited SIMPLY &#63;</h2>
                    As with nearly every new and improved feature on Outlook (which are in fact only new but not improved), the editing of my favorites list seems to be close to impossible!  Previously on Hotmail I could just view the favorites list and star or unstar contacts for that list.  Why in the **** did you change it and what in the **** did you change it to.  If there is a SIMPLE way to use my favorites list and edit my favorites list I would be interested in knowing about it.  However, the present usage system for favorites is retarded to put it mildly.  Now, if I want to send an e-mail to people on my favorites list I have to have all those on my favorites list appear already checked and I must unselect all the ones I do not wish to send my e-mail to.  This is beyond stupid.  So far Outlook is quite a dismal look which should be tossed out or immediately fixed.  Hotmail, which was no big wow, was so much better than Outlook that it was almost like comparing a Mac to a Microsoft product.  Can Micro

            <p>I'm not sure if I'm on the right track here, but are you looking to manage Groups (i.e. where you create a group containing several contacts and then be able to send email to that Group)? If so, you need to go to People (which is the new name for Contacts).
 You do this by selecting the down arrow next to Outlook on the top left of the page. Once in People you can click on Manage and go an create a Group. Once the group is created you can add People to the Group. Back in Outlook, you can send an email to a group
 by typing the group name in the To box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the People you have in a group, go to the People page and select the down arrow next to All on the left hand side of the page. This will show a list of your groups and you can select the group you want. From here you can edit the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have not been able to work out is how to temporarily edit a group if, say, I want to remove someone from the group just for the current email. I will continue to investigate this.</p>

            We are not trying to manage "Groups" we are trying to manage our "Favorite" contacts. &nbsp;Previously, this was achieved by displaying the "favorite" list in "Contacts" and clicking the star or unclicking the star after the name of an individual contact. &nbsp;However,
 this function has completely disappeared and it is a hassle to have to go through our entire address book in order to send an e-mail to multiple people and the "favorites" function within the address book is horrible in Outlook requiring us to click "favorites"
 within our address book and then "unclick" the contacts we do not wish to send our e-mail to. &nbsp;Either way enormously time consuming and frustrating and typical of Microsoft. &nbsp;Outlook is an abject failure. &nbsp;Additionally, most of the "help" we've gotten is not
 helpful, is inconclusive, or doesn't even work. &nbsp;Also, typical of Microsoft.

There's no need to get snippy. The people here trying to "help" you are just users like yourself. If you don't like outlook.com then there are alternatives to choose from. Why don't you give them a try to see if they are more suitable for your needs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've not used the Favorites feature before now, so I am no expert in it. But it seams quite easy to manage who is on you favourites list. I just went to People and clicked on a contact. At the top of the page there was an option to Add to favorites and clicking
 on that option put the contact at the top of my contact list under a star heading. I added several more contacts to favourites. If I clicked on a contact that was alread in favortites then the option in the toolbar was Remove from favorites. As I said I hadn't
 used favorites until now so I don't know how easy it was in Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sending an email to Favourites seemed easy enough, too. I just started to type "favorites" in the To box and the favourites contact appeared in the list (for me, I just entered the letter "f" and favorites was the fourth contact in the list). It appears
 to me, in my limited use, that Favorites behave in the same manner as Groups, just with the Group name predefined as "Favorites".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something I don't seem to be able to do though, is to temporarily remove someone from Favorites just for the one email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Throughout this email you will notice I have spelt Favorites in two ways: Favorites and Favourites. I'm Australian and we spell it with a "u" as do our friends from the UK, but despite my Outlook.com settings saying "English (United Kingdom)" the interface
 still uses the incorrect American spelling. So I have tried to use the American spelling when refering to what is shown on the web page.</p>

            For starters it's frustration not snippiness. &nbsp;Following your instructions we went to "people" clicked on a contact and had an option to "delete" no option to "add". &nbsp;Clicking on the "delete" option said it was going to delete it from our contacts completely
 not just from "favorites". &nbsp;This said, the entire process is unbelievably cumbersome and stupid as stated before "favorites" used to be in Hotmail a list that was easily and simply accessible with a list of contacts that we easily and simply starred and unstarred
 at will adding and subtracting from the list. &nbsp;The old process did not require going to an individual contact and dealing with it on an individual basis. &nbsp;Instead it had the entire list of all the "favorites" with a star after their name. &nbsp;If we no longer
 wanted them on favorites we unclicked the star. &nbsp;If we wanted to add new people we just clicked the star on any person on our contact list. &nbsp;We could change it for any e-mail anytime and cha

I don't work for Microsoft, but I have worked for several software development companies and they all did this. There comes a point where the application is "mostly" bug free and you just have to release it. (Oh, and by the way, I too have no interest in twitter,
 facebook or messaging, although I do use skype a couple of times a year).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now back to your problem. Firstly, when I go to People and select a Contact my tool bar changes to give me the options: New&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to favorites.&nbsp;I just click on Add to favorites and that contact is now a favorite. If
 I want to add more contacts to Favorites I just go back to my contact list, select the new contact and then click on Add to favorites. (It appears to me that Outlook.com requires two mouse clicks to add a contact to Favorites, but from your description Hotmail
 only required one mouse click, and that you could do this from the email contact list rather than going to a people page.) If I select a contact that is already a favorite then the "Add to favorites" is changed to&nbsp;"Remove from favorites". If you can't see
 this then you have a bigger problem - are you using a supported browser and version? Have a look here for supported browser information:

            We do not have an option to "add to favorites". &nbsp;Rather than spending hours trying to work around the cumbersome and horribly deficient changes to Hotmail in our "upgraded" Outlook we would prefer to be able to return to our old Hotmail which was easier
 to use though even Hotmail had made Favorites difficult to use in the lead up to the forced switch over to Outlook. It would be nice to have someone from Outlook/Microsoft respond to the problems they have created rather than leaving it to non-employess to

            <p>There appears to be no going back to Hotmail. And very little chance of someone actually from MS being on here. If that's what you want then I'm sorry, I can't help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I will continue to try and help you with using outlook.com if you want. I have taken a screenshot of my People toolbar and loaded it onto SkyDrive here:
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/YHrx7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/YHrx7c</a>. If you are missing then Add to favorites option, then the only things I can suggest are, firstly, to check you are using a supported browser and version (MS have said that some older browsers may have
 "display" problems, although I can't really think the display problem would be not showing one option on the toolbar); or secondly, try clearing your browser&nbsp;cache to see if that changes anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this still doesn't fix it then I am out of options. Sorry.</p>

<h3> fjvanwet  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project 2013 continues to schedule unfinished tasks from project start date, NOT from the current date.  Is there a setting that I am missing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have tasks that are not even started, have remaining hours of work, yet instead of scheduling them from today's date (5/30) and taking into account the resources individual work calendars, Project wants to schedule them at the beginning of the project
 (11/26/2012).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This results in an over allocation of the resource, as several tasks are slammed into the beginning of the project, and (of course) an unrealistic schedule.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow,you have to tell Project NOT to have a task started at the Project Start (it IS the default, you know)</p>
<p>The simplest way to achieve what you want is to use the button specially made for it.</p>
<p>On the Project ribbon, click Update Project. The second radio button does what it says thus what you want - on all tasks or on selected tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            There is a setting for this, in the project info dialogue box. Project Tab &gt;&nbsp; Project information<br />
You basically tell it to default unscheduled task either to project start, or current date.
<br />
<br />
I think project start is the default.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>If you are planning a project that hasn't started yet, use the default setting, since project start is in the future.</li><li>If you are adding tasks to a project that has already started, change the setting to current date.
</li></ul>
<br />
Once you link it up with dependencies this will become irrelevant, but for a WIP plan it's annoying to have new tasks added start in the past.

            If unfinished work is automatically being pushed out to today's date after you have updates it (I consider this desirable, but you may want to do it manually) then under Options, Advanced look at the calculation options starting with Move. Uncheck them
 and the automatic rescheduling should stop.

<p>Some older threads report that this issue could be caused by WPS Office being installed alongside Microsoft Office. Therefore it is a good idea to uninstall any Office suite that you are not using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no other office suites installed, you may have to remove Microsoft Office completely, possibly manually, and then start fresh. See

            <p>It might be a real Trojan or false-positive.</p>
<p>I suggest update Windows Defender and run a full system scan.</p>
<p>Check View activities in Microsoft account and see whether was there any suspicious attempt like try to login or access your account without authorization?</p>

<h2>            Office 365 setup wizard not loading</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to setup Office 365 using the wizard and reached step 3 - connecting the domain. However, when I try and continue the setup wizard (https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/setupwizard) it just has the loading spinner and never finishes loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at the requests in a proxy and there's one to&nbsp;https://outlook.office365.com/owa/ev.owa2 which hangs for ages but does eventually provide a response so not sure why the wizard isn't loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried from 3 different browsers and 2 different IPs to make sure it wasnt something on my end but at the moment I'm not able to complete the setup because of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;Jonathan Kee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, you are experiencing an issue when connecting your custom domain. If the&nbsp;Office 365 setup wizard doesn't work for you, then please do as following steps to see if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Clear the caches and cookies of your broswer.</p>
<p>2. Open a new incognito window and go to <a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Admin Center</a>&nbsp;, negative to Setup &gt; Domains, click Add domain.</p>
<p>3. There are some different ways to verify your domain and add DNS records, for details, you can refer to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-domain-to-office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add
 a domain to Office 365</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to share the result with us. If you still cannot add your domain, for further assistance, please provide following information:</p>
<p>1. What kind of Office 365 plan do you purchase? Since only business or enterprise plan user can add custom domains.</p>
<p>2. If convenience, please try using a different PC and a better network to set up and check if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<h2>            I am wondering if it is ok to allow the app windows_ie_ac_001 through the firewall</h2>
                    <p>I checked on my firewall status and noticed this app - I am not familiar with it and it seems to be an app for hosting temporary internet files when in Private Browsing Mode, and using 64 bit enhanced mode - both the public and private checkboxes are marked
 to indicate that it has access through the firewall - is this a good idea to leave them checked, as it seems to be the default setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help with this would be wonderful - I can not find any online forums where people just get to the point without calling each other names. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Jenny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer's Enhanced Protected Mode tabs run in an AppContainer named windows_ie_ac_001. This container declares the capabilities of the internetClient, location, and sharedUserCertificates and saving temporary files. The AppContainer, that offers
 more fine-grained security permissions and which blocks Write and Read Access to most of the system. Also, the AppContainer helps ensure that an App does not have access to capabilities that it hasn’t declared and been granted by the user. Moreover, it should
 be fine to allow windows_ie_ac_001 through your Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>

<h3> donald c.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel &#40;Office 365&#41;&#58; Date between two dates.</h2>
                    I have set 2 cells (E8, E9) to show the current date (day &amp; month, numerical values). I need Excel to 'post' a notification (on a selected cell, through CF) when the current date is between two set dates. IE: 08/15 - 09/15 (the year is unimportant). Everything
 that I have tried ends in failure. I do hope that I have explained this as simple and complete as needed.

<p>Do you mean that cell E8 has the current Day of Month and E9 has the Current Month? If so, then in the CF dialog use the following formula to apply to a specific cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on whether you wish to apply the CF to a range of cells, you might need to apply some absolute referencing but at this stage I will leave that to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Real dates are required to test the comparisons and therefore the formula requires a year.&nbsp;Provided the same year is used throughout then that will not make a difference to the result where you only want to compare month and day. So that the same year is
 used throughout, the formula applies the current year to the dates. (You could just use any valid year instead of YEAR(TODAY()).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then uses E9 and E8 as the Month and Day and applies the current year to create a real date. It then uses months 8 and 9 together with day 15 combined with the current year to create another real date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AND(DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),E9,E8)&gt;=DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),8,15),DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),E9,E8)&lt;=DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),9,15))</p>

<p><span>Device compatibility can cause why some of its features didn’t work in the Excel application. For isolation purposes, we’d like to know the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Are you able to use the horizontal scroll wheel on your mouse before in Excel? If yes, what are the changes made on the computer prior to this concern?
</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your mouse? </span></li><li><span>Have you tried installing the latest driver for this device on your computer? If so, is there any difference?</span></li><li><span>Have you contacted the manufacturer of your device regarding its application compatibility?&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>We’ll keep an eye out for your reply.

                    When I receive messages there is no audible alert to let me know a message has arrived on my Iphone or Lenovo Laptop. How do I turn them on?

            Hi CharlesMercado1<br /><br />For Windows: Select your profile picture.<br />Select Settings.<br />Select Notifications, then toggle the listed notification types on or off.<br />Alternatively, from your profile, you can set your presence to Do Not Disturb to block chat notifications and let your contacts know you are currently unavailable. Calls will still come through, however.

Also, make sure you haven't turned notifications off for a specific conversation.<br /><br />From the Chats tab, tap your profile picture,<br />Tap settings button Settings, and then tap Notifications.<br />Then you can toggle the listed notification types on.<br /><br /><a hre
