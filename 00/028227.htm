<h2>            Given up on build 9879  &#58;-&#40;</h2>
                    <p>I've enjoyed testing various beta's and pre-release versions of Windows and other Microsoft products since Windows Vista and usually run at least a standard desktop PC and a Laptop when testing a new version of Windows in the past and for the most part,&nbsp;was
 able to&nbsp;run those systems more or less as a day to day computers but I'm afraid there are just too many problems and issues with the latest build, 9879&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final straw came this morning when I tried to run a virtual machine that I'd set up yesterday in Hyper-V and the virtual machine failed to start... Ok, it's test software and you have to expect/accept this sort of thing but when I went to report the problems
 I'd found, again, the feedback system in Windows 10 Technical Preview was down... again, like it had been all weekend, so was unable to even report the problems to the feedback team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linked with the other problems to do with this&nbsp;build, not least of all the HUGE step backwards in the implantation of OneDrive in build 9879 ( I disabled it and then uninstalled OneDrive as it was unusable), all got me to the conclusion that it wasn't worth
 carrying on trying to test/try out Windows 10&nbsp;Technical Preview build 9879, so I formatted the drives on the machines I'd installed the build on and gone back to Windows 8.1, at least for the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have said there will be no further releases until 2015 so guess I'll wait until then to see what is available to try out... I guess I could create a virtual machine of one of the earlier builds of Windows 10 Technical Preview, but I'm thinking
 it will be best just to wait and see what becomes available in 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fingers crossed the next build will be less problematic and hopefully, OneDrive will actually be useable.</p>
<p>

            The joys of pre-beta software. I think a lot of people are missing the point that this is pre-beta testing where new ideas are being tried out as oppposed to making the operating platform more stable. In the 3 builds offered so far, all have been usable,
 but builds 9860 anf 9879 has certainly introduced their share of many new problems to be dealt with. Stable beta level software for everyday use is still months away.&nbsp;Until then, all we can&nbsp;do is&nbsp;hope that the next build will be better.

            <p>Hello there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your nice answer Rick! Unfortunately, Some people are still complaining despite warnings and recommendations from Microsoft on how to use this technical preview! Perhaps Microsoft-should have added : To join Insiders program, we Strongly recommended
 you to have some patience! It's not a turnkey product ready to use but to test and send feedback!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi ... thanks for the input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not complaining about the build... and I think I understand what beta software/pre-release software is (thought my original message may have given a clue there?).... and with beta/pre-release software, it's normal to give feedback when you find things not
 working right?... so that the team working on the build know about it... right?... well, again I thought I'd made that bit clear too.... the FEEDBACK app wasn't working all weekend, then it came back, then it went missing again, so you couldn't give feedback!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to test beta/pre-release software (said that in my original message too) and it's clear that the latest build really isn't stable enough (well not on the computers that I've been running them on) to use on a daily basis, so it was time, for me
 at least (maybe it's working fine on your machine?) to format the hard drives, install a stable build of Windows (Windows 8.1) and wait for Microsoft to bring out the next build, and hope that's a bit more stable and can be tested and we can give feedback
 on it.... I thought that's what beta <em>testing </em>was all about<em>?</em></p>
<p>It would appear from what you are saying, that the build you are testing is fine and has NO problems/bugs/glitches/issues.... I'm very happy for you and I hope you've been giving feedback via the feedback app (is it working again by the way?) to
 that affect.... I'll join you again when the next build comes out in 2015.</p>
<p>Keep smilin' &nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>Hi...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, all 4 machines I'd installed 9879 had many different problems/issues and I think it was just the cumulative effect of them all, including the problem of NOT being able to give feedback (because that was broken for days), made me decide to
 remove build 9879 and sit and wait for the next build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous two builds were quite good actually and I really liked the return of the 'Windows 7' style start menu and the way the Modern UI apps were available alongside the 'old' start menu... that was a welcome return. I also really liked that you can
 make modern UI apps 'windowed'.... I definitely liked what I was seeing in the first two builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the many problems I'd had (I'd been able to report some of the issues on the feedback app, before it too broke)included problems with Wi-Fi not connecting (on my Laptop), smearing of text in documents/emails etc. pressing the close-down button, but
 the computer would re-start &nbsp;and lots of other minor niggles, BUT, I'm afraid, IMHO, OneDrive is FUBAR &nbsp;and got a feeling that if Microsoft continue with it the way they've said, a lot of people will be kicking back on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit disappointed that Microsoft wont be releasing another build now before 2015. They gave the impression, at least from &nbsp;their original announcement for Windows 10 that there would be a rapid cycle &nbsp;and with the first three builds being released in
 just over a month, it was looking like we'd have at least 5 or 6 builds under our belts by the time we got to New Year, but sadly, it would seem not &nbsp;:-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I'll be grabbing the next build when it's made available and excitedly formatting a hard drive or two and taking it out for a spin, but as I said in my original message in this thread, build 9879 seemed too skittish to carry on with, so for me at
 least, it was time to give it an early retirement, understanding of course that this is early release/beta/pre-beta/testing type software &nbsp;:-)</p>

            <p>As of build 9879 I can no longer access the zPC settings, cannot use my OneDrive, email is gone, and pretty much my PC became a nice entertainment system where I can watch Netflix (that is if I can keep my wireless connections up). &nbsp;Kinda disappointing.
 &nbsp;I know it's all test and everything, but to break so many things in one whack is just painful. &nbsp;I have to go through so many back-doors just to get anything done that I would rather take the hike up to my office which has my Windows 7 Ultimate box to be productive
 than to spend the time trying to figure out some way to make something work in build 9789. &nbsp;I'm seriously considering going back to 7 Pro until the next build because 9879 is just bad. &nbsp;Sorry if I sound like a sourpuss, but I'm not one to beat around the bush,
 especially when it comes to my PCs. &nbsp;Oh yeah, and not being able to give proactive feedback is probably one of the biggest slaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I lost my caps lock and num lock lights on my keyboard and yes this is on an older PC that's in my shop (that I just dropped 2 2TB drives in to keep the testing going) and yes I know that this is test software, but I was using it quite happily before
 build 9879. &nbsp;I mean, it was working and was beginning to restore my faith in Microsoft (Windows 8.x really shook my faith in MS... I mean, seriously, how many people really have touch-screens available to them to run 8.1 the way it was "meant" to be run, and
 why the mac-like interface? &nbsp;I hate Apple corp. with a passion). &nbsp;I dunno, maybe I should just bring my Chromebook down to my shop and use it... at least then I could be somewhat productive.</p>

<p>Yeah... I do frequently slide along the bleeding edge of technology... Testing is half the fun... Well, usually at least. &nbsp;However, there are a few things that I've learned in my many years of being a geek... 1. Don't be afraid to break it a few times figuring
 it out. &nbsp;2. Once you have it the way you really like it, make a backup. &nbsp;3. Once you have it the way you really want it to be... Don't go messing with it! &nbsp;You'll only end up breaking it and then having to restore or reinstall it. &nbsp;And that's my thought for
 the night. &nbsp;^_^;</p>

<p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>We received the requested information in PM.</p>
<p>Based on the detailed NDR, it seems that the sender has been blocked. I have reported it to the relevant team. They will email you and help you delist the sender from the back end. It may take several working days.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience,<br />

</p><p>Yes, the Agile functionality should be available in your copy of Project Online Professional.&nbsp; Launch the software and then click File &gt; New.&nbsp; On the New page, you should see a template named Sprints Project.&nbsp; Click this template to create a new Agile project.&nbsp;
 You will see a new Springs ribbon tab every time you open this project.&nbsp; The Sprints ribbon contains the commands you use for working with Agile projects.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Using N96 as a MP3 Player.</h2>
                    Hi, I have a N96 that i would like to use via my car stereo as a MP3 player,the car has a USB port that i can connect the Phone to via the cable that came with the phone,is this possible? any ideas?

<p>Check your car stereo's user guide for USB media as how it wants the folders/directories and files laid out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your files are structured so that the car stereo can handle it, and you have the files in a suitable audio format (it might not be able to play MP3s at all bitrates, for example), then connecting the phone in USB mass storage (data transfer) mode should
 be enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note also that the car stereo might be expecting to see only one drive, so if you have also a memory card inside the phone, I don't know what happens in that case as then you'd see two (the internal mass memory as well as the memory card). Check your car
 stereo docs for that, too, or just try with and without a memory card.</p>

            If you connect the phone in mass storage mode then usb-storage compatible hosts will only see the 16GB mass storage area. Windows-specific drivers that are installed along with PC-Suite and have nothing to do with the usb-storage standard are what allows
 the memory card to show up on the computer when the phone is connected in mass storage mode. A device without those windows-specific drivers (like a Linux computer... Grrrrr....) will only see the 16GB mass storage area.

<h2>            Excel corruption &#34;Excel found unreadable content...&#34;,  Removed Feature&#58; View from &#47;xl&#47;worksheets&#47;sheet1.xml part</h2>
                    <p>
<span>
<span>
</span></p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>User saves an Excel file, and receives the following error (corrupt file) on opening:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Excel found unreadable content in 'FILENAME.xlsx'. Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook, click Yes.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking Yes generates:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Removed Feature: View from /xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml part</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Log file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;<br />
&lt;recoveryLog xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;logFileName&gt;error102200_05.xml&lt;/logFileName&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;summary&gt;Errors were detected in file 'FILENAME.xlsx'&lt;/summary&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;removedFeatures summary="Following is a list of removed features:"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;removedFeature&gt;Removed Feature: View from /xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml part&lt;/removedFeature&gt;&lt;/removedFeatures&gt;&lt;/recoveryLog&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sheet number refers to the codename of the affected sheet. (can be revealed by renaming the file ending .zip and using a zip-extractor to look into&nbsp;<span><em>/xl/worksheets/)</em></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>Repairing causes:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Gridlines reappear on the affected sheet (if they were originally hidden) and frozen panes are removed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
<p>After much pain and suffering, I have identified a cause that generates this error. It is easily reproducible.</p>
<p>1. Freeze some top rows using freeze panes, e.g. rows 1:6.</p>
<p>2. Move to the bottom of the sheet (using CTRL+down)</p>
<p>3. Use the mouse to scroll down so that you see less rows below the frozen pane than in the frozen pane itself (e.g. show 5 or less rows if you have frozen 6 rows)</p>
<p>4. Save and close the file</p>
<p>5. Open the file and voilá,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;it is corrupt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Spreadsheet users may accidentally generate this error especially if the bottom rows are hidden and they use the mouse to scroll down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same also happens with frozen columns and moving to the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Cause in the code:</strong></p>
<p>Using a text difference editor, I was able to pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Not corrupt file:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&lt;sheetView showGridLines="0" zoomScaleNormal="100" workbookViewId="0"&gt;&lt;pane ySplit="6" topLeftCell="A7" activePane="bottomLeft" state="frozen"/&gt;&lt;selection pane="bottomLeft" activeCell="D34" sqref="D34"/&gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Corrupt file:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;sheetView showGridLines="0" zoomScaleNormal="100" workbookViewId="0"&gt;&lt;pane ySplit="6" topLeftCell="<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>A1048576</strong></span>" activePane="bottomLeft" state="frozen"/&gt;&lt;selection pane="bottomLeft" activeCell="D34"
 sqref="D34"/&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The topLeftCell property of the frozen panes in the corrupt file refers to the last cell in column A, which means that the bottomLeft -property does not have anything to refer to because there is nothing below A1048576</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>This is a bug in Excel 2010. I don't know of any workaround other than not using freeze panes. The probability of causing the bug is reduced by not hiding the bottom rows (or rightmost columns) of the sheet, because it is unlikely that the user will accidentally
 scroll to the end of the sheet with the mouse if there are thousands of rows/columns.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This problem appears to have been solved in Excel 2013.</p>

            <p>I recently encountered this exact issue with one of my excel files after adding some enhancements. After finding this thread I discovered the problem but was also able to find a solution. Well at least it worked for me so I'd like to share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was definitely the freeze panes and hide rows related. I discovered it was the method i used to freeze the panes and hide rows (I.e being in page layout view and changing multiple sheets and/or selecting multiple sheets to do this). Without going into
 the specifics of my order, all I did was unhide the rows for the affected sheets (noted in the error log) resave the file under a new name (will automatically prompt you after you unhide the rows and save). I then reopened the new file and hide the rows I
 originally wanted hidden and were causing the errors (doing this for individual sheets) and voila!...the error message was gone plus I still keep my original formatting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps and you can make the message go away when you open your file!</p>

            <p>Thank you, I have a few spreadsheets that seem to have this problem lately.&nbsp; I am using Excel 2016.&nbsp; I found that if I unfreeze the top rows and save the file, I am good.&nbsp; I can even go back and freeze the rows again and it is not corrupt.&nbsp; (At least not
 yet.)&nbsp; Maybe after some more work in the file it will become corrupt again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another file that this solution does not work because there are no frozen rows or columns.&nbsp; And there are no hidden cells in the entire spreadsheet.&nbsp; I'm not sure what to do about this one because every time I format the output by setting the margins,
 scale, orientation, paper size, etc. it will not save those settings.&nbsp; In fact, if I open the file and only change cell information it will allow me to save and reopen without corruption.&nbsp; But, if I go into the spreadsheet and just change one print setting
 and save, it will be corrupt the next time I open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a big annoyance and time waste because I need to open, make a quick modification and print this spreadsheet all the time.&nbsp; Because the print settings do not save, it wastes my time having to reset the settings for each sheet and there are multiple
 sheets in the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            I'm a software programmer and I found that when I was setting the named range's in code that if there was a space in the named range i would get this error. I picked up on the problem because I converted my xlsx file to a zip file. I had a look at the
 worksheet.xml file before it was corrected and i could see that one of my named ranges had a space in the name. I removed the space and it corrected the issue. I hope this helps you.

<h2>            noise when IE 8 finishes loading, sounds like a toilet flush, then car tires squeal</h2>
                    
<p>This started on one computer on the network and today now five more are infected, including a new one that was hooked up to the network for less than five min.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I start IE 8 on the computer, the&nbsp;home pages load then the sound occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked
 at all the wav files on the unit and no luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;am using symantec av and&nbsp;have scanned some of the computers with spybot, nothing unusual.&nbsp; Please, any help would be&nbsp;appreciated.&nbsp; Some systems are using XP others are using Vista 64 bit.&nbsp; It also happens when
 you refresh the last browser screen open (the one farthest to the right).&nbsp; Another note on the last screen.&nbsp; It happens when you refresh the last browser screen that opens when you start IE (two open when I start IE).&nbsp; If you add more browser screens it does
 not affect them.</p>

            Ok here is the problem; The sound is comming from the graphic/advertisement on the second page.
<br />
<br />
I expect you also have the ad for the Lenovo Ideapad 350 on your second page. If you go to that page you will notice when you refresh,&nbsp;the sound&nbsp;coincides with the skateboard (first sound...like a toilet flush. bad sample&nbsp;I guess) turning into a car that stops
 on the computer screen (second, tire screeching sound).<br />
<br />
Go to; tools - internet options -&nbsp;look at the "general" tab -&nbsp;find the "Home Page" section. You will see two sites listed, one over the other. Simply delete the second page or select a new page to have open as&nbsp;your second home page...or duplicate the first
 page, then apply the setting.&nbsp;This way the offending page will go away and take its annoying sound with it. &nbsp;

<h2>            Simplify and unify search experience</h2>
                    <p>I have non-touch Desktop computer. I installed W10 preview on Hyper-V. After using this for a while, I suggest you review Search experience. There are 3 ways to search:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start</p>
<p>2. Search button (next to Windows key)</p>
<p>3. Search menu (... on title bar of store apps)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you search for "Nokia", #1 &amp; #2 are similar;&nbsp;but not #2.</p>
<p>#3 offers drop down to choose where to search; #1 &amp; #2 don't.</p>
<p>UI for each search is different</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Cannot see OneNote pages on Android device after latest app upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorge k.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot see OneNote pages on Android device after latest app upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded the app which runs on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 (Android 4.0.4) this morning, but can no longer open or create&nbsp;pages.&nbsp; I can see a list of the entire hierarchy of existing&nbsp;notebooks, sections and pages which reside on my SkyDrive account, but I cannot
 seem to open any of the pages or create any new pages.&nbsp; Every time I try to do either action I get the clockwise circling dots (equivalent of the "hourglass" symbol) indicating that the app is working on the request, but after a few seconds the screen goes
 blank and then goes back to the listing of the pages after a few seconds of processing.&nbsp; According to the app, the sections are all synced and up-to-date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the problem?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Where are my programmes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>I am into my third day after installing win 10 over my Win 7 installation. The whole process took 3 hours but it went like clockwork and needed virtually no interference from me apart from following the occasional instruction, I was amazed, well done the
 Microsoft team!</p>
<p>I am also finding it an extremely smooth experience using Windows 10, probably because parts of win7 remain at the moment but I do feel comfortable with it.</p>
<p>One thing has defeated me - where is my list of installed programmes? For example, I have installed my old Office cd but have failed to find it so far, where is the programme list? - help will be gratefully received.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use other Office 365 apps but not SharePoint nor OneDrive For Business with Internet Explorer 11. In my case I do need to use Internet Explorer for the "Open With Windows Explorer" function.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Imkryz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before moving forward, we'd like to check the followings:</p>
<p>1.Please try starting Internet Explorer 11 in private mode to check the result.</p>
<p>2.Can you use other browsers to open SharePoint or OneDrive for Business?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, I would like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1.Could you describe "the URL keeps refreshing every second. It keeps sending a different&nbsp;client-request-id= every second" in detail and capture some screenshots of this?</p>
<p>2.When you mentioned you can't use SharePoint nor OneDrive for Business with Internet Explorer 11, do you mean00 it keeps loading the page after you click the SharePoint tile or OneDrive tile from
 the app launcher? Please share more details about the problem you are encountering and some screenshots of the symptom.</p>
<p>3.Does it exhibit same behavior if you try logging to SharePoint or OneDrive with internet Explorer 11 on another computer?</p>
<p>4.Is there any other people in your organization who encounter the same problem?</p>
<p>5.Your Internet Explorer 11 and your Windows OS version build.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joanne</p>

<h2>            Exporting video from PowerPoint introducing audio pops</h2>
                    <p>I'm working with a contractor using PowerPoint on a PC. They are building slideshows with audio I am supplying and then exporting video for me to edit. When I get the video (MP4/AAC) PP is apparently doing some processing and introducing loud pops – often
 4 or 5 in a 10 minute video. I am on a Mac and don't have a lot of experience with PowerPoint. Is there some way for them to export the video with audio untouched? Or does anyone have any other advice that might correct the problem? I'd rather not re-sync
 the original audio when the video comes back to me. Thank you.</p>

<h3> ethelm  say:</h3>
<h2>            counting selected items in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>We recently migrated to Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I was wondering if there is a way to count the number of items selected and show that count on one of the status bars?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the answer that said to&nbsp; press ENTER if&nbsp;more than 4 items are selected.&nbsp; It said Outlook would display a warning if I&nbsp;really wanted to open&nbsp;xx items at once.&nbsp; This did not happen, it opened all the items.&nbsp; I selected 7 items and they all opened
 with no count displayed anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Help in renaming multiple fields using VBA - calling all VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacneedshelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help in renaming multiple fields using VBA - calling all VBA gurus&#33;</h2>
                    <p>How do I <strong>rename multiple fields in an Access table (Table1), using the data sourced from another table (Table2)</strong> which has 2 columns storing the "old name" and "new name". My intent&nbsp;is to have&nbsp;each
<strong>new name&nbsp;replace the original field name in Table1</strong>.</p>
<p><em>More specifically:</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Table 1</strong> stores survey data, with field names like "Q1_a".</p>
<p>I have created <strong>Table2</strong> with a field name called: "<strong>old name</strong>",&nbsp;and I have&nbsp;populated this with the&nbsp;original field names which are survey question codes (eg.
<strong>Q1_a</strong>, Q2_a, Q2_b&nbsp;etc); the second field in <strong>Table2</strong> is named: "<strong>new name</strong>", and I have typed in the corresponding description to the question codes (eg.
<strong>Question 1a</strong>, Question 2a, Question 2b etc).</p>
<p>Now I would like to use&nbsp;VBA to update the field names - I am quite new to&nbsp;VBA, but am able to get by, with some guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation .......</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Why rename them at all?&nbsp; You can return the data as the result set of a query which aliases each column:<br />
<br />
SELECT <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q1_a AS [Question 1a],<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q2_a AS [Question 2a],<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q2_b AS [Question 2b],<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; and so on&gt;<br />
FROM [Table 1];<br />
<br />
If you do want to rename them then insert the result set of this query into a new table using a 'make table' query.<br />
<br />
But a far better solution would be to recast the table into a set of normalized tables by first inserting rows into an empty Questions table, one for each question, using the names you'd give to each column in the above query's result set as the values.&nbsp; This
 would then be followed by inserting rows into a Responses table using a UNION ALL operation:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Responses(Question, Response)<br />
SELECT "Question 1a", Q1_a<br />
FROM [Table 1]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT "Question 2a", Q2_a<br />
FROM [Table 1]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT "Question 2a", Q2_b<br />
FROM [Table 1]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
&lt; and so on&gt;;<br />
<br />
The Questions and Responses table can them be related on the Question columns, enforcing referential integrity and cascade updates.<br />
<br />
If the responses are a standardized set of fixed answers you can also insert rows into an Answers table, one row per answer value, which you can ether do manually or again by means of an 'append' query from the original table, making sure that the Answer column
 is designated as the primary key so that duplicate values are rejected:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Answers(Answer)<br />
SELECT&nbsp; Q1_a<br />
FROM [Table 1]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT Q2_a<br />
FROM [Table 1]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
SELECT Q2_b<br />
FROM [Table 1]<br />
UNION ALL<br />
&lt; and so on&gt;;<br />
<br />
This would be related to Responses on the Answer columns, again enforcing the relationship.<br />
<br />
In each of the 'append' queries above you do not have to do it all in one massive UNION ALL operation; it can be done piecemeal, appending from a subset of the original table's columns each time.<br />
<br />

                    I thought I used to have the ability to see when my windows phone was last backed up to the cloud by going to my Microsoft Account site (https://account.microsoft.com/devices/). &nbsp; Am I mistaken??&nbsp; All I want to do is verify that my phone has successfully
 been backed up to the cloud and as of what specific date.&nbsp; Where can I go to find this??&nbsp; thanks.

            <p>Windows 10 is build 10041.&nbsp; Moving to 10049 isn't an option right now as I'm on a metered cellular data plan that is metered so I have to go to a friends house to download these new builds.&nbsp; Since I was just there a couple of weeks ago I hate to bother him
 again so soon after that.&nbsp; This problem has been around with 9841 and 9926 also so it's not new to my system.&nbsp; Just hadn't bothered to bring it up until I saw it was still around with 10041?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the trouble shooter but it says that the Intellimouse Optical mouse has the most up to date driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>RE: Microsoft Community Forums?&nbsp; There's only about a dozen listed from google search?&nbsp; Got a link to the one I should move to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Mine quit working when 10041 was loaded to my computer. It turns on, but will not log me in on start up. All of my setings have been checked, but no luck. 10041 seems to be a step backards in the windows 10 process. I also don't have modern apps or control
 of windows updates. <br />

            <p>Downloaded and upgraded to 10074 yesterday and the USB Intellimouse problem is still there??&nbsp; Sure hope support is better when it goes RTM than it is now although I doubt it will be any better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah Top BI've also noticed that Win 10 is an update hog with no way to control when it does them.&nbsp; Mine isn't usable half the time because I'm on a slow bandwidth connection and if Win 10 is updating, which it does every time I boot it then I might as well
 forget about trying to do anything online?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Dunno, early on I had a favorable opinion of 10 but that's been changing lately especially with the lack of support in here!</p>

            <p>Since Win 10 is considered a beta product and we don't support beta (usually) in this forum, your question should be asked in the
<strong>Windows 10 Technical Preview forum.</strong> (<em>Security and Privacy sub-forum</em>)

<p>
</p><p>You can move your question to that forum by editing your post and selecting the proper category.</p>
<p>

            in order to fully remove that other antivirus software it is necessary to uninstall it&nbsp; in the normal manner
<strong>and</strong> then go to the web site of whoever issued the antivirus and download and run their removal tool. Note: in most cases both steps are necessary in order to get Windows defender to turn on and run. Hope this helps and if you need any further
 assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

    <title>Re-activating &#64;live.ca and &#64;live.fr addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikola t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-activating &#64;live.ca and &#64;live.fr addresses</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two years ago, I created two news addresses (one at live.fr and one at live.ca) purposefully to assign them as my address on an important site because my, at the time, main hotmail was filled with so much spam I felt insecure about using it. However, now
 that we are two years past, I realized that I totally forgot my passwords for that site. The problem is, as those two accounts have been inactive for over a year, they have both been deleted. So now, I am left with no way to recover my accounts on the site
 as the referred email doesn't exist for me to log on-to and get the emailed code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I know there is no way to recover what has been deleted on the email addresses and am not very bothered with that. Would it be possible to either (1), re-activate the accounts so that I can log into them, even with empty mailbox or (2), create new addresses
 using live.fr and live.ca domains (I could use the same prefixes as they are available now)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help, this would help me preserving a lot of time I invested.</p>
<p>Nikola</p>

            Microsoft is only creating new email addresses in the Hotmail.com &amp; Outlook.com domains.&nbsp; They are not creating new addresses in any other domains.&nbsp; In short you cannot recreate them
