<h2>            Often people aren&#39;t receiving my emails at all &#40;sent from an outlook.com.au email address&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Often people aren't receiving my emails sent from an outlook.com.au email address. &nbsp;I have checked the sent items through the web, as well as my Apple Mail on my computer and it is in my sent items? &nbsp;I think this seems to happen often as people that would
 usually reply to my emails don't.</p>
<p>Is this a general problem with outlook.com.au email addresses ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; sending through Apple "Mail"</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; when I go to Outlook.com and check the sent items, it is in there as well as in the sent items of Mail</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for getting back to us. We have checked the account you’ve provided and it appears that everything is working fine on our end. If the emails were not sent successfully to the intended recipients, you should receive a mail failure notification.
 You mentioned that sending a test email works okay. At this point, can you confirm if all the recipients are not receiving emails or is it a particular recipient only?

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Most of the times, not being able to receive emails might have something to do with email filters, junk mail filter settings and other factors. For more information, you can refer to the articles below:</span></span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t add an attachment</h2>
                    I click 'new' for a new email, then I click the 'insert' tab and when I click on the 'files for attachement's it states: "We're still getting set up. Please try again." This has been going on since it switched over to Outlook for me. I had no problem sending
 attachments when it was Hotmail. I have IE 10 and Windows 7. I have Microsoft Silverlight enabled. I've cleared cookies and cache. What else is there to do?

            I am unable to either receive or send pictures or attachments in msn Outlook. When i select a choice from the paper clip icon, i keep getting this message: "We're still getting set up. Please try again."<br />
<br />
I am sick and tired of this. MSN outlook does not work well.<br />
<br />
And it appears that I am not the only one having this problem and that it has been<br />
present in Outlook for a LONG TIME!!!&nbsp; Why isn't this problem fixed? Is msn ignoring it?<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />

            <p>I am also having this problem of not being able o add attachments to my outlook emails and the problem began when I started using Internet Explorer 10 and I notice that Internet Explorer 10 keeps closing when I try to add an attachment&nbsp;to an Outlook email.
 The problem has to be fixed with collaboration between Internet Explorer and Outlook. I like you are very frustrated and&nbsp;would like this problem to fixed urgently because what is the point of using an email account if you cannot compose emails with attachments

            I don't understand the response you sent me above. I just (about an hour ago) sent my response to questions that were sent me regarding my initial query...i believe it was via the 'private' email. I still cannot link attachments using msn outlook, with
 Firefox 25 on my Windows 7 computer. It appears to work with Internet Explorer (now)..but I don't use that browser. So it appears there is problem between MSN Outlook and Firefox 25. I also tried cleaning out the Firefox cache, but that didn't help.<br />

    <title>separating a forwarded account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdl1948  say:</h3>
<h2>            separating a forwarded account</h2>
                    <p>I originally had a Hotmail account, later added a separate Outlook account and set the new account to forward to the Hotmail account when a message came in to have all messages in one inbox.&nbsp; Now I have found this was a mistake because if I reply to a message
 that came into the Outlook address, is shows sent from Hotmail;&nbsp; not good because Outlook is a business account and Hotmail personal.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I need to separate the accounts, but cannot unforward.&nbsp; If I log into Outlook to access the options, I immediately get transferred to the Hotmail address.&nbsp; The Outlook will not hold so that I can access the profile/account settings for Outlook. !!!</p>
<p>Running Windows 10.</p>
<p>Any suggestion will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Your @hotmail.com address and your @outlook.com address are two completely separate accounts and logging into one will not transfer you to the other unless one is a true alias of the other, which means they're not separate accounts. Whether you log in with
 the @hotmail.com address or the @outlook.com address, however, you will see the same "Outlook Mail" user interface, since Hotmail was renamed to Outlook.com several years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As separate accounts, they'll have separate options and either one will be forwarding to the other and you can cancel it, or one will be a connected account for the other, and you'll be able to delete the connection.</p>

            I found the alias link and see that the Hotmail account is listed as primary.&nbsp; When clicking to remove an alias, however, the info provide gave me some concern (I'm old and not especially computer literate).&nbsp; If I remove the alias will I loose the ability
 to send and receive on the separate Hotmail and outlook accounts or will they continue to exist as two viable accounts just as if they had never been connected?

            If you see one address as an alias of the other, then they're probably two addresses for one account. If you delete one of the aliases, you'll never be able to use it again. It would not become a separate account. Only if you can log in with each of the
 addresses and a password to go with it and see different information in the mailbox can you be sure they're actually separate accounts.

<p>That's how I interpreted the information and what I was afraid of.&nbsp; Guess I'm stuck with it because I can't at this time lose either account.&nbsp; I'll just play with primary designation and email signature.</p>

<p>I misspoke a little in my previous post. Thanks to Ron Sommer for pointing it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I said you'd never be able to use the alias again, I should have said is that you may be able to use that alias again after 30 days, adding it to another account. You may also be able to add it back to the account having it as an alias now, but, frankly,
 I wouldn't be surprised if there were issues. What I said about the alias becoming another account, though, is, I believe, accurate. I've never heard of someone turning an alias into a separate account after removing it from a different account. I also don't
 think Microsoft is allowing new accounts ending in anything by @outlook.com (unless it's a non-Microsoft address), but I haven't tried it, so I don't know with certainly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I don't think you have two separate accounts, as I said I think you have two addresses (aliases) for the mail mailbox.</p>

    <title>E5 - issues list - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E5 - issues list</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a happy user of Nokia E5 (upgraded from E63 :)). I use this phone about 3 months, and I found a few issues.</p>
<p>PS. My firmware is 42.014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Vibra not working after the phone is disconnected from the charger (not always). Solution - restart the phone. (FIXED IN 042.014???)<br />
2. Screen blinking after keypad lock - if you lock keyboard the screen is backlighted for few sec, backlight go off, and "blinks" for one second. This "bug" is not working in "power saving mode".<br />
3. (SMS) Slow "autofill" recipient in SMS - eg. when i type Dex (for Dexter) and press the navi key it autofill recipient, but it's 2x slower than on my old Nokia E63 phone.<br />
4. (SMS) When i want to copy/pase i must HOLD CTRL + C/V. In E63 i PRESSED CTRL + C/V - it's MUCH easier, to type &amp; copy/paste with one hand.<br />
5. (SMS) Somtimes when i paste a smiley or a short text (by CTRL+V) it sends BLANK sms.<br />
6. (SMS) When i put a smiley after "K" letter (without space) - some strange line appears after K letter and looks like "k|".</p>
<p>7. SLOW adding new appointment to callendar (again E63 was a lot faster, than E5).<br />
8. Somtimes when I turn on the phone, enter the pin number, the phone hangs, and restart itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope, that you`ll fix this issues in next firmwares ;)</p>

<p>Useful post Fisz, I have a lot of these issues too (E5-00 RM-632 firmware 042.014.231.01).</p>
<p>Especially the one with slow sms-typing, and smileys disappearing in an sms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully we can make a sticky thread of this topic (if enough people reply and confirm the same type of problems), such that Nokia will be convinced to fix these (in my opinion) simple/small problems. Cuz if theyre fixed, they would make using the E5-00
 a LOT easier ...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found another issue(I can't confirm it, maybe it's settings fault :))</p>
<p>When I'm in range of my home WiFi network, I can't choose a 'packet connection' when surfing web (connection via GPRS/3G etc.) - and again, I didn't have this issue on my old E63.</p>

<p>I use an E73 and have a more, err, rambling bug list here: .&nbsp; If you care to test any of mine, I would be curious how many apply to both phones.&nbsp; As for your list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I will test for this, but I have mostly noticed that charge = no vibration, and no charge = OK.</p>
<p>2) No problem here.</p>
<p>3) Unfortunately I don't SMS very much, and don't have another Nokia phone for comparison.</p>
<p>4) Interesting.&nbsp; My E73 requires two fingers as well, so I think this is just the way it's designed.</p>
<p>5) How often does this happen?&nbsp; I will try to test for this, too.</p>
<p>6) So typing <strong>K : )</strong> (with no spaces) adds some extra character when typing an SMS message?&nbsp; Doesn't happen here.</p>
<p>7) Similar to 3) ?&nbsp; Again, no basis here for comparison.</p>
<p>8) I will test for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how long Nokia will be putting effort into bug fixes for their Symbian phones, so it seems important to find the major bugs quickly and make lots of noise about them! :smileywink:</p>

<p>I made a photo of #6 bug from my list. (See attachment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@thetao: typing k or K (and smiley after the letter with no spaces), add this straight line only on my phone, when I send SMS to someone, he will see it without any lines etc. :P</p>

<p>How are you making the graphical smilies?&nbsp; Is this built into your E5 or generated through a third-party program like A-SMS?&nbsp; (My E73 does only text smilies, and I would be surprised if your firmware was so different.)&nbsp; If you use a program like A-SMS, that
 could be the culprit.&nbsp; The system font is variable-spaced ("C" occupies more pixels than "i"), and my guess is the spacing is off between the "K" characters and the graphical (gif?) smilies.&nbsp; In any case, it is obviously a bug.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know... post after post.</p>
<p>But it's funny to me, that Nokia sells E5 as E-mail phone, but I can't even create a new e-mail account (gmail).</p>
<p>I go to e-mail account setup wizard, then select GMAIL (type in email adress &amp; password), some 'window' appears (automatic account detection), and it return to the the setup wizard again.</p>
<p>Tried "other" settings instead "gmail", and the same...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My firmware is 042.014. Hope, that someone from Nokia is reading it, and the next firmware release will fix
<span><span>although</span> <span>a few issues from my list @1st post.<br />

            <p>I tried everything from the ABOUT Phone, LOW VOLUME - POWER, and LOW VOLUME POWER AND HIGH VOLUME nothing worked EVEN THE TIME and time setting did not work so I concentrated to email account. I did not know what happened then but when I sync the contacts
 it started working... it started to let me sign in to my microsoft account, let me update the apps and let me download the Messenger. It took me exactly one day to work on it. I am happy Vegemite now...</p>

<h2>            video streaming on Lumia 640 Windows phone</h2>
                    The phone wont stream or download video from the Xbox video service.&nbsp;&nbsp; The TV show "better call saul" I bought an episode this week.&nbsp;&nbsp; first three minutes are choppy but stream, then the rest of the episode fails to&nbsp; stream&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone has function where
 you can cancel the download, and it will then default to streaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; That doesnt help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I switch to my android device, and play video from amazon video, the android device streams with no problem!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Im getting p---ed off by this.&nbsp;&nbsp; anybody have
 any suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp; I read in another message thread to minimize other apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; What other apps?&nbsp; what would I be running at the same time?&nbsp;&nbsp; This video streaming problem on my lumia 640 is very frustrating. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ....fyi: the topic dropdown box like most websites,
 gives topics that are not specific to the problem, but the closest one is apps,

            &nbsp; Tested the phone at McDonalds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Streaming on the Mcdonalds wifi performed beautifully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SO maybe the problem is weak wifi in someplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the weather last night affected wifi signals.&nbsp; Maybe last night was a peak usage hour which affected wifi
 performance.

            <p>MSE uses the pipeline for Windows Update, so if Windows Update isn't working, MSE won't be able to update.</p>
<p>Your device driver issue is probably unrelated. The Telemetry "issues" you probably are viewing in the Event log refer to the inability to connect to upload information about detections and this may be related to your other issue. Note that Defender is applicable
 in Vista Home Premium, but it should be disabled when MSE is installed.</p>

            <p>I believe you can set The <em>Microsoft Script Editor</em> as the default script debugger instead of Visual Studio but im not positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run regedit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default script debugger can be set in the registry directly:</p>
<p>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT \ CLSID \ {834128A2-51F4-11DO-8F20-00805F2CD064} \LocalServer 32&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup the branch by exporting it to a file&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the above key, double-click <b>(default)</b> and set its value data to:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Script Debugger\msscrdlbg.exe</p>
<p>Exit the Registry Editor. </p>

    <title>Entering a date using a calendar&#58; possible&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> negg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entering a date using a calendar&#58; possible&#63;</h2>
                    I really don't get it: is it possible that the windows designers forgot to add a calendar applet to date input fields?<br />
<br />
Like, when I am adding the due date of a new task in the task list I have to enter the date manually. But what if I only know, the task is due next friday, but don't want to count my fingers down to know what date that is?<br />
<br />
Even Windows CE 2.1 (my last device ;-) had a calendar popping up so I could simply select the day I want.<br />
<br />
Please tell me: am I missing something?<br />

    <title>How will storage options differ on Outlook vs. Hotmail&#63; My current - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How will storage options differ on Outlook vs. Hotmail&#63; My current Hotmail account may be 3GB over the lowered &#34;Max&#34; Outlook limit.</h2>
                    <ol>
<li><strong>How will storage options differ on Outlook vs. my current Hotmail account?</strong> I don't want to lose what I have, which appears to be 3GB over the "new" Outlook max of 7GB. (It's 10,088-MB right now). Will Outlook randomly eliminate 3 GB of
 stored data when my "number is up?" Or will it delete the oldest data first? I can't afford to loose incoming emails from contacts who depend upon my timely response to their inquiries.
<strong>Just last year, Hotmail was offering unlimited storage up to 500GB so my 10GB was no where near that max.
</strong>To cut it down so severely&nbsp;upon this conversion puts me in a pickle.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>Two weeks ago, upon notice from Hotmail of my "Inbox growing,"</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;cut out lots of emails and shut off several automatic "newsletters" to slow down the incoming emails. I also&nbsp;stopped using&nbsp;"BCC send" to myself on my replies to further cut
 down on new inbox emails. But I need a record of what emails I've sent, so I have not eliminated my "sent" box. I did not have extra space on my harddrives to off-load data, as recommended,&nbsp;but have since purchased a 1 TB external HD and plan to use it this
 weekend. (Here's where the race against a random conversion comes into play when my number is up).
</li><li><strong>My home computer still has Windows XP, so I need to know which upgraded browser will support BOTH Outlook and this slower, older computer.</strong> I may be able to replace it with a Windows 7 computer, but that used unit also needs some upgrades.
</li><li><strong>I also have a 2006 Mac laptop with 2008 Leopard software. At work, I have a 2006&nbsp;iMac, with same 2008 Leopard software,&nbsp;so I need to know what browser level&nbsp;syncs with Outlook.</strong>
<u>The default browser on both Macs is Safari</u>.&nbsp;Firefox&nbsp;did not work well on the Macs. My small employer is not in a position to upgrade 25 iMacs plus software, so I must live within this reality.
</li><li><strong>My laptop's harddrive&nbsp;will be upgraded this&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;from the&nbsp;original 70GB drive to a new 500GB drive.&nbsp;I had been unable to upgrade the browser b/c doing so takes up too much memory on the older drive.</strong> These are real issues real people
 deal with daily who don't have disposable income to buy the latest and greatest. The laptop was a gift from someone who did upgrade, and I am grateful to have it for the cost of a new battery, harddrive&nbsp;&amp; external&nbsp;HD.&nbsp;Microsoft seems to want to steamroll&nbsp;those
 like us out of the way of their progress, but we're real customers living paycheck to paycheck who deserve&nbsp;and depend upon&nbsp;access to the internet.
</li><li><strong>I got a notice yesterday that the conversion is coming and&nbsp;Microsoft wanted me to "upgrade now."</strong>
<strong>How much time can I realistically expect to have to upgrade on my own, after off-loading my excess stored data, once my account has been branded for upgrade status?&nbsp;
</strong>I couldn't upgrade an email account while at work, even though half of the data and contacts&nbsp;it contains is work-related,&nbsp;so I must wait until Saturday when I can get a friend to help and fully understand&nbsp;it&nbsp;and not have&nbsp;it shoved down my throat when
 I can least afford the time to think it through.&nbsp; </li><li><strong>Judging by the random posts I've read</strong> on this forum&nbsp;from confused and upset customers, these random conversions alienate customers by&nbsp;making them&nbsp;very apprehensive. At least give us a ballpark figure of "within the next 5 days this will
 occur if you don't voluntarily upgrade now." That way we don't live in fear of it happening in the next 5 minutes, and can set aside the&nbsp;time to download our excess data to an external hard drive that's kept at home, not at work an hour's drive away, and with
 a snowstorm on the way to boot.&nbsp;I'm looking into this at 3:55 AM rather than sleeping b/c I don't want to log in at 8 am Saturday baffled over where my contacts list went.</li></ol>
<p>Seriously, Microsoft needs to THINK about&nbsp;how people live in the real world.&nbsp;This company is acting as out of touch&nbsp;with regular folk as the characters on the Big Bang&nbsp;Theory. Just because you ARE the smartest people in the room doesn't entitle you to make
 everyone&nbsp;else in&nbsp;the room feel like a&nbsp;fool.&nbsp;Can you really afford this PR disaster?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, now that I've alienated you back, I sincerely do appreciate any help you can provide to ease this transition that I reluctantly must make. AND WHEN YOU OFFER "HOTMAIL CLASSIC" in 6 months,&nbsp;after the fallout, as a gesture of goodwill, I'll
 be the first to gladly convert back. THANK YOU.</p>

            <p>Hi Newsgirl33,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the late response. I would be glad to assist you with regards to the upgrade from Hotmail to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrading to Outlook.com interface should not affect your emails since its focus is to change the interface alone. Please be reminded that you will need an updated version of browser to get the best browser experience for SkyDrive, People, and Outlook.com.
 You may refer to this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/how-do-i-get-the-best-browser-experience-for/63a2884f-99d9-4d21-806a-156c1b185b44#_self">
link</a> for more information. Click <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/supported-browsers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for instructions on how to keep your browser up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regarding the storage limit in Outlook, your inbox capacity will automatically increase as you need more space. Additional information can be found in this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/email-storage-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Eventually all Hotmail users will be upgraded to Outlook.com. The launch of Outlook.com preview gave everyone an opportunity to learn together as we roll out and scale this new service. We will continue to listen closely and fine tune so Outlook.com
 experience will continue to improve. Users may also see Outlook.com interface because of being automatically upgraded. They were notified in advance via email. Please visit the link provided below to know more about the upgrade:</span></p>

<p>This is just a guess but it is worth the try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try pressing the power button and leave it pressed for 15-20 seconds to force a power down just in case it is "stuck" in the update mode for some reason. If you feel it vibrate then it will restart. If that does not do it, plug in the charger and
 try doing the same thing (just in case it is out of power and it needs to feel a charge to restart). It may take a few extra seconds if the power is attached but just keep it pressed until you feel it vibrate. If it does vibrate and restarts, then leave it
 plugged in to charge the check it out.</p>

<p>Hi Jose,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excel utilizes your iOS device system's language and region the default input format. Thus, if your setting<span>&nbsp;
</span>is set to English language (US) and the region is set to English (UK) then your default input format should become DD/MM/YYYY .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: You need to check what region your app is set to and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For additional information in setting up the date in your device , please check the following articles:</p>

            Re:&nbsp; too many different cell formats<br />
<br />
This is often caused by copying/pasting between different versions of Excel.<br />
My free Excel add-in "Formats &amp; Styles" (Delete_Styles) can usually fix this problem.<br />
It will list or delete (your choice) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unused</span> styles from a workbook.<br />

<h3> nejennie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia e63- saving a wifi password</h2>
                    
<p>I really like using the internet radio feature on my phone using the wifi that is in our home.&nbsp; The only problem is every time I want to use it, I have to enter our password (that is a very long, random string of numbers and letters).&nbsp; Is it possible to
 save that password somewhere so I don't have to enter it each time&nbsp; I want to use internet radio?</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

            You can do this as hadimassa said but there is an easy way which is simple. I had a similar problem to you but it was easy for me to figure out what to do. just follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
So go to Menu &gt; Connectivity &gt; Connection Manager &gt; Available WLAN networks &gt; then select your WLAN network from there and go to Options &gt; Define Access Point &gt; Then Enter your Wifi Key &gt; You are done. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
You can verify that you don't have to enter your key every time you connect if you go to<br />
Menu &gt; Connectivity &gt; WLAN wiz &gt; then under your WLAN network it should say KNOWN if you followed the steps above correctly. If it says UNKNOWN that means your network is not known for your e63 therefore follow the steps above.<br />
<br />
If I helped you pls click the Star :) Thank You

<h2>            Datasheet in filtered view - how to update select field.</h2>
                    I have a split form that shows in datasheet view a list of contacts. I want to be able to filter that list and then set a field "Sel" true or false as to whether to include this record in the output email. I cant seem to get the vba logic of the "Select
 All" "Select None" toggle to just update the select field of the displayed filtered list. It wants to do the entire table??? Any suggestions?&nbsp;

            I'm not sure I'm following. If you are using datasheet filtering. You select a column and you see a list of checkboxes at the top of which are Select All, Select None and Blanks. Now after you have filtered the list you want to turn another column into True or False?.
<br />
<br />If so, you would do that with an Update query:
<br />
<br />strSQL = "UPDATE table SET field = True WHERE " &amp; Me.Filter
<br />CurrentDB.Execute strSQL. 
<br />
<br />This should update only the filtered records.

<p>Hi NikolasD98,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I'd love to help, the user/student account is managed under your school Office 365 tenant rather than Microsoft. So only your school admins can retrieve your account info. And since it's a new laptop as you mentioned, I guess there's no cache
 related with Office 365 account stored in your computer. If you can access the old computer, you can try to find your account ID in Office apps or
<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office portal</a> on the web. Besides, even if you find the ID, only your school admins can help you reset the password if they haven't enabled self-service password reset feature in your
 school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm on Windows 8 - and in Internet Explorer - when I go to select a Word Doc to complete a form, or download a Word doc from Yahoo, I get this message. The intended action still works - I can still attach or upload a file - but the message is annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway to fix it?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply...so far, I don't seem to be having problems with 2013 applications opening recently. Just that (24) message - although today I tried downloading a word file from email and did not get the message. Maybe one of the recent automatic PC
 updates fixed it.</p>

<h2>            I am unable to copy and paste Word documents with graphics on the compose page of Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p>Because some of my correspondents are unable to open attachments, I sometimes copy 'word' documents and paste them straight into the e-mail window itself. These word documents sometimes contain diagrams or other graphics. This was never a problem with the
 old hotmail, but now, with the new, unasked for and unwanted 'Outlook' system, the graphics will not appear in the pasted-in document. I am told they have been 'blocked', 'for my safety,' even though these graphics come from my own collection within my own
 computer.&nbsp;This is a major inconvenience. How may I paste in an entire 'word' document without losing any graphics etc. it contains?</p>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm happy to help you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're currently receiving an error message when attaching files in Outlook.com To start off, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; What is the exact error message that you're receiving?</p>
<p>&gt; Does it only happen to a specific document or does&nbsp;it happens to all the files that you try to&nbsp;attach?</p>
<p>&gt; Does the same issue happen when&nbsp;using a different&nbsp;browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            The title of my message has been altered, I cannot imagine why. Consequently I'm afraid you have completely misunderstood my problem. If you read the text of my message carefully you will see that my question has nothing to do with attachments. I appreciate
 your trying to answer my question, but perhaps if you will ignore the title it has been given - by someone other than me - and read the message itself carefully, you will understand what the problem is; that it is to do with pasting in word documents (complete
 with graphics) into an e-mail window, for sending to people who, for one reason or other, are quite unable to open attachments. Attachments are precisely NOT what my query was about.

            <p>Thank you! My first step must be to discover which version of Internet Explorer I am currently using; right-clicking on the application file and choosing 'Properties' is remarkably shy about actually telling me and I will have to look more deeply. You will,
 I suppose, already be familiar with the way Microsoft takes as much ability to use one's computer as one wishes out of one's own&nbsp;hands as it can, so that one is forced to ask people such as yourself how to overcome the problems it creates in its efforts to
 be officiously 'helpful'. I will get back to you when I have investigated why and how, against my wishes, it is keeping a 'cache' and a 'Browsing history', and have told it to stop at once.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help so far.</p>

            Following your instructions, I have checked my internet preferences and found that I had already set them to delete all caches and temporary files on closing IE, and to delete browsing history every seven days. This seems to me quite a conservative setup,
 so I don't think that is the problem. I find that the version of IE I have is 10. All graphics, pictures, photographs etc. that the word documents I try to paste into the e-mail window contain&nbsp;are blocked, whatever their type. Only the written text is pasted
 in, with blank frames where the graphics should be and a note at the bottom of the screen saying they have been blocked 'for my safety', even though they are invariably graphics, pictures etc. from within my own computer that have never, as it were, been in
 contact with third parties. I do not know if the problem would also occur when using other computers or browsers as I never do so. And I do not know what a 'mail client' is, so as far as I know I never use one. I hope this answers

<h2>            Cannot add business account to Onedrive &#40;OSX&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Onedrive on Mojave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal account is running fine, as was my business account until a few weeks ago when they changed my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, the business cloud symbol was always greyed out because it couldn't log in, but I had clouds, one for each account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account wouldn't let me edit the password, so I deleted it, and tried to add a new account with the new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on my personal icon, go to preferences, click the Account tab, click Add New Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It asks me for the email, and then tells me "There was a problem connecting to Onedrive, please check your internet connection."</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the internet connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how can I add my business account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually deleted everything related to onedrive in my library and keychain.</p>
<p>Reinstalled onedrive and hit the exact same problem.</p>
<p>So thinking about the common denominator I decided to search my keychain for my business account details, and sure enough there were 2 copies of the login. So I deleted them from my keychain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now within my main user, I am asked to sign in, and it now connects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, Microsoft's error messages are completely useless, I should have known because they have been useless for over 20 years. Why tell me "There is a problem, check your internet connection" when it should be saying "Check your login details"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook will not launch from icon click or start menu, can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenisannoyed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook will not launch from icon click or start menu, can&#39;t uninstall or repair either</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for suggestions on how to fix this. I am running Outlook 2016 on a Win 10 Pro PC, fully updated to 1709. Out of no where the desktop icon for Outlook has changed, as well as icons on Taskbar and Start Menu (both from pinned and normal application
 tray.</p>
<p>I unpinned and repinned everything.</p>
<p>Ran Outlook in Safemode, disabled Add-ins which had no effect, re-enabled them</p>
<p>Checked for Windows updates, ran them</p>
<p>Ran Office repair through Control Panel (Programs &gt; Change &gt; Repair), got an error, restarted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I go to Control Panel to uninstall Outlook it will not launch the Uninstall. It is present in the list of programs but just will not launch. I can launch Outlook through Run but this is only good as a temp fix.
</p>
<p>I don't get any error messages when I attempt to launch (from icon double click, start menu etc.) it simply just doesn't launch. Doesn't even show as running in Task Manager.
</p>
<p>Here's what gets me, it is only in this state in one user profile on the PC, other profile works normally.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Hello !!
<br />You could try to go back to a previous version of Office . Here the steps
<br />
<br />Step 1: Set a reminder to enable automatic updates at a future date
<br />Before you revert an Office Click-to-Run installation, you should disable automatic updates. To make sure that you don't miss future updates, set a reminder to manually check for future versions. When a new version becomes available, and if the new version doesn't exhibit the same issue that you experienced earlier, you should re-enable automatic updates.
<br />
<br />Create a reminder to re-enable automatic updates. You can do this in Microsoft Outlook, on Outlook.com, or by using another application that has a calendar.
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Step 2: Install the previous version of Office Click-to-Run
<br />To install the previous version of Office 2016 Click-to-Run, follow these steps:
<br /> 
<br />Determine and note the previous version number. Use the following Microsoft website to find the update version that is previous to the current version: (mine is 1708 an runs fine so far)
<br /> 
<br />Microsoft Office 2016 Click-to-Run update: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/version-and-build-numbers-of-update-channel-releases-ae942449-1fca-4484-898b-a933ea23def7?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/versio...</a>
<br />Determine the bit level of the operating system. 
<br />Open an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd.exe, and then click Run as administrator.
<br />At the command prompt, run one of the following commands:
<br />
<br />For an Office 2016 installation:
<br />cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun 
<br />Tips On 64-bit version of Windows, you can install Office 32-bit or Office 64-bit. However, 32-bit is more compatible. For more information, see Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office 
<br />Run the following command:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />For Office 2016
<br />officec2rclient.exe /update user updatetoversion=16.0.xxxx.yyyy  
<br />
<br />Notes 
<br /> 
<br />In these commands, 15.0.xxxx.yyyy or 16.0.xxxx.yyyy represents the full version number that you noted in step 1. 
<br />Because of recent changes, we refer to "version" as the 4-digit year/month identifier, and "build" as the full format (for example, 16.0.xxxx.yyyy). Therefore, the updatetoversion parameter uses the product build in Office 2016. For more information about the differences between versions and builds, see Version and build numbers of update channel releases.
<br />When the repair dialog box appears, click Online Repair.
<br />Click Repair, and then click Repair again.
<br />
<br />Note If you are prompted to activate Office again, enter your Microsoft account and password. This step does not add your computer to your account a second time.
<br /> 
<br />Step 3: Disable automatic updates for Office Click-to-Run
<br />This step is very important. The repair process re-enables automatic updates. To prevent the newest version of Office Click-to-Run from being automatically reinstalled, follow these steps:
<br /> 
<br />Start Outlook or another Offfice program.
<br />Click File, and then click Office Account.
<br />In the Product Information column, click Update Options, and then click Disable Updates.
<br />
<br />Here you have the complete info: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2770432/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2013-or-office-2016-clic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/277043...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know if it helps !!

<p>Thank you for the reply!</p>
<p>I just gave it a whirl with no luck sadly. I followed all the steps and ran the commands and nothing happens. I get no "Repair" or anything.
</p>
<p>The battle continues...</p>
