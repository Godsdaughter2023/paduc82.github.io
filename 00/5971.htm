    <title>Cannot successfully add Outlook.com ExchangeSync account to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fricksmom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot successfully add Outlook.com ExchangeSync account to Outlook 2013</h2>
                    Running Office 365 Home Premium on Office 8.1, had to do a refresh, and now cannot add Outlook.com ExchangeSync to Outlook 2013. The issue may be that my ATT email account and my Outlook.com email account are the same address. They do have different server/passwords/settings
 (the ATT is a POP account), and both accounts worked successfully before the refresh.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can set up the Outlook.com account via ExchangeSync, but once mail begins to roll in, Outlook crashes. It attempts to restart, but fails within 30 seconds again. If I remove the Outlook.com account via a right click before the 30-seconds, then Outlook
 works.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The PST and OST files are different for both accounts. To try to resolve the issue, I have removed both the ATT and Outlook.com accounts from Outlook, and moved the respective PST and OST files.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After doing this, I added the Outlook.com account, but Outlook continues to crash, until I am able to right-click and delete the Outlook.com account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My main goal for adding the ExchangeSync account to access/and sync my calendar and contacts from my Windows phone, computers and devices.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this problem one that others are experiencing? Suggestions on what to try next?</div>

            <p>Hal,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Gave it a try, but even with the new Outlook profile, when I add the Outlook.com account settings (which I do&nbsp;manually since my email address is the same as my ATT address----I've tried blu-m.hotmail.com, m.hotmail.com, s.outlook.com, and snt-m.hotmail.com)----Outlook
 starts when I choose the new profile&nbsp;and begins pulling in email, but&nbsp;still closes after about 30 seconds, tries to reopen, but then finally closes again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any additional suggestions?</p>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have followed the steps above with no resolution (including repairing Office). As a last resort, I did try establishing the email account on another Windows 8.1 computer running Office 365 Home Premium. The same thing occurred on the new computer---Outlook
 begins running and pulling in emails, but after about 30 to 45 seconds, Outlook crashes. The program tries to launch again, but is unsuccessful.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have one device (Surface Pro) that is successfully running the ATT and Outlook.com accounts, syncing calendars and contact lists.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure why trying it won't work on the computer it previously ran on, or why I cannot set it up on another computer that I've never added the accounts to before.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you would like to see the Outlook Scan report to see if you can discover a potential problem, then please advise the email address where I should send it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm open to any additional suggestions.&nbsp;</div>

            Should have posted this earlier. Issue resolved. There was an Internet calendar subscription that was causing the problem. Once the subscription was deleted I was able to successfully add my Outlook.com account to Outlook on my various devices.

<h2>            outlook 365 not showing attachment icon in inbox for some emails with attachments.</h2>
                    <p>This problem has been there for more than 3 years now. How hard can it be for MS to fix this simple bug?&nbsp; It happens to about 5% of emails with attachments, but there is no obvious pattern.&nbsp; I have seen it happen with both HTML and non HTML emails, to and
 from various accounts (IMAP and exchange).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not dependent on indexing, because over the years I have had to rebuild the search indexes, and this has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not dependent on a particular machine or OS version. I see the issue on my old windows 7 and 8 machines and my new windows 10 machine, (with everything up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not limited inbox, the attachment icon is missing in search too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The type of the attached file makes no difference - it can be a PDF, multiple files, images, html files etc. Still no attachment icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every year, I go through the pain of calling up MS support, they remote desktop into my machine, observe the emails which have the missing attachment icon, find nothing wrong, and give up.&nbsp; They don't seem to have any way to escalate the issue to developers
 or similar, they just drop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is the amount of work and time I lose. I keep everything in email - it is my business and personal life.&nbsp; I have 5 IMAP accounts, and one hotmail account.&nbsp; It means I cant search for attachments. I cant order emails by the attachment icon. I
 lose attachments as I have no way to see or search for them. I have around 100,000 emails in outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is costing me personally hundreds of pounds in lost time.&nbsp; If you multiply that by the thousands of people who also have this problem (its not just me) by the number of months/years this problem has been ongoing, it quickly escalates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Well I've been using OL since v97, currently using 365 on multiple devices and cannot replicate your problem, that being the case the problem appears to be specific to your system</p>
<p>I would start by running the MS OffCat utility to see if that finds critical problems</p>

<p>FYI, The problem has been happening since at least 3 years (possibly 7), and on 3 completely different computers with different OSs (win 7, win 8.1 and win 10), and different versions of Outlook (2010, 2013, 2016/365). I cannot reproduce it either - it just
 happens randomly.&nbsp; There is no obvious pattern (e.g. it happens on different accounts with different document types with different email formats).&nbsp; &nbsp;The issue used to appear if you forwarded a HTML email as plain text then added docs, but I see it happening
 on any email, including HTML ones.&nbsp; You dont realise it until you need to search for an email with an attachment, cant find it, then have to manually search by opening each email one by one seeing if there is an attachment inside.&nbsp; It takes hours.</p>

<p>I dont use webdav - I would have disabled it if I could.&nbsp; But this has nothing to do with some emails missing the attachment icon.</p>
<p>BITS is something to do with windows update, so again nothing to do with how outlook creates the attachment icon.&nbsp; &nbsp;If go to windows update in the settings, it says its up to date and last check was 30 minutes ago, so windows update seems fine. It did not
 find any updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In outlook when I do Account-&gt;update uptions-&gt;"update now" it says I am up to date, so there seems to be no problem with updates.</p>

                    <p>When I select the SkyDrive in the Office Hub on my Windows Phone 7 I, and then the subfolder "Documents" I receive the error&nbsp;message "there aren't any files in the folder" (after some waiting due to phone trying to fetch infromation from SkyDrive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reality there are several files and folders in the Documents folder in my Skydrive, and those file and folders are visible in the SkyDrive app, the web browser, and downloadable using the sync client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reset Office on my phone, but to no avail. Is there something else I can do to reactive SkyDrive access from my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Hobbes42,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couple of quick questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the primary Live ID on the phone the same as your SkyDrive account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see documents in other folders?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get back to me when you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

<h3> tim_martin_psu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Teams Type</h2>
                    <p>I am a student worker at a university that started using Office365. I created a Team for my co-workers and boss that I now noticed was automatically added as a Anyone Team. I want to change the team type to Staff so we can use certain functions, such as
 the Shifts tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to do this without creating a new team? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new team would be very inconvenient since we already use the Anyone Team for group communication, calendar events, document storage, etc. Please let me know as soon as possible.

<p>Hi Tim_Martin_PSU,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, switching team types in Microsoft Teams is not feasible. You have to create a new Staff team if you prefer the features of it. While I totally understand your concern to have this feature included. I suggest you submit
 your ideas via the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a></p>

<p>Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback.</p>

            <p>Hi Joey, last Wednesday my Hotmail account sent a link to every address in my contacts. I was worried this could be a virus and it was obvious my account had been hacked. I tried for ages to find a way to contact microsoft to let them know of this problem
 to no avail. I eventually was able to change my password. Now I cannot find any way to let microsoft know that I no longer use bigpond as my server, I now use Iprimus. Please advise.</p>

 and all I get is a stupid Something Went Wrong message with no directions on how to fix this thousand dollar mess, except directions to seek help on line.&nbsp; I am so regretting investing in this Microsoft horror.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how I can fix this problem?</p>

            Yes, it is a true horror story. It won't make you feel any better, but if you look through the forum, you'll see many people with similar stories.
<br />
<br />
Please confirm which version of Office you bought, which specific bundle and was it "Office 365 something???" or "Office 2013 something???"<br />
<br />
I don't think the problem is Win8.1 specific, I believe it is actually a defect in Office 365.
<br />
<br />
We need the FULL and EXACT error message text. MS has dumbed down the 2013 error messages, there are several stupid messages that include the words "... something went wrong ..."<br />
<br />
Here are a few examples:<br />

<p>Method 1 in this tip does a more thorough job that the "normal" uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These “carry-overs” may contain corruption that is causing your problem.</p>

That is a generic error that MS has not published a specific fix for … sorry …</p>

&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>
The problem seemed to be some difficulty with Windows, possibly some part of Windows wasn’t installed or configured properly. We finally used the Windows install disk to either repair or reinstall Windows then Windows Update to reinstall Service Pack 1 (for
 Windows 7) and all the patches. This all took some time and multiple passes through Windows Update. Finally we had a reinstalled Windows that was totally up to date. Only then did Click to Run deign to run properly.</p>

<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span>Method 1: Uninstall using Fix it <br />
<b>Note</b>: If you are using a 64-bit operating system, save the fixit tool on the system and then run it from the saved location.</p>

<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span>Method 3: Remove manually</p>
<p>Method 1 in this tip does a more thorough job that the "normal" uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries.</p>
<p>Boot the computer. After the restart go to <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From the issue description,&nbsp;I understand that you need to go to the next track in Video app. Unfortunately there is no "next" button available in Video app. If you need to play a different video clip, you need to close the current video and open the new
 one using video app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you can expect more features in the
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>upcoming Builds.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I recommend you join the Windows Insider Program to get more frequent preview builds and send your feedback straight to the people building Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you’re an Insider, use the Windows Feedback app to tell us which features you love, which features you could do without, or when something could be better.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to this article by “<strong>Nirmal S</strong>” to know more on “<strong>How to share feedback on Windows 10 Technical Preview?</strong>” :

            OK, that is the current build. In just a few days the 15.23 update will be available to all users (it's available now for those who are in the Insider program). When it comes out, please install it and try again to see if the problem persists. If you want
 to get 15.23 right now, in Excel go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates. In AutoUpdate app click the checkbox to join the Insider program and choose the regular (not fast) version. The fast option delivers 15.24 if you want to try an even newer but
 as yet unsupported build.

            No, syncing between My Phone and a WM6.x device is no longer possible.&nbsp; Microsoft is now migrating some of your My Phone information, including your contacts, to your SkyDrive account. Once your contacts are on your SkyDrive account, you can download them
 (they will be in a .csv file) and import the file into Outlook or any other applciation or service you plan to use with your phone.&nbsp; The migration of data to SkyDrive will be completed by October 6th.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi the user will get a result based on the data that is entered, if the result is out of spec then they will use the escape button to erase the record, which is not what we want them to do. We had an issue last night as I was not there to see what happened,
 they are saying they entered the same values in twice and got different results but with out paper evidence of this I cant say this happened or not because no records in the database was found? So I am assuming they have been using the escape button to get
 out of the database and as for weird results I can only assume they had typo errors rather than database errors. Specially as no one else had any problems.</p>
<p>So <em>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">oops - did not mean to do that."
</span></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Would be I do mean to do that!&nbsp;</span></p>

            So, you really don't want to "disable" the Escape key but "capture" it. You can use the form's key events. You'll need to check for Keycode=27. Check out

            Maybe you can do this: add a button "Save and Get Result". This would save the record (e.g. RunCommand accmdrecordsave) and only if that's successful (use an error handler!) it would present the result. That way the data is already saved and Esc no longer
 plays a role.

<h2>            I haven&#39;t left a group conversation but it is showing me I have left the group</h2>
                    <p>I have created a group in skype but after adding some people the group is showing that 'You have left the group' message and I cannot do anything in the group. Other members on the group can still see me on the group. Even when I go my mobile app I can add/remove
 on the group and post on the group but on my desktop app it is showing that I have left the group and I cannot perform any admin task there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue. I created a group (14 participants) and for whatever reason, I am now seeing a message at the bottom of the room that says "You have left this group."</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the attendees can see me - they say that I am still in the room, but I cannot take any actions. I cannot leave a comment, I cannot add/remove participants, I cannot rejoin the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done as the comment suggests. I've signed out of Skype on the desktop app and signed back in. It has had no effect. I still see the same message at the bottom of the room, and I still have no actions I can take. The existing participants still say that
 they can see me in the room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to close this room down, and none of the other participants are admins and they cannot take any actions to close the room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help!</p>

            SOLVED (on a Mac): Quit Skype &gt; Go to hidden Library (Go &gt; hold down Option key and select 'Library') &gt; Application Support &gt; Skype then delete all files and folders in the Skype folder (leaving the Skype folder in place). Re open Skype and log in. The
 skype group was active and working properly with full access just like on mobile and on web Skype interface. When I realised that both mobile and web.skype was working properly I figured it must be a corrupt application support file.&nbsp;

<h2>            Build 9879 first impressions - why is classic shell blocked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday I installed the new technical preview build for enterprise build 9879. This worked quite well in itself, although... is it bad that I really * h a t e * modern apps on the desktop, and the UX paradigms behind it? Either it's fugly, unusable, or
 both. And that's about it, hasn't changed in the last two years. The dialogue to check for, and download/install a new build is no exception. It's both. The thing looks like somebody was too dumb to click an actually working (i.e. correctly scaling) dialogue
 together. It works, but it looks fugly and dumb. And why doesn't it have a progress bar and a time estimate for a &gt;1GB (dunno the actual size, took hours) file? I mean the initial setting of a modern app is full screen, it will show that something's happening,
 but no progress bar, no estimate? I don't understand it. For me it would be best if all these modern apps simply disappear in a desktop configuration. I really mean disappear. Nowhere visible, except you're explicitly looking for it. No default programs that
 are the in-your-face modern version. Nothing.</p>
<p>Now to the new build: Looks ok. Fast. No idea what this notification center is up to. Progress windows in this new form are definitely daft (seen on macrium reflect, for instance). The older ones were better. Overall it would be a good idea to simply prohibit
 "grab focus" messages for most applications. Window animation is good, non-invasive. Title bars and controls are too big on a desktop.</p>
<p>All my installed applications continued working, except for Classic Shell. This is now apparently "incompatible" with this build. Why that? I see no reason, except for forcing me to hace a look at the start menu. From ClassicShell this is a big step backwards,
 that I can tell you. Again all these in-your-face modern apps everywhere. "Normal" control center 4 clicks down. Hmm. Maybe you should have a look at ClassicShell (or similar) on how it's done right...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you're trying some new directions, but apparently you're not willing to do something radical (sensible) and throw those modern apps completely out when you're on the desktop. This would make windows intuitively usable again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My test configuration: Lenovo T500 2089-2HG, Intel Core2 Duo P8400 2.26GHz, 8GB RAM, 240GB SSD. Screen is 1280x800.</p>
<p>
</p><p>with best regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jens</p>

            <p>Why demand the hiding of Modern apps for everyone when you can just unpin/uninstall them for yourself?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a lot of Modern apps on my tower and laptop - the Teamviewer remote desktop app is particularly good, and the sandboxing of Modern apps adds a little more security. There's no need to remove them, especially when you'll have the option of running them
 on the desktop. Or uninstalling them for your own machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is removing programs that others use and enjoy a "sensible" move to you?</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>tastes appear to be different. I am one of those who really hate modern apps. On a desktop. Every time this comes up it's like an in-your-face insult for my workflow. All this "reduced" UI doesn't get me where I want to go (tm), and to add to it it's also
 slow. Take for instance the network connection icon. Looks suspiciously like your standard desktop icon (VS2012/Office2013 flat style), when you click on it you get a screen ful of PC settings first, then an animated screen full network settings. And then...
 I dont find a single thing I actually wanted to do there, most of the time. Annoying. And that's on a desktop... I mean the connection center is bad enough, but the modern app easily tops it.
</p>
<p>And now... we're talking Windows 10, the next windows aimed at enterprises. When people that have to work with a computer really hate something, then it's when it changes for no apparent reason. And there you go... in spades. Prime example is the Ribbon(tm).
 Makes sure that you don't find anything anymore (tm), nothing else. And now modern apps, start screen, charms (now disbanded for good), acres and acres of useless iconized menus that don't contain what the supposedly productive user is actually looking for,
 the "crutch" of a search line with a full text menu search as a help of last resort, actually being always used, and so on. All this should be examined in the hard light of worplace realities. And then most of it would have to go, or should at least be easily
 cnfigured away. To have a choice between menus and icons. And so on. BTW: The reason OS/2 2.x looked so bland was that it was optimized by designers for desktop workplace effectiveness, as a graphical UI. And it was pretty effective, the follow-up design is
 still in use on OS/390. New doesn't always mean better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>with best regards</p>
<p>

            <p>And because you don't like it, it shouldn't be available to anyone? I'm all for option being provided for you to have your "pure" desktop, and for me to have my hybrid design.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But not for a particular design to be forced on us because we're using a particular form factor, or because others don't like certain elements. I loathe the Menu, but I don't object to its return, so long as it isn't mandatory.

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Engish is not my native language, but what's not to understand on the word "configurable"? And talking about an enterprise windows, it better should be. When I set up the installation image. Changeable afterwards by user / usergroup, dependent on
 device / device class, too. And I'm giving feedback here, that's the purpose of these forums, right?</p>
<p>

            <p><strong>I wouldn't be surprised if MS has blocked out the code that runs Classic Shell.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I have used Classic Shell and recommended it to my (older demographic) customers for years in Win 8, Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But in this TP it is pointless using 3rd party hacks, as we are here to report on&nbsp;its raw&nbsp;useability and recommend better options if appropriate.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I do agree with others, we all want <strong>choice</strong> to turn on or off "certain features" depending on our own workflows and/or preferences.</p>

            <p>I hope that the telemetry in the TP is telling Microsoft when someone is using Classic Shell instead of the native start menu or start screen, and gathering statistical data. &nbsp;It would be interesting if the users staying mainly on the desktop (start menu)
 mode didn't use classic shell, and those that used the start screen mode used classic shell a lot. &nbsp;If people still prefer the 3rd party hack to the native modes, then that is providing Microsoft with information on what options might be better for the native
 modes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Classic Shell as an experiment to see if I could switch between Start Screen and Start Menu at-will with Classic Shell, and I could. &nbsp;It makes me wonder why Microsoft can't do the same thing - why do we have to log off and log back on to make
 that switch using the native start screen and menu.</p>

<p>I hope that the telemetry in the TP is telling Microsoft when someone is using Classic Shell instead of the native start menu or start screen, and gathering statistical data. &nbsp;It would be interesting if the users staying mainly on the desktop (start menu)
 mode didn't use classic shell, and those that used the start screen mode used classic shell a lot. &nbsp;If people still prefer the 3rd party hack to the native modes, then that is providing Microsoft with information on what options might be better for the native
 modes.</p>

 that switch using the native start screen and menu.</p>

    <title>Duplicate Tables in MS Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevecaron2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Tables in MS Access</h2>
                    <p>I am baffled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using MS Access for years and thought I was good at it. I have come across an issue today though which I cannot solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a central Table in my database called "Data", with all of the my relationship tables linking into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I added a new relationship table and managed the relationships as usual. When running a query though, it appears that the original 'Data' table has been duplicated in the background. When I tried to run a query it told me that I had to specify which
 table a particular field came from. (Image one) It was originally only in the main Data table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at a query, I can see when I try to amend a field there are now 4 additional "Data" tables that I can choose, but I cannot find them anywhere to delete them. (Image two) Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached the two screenshots that illustrate the issue.</p>

<p>This may be a simple matter of expanding the table pane in Query Design View. Look at the screen shot, there is a thick line above the grid with several dots in the middle. Position the cursor on that line until it becomes a two headed arrow, then drag it
 down. that should show the table pane. You can then right click&nbsp; on the aliases and choose remove.</p>

</span></p><p><strong>Should I upgrade my existing version of Windows to Windows 10?</strong></p>
<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>

                    <div><span>I use Word 2010 on Win7, Italian keyboard.</span>
<div>
I tried to check the hotkey by setting it in the hotkey menu: it displays combination "CTRL+=" in the 'current combination' but if I try to insert "CTRL+=" (in the form of CTRL+SHIFT+0 on Italian keyboard, as '=' is over the '0' key), it does not display anything.
 It seems the command is blocked.</div>

It worked correctly on Word 2003 on WinXP.</div>

            Hello Daniele,<br />
<br />
I believe that your problem actually has the same solution as the first thread you posted in. :)<br />
<br />
I had the exact same problem, however in Word 2010 (and Windows 7): The shortcut for making subscript "Ctrl+=" is stone dead. I as well am using a Swedish keyboard, however I think this applies to all that have multiple input languages activated and uses a
 keyboard where "=" is accessed by "Shift+0" ).<br />
<br />
The solution for me was the following:<br />
Under Windows's "Region and language", the "Keyboard and languages" tab click "Change keyboards. Under the "Advanced key settings" click "Change key sequence". There I deactivated(/unassigned) the "Switch keyboard layout" which was up until now set to the shortcut
 "Ctrl+Shift".<br />
<br />
<b>To sum up:</b> Win7 was eating every input that involved "Ctrl+Shift" and Word did not stand a chance to notice the "Ctrl+Shift+0"needed to produce "Ctrl+=" on a Swedish keyboard.<br />
<br />
(I think that this post is a relevant answer to all the posts in the thread, so I hope I notify the relevant people if I post as a reply to the first post.)<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Paints Slowly Over RDP</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Outlook 2013 and it is very slow to paint over RDP. &nbsp;Every mouse click takes a sec to respond.<br />
</p>
<p>I've disabled the hardware acceleration in the options but that didn't seem to help.<br />
</p>
<p>It could be my internet latency is too slow but I'm not thinking that is the problem as I can work in Visual Studio 2012 without issue. &nbsp;I've worked with Outlook 2010 for years now over RDP without issue* ( every so often the internet gets flaky but usually
 that doesn't last very long )</p>

<div>I haven't tried directly. &nbsp;I would assume all is well. &nbsp;I'll have a co-worker verify that though.</div>

<div>In safe-mode, Outlook paints slowly too. &nbsp;I've notice it's not just Outlook but the whole Office Suite. &nbsp;I use OneNote constantly and it is terribly slow too. &nbsp;I've used Excel a few times now and it also paints slowly.</div>

    <title>Uninstall Microsoft Office 2010 Click to Run file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinahagger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstall Microsoft Office 2010 Click to Run file</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I recently got a laptop with a Starter version of Microsoft Office 2010 installed on it. As this Starter version does not give full use of the features within Excel, I wanted to install my Home and Student Office 2007.
<br />
<br />
I installed Office 2007 alongside the Starter 2010, however this caused quite a few problems with File associations so I decided to uninstall Office 2010, unfortunately this meant that Office 2007 also did not work as I believe I hadn't installed and uninstalled
 things in the right order. <br />
<br />
I therefore did a system restore to when Office Starter 2010 was on the laptop without 2007. I uninstalled both the Office Starter 2010 file and the Office 2010 file from the Program files. I tried to also uninstall the Office 2010 Click to Run file, however
 this would not uninstall. It just comes up with an error message "this action cannot be completed. try action again. if problem continues, contact microsoft product support".
<br />
<br />
I have now installed Home and Student Office 2007 and it seems to be working, despite the Office 2010 Click to Run file still being on the computer.
<br />
<br />
What I would like help with is the following: should this be okay now? Is it okay to leave the Click to Run file and the associated Q drive there and be running Office 2007? Or do I need to make sure I eradicate the Click to Run altogether? If so, how?!<br />
<br />
Grateful for any help you can give!<br />
<br />

            This article has a few ideas for you to try to get rid of the C2R. Obviously you will ignore the part about downloading and installing the MSI version. You already have the 2007 installation.<br />
<br />
<b>Click-To-Run? Run! Away!</b> - <a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ01094.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ01094.htm</a> 
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<br />
<br />
Installing Starter inside of C2R is intended to totally isolate the Starter program files from any on your computer. The only remaining interaction is the one you encountered, Windows File Associations. Now that you unisntalled Starter from C2R there should
 be nothing to interact with your 2007 installation.&nbsp; I guess there is a slight chance that the C2R could "resurect" starter, somehow. I haven't heard of it actually happening.<br />
<br />
At this point, I would say getting rid of the orphan C2R comes under the heading of "housecleaning" that is worth doing.<br />
