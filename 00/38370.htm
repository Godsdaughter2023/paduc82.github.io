<h2>            Lost All My Pinned Apps</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my pc was fine.</p>
<p>This morning I started up and it seems like there was a major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my pinned items in the start screen are gone as is all my settings.</p>
<p>I checked System information&nbsp; and the build is the same as it was a couple days ago, I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??????</p>

<h2>            Keyboard and mouse input buffering and delay</h2>
                    I own a logitech wireless mk520 combo. I've been using it for about a year know and it worked perfectly well on a windows 7 proffesional (no SP1) system. A couple of days ago I bought a new PC and installed windows 7 proffesional SP1 with all the updates
 and on my new system (even before the updates), once or twice a day, my keyboard inputs get buffered and delayed. Most of the keyboard keys reach the destination after about 5-10 seconds, but some of them never show up. This happened accross different applications
 (google chrome, space marine game). Any ideas?
<div>Thanks and let me know if you need more information.</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I think&nbsp;receiver&nbsp;relocation did the trick. I've moved the received to the front USB so it's now closer to the mouse/keyboard combo and farther from the router. I haven't noticed the problem since.</div>
<div>Thanks for the help.</div>

            Hi, I'm cristhian and I'm willing to help you today
<br />
<br />We want to tell you that, the error that appears in the update refers to the lack of space in the system, however, it can also be something related to a program or file preventing the Windows Update services from running. As for printers, it is something of drivers, which is repaired with the update or reinstallation of the printer itself.
<br />
<br />Therefore, we recommend the following repair processes:
<br />
<br />Process 1.
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any antivirus that you have installed on your computer, other than Windows Defender. The way to do it can be found through the developer of the application. Skip this step if you do not have any other.
<br />
<br />Process 2.
<br />
<br />Then, access the main menu search engine and there type CMD, right / secondary click on the command prompt and choose to run as administrator. Next, you will enter the following commands one by one and press Enter. You must wait for the answer of each to enter the following:
<br />
<br />
<br />SC config wuauserv start = auto
<br />
<br />SC config bits start = auto
<br />
<br />SC config cryptsvc start = auto
<br />
<br />SC config trustedinstaller start = auto
<br />
<br />
<br />Process 3.
<br />
<br />Finally, do a full repair of Windows Update and its services, in addition to installing all pending updates. Click on it with the help of the following link, there choose the Windows 10 operating system and perform maximum up to step 5 Correct damaged Windows files: Repair Windows Update problems.

<br />
<br />Then, install the update and for the printers, use the steps explained below: Troubleshoot printer connection and printing problems in Windows 10.
<br />

<p>The best thing to do is to contact the printer manufacturer's technical support. Your printer has a brand and a model number, yes? What are they?</p>

 except play the movies.&nbsp; I've tried download VCL media player and DIVx but it to does not help.&nbsp; Anyone have a fix to this&nbsp;problem short of upgrading to windows 7?&nbsp; I just don't want to spend any more money on this.

            Thanks for the post.&nbsp; I spent quite&nbsp;a bit of time emailing back and forth with HP (Not much help at all!!!) and finally it dawned on me that perhaps the issue was the installation cd that came with the dvd drive.&nbsp; It is set up quite poorly with no instructions
 and no autorun/play.&nbsp; After doing a search for the setup file to find the appropriate .exe , the installation process started all over again.&nbsp; This time it took about 1 1/2 hours but in the end everything works correctly and&nbsp; now I am able to play movies.&nbsp;
 By the way, HP also suggested system recovery which turned out to not be necessary.&nbsp; Thanks again!

<h2>            Some web pages coming up blank in IE&#47;Edge&#47;Chrome</h2>
                    <p>I have a weird problem that only recently started happening. Windows 10, NVidia GTS 750 Ti, 64-bit. When I open IE/Edge or even Chrome and go to aa.com (for example) the page comes up blank. But if I mouse over certain areas, I see in the very bottom of
 the window hyperlinks, and my cursor also changes depending on which invisible field I'm over. This has happened on other sites, but aa.com is 100% repeatable. So the page loads, but I just can't see it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought it was just an IE problem. But Edge and Chrome are also affected. In IE I also notice that most buttons on Tweetdeck are invisible, and also in wordpress some editor buttons are blank. Tweetdeck buttons are visible in Chrome though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded my video drivers to the latest NVidia package, but that didn't help. On my old Windows 7 work PC everything works just as expected. This has rendered my home PC useless for booking tickets on aa.com, which is my airline of choice. I also have
 to use Chrome for Tweetdeck, whereas I'd prefer IE. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing I want to do is re-load my PC from scratch. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            I'm on a wired connection. I just downloaded Firefox, and the same symptom. My work PC (Win7) is on a wireless connection (same ISP/router) and it works perfectly. I've rebooted my Win10 PC a few times, and still no luck. I can go to mobile.aa.com on my
 iPhone using WiFi, and that comes up.

            <p>What´s up, CraigWeekes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might try to make a SFC command. This identify and restore the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try this procedure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>CMD</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Right click on the icon and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>4. On&nbsp;CMD window, type: <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>(there is a space bar between "sfc" and "/")</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Wait untill the end of the process and restart Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It´s going to restore the drivers and fix this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you need more information, post again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

</p><p>That doesn't sound good... or right. If they worked when new, they should be working again now.</p>

    <title>Host migration&#47;score reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awtacular  say:</h3>
<h2>            Host migration&#47;score reset</h2>
                    
<p>I'm just curious if its been happnening to anyone else? I've had three games in the past week where the host left and we get the host migration message. Among resuming the game I end up losing all of my progress from that match yet others haven't. Its like
 I just joined the match and end up in last place with all 0s even if I was in first place. I'm not sure why it keeps doing this but it is starting to be more annoying than when the host dashboards and the match ends. I haven't had this happen ever in any of
 the previous COD's.</p>

<p>&nbsp;A lot of weird things happen during host migrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've wound up in a completely different match, or at least only a couple of the original players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; There was a forum reg who meantioned being put on the other team &nbsp; I looked at his recent games and if i remember correctly he was top scorer on both even.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Caps/plants disappear from the scoreboard .... just some of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We've won ( overwhelmingly) both rounds, yet the match goes to a tie breaker and we lose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Captures plants appear during a migration .... for example we are defending a bombsite successfully, migration ends, bomb has been planted and the timer has run half way down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I can understand losing stats and ending up in the same match with a 0 score but the other stuff, even though rare, puzzles me. Sometimes its if there are some players still running around playing while the migration is going on ..... perhaps the new
 host, or maybe that it just takes some of us longer for the match to start back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Other things I do understand .... but find most annoying. Timers for the most part. Ssr and bomb timers keep going, scores for holding objectives keep adding up, thrown grenades go off without a possibility of killing anyone ..........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; .......... &nbsp;and why is it I almost always shoot one bullet when the game resumes. This hasnt bothered me much in bo2 when it happens but in earlier releases I did a lot of sniping, where I was deliberately trying to be quiet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; And one more thing while I'm on a rant. .... not a migration thing, but why lately do I keep respawning staring straight up at the sky? &nbsp; &nbsp;I've heard others complain about the same thing happeneing to them.</p>

<p>Yeah, Ive seen that before (losing score during migration) and we started a game the other day (a party of 3 or 4) and it splits the lobby to start the game and the game starts and its like 8 or 9 against 3. It stayed that way the whole game. It was rare
 and probably caused by odd numbers in parties in the lobby, but why have us in the small team? LOL.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I just got in a match of tdm on hijacked (from the start). It started 4 vs 4. I run the whole lenghth of the ship and realize I've heard no gunfire, seen 0 enemies .... and there are no triangles on the minimap, not even a yellow one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I ran back the other way and saw some teammates. along with a message on the screen, "enemy forfeiting within "x" seconds" . I turn a corner and get shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It all went downhill from there.</p>

<h2>            Is the &#34;Microsoft Rewards&#34; program a scam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see enough evidence that makes me seriously question its validity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from having a real cheapening effect on the Microsoft name itself, I also see strange errors that prevent me from checking it out.&nbsp; The latest being a strange misspelling in the subject line of an e-mail message.&nbsp; It says "we<strong> sea</strong> 50
 points ahead".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I saw that, I chose not to download the pictures in that it looks like it might be fraud/trap/phishing.&nbsp; This is exactly the sort of red flag that makes me immediately delete the message.</p>

            That likely is a scam emailing pretending to be Microsoft's reward program. I got an email from FedEx yesterday telling me I won a MacBook Pro and iPhone 8 including 6.4 million dollars and I just need to contact them to collect my prize.

            Hi,
<br />Seems this is a scam. Microsoft does not have any program to reward its users.

<p>If this is a scam then it is of top-notch quality fake.&nbsp; The message has all the MS logos, fonts, patterns, and layouts.&nbsp; None of the roll-overs look suspicious.&nbsp; Even the header looks valid.&nbsp; However, none of this has tempted me to follow up on any of the
 e-mail messages anyway.&nbsp; I have seen these messages before and the main reason I was alerted to avoid them was that I would not figure out why MS would have a rewards program for users or buyers of their products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The roll-overs did look suspicious though. (http:// e.microsoft.com/key2316002.d.kf5m.-.nhbngrc) which was the main reason I doubted this all along.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never the less, this last one showed something I have never seen in any MS correspondence or software: Creativity. I now know where the "sea" in "We sea 50 points ahead" comes from.&nbsp; The message has a lighthouse theme, hence the reference to the oceans.
 To tell the truth, had the designers of this subject line put "sea" in quotes or drawn special reference to the juxtaposition, I may have responded to it with clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searches on "MS Rewards" net many references to it as fraud and not one suggesting that there is something legitimate afoot.</p>
<p>

            Microsoft does have a reward programme: <a href="https://rewards.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.microsoft.com/</a>. 
<br />I’ve seen strange spelling within the email but usually this ‘error’ pertains to the question subject so the spelling of sea may refer to questions about the sea.
<br />If you hover your mouse over the link does it point to a genuine site or a strange url?

<h2>            Bought Cars 3 &#43; BONUS UHD movie on Xbox One X&#47;can&#8217;t play due to 0x80190194 error</h2>
                    <p>Like the subject says, I just purchased Cars 3 + BONUS in UHD to watch on my Xbox One X and I am unable to play it. I have a 200mb/s internet connection.. and a UHD/HDR capable TV. Other movies in UHD/HDR work just fine in my library so it has something
 to do with this specific movie with the xbox platform. Im able to use my Iphone X to login to the Movies Anywhere app and watch the Cars 3 movie i just purchased perfectly fine on my phone, but thats not what I bought it for.... whats going on????</p>

<p>Hi ZippyMike!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up to our attention. I'm sorry to hear this is currently happening at the moment. It helps a lot to know that so far you can watch the movie with no issues on other devices except the Xbox One X. Now, first thing I want to clarify
 have you done any troubleshooting steps yourself on your Xbox One X?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile you get back to us, we suggest for yo<span>u to <span><span>clear the alternate MAC address(Network cache) on the Xbox One console.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>F<span><span>ollow these steps:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Go to </span></span><span><span>Settings</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select </span></span><span><span>Network &gt; </span></span><span><span>Network Settings</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select the </span></span><span><span>Advanced Settings</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Next choose the </span></span><span><span>Alternate MAC Address&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Select </span></span><span><span>clear and restart</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear backs soon,.</p>

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us! We actually do have one more thing we would like to suggest for you to try out, it's a bit of work (I wish it was easier) but this may be the main resolution to this problem.
<span>Now what w</span><span><span>e suggest (if it hasn't already been done) a reset of the console
</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ince
</span></span><span><span>the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a

 Factory Reset</span></span></span></a><span><span>(while keeping games and apps)
</span></span><span><span>Before resetting your console make sure of the following:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>There is a stable network connection.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>The information for all profiles is known (email and passwords)</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Once the setup is complete it will ask if we want to keep settings or manual setup
 let's do </span></span><span><span>manual setup</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes!</span></span></p>

<p>Just did the soft reset, and manual setup...tried the movie again and now the first thing that pops up is:</p>
<p>—————-</p>
<p>Cant play</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you’re connected to the internet, then try again. If you’re definetly connected, make sure no firewalls or proxy servers are blocking access to online services.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i am definetly connected to the internet, no firewalls or proxies on my router, tried other movies from my library(streamed from the internet) and the trailer itself from my bought Cars 3 movie and everything worked just fine. Tried playing the movie again
 after that and now im back to the 0x80190194 error again that is no longer available from the catalog, i cant stress enough that this is the only movie i have ever had this problem with, could it be something with the microsoft servers? Everything on my side
 is working just fine</p>

            I ended up chatting with microsoft support for two hours about the issue and they couldnt figure it out... im assuming microsoft may have an issue with that movie in the store cause its only that one that gives me a problem... ive watched 2 other UHD movies
 after dealing with Cars 3... might wanna look into it... i ended up just getting refunded for it

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your
<br />
System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try these from the Command Prompt of a Vista Boot Disk - type in each at the prompt and hit<br />
ENTER after each.<br />
<br />
bootrec /fixmbr<br />
<br />
bootrec /fixboot<br />
<br />
bootrec /scanos<br />
<br />
bootrec /rebuildbcd<br />
<br />
If that works then run StartUp Repair THREE times from the Vista Boot Disk, run once and<br />
then reboot and run again and repeat.<br />
<br />

repair startup issues in Windows Vista<br />

<h2>            My windows 8 laptop is stuck on &#34;repairing disk errors&#34;</h2>
                    <div>HP 2000 Notebook PC</div>
<div><br />
</div>
My laptop's mouse froze, so I restarted the computer. When I turned it on it said my PC ran into an error and needs to restart. "Preparing Automatic Recovery" - "Diagnosing your PC" ... "repairing disk error. This might take over an hour to complete." That
 is the loop I get everytime I turn my laptop on and off. It's been day 2 and my laptop is still in this loop. I tried "f11" for System Recovery but everytime I reresh, restart, or restore, it tells me that my PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. And
 then the same repair loop occurs.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't have a Windows Installation DVD or anything to boot Windows 8 from. And I don't remember making a recovery disk or a recovery image. I really don't know what else to do.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi, Jason,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;First format the hard-drive, install the previous windows version (XP, Vista or 7) and then download the upgrade to windows 8 - again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you check your email you find a receipt sent by the store for your purchase, click the link for download, burn to a disc and you are done.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>You could go to C:/, ESD, Windows, Resources,&nbsp; there's a file named <strong>Install.esd</strong>, burn that for installing. You need to tick "unhide hidden files" in View tab to find these hidden files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See Steps Listed here:</p>

            I turned off automatic repair so I'm no longer stuck in the repair loop. But now when I turn it on, it says your pc couldn't start properly and gives me an error code.
<div><br />
<div>I don't know how to format the hard drive and I didn't buy the laptop, it was a gift from my mom (who probably no longer has the email if received)</div>

<p>Have you tried PC Reset?&nbsp; This will reinstall Windows 8 (equivalent to a clean install)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the following for instructions about how to create a system image of your Windows 8 installation:</p>

<br />
3&nbsp;suggestions :<br />
<br />
1. Right click on an open space of desktop &gt; View &gt; select classic icons.<br />
<br />
2. re-set DPI :<br />
Right click on an open space of the desktop &gt; personalize &gt; left column, Adjust font size (DPI) &gt; uac prompt &gt; click Default scale (96 DPI) &gt; OK<br />
<br />
3. re-set resolution :<br />
Right click on an open space of desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Display Settings &gt; under Resolution, move the slider to the LEFT towards low. My laptop suggest 1280x800 pixels. Check you manual for your settings.<br />

<p>Hi Ann-Marie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may happen if the program you've installed creates a registry key name that has more than 60 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the program showing when you look for it using Windows Search box?</li><li>Is it also not showing in your Download folder?</li></ul>

<p>You say, it's downloaded, but not in your programs... Perhaps, it's only a setup-file, you have downloaded? After the download, did you run the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only some programs are ready to use after just downloading them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when installing some programs, it's unfortunately necessary to deactivate the antivirusprogram, so it doesn't end it's life in the Quarantine...</p>

            The question wasn't 'what are the features of the broadband usage meter in windows 10?' it was: how does one&nbsp;reset it? If this isn't possible then for those of us who are on a metered connection this feature of the new windows is useless; shame on Microsoft.

    <title>Three Days of Connection Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raamageddon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Three Days of Connection Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Alright Xbox Community / Support Teams. Have I got a whopper for you.</p>

<p>For the past three days I've been experiencing connectivity problems with Xbox Live, in ways that don't even seem to make sense. About a week ago, I started seeing the "Some features not available" screen, and my dashboard would be screwy, but I was able
 to connect to Live just fine all the same. But about three days ago, the thing just cut out almost altogether.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The issue started after a screen informing me of some kind of security update popped up. It asked for my e-mail and password, but as it was confirming and brought up the "Remember me / Log In" screen, something seemed to go wrong, and it the "loading circle"
 just kept going until it seemed to time out or something, and gave me an error saying I couldn't connect to Xbox Live, while at the same time the "Achievement Bar" told me that I was
<em>disconnecting</em> from Xbox Live. So I obviously had the connection to Xbox Live present, just not... Functional, I guess.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The past three days have been filled with talking to representatives from Microsoft, Time Warner Cable, and a little bit of Linksys. I've tried every solution, and I mean
<em>every</em> solution that Support has thrown at me, including security updates, deleting my profile (That was FUN.), clearing my cache, restoring factory settings, checking my cables like an idjit, attempting direct connections with the modem, REPLACING
 my router (For whatever reason), and a great big slew of other things. TWC has tried resetting my modem to see if that did it, and it didn't. But my computer works just fine, and it's running off the same connection, so I'm seriously doubting it's got anything
 to do with my actual network or Internet.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>That said, I HAVE succeeded on a few occasions to actually log in. I did manage to re-download my profile through some manner of sorcery and enough luck to make a pot o' gold look like a black cat crossing underneath a ladder next to a shattered mirror.
 When I do log in, it's always the same "features unavailable" shtick, and usually after an hour my connection just dies again and I'm back to square one. From there, I can't even attempt proceeding forward unless it decides-- Rather spontaneously-- that I'm
 allowed to give it a shot again.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I get plenty of error codes. 80072741, 800721909, 1908. All depends on my Xbox's current level of fickleness. 2741 is usually what pops up when I'm actually logged in, while the other two are if I can't connect at all. Testing my connection always pops the
 X up between Network and Internet, which makes no sense when you consider that it's still true even between successful attempts at logging in. As stated, all of my network is set up fine, and I'm now using a router I bought just today (It's past midnight,
 I guess it's yesterday now) with the same effect, which doesn't matter since bypassing the router did nothing. Swapping cables did nothing. I checked my router settings and there's nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So either something's wrong with the Internet, or the Xbox itself. My bet's on the latter, and one Xbox rep suggested I send in the Xbox for repairs, but I obviously only want to do that as an absolute last resort. I would take it to a friend's house to
 check if it works there, but I've moved far, far away from anyone I actually know, and the people around me aren't particularly sociable, so knocking on their door and demanding to use their Internet to check my problem is far from realistic.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So. What Champion can step forward and give me some clever suggestions here? I've used all the troubleshooting steps on the site, and I've done everything that Support could suggest. Does anyone have another suggestion apart from spending money I don't have
 to get this issue settled?</p>

<p>Hi there RAAMageddon! Sounds like you have a real time of it here. In my experience the 80072741 error normally leads me back to corrupt data on a storage device somewhere, That being said, I have a few questions for you.</p>
<p>1) Do you have an Xbox with a hard drive, a memory unit, or both?</p>
<p>2) Are you using a USB drive plugged into your Xbox to store any data?</p>
<p>3) Do you believe that the Beatles are the undisputed kings of rock and roll?</p>
<p>OK, that last one was just for me.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting-wise, go to your Xbox storage devices (Settings -&gt; Storage) and press A on your hard drive (or MU). Then press A on "Games and apps". Look through the list of games and apps and see if there are any entries without a picture, or that say
 "Corrupt" or "Unknown". If not, then press A on each of the folders and looks for the same type of corrupted files in each. Wherever you see a corrupt/unknown/incomplete file, DELETE that sucker!</p>
<p>I would love to hear the results, so I'll come back and check on this thread later. Have a great night!</p>

<p>I do have an Xbox with both a hard drive and a USB. Over the course of my efforts, I've removed the USB, since I was told it could be creating some kind of issues. That said, I do keep it plugged in normally.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went ahead and checked them both. There were a few corrupted Avatar Items, all of them apparently having been downloaded on the same date. What they were, I have no idea, but they're gone now. And I had a few "Unknown" games as well. All of them were original
 Xbox games, but I know they used to have symbols and whatnot attached to them, and now they didn't, so I've deleted them as well.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the problem has ultimately persisted. If that solved the 80072741, I won't know it until I can successfully log in, since that only ever popped up after I'd logged in.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>That aside, I'm still seeing the error 80151909 while trying to log in. Upon looking it up, I see that it means that downloading my profile failed, but I'm not getting that particular message. It's just telling me my console can't connect to Xbox Live, with
 the error code attached to it. On the first day, I did attempt deleting and re-downloading my profile, but that was... Nearly catastrophic, since it hadn't been letting me connect in order to do the download again. It was only during a very brief relenting
 that my Xbox actually allowed me to download it, but I've since been in the same boat as when I started.</p>

<p>Hey RAAM,<br />
<br />
Really sorry to hear you're having issues with your connection.<br />
<br />
Just making sure I understand correctly:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>You were getting different error messages but your connection test always failed between your console and network
</li><li>You were primarily getting 80072741 </li><li>You've cleared the corrupt data from your hard drive and USB drive </li><li>Now you are getting 80151909 when you try to log in </li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>Is that all correct?</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
If not, please let me know what I've misunderstood.<br />
<br />
<br />
If so, there are a few things that will help us better understand your setup and try to narrow down where the issue may be:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you tested your connection and it failed, do you remember the exact error message you got?
</li><li>When you test your connection now, does it still fail? </li><li>Can you run a pingtest.net test and let us know the results. </li></ul>
<p><br />
Also, please post back with the following information:<br />
<br />
<strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in?</strong><span><b>&nbsp;</b></span><b><br />
<strong>Modem brand &amp; model number:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong>Router brand &amp; model number:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?</strong><br />
<strong>Things you have tried:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown</strong><br />
<strong>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?</strong><br />

<p>I tried responding and it didn't work, so I apologize if this winds up becoming a double-post.</p>
<p>Not entirely correct. I was receiving 80072741 during successful log-in attempts, accompanied by the "Some features currently unavailable" message. 80151908 and 1909 have appeared during completely failed log-in attempts. They appeared before clearing out
 my storage, and still appear after. 2741 seems to be strictly for semi-successful log-ins, but I have not had a successful log-in since clearing the corrupted items, so I cannot confirm if it is persisting. I can only say that I know 1908 and 1909 are persisting.</p>
<p>It's an Internet Error, between Network and Internet, as stated above. It always fails between those two points, even if I test the connection after having briefly managed to connect, log out and test, and then successfully log in again. Pingtest yields
 the following: <a href="http://www.pingtest.net/result/88476006.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.pingtest.net/.../88476006.png</a></p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in?</p>
<p>United States, State of Ohio.</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number:</p>
<p>Modem brand seems to be "Scientific Atlanta," which is apparently part of Cisco. Unknown model number, only serial and MAC present on the modem. Modem was supplied by ISP.</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number:</p>
<p>Have used a Linksys WRT120N and Netgear WNR1000v3. Linksys router was used during initial problem appearance, but I replaced it at the suggestion of an Xbox rep because I bought it used and could not access the settings on it, and some kind of firmware problem
 present on the router prevented me from resetting it. Issue was not solved by replacing the router, that is for certain.</p>
<p>Things you have tried:</p>
<p>Everything. I tried all the solutions listed on the Support page under the "Can't Connect to Internet" category. I have checked for damage to the network cables, and found none. Replaced cabling to see if internal damage was present, made no difference.
 As stated, attempted replacing whole router, did not work. Checked for MAC filtering. Attempted deleting and downloading profile at representative's suggestion, definitely did not work. Tried validating security references, did not work. Attempted two-step
 verification, did not work. Have tried clearing the cache, resetting to factory defaults, removing and reseating the hard drive, attempted connecting without hard drive, cleared corrupt data, and many, many other things. Since you are a Support representative,
 I suspect that Reference Numbers may be of some small use to you. If you can access the records based around these Reference Numbers, they'll likely contain more complete lists that I lack the memory to provide.</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown</p>
<p>Unknown.</p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter:</p>
<p>80072741, 80151909, 80151908, fairly certain I've encountered 1901 or 1902 a couple times.</p>
<p>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)?</p>
<p>Time Warner Cable/Roadrunner.</p>

<p>Thank you for providing so much info, RAAM! It's extremely useful. I've removed your Service Request numbers for the sake of security; those aren't something you want to share with folks outside of official support.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>There's one more thing to try that I haven't seen mentioned yet (forgive me if I missed it somewhere) and it might take some time: Can you take your console to a friend's or relative's home and connect to their network? If you're
 still unable to connect to a different network with different network hardware, we can say for sure that the issue lies somewhere in the console itself. If you are able to connect, then we have some further exploration to do with your home network.</span></p>

<p>I apologize for the service numbers. I suppose I forgot this is a public forum, after all.</p>
<p>It's not impossible to bring it to someone else's house, but it's very unfeasible. It's something that I've been keeping in mind as a possibility and that I'd like to try, but I just recently moved (Two months ago, everything's worked fine up 'til this past
 week) so the nearest person I'm even vaguely acquainted with whose Internet connection will support Xbox Live is somewhere in the range of an hour and a half to two hours' drive away, and I am... Transportationally-challenged for the time being. There's also
 the matter of their schedule being extremely difficult to work with. </p>
<p>It's not impossible. I wouldn't call it impractical, but it would be extremely difficult to manage.

            <p>Hey there RAAMageddon! Thanks for getting back to us!<br /><br />I can certainly understand that in your situation, going to a friend's house would be a little troublesome.<br /><br />I assume the answer will probably be no, but do you happen to have access to another Xbox 360 console that you could try to connect to your home network? Like I said, probably not, but there's no harm in asking.<br /><br />Since it looks like everything in your setup went from working to not working over a week or so and the only thing that's changed is time, I'm sorry to say that it's really sounding like your console is in need of a repair to me. For information on how to get that started, I suggest taking a look at our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to get your Xbox product repaired</a> support article.<br /><br />Let us know if you have any questions and if you're able to try a different console (which is a long shot, I know).</p>

<p>While normally that would've been very unorthodox, that was actually exactly the suggestion I needed.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I DO have another 360. It's old and outdated, for sure, but I never had any connection problems with it when I was using it. It's one of the original 360s, rather than a Slim, which is what I've got now. &nbsp;The reason I'd replaced it was
 because it started experiencing mechanical malfunctions-- The discs not reading, tray not opening, that fun slew of problems-- but it always let me jump online, and it's been in the box ever since.
</p>
<p>I just tried connecting it with two different cables both to the router and directly to the modem to be sure. Just like my Slim, which is what I was using originally, it *can* connect to Xbox Live, but it *doesn't.* I wasn't able to fully explore the issue
 because it wanted me to update when I tried connecting, and the update failed. Just like my Slim, it failed between Network and Internet, and once between Internet and Xbox Live. And that was while it was hooked up to my modem, ignoring my router completely.</p>
<p>So it's /not/ the Xbox itself, as best as I'm able to figure. </p>
<p>Something about my actual Internet connection seems to be wrong. It couldn't be anything to do with MAC filtering, or closed ports, or anything like that if I've only got it hooked up to the modem, right? That's all stuff pertaining to the router, which
 if I remove from the equation, means it would have to be a failure on the ISP's part, doesn't it?

    <title>Wake from sleep into bios settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_k_49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wake from sleep into bios settings</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem that just started in the last week or so.&nbsp; Actually, I have two problems, so I will state both of them here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First problem:&nbsp; When I manually put my desktop computer to sleep, I will often come back to my computer after having not touched anything to see my screen on the bios setup screen instead of a black screen.&nbsp; I have to press F1, discard any changes, and then
 wake my computer.&nbsp; This never used to happen, now it happens all of the time.&nbsp; I do not know what has changed, other than I think windows did an update around the time that this started happening, though I am not positive.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of my sleep settings are still
 the same as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue number two:&nbsp; I have the sleep settings set to put my computer to sleep after 10 minutes and require me to sign-in upon waking.&nbsp; If I manually put my computer to sleep by pressing the power button, this works as it should, and I need to put in my pin
 after waking my computer.&nbsp; However, if the computer goes to sleep automatically after 10 minutes, any hit on the keyboard, move of the mouse, or hitting the power button wakes the computer without asking for my pin, and anyone can just wake the computer and
 resume where I left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you if you can provide any insight into either of these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to a corrupted security settings. We suggest that you try removing your PIN, and then restart your computer. After doing this, try to set up a new PIN. If it still the same, try creating a new user account by following the steps
 in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>

<p>OK, I removed my pin, rebooted my computer, added my pin back in, rebooted my computer again.&nbsp; So far, the first time I manually put my computer to sleep, it did not wake until I instructed it to, and when it did wake, it asked for my pin.&nbsp; It did not go
 to the BIOS setup screen.&nbsp; It was only asleep for about 30 minutes, so I will still have to test it during a longer sleep, but so far, so good.&nbsp; I still have not tested the sleep mode after 10 minutes of inactivity to see if it will now require a pin to let
 me back in.</p>

<p>Well, half of my concern has been addressed and solved.&nbsp; I have not seen the bios screen since removing my pin, rebooting, and setting my pin again.&nbsp; I have gone two nights now.&nbsp; The first night, I woke to see the screen on the background wallpaper screen
 waiting for someone to log on.&nbsp; The second night, I woke to a black screen, which is what I expect and want, and upon touching the mouse or keyboard, it lit up and I was able to input my pin and log on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only remaining problem is that the computer goes to sleep after 10 minutes, as I have instructed it to.&nbsp; The only problem is, anyone can wake it and be in my account, despite the settings I have set to require a pin upon waking from sleep.&nbsp; If I manually
 put it to sleep, it does this just fine, but if it automatically goes to sleep after the period of inactivity that I set, no pin is required.</p>
