    <title>Disscussion on windows 10 Versions the Old vs. the New - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanitaslover  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disscussion on windows 10 Versions the Old vs. the New</h2>
                    <p>My first discussion, so expect mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright I'm going to compare one version to the other version. Here's the two versions I'll be discussing about to one end there's the old version of windows 10 that's been around 'til the compition came which is the version to the other end. The windows
 10 update everyone has been sent in their&nbsp; updates suddenly since Monday feb, fith. At least that's when I got it sent to me.&nbsp; The new version isn't the windows 10 hello that I'm talking aboutt.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning strong criticism below </p>
<p>
</p><p>The old version Has a different style&nbsp; in the start&nbsp; menu where it&nbsp; there's a lot of squres to the right like on a phone list of apps this is one of the things that made this version look more futuristic. In the control panel there was&nbsp; something new added
 then the other's before it. In the display stuff in that section there was a option of just making the text bigger instead of the usal of making everything in the computer bigger. This is my most fav option in the appearance options. Next thing that was new
 to me was I could do all kinds of things to make the mouse easier see that I didn't have the ability to. I can change the mouse pointer size, I can make the typing curor more thicker to see, I can even put something that is basically a highlighter circle to
 find the mouse better. In other appearance settings I could set up new themes using colors only in High contrast section. I had advance appearance toptions in the settings display stuff. This makes the version more futuristic. Oh, and I don't have to click
 the apply button to make my changes final much at all now. The narrator/screen reader is&nbsp; so much better say goodbye to using the keyboard 'cause the narrator will follow the mouse the whole time. It does give options to still use a keyboard though for those
 that need it. This version had the first new version of the narrator for my experience.&nbsp; I'm not blind, but I have low visial, so I use it. I can still see the screen the text is too small for me.&nbsp; The narrator in this version is confortable speed that is
 like a person talking if the pitch is set right. Speed 45 pitch 80 for zera moble is what I use. I may had to use the Kortana a lot to find everything in the settings, but at least I had a good experience with this version of windows 10. I use the narrator
 to 'walk' around on the comp more then anything besides reading text, helping me with typing&nbsp;stuf also. For mic, and volume options it was pretty advanced&nbsp; as&nbsp; well. I don't want&nbsp; to give this version up from how much I like it for visial problem helper reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright now let's turn to the new version that's being called the latest build for windows 10. Again not Windows 10 hello it's the one that was sent in updates to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I expected for this version was a style that was like the previous one I was wrong 'cause I was unhappy at the changes. In truth I describe this&nbsp; new version as before windows seven. It looked like the oldes were trying to come back, and well the oldies
 had missed their window here 'cause the future is too advance for it. People are expecting more from it 'cause of what the prevous version had compared to this version. Let's look at the narrator first compared to the old to the new windows 10. I put the speed
 at 45 the slowest I can get before it's too slow, and the pitch is at 80 moble zera.&nbsp; The narrator is too fast, and I don't hear any sounds when the narrator is moving with the mouse, or hear a sound when the mouse hits a reading target. Woha I'm sliding around
 using the narrator like this and I have to use my eyes&nbsp; more then the last version. 'Running program internet, running program narrator, Home favorites tools report."&nbsp; It has no pauses when the narrator speaks like that and it says everything I don't need
 to hear. compared to the old version this narrator is too fast, and it&nbsp; makes my head hurt, and I feel like it drives me crazy. Putting the speed at 40 doesn't help 'cause it sounds like the&nbsp; cartoons&nbsp; when they show a teacher talking slow. The old version
 narrator didn't say stuff before saying what&nbsp; the target is. Or says one target at a time it keeps trying to say multiple targets at once.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright let's see the appearance settings. Control panel go to appearance folder look the option of making just the text bigger is disabled. I can only make everything else bigger this is what made this new version feel like a oldie version of windows most.
 Let's&nbsp; see the other appearance settings in the settings section now. No advance options at the bottom where the brightness can be changed. There's a night light to make the screen less bright to help people sleep, but that seems&nbsp; kind of unneeded since the
 brightness could just be fixed, or if using a laptop just closing the screen a little to where it's almost closed up, but still open to where the comp doesn't go to&nbsp; sleep, and people can still hear alerts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the extra options&nbsp; that were present in the old version are missing in this new version.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu does it look&nbsp; all futuristic with apps? opens the start menu and it looks like a windows version before the old version of windows 10 we keep referring to. This is where I feel like the oldies came back. The description doesn't need to be
 explaned everyone knows how the start menu looked before the prevous windows&nbsp; before this new version.&nbsp; How do I get to more advance options, why do I feel so limited compared to the last version? My answers are at the bottom of each page in the settings where
 it says 'have a question? Link to Microsoft support' Oh&nbsp;that's helpful.. not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this new version made for kids under 12 to&nbsp; have fun with&nbsp; 'cause that's how I felt with this version. Just given a amount of settings that didn't mess&nbsp; with the comp really at all.&nbsp; I think it says a lot if a person in their 20s feels like that. I'm&nbsp;
 almost going to be 25 for my age.&nbsp; Yes things were easier to find since they were listed on the side in the settings like troubleshoot, but still I felt like I was given a kid computer that a parent put settings limits on. I had asked how to get into the advance
 settings, and I have to do a lot of complicated things to do that which is like a web designer expert know how to not get confused. C'mon doing all that tech stuff is for oldie windows not the here and&nbsp; now. I didn't had to to do much of advance tech support
 stuff to set bigger text with the old version. it was right there where I can find it and a single click and there the text was bigger for the selected thing in the old version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was all I had gathered from a little of minutes with the new version I had tried it twice. Right now the&nbsp; old version I have currently is what I like 'cause the new stuff isn't better then it it's worst then the version I love right now. This year's
 newest windows 10 is not ready to be put out the door yet. So hold on&nbsp; creators don't stop sending updates for the prevous windows 10 just yet a lot people are going to use it still waiting for the next newest version of windows 10. The newest version wasn't
 ready for the world that expected it to be more advanced then the last version which it has failed in comparison.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For short worded discriptions of the two versions in this&nbsp;post i'm calling the old version, A highly advanced phone put on a computer, and the new version will be&nbsp; called, Failed comeback of the oldies trying to beat the future that's the here and now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it I'm sorry if my criticism has upset people, but just like&nbsp; writers&nbsp; the creators do need all the feedback they can get since they had been a bit too speedy with the newest stuff this time not being successful topping&nbsp; their creations with new ones.
 It looked like a video creator had made a new&nbsp; video without looking over the last one that had ended up being&nbsp; more futuristic then the new video they had just made.</p>

</p><p>How do i contact someone to find that out. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way to contact the correct persons would have been through the Enforcement Website via a Case Review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since Case Reviews take at least two business days, during which your son would stay suspended, you can't issue a Case Review for suspensions that are "only" 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To not be able to communicate with his friends for 24 hours should be considered as a "warning" for your son, and be punishment enough.
</p>
<p>During those communication-less 24 hours he can then think hard about what he said exactly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to have a talk with him, explain to him how the Enforcement system works:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever he sends a message that others might find offensive, AND that message is violating the
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/legal/community-standards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Code of Conduct (which you can read here)</a>, the person can report that message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message itself is then attached as evidence to that report, and a real life human being will review the report and the attached evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on that evidence, the person will then decide if the message violates the Code of Conduct or not. If it does, your son will get a suspension. If the message was reported in error, nothing will happen (well, not to your son. The person incorrectly reporting
 your son will get a lower "trust" rating for future reports).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So since a real human reviews these reports, and has access to the message sent, your son can't complain that he was reported for doing "nothing".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also explain to your son, that if he repeatedly violates the Code of Conduct, the suspensions will get longer. From 24 hours, to several days, to weeks, months, and ultimately, if your son continues to violate the Code of Conduct, he can be permanently locked

<h2>            How to block words</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am interested in using Windows Family Safety - but what I need is an application that blocks not only domains but also websites containing certain word like fx. "flash games", "flashgames", "freegames" etc. - because it is impossible to block every single
 adress when my children are surfing the internet.</p>
<p>Hope somebody know.</p>

            You would be better off using the free <a href="http://www.opendns.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OpenDNS</a> service instead. This type of fine-grained category/domain blocking is usually sufficient for home users. If you are running a school or corporate office, then please let
 us know your actual situation. You can also add edge security such as an Untangle Box with paid filtering subscriptions.

                    <p>As you can see from my attached screenshots, Mr Bill Gates has deliberately designed his software to steal money from his customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) You dial a number into your post Skype 3.8 software and hit &lt;enter&gt;:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca708b7d-9035-419a-a987-65407630f5e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca708b7d-9035-419a-a987-65407630f5e9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Bill Gates secretly and in an unauthorised manner and criminally adds a prefix for&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>"Australian External Territories" , and starts dialing and connecting</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b2cc6a5-9785-415a-9255-9f2b0e5c11bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b2cc6a5-9785-415a-9255-9f2b0e5c11bc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3)&nbsp;</span><span>You're billed £1.94 for three seconds, which is on hidden on a webpage that is impossible to find except if you manage to find your way through
 a maze that poses as Skype Support:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54426b3a-b9ee-4e9a-988c-1fae74c08a3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54426b3a-b9ee-4e9a-988c-1fae74c08a3f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please stop stealing my money and to give me back that you have stolen from me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, what does "RATE" mean? According to the image above, is the rate&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(110, 110, 115, 1)">£</span><span style="color: rgba(110, 110, 115, 1)">1.879
 for three seconds and my call has lasted 3.097 seconds rounded down to three seconds, but still being billed for the extra 0.097th of a second, ie 6.1p? I don't understand. Please clarify.</span></p>

<p>Not from what I can tell.&nbsp; You are dialing a phone number without inputting a country code.&nbsp; If you look at your own screen shot you will see a drop-down for
<strong>Choose Country or Region</strong>.&nbsp; If you skip that, you are relying on the software to use its algorithms to append a country code based off what you entered.&nbsp; It is possibly using the first country in which the number is valid in alpha order, resulting
 in the Antarctica/Australian External Territories being selected.&nbsp; It does not take your current location into consideration as you could be dialing anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><br />
I have had Skype for over a decade as my main phone line.&nbsp; I have never relied on the software to guess the destination for the number I was dialing.&nbsp; There are only two main ways in which I have dialed a number using the software with consistent results:</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp; Typing in the full international dialing format.&nbsp; If I was dialing a UK number I would type in +44 207xxxxxxx.</p>
<p><br />
-- or --</p>
<p><br />
2.&nbsp; Selecting the country (United Kingdom) from the drop-down, then typing in 207xxxxxxx.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you retain the leading zero in this case, it will be dropped as it is unnecessary.&nbsp; So either with or without the leading zero, both formats are acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely rare that any company will round down for services.&nbsp; For example, I have never ran across a gas/petrol station that rounded down on my purchase.&nbsp; As stated in the Terms and Conditions all calls are rounded to the next full minute and all
 charges are rounded to the next full cent/penny.&nbsp; All Pay as You go calls are subject to a connection fee (once per call).&nbsp; That gets included into that rate, which includes any taxes (VAT/GST).&nbsp; The 1.88/min rate&nbsp; is a VAT-included rate (for your residence).&nbsp;
 The connection fee for that call is 5.6p.&nbsp; Connection fees are nothing&nbsp;new. By adding the two unrounded values (1.879 + 5.6p), the total comes out to 1.935.&nbsp; The next whole&nbsp;penny would be 4, so the total charge is 1.94(0) to cover the cost of dialing an Antarctica
 number&nbsp;covering the duration of 1 second to 1 minute.</p>

<h2>            Reverting to Windows 7 after upgrading to windows 10 - Sony Vaio E Series</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Home Basic 64 bit preloaded in my Sony Vaio E series laptop. In windows update I was recommended to upgrade to windows 10 so I went ahead and did it. The upgrade was smooth and i didn't lose any data. My BSNL EVDO (Prithivi UE100) device
 wasn't detected in the windows 10 (it was working fine in win 7) I uninstalled it and tried installing it back again with the compatibility settings and it didn't work. So after multiple fails i had to revert back to windows 7. Then the revert failed and I
 wasn't able to login to the machine. I tried logging to safe mode to get the backup and that didn't work either since my keyboard wasn't detected for me to type the password. (I had to install another version of Windows 7 in another drive to get the data backup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S I upgraded to windows 10 earlier like 3 months before and my audio wasn't working so reverted it back to windows 7 without much trouble (but i faced other problems like laptop heating up frequently and shutting down or CPU usage shooting to 100 everytime
 I open Firefox browser). Did any one face these issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I would like to know if its advisable to upgrade to windows 10 for Sony Vaio E series?</p>
<p>2) If i upgrade to windows 10 again how do i get the BSNL EVDO working. ( I did try installing using compatibility settings and as well tried the answers from the windows community but no luck). I did see few replies saying you had drivers installed for
 them to get working can you please share links to the drivers needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if you need any more details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>~ Priya</p>

            <p><span>Hello Priya,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will get to know if this series is compatible with windows 10 when you get the Get Windows 10 app. The Get Windows&nbsp;10 app shows up as a Windows
 icon in the notification area at the right end of your taskbar (the taskbar is the ribbon of icons on the bottom of your desktop). If you don't see the app,</span><span>
</span><span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616446" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">get help here</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">.</span></span><span>
 I also suggest you to go to the manufacturer website n check for the compatibility of the series. Since Windows 10 is a new OS, we should update all the drivers after the upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how it goes.

<h2>            How do i vote on Windows 10 lock screen wallpapers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Home Anniversary Edition. It is the latest update I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when it goes to the lock-screen, or I restart my laptop, it displays the alternating wallpaper, and allows me to vote if I like it or not. However, sometimes when it displays the wallpaper, it seems like it does not allow me to vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that in order to vote, i must hover over the upper right-hand corner. But the last image on the lock screen did not allow me to vote that i did not like it. The same on the login screen. Is there an option to fix this? I like to allow it to alternate
 the wallpaper to scenery that I like, but if I don't like it, I would like to say that I don't like it, so it won't show it anymore.</p>

</p><p>Are you referring to Windows Spotlight? Images are downloaded on an ongoing basis, depending on the feedback that you provided for the background image. The feedback feature in Windows Spotlight lets you curate the types of images that will be displayed
 on your lock screen. For example, if you have liked a lock screen that contains images of cats or kittens, then more images of cats or kittens would be shown as your lock screen.</p>

<p>it may be, but lately there is this one with the wing of a plane, and i am not able to dislike it. The previous images i was able to like or dislike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the login screen also had an image i could not vote against it as well. why is that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>however, it does not explain why I also no longer have voting options (for example, "do you like this image?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been stuck on the plane wing image for days. changing the lock screen to blue still keeps that image there
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, I think that at startup and lock screen there may have been voting options, but I am not sure. But now it won't change anymore.</p>

            <p>Ascent95, you will find no help with this from Microsoft support. I was on the phone with Microsoft "tier 2" support (after wasting my time with "tier 1" support who insisted on repeating all of the commands I said I already tried.) &nbsp;and they basically told
 me the same thing: "Media Center isn't part of Windows 10" (I don't want media center, I want the&nbsp;<em>media pack</em> that you released because certain softwares depend on it). When I explain this to them, they recommend I install VLC or something, which I
 still do not want, because this will not resolve the software dependencies Finally, the tech claimed that, because I was in the US with an N version of Windows, I would be unable to install the pack. This is blatantly untrue and was not causing the issue.</p>
<p>I was able to fix it by reinstalling Windows, as expected. I'd recommend trying the same, as it's probably the only way around this issue. A reset might fix it as well.<br />
Good luck.</p>

    <title>Windows 10, file and folder rename fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnstrachan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, file and folder rename fails</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded from 64bit Win 8.1pro to Win 10. Now I have&nbsp; problems with file renaming and folder renaming.</p>
<p>When a file is to be renamed, the file in the details format, is clicked on.</p>
<p>The file name (excluding the . and extension) is highlighted ready for editing.</p>
<p>If no further action is taken, the file name reverts back to the state prior to clicking on it.
</p>
<p>This is like a screen refresh and typically occurs within 2 to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>If a further action of editing the file name continues where for example the backspace is entered, the file highlighted file name is deleted, and the entry of the new file name is then in progress. At some point in 2 to 10 seconds the file name is restored
 to the state prior to clicking on the file name, as if a screen refresh occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>refreshing the screen prior to renaming does not solve the renaming problem.</p>
<p>Right clicking on the file name and selecting rename does not solve the renaming problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same occurs with folder renaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another associated fault is that if you are viewing a list of files that is larger that the frame can display, and you move the focus to a file below on what I will call the lower screen, then the fault will occur as if the frame was refreshed, and the upper
 screen will then be displayed. This makes it more difficult to edit the file name if it is listed on the lower screen. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Microsoft Support. (12 Aug 2015)</p>
<p>They have connected remotely and performed a scan and restore.</p>
<p>The problem appeared to be gone ... But it came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Support again. (12 Aug 2015)</p>
<p>They changed the security settings of a file that has the renaming problem as follows:</p>
<p>Right click file - properties - security(Authenticated Users) - edit - set "Full Control"</p>
<p>The problem appeared to be gone ... But it came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further testing of the time out period for renaming found that it varied from about 0.5 of a second up to 48 seconds but was mostly in the range 2 to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More info:</p>
<p>If you bring up an analogue clock on the screen e.g. http://analog.onlineclock.net/</p>
<p>I have determined that the rename timeout always occurs at a 10 second interval.</p>
<p>Simply click on a file to be renamed. The file name will then be highlighted and ready for editing, but do not start the editing.</p>
<p>When the highlighted file reverts to normal, look at the clock and note the second hand position.</p>
<p>Click on the file to rename ........ and keep repeating ..... </p>
<p>In my case, the timeout always occurred at one of these positions :00, :10, :20, :30, :40 or :50&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So, I believe there is a 10 second supervision timer or such, in WIN10 that is linked to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can use a stopwatch / lap timer. Start the stopwatch when the highlighted file reverts, then click on the file again to highlight it. set the LAP timer when the highlighted file reverts and repeat the process ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded the following times:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 9.93</p>
<p>10.04</p>
<p>&nbsp; 9.97</p>
<p>10.03</p>
<p>10.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; 9.83</p>
<p>10.03</p>
<p>10.01</p>
<p>&nbsp; 9.96 </p>
<p>&nbsp; 9.98</p>
<p>10.01</p>
<p>20.13</p>
<p>&nbsp; 9.88</p>
<p>1:00.11</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the fault can occur after one minute also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Support again. (13 Aug 2015)</p>
<p>This time, a test was performed on two other user accounts on the PC. An in these cases the file rename does not appear to be faulty.</p>
<p>Miscrosoft suggested to create a new main user then transfer all user data to this account.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this procedure, with Microsoft connected remotely, I tried to demonstrate the fault, but it would not occur.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the new user account was created and the rename test (up to 90 secs) was successful.</p>
<p>I then disconnected the remote link, restarted the PC to the new user account, and tested the file rename.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the fault is back :(</p>
<p>It could be that the remote connection is having an effect on the fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The solution to my file rename problem comes from Mitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply turn off the background slide show</p>
<p>The file rename fault occurs when the background picture is changed with the slideshow.</p>

            Me too, sorry I have no solution yet, I have also found that when renaming a file it often disappears only to end up in the recycle bin, thought this was my error but it has happened repeatedly.

</p><p>A variation on the above .... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since changing to W10 I have had a single static pic as background, not a slideshow, but the time out on naming new or renaming existing folders was still driving me nuts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I changed it to a slideshow, let it run for a few cycles (reduced to 1 minute) then changed it back to my selected static pic. &nbsp;<br />
I have not timed how long it remains stable in edit state, but it does seem to have solved the problem. &nbsp;<br />

            <p>Thank you JohnStrachan. I have tried the solution that you have attributed to Mitch and I do not have the problem any more (for now anyway). Hopefully that will be permanent.</p>
<p>I chose an available standard static background picture and stopped the slideshow I had previously, and I was able to rename files and folders and the screen stopped re-setting itself.</p>

 and choose Properties renaming the listed folder name at the top&nbsp;instead.&nbsp; You will have all the time you need to name the file."</strong></span> , your most practical solution,&nbsp;out to the masses.&nbsp;<em>" First of all this is caused by a bug Microsoft still
 hasn't worked out in that the folders you are working in refresh ever time your Desktop Wall paper changes."
</em>IE... I set mine to change ever 10 seconds as did the original poster for this discussion." It is shocking a&nbsp;Microsoft tech had the user create a new user (Default Longer background changes that&nbsp;allow for the most part, time to change file and folder names)
 as a fix. This of course implies there tech obviously hasn't been taught about the issue. I find that embarrassing. The issue has been present since Windows 8. How can a tech not know this folder refresh issue is beyond comprehension. Oh, thanks by the way
 for your one and only practical solution I have found. Brain dead simple but we the masses missed your solution for the most part. Take care all.</p>

            I have this problem from time-to-time with my wireless keyboard. &nbsp;If yours is wireless there are two things I'd recommend trying:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Put in a new battery</li><li>Move the wireless USB receiver farther away from any source of interference, like a cordless phone or a wireless router. &nbsp;Theses things usually are in the same frequency band as the wireless keyboard.</li></ul>

<h2>            How to add or check &#34;Trusted Devices&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I don't know where to ask this so I'm putting it here. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm trying to get a Windows 8 Store app - Package Tracker to work as advertised. It doesn't sync.&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted the developer and was asked if&nbsp;"I have trusted all my devices&nbsp;via the security mail which Microsoft sent&nbsp;me during initial&nbsp;setup."&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can not find a list of "trusted devices" </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The "Trusted Devices FAQ" instructions to add a device as a trusted device are completely wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; None of this exists anywhere that I can locate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-is-trusted-device?woldogcb=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-is-trusted-device?woldogcb=0</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>You can mark a device as trusted just by selecting a check box. When you're prompted to enter a security code to verify your identity, select the
<span>I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code.</span> check box, and we'll no longer ask you for a code.
<span>I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code.</span> check box, and we'll no longer ask you for a code.
</em></p>
<p><em>If you don't currently have any trusted devices associated with your Microsoft account, here's how to mark the first one:</em></p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>On the device you want to trust, </em><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=263779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>sign in</em></a><em> to your Microsoft account.
</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Under <span>Password and security info</span>, tap or click
<span>Edit security info</span>. </em></p>
<span>Edit security info</span>. </em></p>
<p><em>This time, you'll be prompted to enter a security code.</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Check your alternate email or your phone for a code sent by the Microsoft account team, and enter it in the text box.
</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Select the <span>I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code.</span> check box, and then tap or click
<span>Submit</span>. </em></p>
<span>Submit</span>. </em></p>
<p><em>You can now edit your info on this device whenever you want, without entering another security code.
</em></p>
</li></ol>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>If you've already marked at least one device as trusted, the steps are a little different:</em></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>On the device you want to trust, </em><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=263779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>sign in</em></a><em> to your Microsoft account.
</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Choose how you want to receive your security code, and then tap or click
<span>Next</span>. </em></p>
<span>Next</span>. </em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Check your alternate email or your phone for a code sent by the Microsoft account team, and enter it in the text box.
</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Select the <span>I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code.</span> check box, and then tap or click
<span>Submit</span>. </em></p>
<span>Submit</span>. </em></p>
<p><em>You can now edit your info on this device whenever you want, without entering another security code.</em>
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>There is no "Password and security info" section.&nbsp; There is "Password" and there is "Security Info" but not combined</p>
<p>There is no "Edit Security info" under either one of them.</p>
<p>There IS a section called "Trusted Devices" and there are no devices listed but there is a link to "Remove all trusted devices"&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't a clue if I click that if any of my devices will be removed or will there be a confirmation or list
 of trusted devices. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any updated or accurate instructions on how to do this?&nbsp; I would say I can't believe Microsoft would overlook this but I honestly am not at all surprised at such lousy, inaccurate, outdated&nbsp;documentation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I add a device as trusted?&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to trust my PC, a Surface 2, and a Windows Phone 8.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

            <p>This still does not help.&nbsp; At all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I accidentally removed a computer from the devices listed by Microsoft under My Account.&nbsp; I believe this is the same type of "account" that the person above is asking about.&nbsp; Not the
Microsoft</strong><strong> My Account</strong> - that you can sign into with a browser.<br />
If you sign into your Microsoft - My Account in a browser and look at your list of Devices and do not see all of your computers, there is an option to add a "Surface" or "Phone" - but *not* another computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For myself, I have signed into the missing computer using my Microsoft account name/password.&nbsp; I have also signed into the Microsoft My Account using a browser on that machine.<br />
<br />
The question is this - <em>what</em> do I need to do so that Microsoft will, once again, realize that this other computer that I own and am signed in on is a "Device" that should be listed in my Microsoft - My Account - Device list?</p>

            <p>Same here. I deleted a computer that I just decommissioned, and am trying to add a new Intel NUC i7 kit. Of course, the only options to add a new piece of hardware in the Microsoft-centric world is a Wondows phone, a Surface or an Xbox, none of which I own.
 I would certainly like to add my new Windows OS-based computer, but Microsoft doesn't seem to allow it for some strange reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, community. There has to be a way.</p>

            <p>I renamed my laptop, but my old laptop name was still appearing under Trusted Devices. So I removed my old laptop but there is no option to add the renamed PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to add the renamed PC, I had to convert to a local account, and then convert back to Microsoft account, at which point you will be asked to verify you account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once complete, your renamed PC will be added to your Microsoft Account, as well as associated Family accounts.<br />

    <title>Broken right click and start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baino95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Broken right click and start menu</h2>
                    <p>To start off, I'm not sure if these problems are related but they started happening about the same time. Okay, so i recently upgraded to windows 10, everything seemed fine, then after about a week out of nowhere whenever i right click, be it on the desktop,
 or file explorer, that window will freeze. I also have the problem of my start menu not opening up, i can click on it and it doesn't appear to be frozen, it just doesn't come up. So i tried fixing it myself, I looked up the right click problem and it was likely
 due to a faulty shell i think, so i downloaded ShellExView and disabled a bunch of shells, but nothing, I ended up disabling all non Microsoft shells, still nothing. I tried something else by going onto the registry editor and deleting context menu handlers
 that I didn't recognize, still nothing. Now as for the start menu, I assume if i fix the other problem then hopefully i will be able to use it again, whereas if i cant then i don't know what the problem would be, the only thing i could think of would be that
 i recently changed my location and language settings around so i could get Cortana to work (because i have an american keyboard so my keyboard layout is set on US so i had to change my location to US too, but i actually live in the UK) I should also mention
 this started about the same time i downloaded uTorrent, when i installed it, it suggested I download a program called SHAREIT or something, but i didn't really want it so after I downloaded it I uninstalled it, but after the problem ensued I noticed that there
 was still a SHAREIT context menu in ShellExView, I disabled it, but alas right click is still isn't working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: I also forgot to mention that it is only when i right click on applicationsn folders and shortcuts, not things like application extensions and .zip folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NBB: Also not sure if this is related but task manager never works, its always not responding. Again, it started about the same time</p>
<p>

            Hi, thanks for the help, but unfortunately I could not complete method 1, 2 or 3. Method 1 because whenever I try to open task manager it doesn't respond. Method 2 because when I try to open command prompt (admin) although I click on it, it simply won't
 open. And I cannot attempt method 3 as I do not have the start menu to access settings :(

                    My compute seems to be stuck in "Getting Windows Ready, Do not Turn Computer Off". It has been running for about two hours. I did a restart and this happened. Seems to be a fairly common problem.

            Hi Bruce, it does seem stuck . . .
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Remove all devices plugged into your PC
<br />
<br />Start your system and give it 20 minutes to complete
<br />
<br />If it does not complete:
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset
