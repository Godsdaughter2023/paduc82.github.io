            Since you refer to "subdocuments," are you using the master document feature in Word? If so, you should stop, because master documents have never been safe in Word; on the contrary, they lead do document corruption. See

            <p>Thank you<br />
It seems to help, I tried shift-DoubleClick document file and then cleaned my documents from user templet. With the clean documents, merged by copy-paste,. I loaded my template back again. Then all the vector figure illustrations are all visible and stable.<br />
</p>
<p>I User MathType from Design Science as add on, I don’t experience problems from this.</p>
<p>What happens by DoubleClick, there is no flag that tells Word is in safe mode?

            Thank you for the warning, <br />
My experience is, to work with master doc is very delicate, a simple sequential error in your action and you lose a lot of data.

            Hi secretaryhgc,<br />
<br />
We've tried to replicate your concern here on our end and it seems adding names from a contact group may depend on where you exactly get your contacts from. To better understand your issue, kindly answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
• Are you trying to access your email using the Outlook desktop app or Outlook.com?<br />
• Have you tried manually adding your contacts in your email account then adding it on your contact groups to check if the issue still persists?<br />
• How did you add those contacts that show on your contact list? <br />
<br />
You may also use the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/22878/windows-10-record-steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Steps Recorder tool</a></strong> for us to know what exactly is happening with your contacts. Once done, save the
 .zip file and send it to us via private message.<br />
<br />
Here's how: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. In my previous response, click Advanced Tools. &nbsp;<br />
2. Click Initiate Private Message. &nbsp;<br />
3. On the message editor, click Choose File. &nbsp;<br />
4. Browse the file and click Open. &nbsp;<br />
5. Compose a message (optional), then click Send.<br />
<br />
To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post. <br />

<p>I use either the outlook .com or it takes me to this</p>

<p>I check my individual names to make sure they are in the contact list.</p>
<p>I go to my group list.</p>
<p>open group</p>
<p>&nbsp;then edit app to add name</p>
<p>type in name it says "No results found" yet i can see it. in the contacts.</p>

            If that's the case, you may try adding a contact to your address book. Once done, try adding it on your contact list/group and check if "No results found" will still appear. We just want to make sure if the issue is only happening when the contacts came
 from a third party connected accounts of your email.<br />
<br />
If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.

            For weeks now I've been unable to add a contact to an existing contact list.&nbsp; I confirm the manually added individual name/email address exists in my address book but when I attempt to edit and add that individual to the contact list, whether using surname
 or email address, I repeatedly get "no results found".&nbsp; Help??&nbsp; This appears identical to the prior user's issue but I don't see a resolution?

<h2>            Personal Office conflict with Work Office</h2>
                    <p>I have two subscriptions to Office365 - one for home and one for work.&nbsp; I thought the best way to use them on my home pc was to have two profiles.&nbsp; Since upgrading to windows 10 and then allowing the upgrade for my home office365 to Office 2016, I can no
 longer install applications that I only have access to through my work account (e.g. Skype for Business or Microsoft Project).&nbsp; Does anyone know how to solve this?&nbsp; Is there a way to merge / connect my two Office 365 accounts so that I can have a single profile
 and have access to all the applications I need?<br />

            <p>Two win Profiles, presumably you mean two win logins as the type of Profile you mean has not been supported under win for some time. So you are installing the two versions on the same PC/space, which isn't going to work, unless you use a 'virtual PC' setup
 for one of the MS Accounts/versions. (or buy a new PC/device, for your Personal version)</p>
<p>No, the different type of MS Accounts cannot be merged without losing one.</p>

<p><span>This is often a temporary error, and I suspect that it does in fact indicate a programmatic error in Windows Defender – but I’ve only seen this error once, and that was after a test cleaning with
 Ccleaner. So I think the error in my case was caused by Ccleaners unfriendly removal of Defender’s tracking data, and that the issue might more generally be caused by other system cleaning and optimization utilities.</span></p>

</p><p>Can you provide your current location right now? Please be advised that caller identification using your mobile number is available across the world, with the exception of China, Hong Kong, Japan and Mexico.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the caller identification doesn’t work it might be because it’s not available in your country or it’s not currently supported by the local telecommunication provider for the country you’re calling.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're working hard to make caller identification available in other countries, too so that everyone can recognize you're calling them from Skype.</p>
<p>

            <p>I want to add my 2cents after a 72 hour Insider Slow Ring experience on my HTC OneM8.&nbsp; I've since reset my phone back to 8.1Update 2.&nbsp; The "look"...I see a category here for it and I'm wondering if you're tinkering with something that was really good already
 and should be left alone.&nbsp; That's all I'll say about it.&nbsp; Updating through the program worked well.&nbsp; I didn't crash at all but it did get hung in a final cleanup of OneDrive after all of the initial downloading, installing and then updating of individual apps.&nbsp;
 I rebooted it and it went forward as planned.&nbsp; I wanted to run this on my primary phone because I have 3 developer phones.&nbsp; Any of those phones would have worked, but I figured I needed to use the primary because I wouldn't get enough experience out of the
 others.&nbsp; Cortana crashes in drive mode after my destination is set and I've tried to start the driving instructions every single time I&nbsp;drove with&nbsp;it only to see it crash.&nbsp; I went back over to HereDrive and it worked fine.&nbsp; I would describe the software as
 "picky" on connections.&nbsp; It was picky with which cables I was using between PCs.&nbsp; I have several different ones that I've used and it didn't used to care, but now it does.&nbsp; I noted that the phone is sensing a certain percentage of my wifi and then going over
 to cellular and that threshold is higher than before.&nbsp; It used to hold onto my wifi for dear life before and I could use it through multiple floors and walls without much concern for range.&nbsp; There was lag of about 3 blocks from my office before it would switch
 to cellular before and that was a little frustrating with 8.1. After the update that changed significantly and I was on cellular data after walking down one floor in my building whereas before I could go down 5 floors and still be hanging on just a little.&nbsp;Now
 that I have reset back it has gone back to this old behavior and I'm delighted.&nbsp; I experienced 2 significant crashes.&nbsp; One crash in the first 12 hours lasted some minutes where the phone was just dead.&nbsp; Zero response from trying to reset through the buttons
 at all.&nbsp; Plugging it in did the trick this time and the phone was not really doing anything when I saw it crash.&nbsp; I noted that the Bluetooth commands seemed good and the new ones were fun, but that she had trouble hearing me even with a headset.&nbsp; To some extent
 I kept thinking that she was turning the mic off and this is a problem that I had within the first few months of having the phone that went away but seemed to come back now.&nbsp; The compass is still screwed up and I see MS saying it isn't them but all the trouble
 started in June for me as it did for everyone else.&nbsp; This is still a problem.&nbsp; I don't like the visual set up on the store and think you should go back to the way it was.&nbsp; Also, I was able to download apps that clearly were not meant for this OS and would
 not respond after install and found the store experience disappointing. I tried the headphones that came with the phone for some music but felt the quality of the sound and the volume of the has changed a litte from what it was.&nbsp; I have not tried it since
 I've reset the phone but I wanted to note that there was some difference.&nbsp; What little time I did spend with office everything seemed ok but I was missing the month view in the calendar and didn't find it right off.&nbsp; It may be there but I just didn't find
 it in the bottom&nbsp;nav bar where it usually is.&nbsp; The last crash was the final straw with it.&nbsp; I did note that the&nbsp;phone seemed to be having trouble during a barrage of texts&nbsp;and calls that I received over a period of about 10 minutes.&nbsp; Cortana seemed to be having
 trouble keeping up with what was going on and I&nbsp;have seen these signs before but I didn't respond to it because I was busy.&nbsp; By the time I figured out she was crashing and I needed to reboot, the phone hung in shut down and started to get hot.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is frustrating
 because I should have seen it coming faster but locked up so hard with the&nbsp;lockscreen on and no help for miles.&nbsp; I got it home and got it to reboot&nbsp;into the diagnostic mode&nbsp;but honestly I'm not sure how because I&nbsp;know how to reboot the phone and none of this
 worked.&nbsp; Rather than mess around with this anymore on my primary I gave up on it and reset it back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expected issues by doing this, but I didn't expect to be in the slow ring with the literal interpretation of holding another phone in my pocket for when it crashes and that is what I would have to do.&nbsp; I can do that, but this is the slow ring and a good
 phone.&nbsp; I shouldn't need to do that.&nbsp; I love MS.&nbsp; Call on me anytime.&nbsp; Sorry if this isn't the right place to post.</p>

<p>I primarily use 3 Office programs, Word Excel and Outlook.&nbsp; All three of them work fine for varying amounts of time and then as I'm working in one of them, for no apparent reason,&nbsp;when I type quotation marks, question marks, the slash key or commas, they
 are replaced with <span>
<font color="#000000">É.&nbsp; Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End also quit working.&nbsp; When I use that combination, the cursor just goes to the beginning or end of the line, not the beginning or end of the document.&nbsp; What Iève (this is an example of my problem - as I was typing
 this reply, those keys have quit working.&nbsp; that è was supposed to be a apostrophe.&nbsp; This - É is a question mark.&nbsp; Wordpad, Word and Outlook are still ok, but Excel suddenly is not - I was just using it)&nbsp;been doing so far is closing the particular program and
 then restarting it.&nbsp; The program then works fine for awhile and then goes on the blink again.&nbsp; I never use Wordpad, however, I just opened it to test the keys and Everything seems to be working fine right now.</font></span></p>

            <p>Hi Helpme111111111Please, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand you're wanting to sign out of your Xbox Live account on the phone. I'm not sure if you're wanting to sign out of your Xbox Live account in the Games hub on your phone, or the account in
<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Email + Accounts</strong>, but the answer will be the same for either situation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to sign out of your Xbox Live account on the phone will be to reset the phone. This can be done&nbsp;under
<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; Reset Phone</strong>. Please keep in mind that this does delete everything on the phone, so you'll want to back up all of the music, videos, and photos in the Zune software&nbsp;that you don't want to lose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H. </p>

    <title>Language pack for Nokia 3720c - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patodal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language pack for Nokia 3720c</h2>
                    
<p>I live in Norway. Recently I bought a 3720 from Germany, and I didn't realise that the phone would be without Norwegian language options. The menus are not a major problem, but the lack of a Norwegian dictionary for texting is. My question: Is it possible
 to download the Scandinavian language pack to my phone? Or is it possible to acquire it through some kind of service center?</p>

<p>The whole firmware must be changed. Your current firmware variant is identified through the Nokia Product Code (05…). Your current code&nbsp;is printed on the label behind the battery. You need a firmware variant which contains&nbsp;<span>Norwegian like&nbsp;0590889 (Grey)
 or&nbsp;0591159 (Yellow). Officially, this is done by a Nokia Care Centre. However, because I am an end-user like you, I do not know if there is still such a centre in Norway.</span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 Sites vs Sharepoint&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an Office 365 Essentials subscription that comes with "Team Sites".&nbsp; However I'm confused b/c the documentation often refers to Sharepoint. Is "Teams" a low version of sharepoint? I'm not sure what "Teams" can do and cannot do. If someone could provide
 a reference it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change wifi to data connection or data connection to wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists try that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of errors are normally caused because the main microsoft account that you are trying to use on the phone does not have all the information required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all please check what is the main microsoft account on the phone. Please go to
<strong>Settings &gt; email+accounts </strong>&gt; check the email that appears under "<strong>Microsoft Account</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the PC, sign into this web using your microsoft account: <a href="https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that all data are filled in and correct, including the date of birth, country, address and time zone. Save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please sign into this web with the same account: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are asked to confirm the Terms of Use or to create an Xbox live account, please follow the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then please, on the phone go to Settings &gt; email+accounts &gt; add an account &gt; microsoft account &gt; enter the email and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same issue persist&nbsp;please follow the steps of this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can't add Microsoft account during initial setup of Windows Phone 8</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784236/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2784236/en-us</a></p>

</strong>and then <strong>Email+accounts</strong>.</li></ol>
3. Reset your phone

If the steps above still didn't help, your phone may be in a bad state, which means you will have to reset the phone to its original factory settings and set it up again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note&nbsp;</strong>More information about resetting your phone can be found in the Help &amp; How to article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/basics/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset my phone</a></p>

<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Tap <strong>About</strong>, and then tap <strong>Reset your phone</strong>. </li><li>Tap <strong>Yes</strong>, and then tap <strong>Yes </strong>again. </li></ol>
<p>Then step through the setup wizard again. During the setup, make sure to&nbsp;<strong>manually set the date and time</strong>,
<strong>connect to Wi-Fi </strong>(if available), and try adding your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in using Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are unable the Technical Preview. &nbsp;Let me try and let you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried installing it from a different DVD or USB?<br />
</p>
<p>Error code 0x80070570 reported solutions that have worked for Windows install are:</p>
<p>1. Disconnect all USB devices except for mouse and keyboard-then install.</p>
<p>2. Test your RAM sticks -a bad RAM stick will cause corruption when expanding files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You have mentioned that the ISO is verified so have you re-downloaded the ISO?
<br />
S</span>ome users were able to install it after re-downloading the ISO once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a newbie and since I joined here I want to express my opinions about the new release.</p>
<p>I tried all above mentioned even cleaning from cmd the install partition.</p>
<p>Anyway I skiped the x64 version and tried the x32 version on another old netbook, Lenovo Thinkpad X60s.</p>
<p>This time I created the bootable usb with Rufus. Worked fine. And I'm really surprised how well the 10 technical respond. And this after this netbook run XP, Ubuntu, Lubuntu, Bodhi and 7 Starter with their tweaks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm surprised. Anyway there were some issues&nbsp;&nbsp;with accesing the "change adapter settings" wich didn't respond after the wireless connection dropped.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the only resolution available was the recommended one.</p>
<p>I liked the idea of being able to revert to Start Screen instead of Start Menu. Nice option. I like the Metro UI.</p>
<p>For the x64 version I'll do another installation today with Rufus and from an SSD on the same Toshiba laptop.</p>
<p>Thx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dan</p>
<p>
</p><p>________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Succesfully installed the x64 version on the same Toshiba machine. This time I used again Rufus instead of Microsoft tool. Weird was that I was asked to press any key to start the USB installation. And it took much longer than previous installs with 7 or
 8 on the same ssd. The same as for the x32 Lenovo install the video controller was missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep for a while to play with and share same opinions after I'll install some apps.</p>

2) After downloading the correct .iso file install HashCalc and validate the SHA1 hash value<br />
is correct.<br />
HashCalc: <a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</a>
<br />
(Note: If the download is not corrupt, the value HashCalc returns will match the SHA1 value I posted)</p>
<p><br />
a) Launch HashCalc and navigate to the location of the .iso file you downloaded.<br />
(The default download location is: C:\Users\User account name\Downloads)<br />
b) Remove all check marks from the list of HashCalc options except for SHA1.<br />
c) Click the ‘Calculate’ button and wait for the SHA1 string of letters and number to be displayed.<br />
Note: Upper and lower case letters are considered the same.</p>
<p><br />
3) Next use ImgBurn (or Gear ISO) to create a bootable DVD.<br />
ImgBurn: <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a> <br />
Choose the “Custom Installation (advanced)” option and remove the check mark(s)<br />
to eliminate unwanted options.</p>
<p><br />
Note: Skip to step #4 to create a bootable Flash / Thumb drive.</p>

            I've had this issue as well of receiving an error code (wording was same but actual error code may have been different).&nbsp; I've downloaded the .iso file several times over the past 6 weeks and checked each one with FCIV.EXE to confirm the download wasn't
 corrupt.&nbsp; Each download resulted in the same hash value of 9005dce26734bcde7f912c2c51ab1127 but that DOES NOT match what is posted... not sure what's going on but looks like I'll have to pass of checking out Win 10.<br />

            I just saw that HashCalc is the tool others were using to calculate the SHA-1 hash (I'd never heard of it before).&nbsp; When I used that tool I got the value that is posted on the download page.<br />

Hi ezpar44,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
So we can better assist you with the challenges that your colleagues are having when replying to messages from bellsouth.net email domain, we would like to ask a few points:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>How are your colleagues trying to send a reply to the bellsouth.net emails? Are they using an email application or via the browser?</li><li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Is the issue also occurring even if they are only sending new emails (not replying) to the said email address?</li><li>Is the bellsouth.net email somehow connected to an outlook.com account?</li><li>Can you enumerate the suggested “fixes” that you have tried so far?</li><li>Would you be able to send us a screenshot of what exactly your colleagues are seeing when they reply to the said emails?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>

<p>Thanks for quick reply....answers:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I believe they are using their aol. email application from pc, laptops, and tablets.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Issue started in last 2 weeks when I started using my bellsouth.net email as my primary email.&nbsp; (Moving from previous corporate email system)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I believe it is happening on both replies and NEW emails being sent to my bellsouth.net addr</p>
<p>4. Yes, my bellsouth.net email is associated with my Outlook 16 software....see copy from current Profile:</p>
<p><em>Selected account delivers new messages to the following location:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***\Inbox</em></p>
<p><em>in data file C:\Users\elise\...\Outlook\*** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Elise.ost</em></p>
<p><em>5.&nbsp; </em>I googled this problem and there were several suggested fixes...even a couple of utube videos which I tried to follow...mostly involved configuring
<em>IMAP or POP settings...for incoming and outgoing mail.&nbsp; I think they all showed pretty much the same settings....I will say, it was getting pretty confusing when nothing was working to fix the problem!</em></p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response. As you may already know, the error code 554 5.7.9 is usually related to policy settings configured for a certain email account. However, it is still quite
 unclear why your colleagues are receiving the said error when sending emails to your Bellsouth.net account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the whole error message below, it is more likely to be an issue with the policies set on the Outlook.com server, but based on your description on your second response, we still
 do not see how the Outlook.com server would fit in on the issue since having your Bellsouth account configured to Outlook 2016 application should not have anything to do with the error message that the senders are receiving:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original message was received at Tue, 19 Feb 2019 12:52:46 -0800</p>
<p>from mail-sn1nam01lp2054.outbound.protection.outlook.com [104.47.32.54]</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----</p>
<p>&lt;elisecampbell@bellsouth.net&gt;</p>
<p>(reason: 554 5.7.9 Message not accepted for policy reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By any chance, are you using your Bellsouth.net account as your Microsoft/Outlook.com account as well? If not, is this account work or a personal email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you be able to confirm if the AOL.com email senders are also getting the same error when sending to other domains aside from Bellsouth.net accounts?</p>

<p>Thanks for trying to fix this.&nbsp; I have set up my Outlook account to receive my bellsouth.net emails as this is my primary email addr.&nbsp; This goes back a few years as I have had this email for a LONG time.&nbsp; When att moved everything to Yahoo I kept my bellsouth
 addr.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new laptop and purchased Outlook 16 since I had previously been using Outlook via a corporate email (I am now retired) so I need to operate exclusively via my personal email:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp; I really liked Outlook so
 want to continue using on my personal PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is screen shot of my Outlook account settings.&nbsp; Does this help?&nbsp; ONLY my aol friends are getting the subject error message.&nbsp; And I have a LOT of friends on my distribution lists with various email servers.&nbsp; (I manage a women's golf league so I am doing
 a lot of emails)</p>

<p>Thanks for clarifying, ezpar44.&nbsp; There is a certain parameter that the Outlook server has that may be preventing emails from the aol.com domain to go through. I would suggest that your colleagues who are using the aol.com domain fill out this

<p>Most of my aol friends are far from "techy" and would not have any idea how to do what you are asking.&nbsp; I really don't want to cause any more "stress" on their end.&nbsp; Since you indicate this is an "Outlook server" issue....isn't there some way to check my
 Outlook settings to allow aol emails?&nbsp; I'm sure none of my friends have changed any of their aol settings so the aol email settings should be the same for all of them!</p>

<p><span>Thanks for the update. Based on our investigation, having an issue with sending/receiving an email using a different domain is caused by the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The sender’s IP or domain has a low reputation with Outlook.com because of Spam activities, the IP is new, or the IP address of the domain is sending a million emails to Outlook.com users (<strong>Note:</strong> IP based domain have limitations of
 emails to be sent to Outlook.com users).</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Antivirus software’s “Internet Email Auto Protocol” or “Internet Email Protection”. If this setting is enabled, disable it and try sending a test message to our server again.</span></li><li>The DNS of the sender’s domain is not configured correctly.</li><li>Namespace mining - This method is commonly used by malicious senders to generate lists of valid e-mail addresses that they can send spam, phishing emails, or malware.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>With the above-mentioned causes, Outlook.com users have nothing to do with the issue as it is created by design to protect Outlook.com users for any possible compromise of your personal information online.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since your colleagues are using an AOL account, it is best that they contact their email provider and advice them to contact our Outlook.com Postmaster by visiting this
<span><a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com%2Fpm%2F&amp;data=02%7C0****H%2Fri9SXRrrvJY21BPGuj8ZrQsh%2FeTI%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></span>.</span></p>

    <title>Lumia 625 calendar entries not showing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ichigo_chan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 625 calendar entries not showing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! I'm a Lumia 625 user. For the past few months my lumia worked just fine and the calendar showed all the birthday entries of the contacts that I saved. But since yesterday, no new birthday entry is showing on the calendar. I mean, if I save a contact,
 the birthday is shown in the contact's profile but the birthday isn't shown in the Calendar. For example: Yesterday I saved a new contact whose birthday is on March 20. When I view his profile from the People list, I can see the birthday under the other profile
 information. But when I open the calendar and go to the date March 20, it doesn't show the notification of his birthday. I experimented with lots of new contacts since then but the same thing is happening.</p>
<p>This has never happened before... I can't seem to find a solution to this problem. I searched the net but didn't find anything useful. I tried restarting the phone multiple times. The problem is still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: All the old entries are still viewable in the calendar.</p>

    <title>Copy&#47;Paste Values across entire workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ga99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy&#47;Paste Values across entire workbook</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I have a workbook with &nbsp;multiple worksheets that links to a live stock pricing database.</div>
<div>I need to periodically share the workbook with others but &nbsp;I can't email it because links break since no-one else has access to the stock prices.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't need them to update the database or use formulas, so I wonder if there is a macro or something that would let me Copy and Paste Values to every cell in the workbook. That way I can update it as required, save it with values only and email it to
 everyone who needs to view it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Warning #1: Test all of this out on a copy of your real workbook since it is a 'data destructive' process.</p>
<p>What this does: it copies all of the worksheets in the workbook that the code is in into a new workbook.&nbsp; Then it goes to each sheet in that new workbook and turns the formulas in cells into values, and it also removes all hyperlinks from those sheets.&nbsp;
 If all goes well, you won't even have to any resetting of anything in your regular stock pricing workbook.</p>
<p>It then returns to your source workbook and tells you the job is done.&nbsp; The other workbook will be hidden behind the original, you can use View --&gt; Switch Windows to bring it into view and save it with a new name and distribute it as needed.</p>
<p>The code goes into a regular code module, see this page for instructions on how to put it into one:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Regular" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Regular</a></p>
<p>The code:</p>
<p>Sub MakeCopyForDistribution()<br />
&nbsp; Dim newWB As Workbook<br />
&nbsp; Dim anyWS As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; Worksheets.Copy ' copy all from this workbook into a new workbook<br />
&nbsp; Set newWB = ActiveWorkbook<br />
&nbsp; For Each anyWS In newWB.Worksheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'converts all formulas to their values<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyWS.UsedRange.Formula = anyWS.UsedRange.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'deletes any hyperlinks on the sheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyWS.Hyperlinks.Delete<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Activate<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox "Values only copied into workbook: " &amp; newWB.Name<br />
&nbsp; Set anyWS = Nothing<br />
&nbsp; Set newWB = Nothing<br />

            The easiest way would be to save a copy under a different name and then just break the links before sending.
<div><br />
<div>In Excel 2007</div>
<div>Click the Office Button (The round thing in the upper left corner)</div>
<div>Select Prepare, then select Edit Links to files.</div>
<div>You can select all files by using (Shift + mouse click) then click the Break Link button.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you really want a macro this will do the same thing</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub Linkbreaker()</div>
<div>Dim WBlinks As Variant, A As Integer</div>
<div><br />
<div>WBlinks = ActiveWorkbook.LinkSources(Type:=xlLinkTypeExcelLinks)</div>
<div><br />
<div>If Not IsEmpty(WBlinks) Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For A = UBound(WBlinks) To 1 Step -1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveWorkbook.BreakLink Name:=WBlinks(A), Type:=xlLinkTypeExcelLinks</div>

<h2>            Windows10InsiderPreview.exe quits after &#34;Getting ready to upgrade...&#34; &#91;Surface Pro&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hey! I am trying to get the Windows 10 Preview on my Microsoft Surface Pro which is currently running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I launch the Windows10InsiderPreview.exe file a window pops up saying "Getting ready to upgrade...", has a little continuous scrolling progress bar, and then quits. It launches Windows Update, but nothing in that application makes a note that anything
 has changed. Restarting the computer and trying again does nothing either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I could be doing wrong?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Hyperlink warnings are driving me INSANE in Office 2007 - KB925757 Does NOT Help</h2>
                    I have had this problem for several weeks now.<br />
<br />
Anytime I click on my hyperlinks within Word 2007 I am presented with <a href="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg301/Muthafodder/Office2007Issue/Warning.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this warning</a>:<br />
"Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern.<br />
This location may be unsafe.<br />
C:\....xxxxx.docx"<br />
<br />
If it is another Word document I hyperlink to, after the warning is cleared it will take me to the location and bring the document to display.<br />
However, when it is an Excel or PDF document I am hyperlinking, after I have cleared the warning, the document that would normally open and display is instead
<a href="http://s251.photobucket.com/albums/gg301/Muthafodder/Office2007Issue/?action=view&amp;current=DoesNotOpen.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg301/Muthafodder/Office2007Issue/DoesNotOpen.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">just flashing in the taskbar</a>.<br />
<br />
It's driving me INSANE and hampers the flow of my work in having to deal with this pop-up over 100 times in a document...it's madness.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything under the sun.<br />
<br />
I have added my C:/ drive paths as trusted locations; add-ins aren't required to be signed; all ActiveX controls are enables without restriction; all Macros are enabled; notifications of blocked content are disabled; check Microsoft Office documents that are
 from a link to suspicious web sites is not checked.<br />
<br />
I tried every step in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB925757</a> to no avail, even going so far as adding the DisableHyperlinkWarnings REG_DWORD values in each .bmp; .png; .pdf; .docx; .xlsx; etc. root in Regedit.<br />
<br />
I know that in KB925757 it references the HLINK.dll file...could this the root of my issues?<br />
Everything is up-to date...Windows...Office Suite...Adobe...everything.<br />
How can one disable warnings that originate from the HLINK.dll file?<br />
Could the issue be related to the permission garbage of Windows 7?<br />
<br />
This makes no sense...why can't I turn these warning off or disable them?!?!<br />
This is EXTREMELY frustrating and have spent double digit hours already troubleshooting this madness.<br />
<br />
It should be obvious I have researched this thoroughly and please don't reply with scripted responses relating to items I've already stated I have addressed above.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Office 2007 Suite with Access 2003<br />

            I appreciate the interest of those that have responded, but I kinda figured I would need to figure this one out.<br />
<br />
If you've read my initial post, you'd see that I had tried the ideas you suggested.<br />
<br />
I was leaning towards a Windows 7 issue...it was...per se.<br />
<br />
The documents were recognized as originating from another computer and was blocking all the content..i.e. hyperlinks.<br />
This was a Windows security issue as it was being blocked outside of Office.<br />
I knew this as stated in my post that I felt it was tied to the HLINK somehow...<br />
<br />
"You can differentiate the 2007 Office or 2010 Office hyperlink warning message from the HLINK warning message by looking for quotation marks around the file path in the warning message.
<br />
You'll note in the picture of the error in the original post that it was not in quotation marks.<br />
<br />
I was able to unblock the content by <a href="http://s251.photobucket.com/albums/gg301/Muthafodder/Office2007Issue/?action=view&amp;current=Unblock.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg301/Muthafodder/Office2007Issue/Unblock.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">right-clicking the files and choosing unblock</a>...I only needed to do this once per file...the option disappears afterwards.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what change to my system triggered this as I have other files that have originated from other computers and this has never been an issue, just some recent files I have been working on for a while.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not sure what caused this to occur, but I'm now researching how to prevent it in the future.<br />
<br />
Insane that something of this nature was not found on the Internet with this error and it's association with blocked hyperlinks...mind blown.<br />
<br />
The warning that was given for this should have referred to the blocked content evidenced by right-clicking the file and/or given an error when the Word document was opened that any content in the file would be blocked.&nbsp; It's just silly that this conflict between
 the Word permissions and Windows creates this issue.<br />

<h2>            Sway videos</h2>
                    I have inserted a 30 second video clip into a Sway presentation.&nbsp; Is there a way of stopping this one card from scrollling on to the next one in the set 3 seconds?&nbsp; My other cards are just photos with a small amount of text so I don't want those to show
 for 30 seconds.&nbsp; My only solution has been to put the video clip last and ensure the loop continuously tab is not clicked.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not a way to do what you are asking for.&nbsp; The autoplay delay can only be applied to the Sway as a whole.&nbsp; In addition to your solution of putting it at the end you could also try splitting your videos and images into two separate sways and then
 embedding the image one in the video one and having autoplay only on the image one.</p>

<h2>            How can ACCESS automatically open reports in the accdr&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a "Customer Order" Database in Access 2010.</p>
<p>How can make ACCESS automatically open reports in the accdr?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried macros in the accdb and accde to no avail:</p>
<p>Forms![ORDER ENTRY].OnOpen </p>
<p>Forms![ORDER ENTRY].OnActivate</p>
<p>Forms![ORDER ENTRY].OnLoad</p>
<p>Forms![ORDER ENTRY].Visible</p>
<p><strong>Then</strong></p>
<p>Open Report...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Macro works on clicking but I need it auto execute because the Shutter Bar is not accessible in the accdr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robert</p>
<p />

            What do you mean by *automatically*? &nbsp;You mean you want a Report to open without pressing a button? &nbsp;If so, does it just open showing all the records or are you trying to open a filtered report?

            <p>Thanks Gina.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>I had to rename the macro AutoExec</p>
<p>No filters are applied.</p>

            <p>If you want to schedule a report to run what I do is create a separate front end with either an Autoexec macro or use the On Open event of the default form. This front end is then run using Windows Task Scheduler at the selected time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want this report to run whenever the app is open, then again use an Autoexec macro or the On Open event.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trick was to rename my macro into: "AutoExec"</p>
<p>This way, my Customer Contact Report and Vendor Report open automatically on the Front End.</p>
<p>And that what I need.</p>

            So you need it to open every time the app is opened?

            <p>Yes Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have configured it that my "Order Entry" form opens on top of the all other tabs which open every time.</p>
<p>That way, I have the Form I need most on top and I just ust have to switch tabs to see my Customers, Sold Products or Vendors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Works like a charm now :)</p>
