<h2>            Computer crashed, want my office on new computer</h2>
                    My computer windows crashed, I bought a new computer and need to have my office programs loaded to my new computer. I loaded office 2007 from online in 2008. How can I do this? I'd like to upgrade to 2010 also.

The MOST important part of your Office purchase is the Product Key.&nbsp; If you don't have it written down, or the orignal confirmation email there are some other ways of finding it.<br />
<br />
Go back to the online store you bought it from&nbsp; There should be an account setup there for you using your email address as the log in ID. The account would have a download link and your product key.<br />

If you don't have the product key, there is still a chance you can extract your key. It depends on the type of crash. You may be able to get a technician who can plug in and run the HD just long enough to extract the key.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if you have an image copy backup
 of the old machine, you may be able to extract the key from there.<br />

<h2>            Selecting single data point on line chart</h2>
                    
<p>I first created line chart with four series with data points conected with a solid line.</p>
<p>Then on each series' last point I hide the line from the previous (last but one) point.</p>
<p>This works fine for the first three series, but on the forth series, when I click on the last data point, this point is not selected (the selected point is two points to the left) - any idea?</p>

<p>Click on the series, then on the point you want (two single clicks, but I think you get it). Then if the wrong point is selected, use the left and right buttons to cycle through the points until the one you want is selected.</p>

    <title>On occasion, &#39;undo&#39; in OneNote will randomly &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> therealevangelo  say:</h3>
<h2>            On occasion, &#39;undo&#39; in OneNote will randomly &#38; unpredictably erase data &#40;which therein cannot be recovered&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I began using OneNote for Mac when it was released in March of 2014. I LOVE the program, but I have encountered a MASSIVE issue that has reoccured for me on numerous instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, when I initiate 'undo', OneNote will produce the normal and expected behaviour -- i.e. removing the most recent change, which can thereby be restored if a 'redo' is thereafter initiated. However, on random and unpredictable intervals, the
 triggering of 'undo' in OneNote will result in an incredibly problematic outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Description of the problem</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After committing a typing or formatting error (or any other similar instance in which undo might be employed), I would use cmd + z to undo the most recent change to my document*&nbsp;</li><li>However, instead of simply removing the most recent change to my document, an undo event would delete it AND entire portions of text/data that had preceded the most recent change (in a seemingly indiscriminate fashion).
</li><li>After this erroneous event, if I try to initiate 'redo', it simply restores a small element of text/data to the portion of the document that remains, and then will not allow for any additional 'redos (thereby acting as if the portion of text/data that had
 been created subsequent to what is remaining had never existed in the first place)</li></ul>
<p>I soon discovered that this unpredictable 'undo' behaviour will repeat itself in a given session after its initial occurrence until OneNote is closed and reopened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not use OneNote for Mac over the summer, and so I had hoped that this issue would have since then been addressed and resolved by recent updates to the software. &nbsp;HOWEVER, after a month of use during this new school year, I experienced the same bug
 today with the most up-to-date version (15.2.2) -- whereby it acted in the exact same fashion as described above, and reoccured shortly thereafter, ceasing only after I closed and reopened OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Accounts of the problem by others:</span>
</strong></p>
<p>I have seen complaints about this problem. &nbsp;Here are two examples from users posting to these boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, by a user of OneNote for Surface from August 2013:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-onenote/undo-in-onenote-deletes-text/30bf4856-0a50-4349-bb49-7b6e233bc800">Link</a></li><li>Second, by a OneNote for Mac user on the 20th of this month:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_onenote-onenote_mac/what-happened-cmd-z-blows-away-60-minutes-of-work/42d89673-8d3b-4962-abf4-da69775a495c">Link</a></li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLEASE HELP</span></strong></p>
<p>This is a HUGE problem for me. &nbsp;I cannot continue to use a program that will have entire portions of text/data just randomly and indiscriminately disappear on me when I simply attempt to use such an elementary and essential feature like undo. &nbsp;I have not
 found any way to recover the text/data that disappears with this bug, so I'm forced to sit there and attempt to recreate what was lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by the person in the first post linked above, though exiting and reopening OneNote allows one to temporarily halt the occurrence of this bug, this does not prevent it from occurring in its first instance in the future, whereby one will randomly
 lose large portions of work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(*note, I believe the buggy 'undo' behaviour described above has occurred whether it is triggered via the cmd + z keyboard shortcut, or by clicking the 'undo' menu icon or menu option)</p>

            <p>I still can not reproduce the issue, never had this issue ever when working with either onenote 2010 on a windows pc or onenote mac app.</p>
<p>Can you text the behavior in a new notebook and see if this can be replicated.</p>
<p>This may be an issue as the app has to work with data saved on the cloud, though i can not confirm the same.</p>

            <p>That's the problem - I have no idea what brings it on, and so since it is such an infrequent and sporadic issue, I'm usually so upset about having had entire portions of text that I just worked on disappear in front of my eyes that I haven't been able to
 think much about what might have caused it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to intentionally bring it about -- though I believe it can be reproduced fairly easily after the bug surfaces the initial time in a given session (that is, before OneNote is closed and reopene).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it definitely seems like it could be a cloud issue to me. &nbsp;It's almost like the undo feature becomes out of sync with the present state of the document -- and thereby 'undo' seems to roll back the document to an early state, thereby 'undoing' the most
 recent change starting at x amount of time ago, rather than undoing the most recent change based on the current state of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, say earlier at 4:30pm I typed in a word that brought my document up to 400 words, and then at the present (say 5:00pm) I had just typed in a word that brought me up to 500, initiating undo seems to trigger an undo event that undoes the 400th
 word from 4:30pm (instead of the 500th word I just added). The redo feature thereby seems to only allow me to restore the word from 4:30pm (bringing it back up to 400 from 399) and so the undo bug irrevocably erases the 100 words I had added in the meantime.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Community. Besides closing and re-opening the OneNote app, it <em>
may</em> help to also close and re-open<em> each notebook</em>. This will force a "clean" re-sync down from OneDrive to the Mac. So&nbsp;<span>if you're up for some experimentation (at your own risk!), try the following...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure your notebooks look good on OneDrive here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. In OneNote for Mac &gt; File &gt; Close This Notebook. This removes the synced disk cache of that notebook from the Mac, whilst the master copy on OneDrive remains unaffected. Note: Choose a small notebook to start with, because when you re-open the notebook
 it will be re-synced down from OneDrive to the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Wait a few seconds for the disk cache to be removed as a result of the "Close This Notebook", and then do File &gt; Open Notebook... (Just to keep things simple, wait for it to complete its sync&nbsp;before closing &amp; opening the next notebook.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some basic instructions regarding closing notebooks in the Help menu &gt; OneNote Help &gt; enter "Close" in the search bar. You'll see in one of the search results there that closing and opening notebooks is suggested as a way to reset notebooks that
 can’t sync — and the problem you're seeing <em>may</em> be related to the sync process.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I really appreciate your suggestions, but in the meantime, I really just want OneNote to identify and acknowledge the problem, and to put some sort of measures in place to protect users against the program losing and/or compromising
<p>
</p><p>While it seems like this may not be a problem that has affected all users (yet, at least),it is a real bug, and it is incredibly problematic that the current configuration allows for data to be randomly erased in this manner.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Community. Besides closing and re-opening the OneNote app, it <em>
may</em> help to also close and re-open<em> each notebook</em>. This will force a "clean" re-sync down from OneDrive to the Mac. So&nbsp;<span>if you're up for some experimentation (at your own risk!), try the following...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure your notebooks look good on OneDrive here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.onenote.com/notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onenote.com/notebooks</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(As that's the master copy that will be re-synced down to your Mac in the following steps.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In OneNote for Mac &gt; File &gt; Close This Notebook. This removes the synced disk cache of that notebook from the Mac, whilst the master copy on OneDrive remains unaffected. Note: Choose a small notebook to start with, because when you re-open the notebook
 it will be re-synced down from OneDrive to the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Wait a few seconds for the disk cache to be removed as a result of the "Close This Notebook", and then do File &gt; Open Notebook... (Just to keep things simple, wait for it to complete its sync&nbsp;before closing &amp; opening the next notebook.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some basic instructions regarding closing notebooks in the Help menu &gt; OneNote Help &gt; enter "Close" in the search bar. You'll see in one of the search results there that closing and opening notebooks is suggested as a way to reset notebooks that
 can’t sync — and the problem you're seeing <em>may</em> be related to the sync process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, closing &amp; re-opening notebooks can also help with "search" in OneNote:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"...the suggestion of closing and reopening the file. This worked like a charm and the notebook in question is now searched along with "Search All Notebooks"."</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>I should also add that I have encountered this problem at different times on 3 different devices (my Mac desktop, on my old Macbook, and on my new Macbook). &nbsp;So I believe my notebooks have invariably been freshly opened within OneNote and nevertheless still
 exhibited this problematic behaviour.</p>

            <p>I have tried to contact Microsoft support through the various different forums they provide it (i.e. online chat and by phone) and have been endlessly sent from one support agent/body to the next, with each one telling me that they do not provide support
 for my product and that I will have to look elsewhere. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was given 5 different phone numbers and extensions to call (one of which was not even in service) and was transferred off from chat/phone support agents who said they only provide support only for "Microsoft" products, to one's that said they only provide
 support for "premium" Office products on "Mac", to ones that said they do not provide the type of support I need, and I have tried tweeting at the @msonenote twitter account, and now I have begun posting on here. &nbsp;With all this, I am shocked that I have still
 have received ZERO feedback or support from OneNote staff on this issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem. I got so frustrated yesterday when I was typing equations in the middle of a class, when a Cmd+Z unexpectedly erased 4 lines of complicated equations that the teacher had already erased from the whiteboard. This made me so
 angry, I had to take a deep breath. I really want to continue using OneNote, but as I can see this bug has been around for at least 4 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h3> ppww---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            3.5g  might fix, nokia 808</h2>
                    
<p>I had &nbsp;problems with my 3.5g connections, , so one day I decided to leave it permanently on, with my home screen widgets connecting to the internet without any problems, &nbsp;I left the phone in this state for about three days without any issues. When using
 apps (fmobi, nokia social, internet browser) I disconnected 3g widget otherwise the phone would freeze, or crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 4th day I decided to upload some pictures from the gallery using the facebook link, but I forgot to disconnect the 3g widget, to my surprise my photos uploaded OK without any problems, I continued to upload several more pictures, without any freezing
 issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to use some of my apps, and again no issues, my nokia 808 has not freeze for three days now when connecting to the internet, or using any apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not saying this a fix but would be interesting if anybody else find this a help and email me back please with your finding.</p>

<p>Disabled the high speed packet data package, you will have a more stable internet/apps connection. You will have 3g but not 3.5g.</p>
<p>Go to setting/admin setting/mobile data and then disable high speed packet access. If tab is not visible, &nbsp;enable &nbsp;dual mode, again setting/connectivity/network,&nbsp;and click dual tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made a big difference to my 808, hopefully nokia will sort out fix.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Exchange 2007 Free Busy Hash Marks</h2>
                    Except for one, all end users have Outlook 2007 and Free Busy info appears fine. &nbsp;Our one exception is Outlook 2013 and when that user tries to use the scheduling assistant they get hash marks with message "Your server location could not be determined".
 &nbsp;This happens regardless who in the GAL is chosen for the meeting. &nbsp;I have tried create new outlook profiles, both cached and uncached. &nbsp;I have tried creating new windows profiles. &nbsp;It always shows hash marks. &nbsp;I tried doing a reg hack about using legacy FB;
 that worked one time and then went back hash &nbsp;marks.
<div><br />
<div>I have tested autodiscover multiple times and it works every time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have an idea of how Outlook 2013 pulls Free Busy info from Exchange 2007?&nbsp;</div>
<div>How do I solve this?</div>

<h2>            Office 2016 HUP license - transfer from PC to laptop</h2>
                    <p>I purchased an HUP copy of office 2016 several months ago and installed it on my desktop PC on windows 7. &nbsp;I have now purchased a new laptop with windows 10 and would like to transfer the license to my new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the original email with the download link for my install - when I go to the download link, it is saying my HUP download link has expired. &nbsp;I did order the backup disc, which I promptly forgot about and don't believe I ever received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use the product key on my 2016 install on my desktop PC on the trail version of office installed on my laptop and it wouldn't take it.</p>

    <title>Saab 9.3 BPIS Bluetooth System and Nokia - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saab 9.3 BPIS Bluetooth System and Nokia</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I Have a Saab 9.3 equipped with Saab's own bluetooth system named Bluetooth Phone Integration System. I works quiet well with my old Nokia 6310i. But at this time it needs replacement. I tried a Nokia E90 and E61, they connect but it is impossible to import
 phone numbers and contacts to the system. My question is which RECENT Nokia phone can be recommended so I can use or transfer the phonebook.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much<br />
Ljad<br />

            The best people to contact are the manufacturers of Saab.<br />
Nokia cant ensure compatibility with your BT system in the Car.

            Thank You for your reply!<br />
I already contacted Saab in the past, they only give me a list with old phones which are supported. They only say that their Bluethooth system supports the official bluetooth standards. So I am left in the cold. Can someone tell me which protocols are necessary
 to have full compatibility with a Nokia Phone (E series if possible). OPP, OMA .. ? Or where can i find this information.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.

            Nokia smartphones work with some in-built car kits when you install this file:<br />
<br />
Try installing the "Nokia 810 Contact Download Application for Nokia S60 3rd edition devices" from this link:
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4143881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4143881</a><br />
<br />
It's the second file down.<br />
<br />
I do not know if it works with saab's.

            Most important thing is that whatever phone you're choosing it supports same profiles as your carkit e.g. handsfree or SAP (Sim access) profiles. So, if you know what profiles your carkit supports then check phone user guide (or Nokia web page - if you
 are thinking about buying a new Nokia phone) for supported bluetooth profiles.

The problem is that Saab is not very clear in providing the applicable protocols. Think they bought the hardware from someone else.<br />

            Hi ljad<br />
<br />
I know this is an old thread but I wonder if you ever cracked this. I'm also about to retire my trusty 6310i and have a new style S60 Nokia 6120c. I have same problem as you. The phone connects to the Saab Bluetooth kit but does not pull the contacts through
 which makes it fairly useless. I have tried the download application mentioned earlier in this thread from the Nokia website but this doesn't seem to have any effect.<br />
<br />
Other Nokia phones seem to work as long as they aren't S60 technology.<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated :)

            Hallo,<br />
<br />
I still have no solution for my E90 (which is indeed also a S60 phone). But as my wife now drives the car, it isn't so important any more. She has a Nokia 6300 which works perfectly with the saab.<br />
Best greetings,<br />

<br />
Thanks so much for the quick reply shame neither of us can get sorted!! I'll keep looking but I'm tempted to stick with my 6310i a little longer.<br />
<br />
By the way it's a little extreme to give your car to the wife just because the phone won't work!!! ;)

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem with my SAAB 9.3 2009ed and Nokia E65. I am able to connect the phone to the car, but I am not able to transfer the phone book, use voice instructions and so on. From the instruction manual it looks as if the car should identify
 itself as two separate bluetooth units, one for "normal" bluetooth and one for the extended service that allows you to transfer the phone book etc. I only get the first choice.. However, I have tested it with a Sony Ericson phone and that worked alright. My
 only concern is that I don't want a Sony Ericson phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you any closer to a solution?</p>

            This option is not available, although I had requested it a long time ago and I feel it should have been available by now. Your only option is to use your email address with an email client, such as Thunderbird for example; an email client will grant you
 the option to have a custom display name for sending email. This is currently the only way you will be able to have a custom display name for sending emails to others, from what I am aware.

<div>This problem should have been corrected back when Microsoft's web mail service was known as Hotmail, but the problem still carries on to this day, even though it is so simple to implement.</div>

<h2>            error while archiving folder Junk E-mail</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting this message for some time now and wans't too worried about it... but now I went into the Junk e- mail folder to manually delete the files and I get "The messaging interface has returned an unknown error. If problem persists, restart
 Outlook" even after restarting Outlook I get the same error.... the funny thing is that all new e-mails in that folder dated later then the date I started to get the "Rooro while Archiving" error can be deleted but anything before that date is stuck there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Outlook 2007 SP2 on a Windows XP with SP3 installed.</p>

<h2>            Nokia XPress Music 5800 Died</h2>
                    
<p>After 8 months it finally went I'm on Vodafone via a contract and I got this Nokia 5800 as an upgrade I love it great piece of kit Music Player is great. On thursday morning thou it went all pear shaped, as I was in a shop I could feel the phone pulsing
 via the vibration I recieved no call or text it was doing small pulses from the vibration feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I whiped it out and unlocked it but the screen stayed blank for about 1min then it finally came on and went back into key lock by its self???. I unlocked it again and the screen came on/off then finally on it had been doing it a few times in the past but
 not this bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to send a text and when I touched the screen to bring up the alpha keys it would not type anything it would show that I was hitting the keys but nothing was writing. I had to reboot the phone and it worked for 10mins, I took it into Vodafone and got
 it sent off to Nokia for repair I hope they repair it much better than what Sony Ericcson do last 2 phones from them have all failed to be fixed of there problems last 2yrs I had there mobiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to Nokia after 8yrs away because everyone now has a S.E, Samsung or iPhone.</p>

<p>If they do not repair it properly I will be taking Vodafone to trading standards because like I said over the last 5yrs I have nothing but trouble with phones from them dying around the 8 months mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They never get fixed properly and I'm getting a little fed up with it, I'll see how it turns out when I have to pick it up if then even try to offer me another lower model I'll be very ******** off.</p>

<p>Right they repaired the phone since it was sent out for a 2nd time to a advanced&nbsp;technican they replaced the complete screen and touch pad and now 3 days in&nbsp;i've had no issues with the ey lock and button pressing when texting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only small issue now&nbsp;the alarm clock is 4mins slow if I&nbsp;set it to&nbsp;3:45am it will go off at 3:49am instead I've set the time zone and searched&nbsp;google and a post came up on here but them owners has serious issues with it&nbsp;being 10-15mins out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have firmware v30 as Vodafone installed that but I swear before it ever causes my 1st lot of issues I downloaded&nbsp;fron Nokia&nbsp;voa PC Suite v21 of the firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now dont use the alarm clock just bought a cheap one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been using C5 for about 8 months now....my battery used to last for 3-4 days....but since I have been using internet applications on the phone....it hardly lasts a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess u too must be facing the shortage in battery life because of the same reason....</p>

<p>I used to have the same problem with short battery life (3-4days) of my Nokia C5-00 which bothered me for almost a year. I found in internet an application called Energy Profiler v1.23 which measures the consumed energy and shows it in a graphic. It is really
 awesome. Then I spotted that my phone consumes about 0.22W/h power for a period of 15s every 3 minutes. For comparison reasons it consumes about 0.09W/h when the display is active. So after some research of the applications I found out that this power consumption
 comes from the automatic updates of the software. By default the setting is ON. The path to it is:<br />
Home-&gt;Settings-&gt;SW Update-&gt;Options-&gt;Settings-&gt;Auto-check for updates-&gt;Off<br />
Here we go! After this setting is set to "off" my phone is working for 2 weeks with a single charge and it consumes less than a 0.01W/h in standby mode.</p>

                    <p>Does anyone have any help to offer as I have been constantly liaising with MS Support via email, live chat and phone and still I cannot reinstall and MS Support have not yet provided a link to do this which is valid.</p>

            Thanks Doug - however, when I use this link and choose HUP it only shows Windows 2011 and 2013, when I try and click on Office 2010 Account it shows: Make sure the web address
<span>https://buyoffice.microsoft.com </span>
is correct.&nbsp; Initially the page states:&nbsp;
<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.
<br />
HTTP Error 404 - File or directory not found.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Even though I am connected to the Internet so it's not a connectivity issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I proceeds to the option and choose&nbsp;Office 2010 Account - it shows page removed.&nbsp; I've reported this to MS Support and they have the same issue when taking control of my computer... then the only thing they can offer is additional warrant at $189 for
 one year to conduct further diagnostics!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            Dependent on your accounts reputation these are the limits<br />
<br />
The Hotmail limit for outgoing email messages is 300 (three hundred) messages per day. Maximum 100 per email.<br />
<br />
The limit is lower for new accounts and when Windows Live Hotmail has spotted what it deems suspicious activity<br />
(a large and sudden increase in outgoing messages may indicate your account has been taken over, for example)<br />
<br />
How Many To, Cc and Bcc Recipients Windows Live Hotmail Allows Per Message<br />
<br />
You can add up to 100 (one hundred) recipients per message in Windows Live Hotmail.
<br />
Again, suspicious activity can lead to a temporarily lower limit (as low as 10 (ten) recipients).<br />
<br />
If you’ve been notified that you have hit some limit on a Microsoft product, it’s almost certainly part of an effort to reduce spam.
<br />
You can also increase your limit simply by continuing to use Hotmail and other Hotmail services normally. &nbsp;<br />
It only takes a few days of normal activity to increase the limits—that gives us enough time to detect automated spam machines and accounts that have been hacked.
<br />
We’re constantly working to make things worse for spammers and better for real people.<br />
<br />
The send mail limit depends on your reputation within Hotmail. <br />
The system needs a few days to build your reputation. <br />
So, there are stricter limitations on new accounts or accounts that have engaged in activity that is representative of abusers sending spam.<br />
<br />
If you are a new user, a low sending quota is a temporary restriction and is upgraded to the maximum limit as soon as the user establishes credibility in the system.<br />
If you are an established user, recent account activity may have sent us a false alert.<br />
<br />
Note: Recipients is different from emails - 1 email with 5 recipients' counts as 5 emails, not 1.<br />
<br />
You can raise the limits by getting a one-time verification code sent to your mobile phone.
<br />

<h2>            battery drainage</h2>
                    Sometimes I forget to charge the battery during the night. On some ocasions I have left it on 90+ charged state and in the morning found it 30- Does the external memory consumes power while the device is off? My iPaq 111 with ext mem. SD 4Gb instructions
 do not mention this. Should I leave it unconnected?<br />

<p>If you are using a computer with a touch pad mouse device, it could be that you are inadvertently touching that device when taking a break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can reduce the sensitivity of the device, or use an external mouse and disable the touch pad.</p>
