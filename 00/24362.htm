<h2>            Is Skype blocking calls to 1-800 numbers from outside the US&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Skype community, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be able to call 1800 numbers in the US on Skype for free from outside the US (I am based in Europe). However, I just tried after a long time and it seems that this service is discontinued.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even more shocking is that I do have Skype balance and would like to access those numbers even if I have to pay. I can't go through at all. I am using both mobile and desktop platforms for SKype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS Skype now blocking access to 1800 numbers from outside the US?!</p>

<p>Nothing has changed in regards to toll-free support on Skype's end, as covered in the toll-free section of this FAQ:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I make a call in Skype?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, toll and toll-free number owners can restrict calls made from certain numbers/regions or made anonymously. This is often done for cost reasons (since someone pays the toll, when you do not) and to limit spam calls. Disabling or enabling Caller ID
 may resolve the issue, depending on how the call is being blocked on the remote end.</p>

    <title>Win 10 Technical Preview Upgrade Confusion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lv048  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Technical Preview Upgrade Confusion</h2>
                    I recently installed Win 10 Technical Preview on my Win 8.1 computer by downloading&nbsp;an ISO file and creating an installation DVD.&nbsp; Everything worked fine and I am now running Build 9841.&nbsp; After installation&nbsp;I took the time to go through the "Welcome to
 Tech Preview" information, and noted the recommendation to select "Fast" or "Slow" for future upgrades in Windows Update settings.&nbsp; In particular, the instructions state "Click
<span>Preview builds</span>, click the top list, and then select <span>
<span>Preview builds</span>, click the top list, and then select <span>
Fast</span> or <span>Slow</span>."&nbsp; However, when I follow the step-by-step instruction&nbsp;and reach the "Preview Builds" page, the referenced option for fast and slow does not appear.&nbsp; The only options I am given are to change the time when an upgrade
 will be installed and to check for upgrades.&nbsp; (I am in my Administrator account when I do this; I have verified that the account type is "Administrator".)&nbsp; I gather from browsing through Technical Preview&nbsp;Q&amp;A pages that if I were to select "Slow" that I would
 remain in Build 9841 until the next stable Build is released; if I were to select "Fast" I would be upgraded to Build 9879.&nbsp; However, as noted, I am not being given that choice on my Preview Builds page.&nbsp; Why not, and how can I fix this omission?&nbsp; For those
 of you who have suggested in other posts to go through the ISO installation process all over again to get Build 9879, it is not clear to me why I should have to do this.&nbsp; Per the "Welcome to Tech Preview" info,&nbsp;it sounds to me as though I should&nbsp;automatically
 receive a downloaded upgrade if I indicate that I would like "Fast" upgrades.&nbsp; Is this not correct?&nbsp; If it is, this brings me back to my question - why am I not being give the option to select Fast or Slow upgrades?

</p><p>For now, if you need to upgrade to a recent build such as build 9879, then its best you use the .ISO file for now or wait for tomorrows new build.

            <p>As I recall, build 9841 did not have the fast/slow option.&nbsp; That was introduced in build 9860, so it has only been used during the upgrade from there to 9879 so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit puzzled how come you've installed 9841 rather than 9879 if you've only installed recently.&nbsp; The 9879 ISOs have been available for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As others have said, wait until tomorrow (or soon thereafter) to install a brand new build.</p>

            as the 6230i is so old it is not supported by the NSU, you would need to refer back to the nokia care point to have the code reset... remember to back up your data 1st :)

<h2>            Formatting OneNote&#39;s layout</h2>
                    I've "upgraded" to Office 365 and it's been a nightmare.&nbsp; I was locked out of my computer (I've fixed this, but lost hours of my time), my Access no longer works and the layout of OneNote is unusable.&nbsp; How do I reconfigure OneNote's layout so that I can
 access sections?&nbsp; They used to be shown vertically and I could scroll down to see them all.&nbsp; They are now showing up horisontally across the top and I have no way of scrolling sideways, so the program is unusable to me.&nbsp; I appreciate your help.

<p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know if you have attempted to update the Office application and check if the issue persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an Office application such as Word or OneNote isn't working correctly, sometimes restarting it will resolve the problem. If that does not work, you may attempt to repair the application. When you're done, you might need to restart your computer. Here's
 how to repair an Office application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button, and select <strong>Programs and Features
</strong>on the pop-up menu.</li><li>Right-click the Microsoft Office product you want to repair, and select <strong>
Change</strong>.</li><li>From the <strong>How would you like to repair your Office Programs </strong>screen, select
<strong>Online Repair </strong>to make sure everything gets fixed, and then select
<strong>Repair</strong>. The <strong>Quick Repair </strong>option is also available, which runs faster but only detects and then replaces corrupted files.</li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete.</li></ol>

<h2>            Word 2013 crashes when trying to open file from internet</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am having lots of problems opening files from Outlook. Initially, files would open in protected mode, which was annoying and useless. As soon as I wanted to edit the file, I would click "enable editing" and word would crash. Then I disabled Protected mode
 for all internet / email files. Now whenever i try to open any word file from any email client, it crashes instantly. Even if I save the file, then through properties "unblock" the file, then try to open it, it still crashes. This basically makes word useless
 to me as I work from home, so I constantly need to use files "from the internet" (in otherwords, from my colleagues...)<br />
<br />
What can I do to prevent this - it is making work impossible for me!<br />

            Are you saying that you have no problem at all opening files that were initially created on your computer's hard drive? If you send a local file as an e-mail attachment to yourself, then can you open that file?<br />
<br />
Is there something special about those files that your colleagues send? Content? File size?

<p>When I attempted to activate MS Office 2007 for my netbook, a dialogue box popped up, stating that the limit for the activation code has exceeded. However, my dad did not install the program on three computers. Therefore, he did not exceed the limit, so
 now, I'm in need of help.</p>
<p>If you're able to assist me in this issue, then I'd like to thank you for doing so.</p>

<h2>            Opening smime.p7s file</h2>
                    <p>Hello there. I have recently received a file with .p7s extension. I found out, that Outlook should be able to open it, but whenever I try to open it, the Outlook option won't show up.<br />
<br />
I tried to look for answers on internet, but with no success. When I right-click on the file and click on 'open with' the only option is "Crypto Shell Extensions". There I have installed the certificate for it, but still can't open it. If I click on open with
 something else, Outlook is not listed there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Outlook VBA runtime error 7 &#58; out of memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alpha456  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook VBA runtime error 7 &#58; out of memory</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a macro in Outlook 2010 that uses a four-dimensional "string" array with each dimension being 99, so quite large when you multiply it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was, nonetheless, using it without problems on a laptop running Windows 7 with 4 GB of RAM. I now have a new laptop (also running Windows 7) with 12 GB of RAM and keep getting runtime error 7 (Out of memory). Sometimes, this occurs even if opening Outlook
 and running this macro is the first thing I do after starting the laptop. Other times, it works for part of the day and then the error occurs. If I close Outlook and re-open it, the macro works fine for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate that rewriting the macro to avoid using such a large array might be the best long-term solution, can anyone suggest a solution&nbsp;to the memory problem, since there is clearly enough memory available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in&nbsp;advance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I normally work&nbsp;in Excel, but that doesn't seem like all that large a array to me- I wouldn't expect problems just based on the array size (although I don't know what size your strings are)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post the code- even if your immediate solution is to stick with the large array, there may be other areas where your existing approach might cause a memory leak- hard to tell if you don't share the code.</p>

            <p>I didn't post the code because</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; there are hundreds of lines of it in lots of subroutines and forms; </p>
<p>b.&nbsp; this macro worked fine on a much lower spec machine; and</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; the macro works fine on the new machine after Outlook has been closed and re-started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no expert, but it seems most likely that the problem is something to do with Outlook / VBA&nbsp;being blocked from using the available memory (of which there is lots). When I restart Outlook, as I said in my original post, I can run this macro lots and lots
 of times without any trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have perhaps posted this question in the wrong place, but it wasn't clear to me WHERE to post it. Any suggestions on that would be very welcome.</p>
<p>

            What you describe rather suggests it has to do with what you put into that array, which might be different on the computers.

<p>a.&nbsp;the contents of the array are identical on both computers;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to spend however long it would take to sort out which bits of the code to post when, for the reasons I've already given, this problem is almost certainly not being caused by the code itself but by Outlook's interaction with the memory on the
 new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's therefore please call this thread closed. Unless I find the answer, in which case I will post it here. I may just reinstall Outlook and see if that solves the problem.</p>

            <p>Sorry we couldn't be of more help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will mention that&nbsp;while I was at&nbsp;my last employer, an Outlook update was released that newly&nbsp;limited the number of draft emails that could be open simultaneously.&nbsp;Older PCs continued to work just fine, but newer PCs (or any that auto-updated) suddenly
 started having problems. Not fun to troubleshoot...&nbsp;we spent over a week re-installing user accounts, checking the Exchange server settings, etc. before realizing what MS had changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The fact that the macro works again after restarting the machine adds additional support to the theory that the code has a memory leak *in the new environment* (not necessarily the result of a programming "error").</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing that comes to mind- now that you've&nbsp;mentioned that your macro includes forms- I'd also check to see if your forms contain any&nbsp;ActiveX controls. It sounds like the program has been around a while,&nbsp;back when ActiveX controls were more popular...
 but&nbsp;(with Office updates) they can also&nbsp;wreck all sorts of havoc without it being easy to tell what is&nbsp;to blame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck, and please post a follow-up if you do identify the&nbsp;root cause. You may save someone else the same headache when they search and find your thread.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            All Downloads Identified as Having a Virus &#47; Deleted</h2>
                    <p>Every file I try to download is flagged as having a virus and is then deleted. The files include a .pdf file from irs.gov, a .csv file from a national pharmacy, a .pdf file from an insurance company, etc. The problem occurs whether I'm using Microsoft Edge
 or Chrome. I thought McAfee might be the issue so uninstalled that program letting Windows Defender take over security duties, first doing a scan that disclosed no viruses. The problem continues. I had Windows Defender scan for viruses, but none were detected.
 I can open .pdf files that were previously downloaded or that can be viewed within the browser window. These files will all download to my Fire tablet or Android phone without a problem, but not to my laptop. I've tried composing a new message in Hotmail and
 attaching a PowerPoint file from my hard drive. I receive the file fine and the slides display properly in my email account; however, when I choose the Download option, I again get an error message saying the file contained a virus and was deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if every file on my own hard drive was infected with a virus, it seems unlikely that every file, regardless of file type, from every website I've visited is infected with a virus that isn't identified by my tablet or Android phone. I believe all my
 software is up to date. I am beyond frustrated! Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>I have the same issue. It's impossible to download Malwarebytes as some have suggested because, as you've noted, nothing will download successfully. The files, whether .pdf, .exe. or .jpg, always seem to download, get to Security Scan, then display the error
 message about the file containing a virus and being deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't an Avast problem. I was using McAfee Security Suite when the problem occurred. No problems were disclosed by McAfee during a full scan. I next uninstalled McAfee and had Windows Defender do a full scan. Again, no issues were identified, but the
 problem continues regardless of which browser is used. The computer otherwise is functioning normally.&nbsp;</p>

            I found a semi-solution to my very similar problem. While I can't download files from a browser on my pc, I can move or copy them from a mobile device via USB connection . You should try this solution to see if it helps your problem a bit.

<p>Go to the McAfee site and get their uninstalling software and completely remove all of the McAfee code.</p>
<p>Then download Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>Also get the Avast uninstall software software and uninstall Avast.</p>
<p>just uninstalling in Programs and Features does not remove all of the code from the computer and this code is what causes problems.</p>

<p>Like what was the error number.</p>
<p>If it was 80240020 try this,&nbsp; if other search through this forum;</p>
<p>Grammatik&nbsp; replied on July 29,2015<br />
<br />
This worked for me after the update&nbsp; tried to install but failed, and I got error message&nbsp; 80240020.&nbsp; I was upgrading from Win 7 Pro through the reserved copy showing in my taskbar. I found it by searching google for the error message and then on a&nbsp; reddit
 subpage. <br />
<br />
https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/3eyrre/fix_for_the_80240020_error_when_trying_to_install/<br />
<br />
The Reddit page says:<br />
<br />
"What this error means is, your Windows 10 installation folder is unfinished and/or corrupted. Now, how do you fix that?<br />
1. Go into "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and delete everything in that folder.<br />
2. Now, run the command prompt as an administrator. Type in "wuauclt.exe /updatenow".<br />
3. Go to your Control Panel &gt; Windows Update and your Windows 10 should start re-downloading from scratch, hopefully without flaws this time."</p>

    <title>Aligning two X axis&#39;s, that have a non-linear relationship - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daranrudnick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aligning two X axis&#39;s, that have a non-linear relationship</h2>
                    <p>I have created a graph with two x axis and one y axis, but I am having trouble aligning the two x axis’s. The problem is that there is a non-linear relationship between the two x axis, so when I plot them independently, with respect to
 the y axis, they do not line up. I suspect writing a macro would be appropriate, but all tutorials I have found assume a linear relationship, so they just adjust the max and min value. I need to fix the max and min values, but adjust the inter tick marks of
 the secondary axis, so they&nbsp;appropriately&nbsp;line up with the primary x axis. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Thank you all for your replies.
<div><br />
<div>Mike, your understanding of the problem is correct. There are two separate, but linked, data series, that I am wanting to plot on the same XY graph. Through much work, I have decided not to display the data with two x - axis; however I found an alternative
 way to display the relationship.&nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Prior to installation of Office 2016, I was able to attach labels to data points in an Excel scatter plot by inserting the following code into a module sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>Sub AttachLabelsToPoints()

   'Dimension variables.
   Dim Counter As Integer, ChartName As String, xVals As String

   ' Disable screen updating while the subroutine is run.
   Application.ScreenUpdating = False

   'Store the formula for the first series in "xVals".
   xVals = ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Formula

   'Extract the range for the data from xVals.
   xVals = Mid(xVals, InStr(InStr(xVals, ","), xVals, _
      Mid(Left(xVals, InStr(xVals, "!") - 1), 9)))
   xVals = Left(xVals, InStr(InStr(xVals, "!"), xVals, ",") - 1)
   Do While Left(xVals, 1) = ","
      xVals = Mid(xVals, 2)
   Loop

   'Attach a label to each data point in the chart.
   For Counter = 1 To Range(xVals).Cells.Count
     ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Points(Counter).HasDataLabel = _
         True
      ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Points(Counter).DataLabel.Text = _
         Range(xVals).Cells(Counter, 1).Offset(0, -1).Value
   Next Counter

End Sub</code></pre>
<p>This no longer works. When I attempt to use the same code in Excel 2016, I get a syntax error pop up message and this is highlighted yellow in the code:</p>
Sub AttachLabelsToPoints()<br />
<br />
<p>Not sure if there is another code out specific to Excel 2016. If not, does anyone know of another option where you can attach labels to points? It seems like it should be a basic option in Excel...</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create a simple form<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a601c34f-5060-41f9-946f-582635ae5890?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a601c34f-5060-41f9-946f-582635ae5890?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and a branching strategy for it</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f488cfbe-8307-43e4-809f-a450ddcdfd56?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f488cfbe-8307-43e4-809f-a450ddcdfd56?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>but then when I select the first option the form should go to question 2 but it shows the two other options</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e878381-5965-4bf3-9a0e-2790dad7b737?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e878381-5965-4bf3-9a0e-2790dad7b737?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>selecting the second option works fine</p>

<div>We understand that your concern about the result of this feature. In<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-branching-in-Microsoft-Forms-16634fda-eddb-44da-856d-6a8213f0d8bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this article</a>, it says that
 questions appear only if they are relevant to the responder. If the questions don't apply, the responder is redirected to a different set of questions or will skip a set of questions altogether.</div>
<div>
<p>The question won’t show if it is the last question in branch. That means branch can’t direct to next question so that’s why the rest questions will show up. It will show other unrelated questions when the branch goes end.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my picture below, I set branching like this: <span>Option 1 of Question 1 go to Question 1, Option 1 of Question 2 go to Question 4, Option 1 of Question 4 go to Question 5</span>. Then I select in the preview, the rest question will show up
 when I click&nbsp; Question 4. That means the end in branch, so rest questions will appear.

<a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">subscription page</a> to check whether a license called
<strong>Visio Pro for Office 365</strong> is listed. If yes, you can go to the <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
software page</a> to install the Visio client. For more information, you can refer to the following article.</p>

<h3> fred.fredex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 insider--my win10 gave &#34;side-by-side information&#34; errors, now boots only to diagnostic&#47;repair screens.</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I was working in WSL on porting a program from Linux when all of a sudden the computer started putting up an error dialog for every command I entered, saying something about "side-by-side information" being incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I started working on it, I believe it was build 16199, but after I started having those problems, the screen sh owed build 14xxx (where I don't remember the xxx part, I didn't write it down).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After fighting with it for a while I decided to reboot, and now it won't reboot, it keeps "preparing automatic repair" and "diagnosing your system" and other such stuff. then it offers "restart" or "advanced", advanced offers "reset" or "advanced options".
 one option there is to go to a restore point. it shows one restore point, so I restore to it and after rebooting it offers the same options again. it still shows the same restore point&nbsp; available, and trying it again makes no difference. It offers "startup
 settings" and "system repair" neither of which fixes it so it will actually start up windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't seem to have a restore image--at least not one I can find. thought I had made one but it's hiding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to a command prompt from that spot, but what would I look for or change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to suggestions here, thanks in adavnce!</p>
<p>

<p>Try running <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>, but you need the right switches to point to your "offline" Windows install. Check if Windows still shows on drive C: in that mode. Sometimes it moves to other drive letter, such as D:. Once you find it:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">sfc /scannow /offbootdir=C:\ /offwindir=C:\Windows &lt;-- use the drive letter you find Windows on.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I don't know if it is possible that your Restore Point took you all the way back to 14xxx builds, but if you are back on some build prior to 15063 (14393 was the previous public build) you can download the 15063 public ISO and upgrade
 to it (assuming that you can actually boot to the old Windows version after repair).</p>

<p>Don, thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It reported build 14xxx BEFORE I tried the restorepoint. I tried t he restorpoint only after it failed to reboot. The date/time on the restore point was listed as being only a few hours previous to the time I tried to restore it. Dunno where it came from,
 I hadn't made it (intentionally) and I think the last automatic update had been a day or two earlier. (I could be wrong).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I've run sfc /scannow as you described, turned out to be D: I needed. it reports</p>
<p>
</p><p>"...did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded Windows10_InsiderPreview_Client_x64_en-us_16193.iso, so if only I could get windows to boot I could try doing an update/install of that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a 16199 iso for download, is it up somewhere I can reach?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If is such a wishy-washy word. "If wishes were horses, beggars would ride", as my wife likes to say.</p>

<p>16199 is not available as an ISO download. Some users have used scripts to make their own 16199 ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any specific error when you try to boot? Maybe you just need to rebuild your System partition. Since Windows showed on D: I am suspecting that you are on an MBR-initialized disk on a Legacy BIOS PC? or is your PC in UEFI BIOS mode and using a
 GPT-initialized disk layout?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your Command Prompt, try running:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootsect /nt60 ALL /force /mbr</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bcdboot D:\Windows</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then restart and see if Windows will boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>thanks for the further reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't try your suggestion til I get home, but in the meantime I'll attempt to answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is running in a VM&nbsp; on VirtualBox, on a Linux host.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it is a normal MBR partition, and not EFI, as far as I remember, I just ran the ISO inside the newly-created VM, and took whatever it gave me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>re the particular build, I did download 16193, so if I can get to where I could install it, it would then be easy (or should be, one hopes) to upgrade to 16199 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>further news once I've had a chance to follow your advice.</p>

            The dism command specifically addresses the side by side folder.&nbsp; The two solutions address different things so it doesn't matter when you use it.

<p>If you try the /StartComponentCleanup repair before you are able to boot Windows, you would need to run it on your offline Windows with a modified Command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows still appears on D:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">DISM /Image:D:\ /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you setup the VirtualBox VM, you would have had to choose between a Legacy BIOS mode and a UEFI virtual machine. In Hyper-V, they describe these as Generation 1 (Legacy BIOS) or Generation 2 (UEFI) VM's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With an MBR disk (Legacy BIOS) the System partition is by default also the Recovery partition (contains a file Winre.wim, used to launch Windows RE). This is the source of the Windows RE OS that you are still able to run from the Repair menu and get a Command
 Prompt. It creates and then runs from a RAM disk (drive X:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a GPT disk, it is quite simple to entirely delete and recreate the System partition, since there is nothing else on it. With an MBR disk you have to repair that partition, or if you want to replace it, you need to preserve a copy of the winre.wim to put
 back after you have replaced the partition.</p>

<p>Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ran the DISM command as you suggested and it did something, took a few seconds and appeared to be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I then ran the two commands you gave earlier, the bootsect and bcdboot (with the options you showed). they both appeared to be successful.</p>

    <title>Changing Line Spacing in TOC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogwoodnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Line Spacing in TOC</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2007, we've been using pretty basic table-of-contents (TOC) coding, with a few switches.&nbsp; Our current code is TOC \o "1-4" \h \z \u \t.&nbsp; Until now, it has done what we've wanted!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we want to keep that as our default TOC format, a customer has requested a slightly modified version.&nbsp; Our normal TOC has 6 pt line spacing both above and below each line; the custom one needs to have 0 pt both above and below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a "TOC compact" style based on TOC1&nbsp;-- and when first applied, it looks great.&nbsp; However, if I update the field (right-click&gt;Update fields, whole table), the style reverts to the underlying TOC1 style; there's no mention of "TOC Compact" any more
 in the style characteristics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried modifying the line spacing on the underlying TOC1 style, but it was grayed out.&nbsp; (I didn't really want to do that anyway, since our normal TOC needs to remain as is.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to be able to select a customized TOC format for one particular document, short of changing the default paragraph style, the default TOC style, etc?&nbsp; It looks like we may have more and more customers who want the custom format, so it would
 be really beneficial to be able to easily select it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, you do run that risk with a long TOC. One workaround I'd suggest is to put a Next Page section break between the TOC and the start of the document proper, and restart the page numbering of the second section at 1. Then the page numbers in the document
 body will be independent of the number of pages in the TOC (and any other frontmatter). See
<a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/NumberingFrontMatter.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/NumberingFrontMatter.htm</a>.<br />
<br />
If your customer objects to that workaround, the alternative is to modify the definition of the TOC1 style in that customer's document after the document is created from a standard template. If you leave the "Only in this document" option selected at the bottom
 of the Modify Style dialog, <b>and uncheck the Automatically update box</b>, the style in the template won't be affected and the style won't be "refreshed" from the template.<br />
<br />
You said "I tried modifying the line spacing on the underlying TOC1 style, but it was grayed out." Exactly what was grayed out? And were you trying this in the document or in the template? (It should be done in the document.)<br />

            Your TOC1 style should be particular to that document - not global. You should be able to change it without making any changes to other documents or to your other non-TOC styles in your document.<br />
<br />
This is unless you for some reason tell Word to change your template.<br />

<p>Hi Yuan,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your details. As this situation happens after the OS updating, it is not related to Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried re-install this thired party software? If it does not work, I think you should continue contacting the software support to move on the issue. May be there is some compatibility issue for this software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

<h3> mikeinflorida  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2019 with Gmail is creating duplicate emails in All Mail folder when I click on new &#34;Archive Button&#34; in ribbon</h2>
                    <p>I got a new computer with Windows 10 Pro and started using Outlook Home and Business 2019 along with Gmail set up as IMAP However Outlook 2019 is creating duplicate emails in Gmail's "All Mail" folder when I click on new "Archive Button" in ribbon to archive
 Gmail messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I keep Outlook 2019 from duplicating Gmails in All Mail folder automatically? I do not want to auto delete them with the "Delete Button" in the ribbon. I just want archive them like I used to into Gmails All Mail folder (label).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was previously using Office Pro 2010 with Win 7 and never had this issue.</p>

            When the All Mail folder is in Outlook, you'll end up with duplicates when you move mail around - its the nature of how gmail labels become imap folders. Try this: right click on a folder and choose IMAP folders then unsubscribe All mail.

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but I need the "All Mail" folder access thru Outlook at all times, since I refer to it often. So that suggestion won't work for me since I don't want to have to log into Gmail online to access the All Mail folder every time I need
 to refer to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Outlook 2019 is different, but I never had this issue with Outlook 2010. I simply deleted an email and it went right to the Gmail All Mail folder (label) since that was the folder I had set up for deleted emails. So I would hope that there
 is way to do the same either with the delete button or the new archive buttons in the ribbon. (Or by setting up a different way, however in the more settings, the new Outlook 2019 version doesn't give that opportunity to direct where deleted emails go (to
 a specific folder.) That tab is now missing in more settings. I assumed it was because they added the new Archive button in the ribbon, which should have taken its place and acted in the same manner. But apparently doesn't. It creates duplicate emails instead
 in All Mail.</p>

<p>Once again. Thank you for reply. However I have already been at that section pasted above. It is not have the same option what I was looking for as in Outlook 2010 which let me choose which folder the deleted messages were moved to. Above and what you are
 referring to, are just the specific folders that are included with send/receive. I was actually trying to find the extra tab called "Deleted Items" in "More Settings" that was located in Email "Account Settings" that is no longer included with Outlook 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second print screen is actually from Outlook 2010. That is what I was looking for, but don't think it exists in Outlook 2019</p>

            Correct, the TechNet article is about the changes and the new simplified dialog they rolled out last summer/faall. Do you see the same dialog if you go through control panel, mail to access the old dialog with more setting? It should be the same, but is worth checking. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, it looks like an issue with the specific build. I know at one point they didn't include the tabs to choose the folders. (And you have Advanced, I don't). I'll check with support on it.

<p>Thanks. (I think I am just stuck.) I may have to just manually delete duplicates each week so my Gmail account size doesn't double!)</p>
<p>I have tried a bunch of different things. That is why I am very reluctant to upgrade to newer Microsoft versions when things were working perfectly fine before. In addition to the extra cost, the new Microsoft versions always seems to cause bugs I didn't
 have before and the benefits of the new versions are very minor and insignificant to me personally! It is very time consuming, non-productive, and very frustrating to try to resolve new issues. Example: I have just upgraded to Windows 10 Pro on a new computer
 from Windows 7 on my old computer and I have been having additional issues with Windows 10 as well. Mouse and keyboard just stop working intermittently. I have tried tons of things to get this resolved and also had Dell Pro Support help as well. So much time
 spent and not sure it is even resolved since it is an intermittent problem. (Anyway that is a totally different subject. No need to address that here.)</p>

<br />That is why I am very reluctant to upgrade to newer Microsoft versions when things were working perfectly fine before.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Completely understandable. Why break what ain't broke? :) I have a few clients still on Outlook 2010 but I'm familiar enough with how they work to know they shouldn't upgrade. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Mouse and keyboard just stop working intermittently
<br />Are they Bluetooth? I'm having the same problem (on a much older Dell). Bluetooth is often disabled in Device manager. I switched to a wireless Logitech mouse so i could do things without the keyboard - like sign in using the onscreen keyboard then go into device manager and remove Bluetooth then check for new hardware to bring bluetooth back to life. A couple of weeks ago, Bluetooth completely disappeared so I bought a little Bluetooth dongle on Amazon. The day it arrived, the built-in Bluetooth came back to life and (so far) its working trouble-free. If it is disabled again, I'll try the dongle.

<div>
<div><b>Lion Repair Utilities.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>In Lion, there is an additional Repair Permissions application utility hidden away. This tool is located inside boot Repair Utilities. Here's how to access it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1 Restart Lion and hold down the Command and R keys.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2 You will boot into the Repair Utilities screen. On top, in the Menu Bar click the Utilities item then select Terminal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3 In the Terminal window, type resetpassword and hit Return.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4 The Password reset utility launches, but you¹re not going to reset the password. Instead, click on the icon for your Mac's hard drive at the top. From the drop-down below it, select the user account where you are having issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;5 At the bottom of the window, you'll see an area labeled 'Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs'. Click the Reset button there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reset process takes a couple of minutes. When it¹s done, quit the programs you've opened and restart your Mac. Notice that 'Spotlight' starts re-indexing immediately.</div>

            Impossible to say without seeing the code. Where did the macros come from? If a windows machine it is quite possible that the macros won't run unless they were specifically designed with the Macintosh in mind.<br />

            Since our device is eligible I guess we have to wait. But from what I read many people have serious issues after the upgrade, with their contacts and other problems and I think that maybe this delay is on our favor, so Microsoft has the time to make this
 update more stable. In my country we say that every obstacle is for a good purpose.
