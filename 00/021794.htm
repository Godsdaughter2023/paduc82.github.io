<h2>            Appointment times spontaneously shifting to different time zone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having some trouble with some recurring appointments spontaneously shifting to be 2 hours later in my calendar.&nbsp; I have not changed it anywhere -- it just starts displaying as 2 hours later than it really is.&nbsp; When I look at the scheduled time,
 it has not changed, but a different time zone has been added.&nbsp; I am not able to change the time zone for the appointment --&nbsp;even those that I have scheduled for myself.&nbsp; So...I may have a recurring appointment at 1:00 PM EDT.&nbsp; All of a sudden, it starts displaying
 in my calendar as 3:00 PM EDT.&nbsp; But when I look at the the time of the appointment, it still says 1:00 PM, but it has added "(GMT-05:00) Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada)" to the time.</p>
<p>My time zone setting has not changed.</p>
<p>What is going on?&nbsp; It's inconsistent and does not happen to all of my appointments.&nbsp; They don't all shift --&nbsp;only one or two shift at a time.&nbsp; The only way I've been able to fix it is to delete the appoinment and enter a new one.&nbsp; This is a problem when
 it's an appointment request from someone else for a recurring meeting.&nbsp; But it's getting to the point that I can't trust my calendar.</p>
<p>I do have a Droid and syncs with the Microsoft Exchange calendar, but I do not make changes to these appointments on the Droid, but only look at them.</p>
<p>Our TIS group doesn't know what's going on. Help!&nbsp;</p>

            What time zone is the driod set for? Problems like this are almost always the result of&nbsp;a 2 way sync and one sync has the wrong&nbsp;zone setting. &nbsp;

<p>Thanks for responding!&nbsp; My Droid is set at GMT-4:00, Eastern Daylight Time.&nbsp; That's correct.&nbsp; And if my Droid was the wrong time zone, wouldn't all of my appointments on my&nbsp;Droid seem wrong?&nbsp; They all agree with my Outlook.&nbsp; I do do a two-way sync, but I
 never edit the recurring appts. on the Droid.&nbsp; I just doesn't work.</p>
<p>And why are only random appointments shifting?&nbsp; It's not like everything in my calendar shifts -- just one or two at a time.</p>

            We are having the same problem with one of our users here at work.&nbsp; Only her reoccurring appointments shift, usually by 4 hours.&nbsp; Her droid &amp; outlook &amp; computer are all set to the same time zone.&nbsp; She syncs with her droid.&nbsp; Was there a solution to this

            <p>I'm having this same problem, I sync with an Android phone (HTC Inspire 4G).&nbsp; Any word on what's causing it / how to fix it?&nbsp; I had this problem before and deleted the appointment from my calendar,&nbsp;I then&nbsp;re-entered my own version of it.&nbsp; However this means
 I don't get updates from the organizer automatically.&nbsp; I switched from an iPhone to the Android, and &nbsp;if I'm not mistaken the first time this occurred I was still using the iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has only happened to me 2 times, and both were with recurring daily appointments.&nbsp; Now that I think of it they were both scheduled at 9:00 ET at the time of their respective&nbsp;error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>These issues are always the result of time zones, usually the zone is different on one computer or device.
</p>
<p>What was the time difference? Does the appointment span Standard and daylight times?

            "Always" is an absolute and in this case wrong.

<h2>            activeX and macros no longer working in powerpoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have a powerpoint .pptm file I used last year. It contains macros based on activeX controls that use VBA to open a blank slide while projecting, change the color of the pen, and other useful features. It stopped working when I tried it today. Also, I tried
 to build a new slide show with activeX controls, but I keep getting error messages and can't place the controls on the slide. I check excel, and while I can insert form controls, activeX controls also don't work, giving an error "Cannot insert object". At
 first I thought that maybe visual basic was broken, but an example file with visual basic code but without activeX worked fine, and I was able to create my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the powerpoint slides for teaching. Any ideas how I can get the functionality back?</p>

<h2>            OneNote SkyDrive sync Error 0xE4010668</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I was able to successfully sync until today. Now I keep getting error 0xE4010668.<br />
<br />
Even creating a new notebook on SkyDrive called Test, with a simple default section and one page doesn't work. The notebook gets created on SkyDrive and I can see it from the web interface, but it is empty and when I try to sync I get the above error.<br />
<br />
The only difference between today and yesterday is that I just installed the Live sign-in helper that was suggested by my OneNote 2010.<br />
<br />
should I uninstall it ?<br />

            Effectively, the issue came up when I installed "Windows Live ID sign-in assistant" as suggested by OneNote 2010 itself. As soon as I removed this seemingly additional piece of junkware, everything was synching fast and successful again.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have just realised my auto update for Office 365 for Mac has actually never updated! &nbsp;I am still on Version 2011, 14.7.7. &nbsp;When I checked that auto update was turned on, it is supposedly active, but when I click on 'check for updates' I only get the message
 that it can't reach the update server.</p>
<p>I am not a skilled technician, and I need help to get my 365 version updated, because my Mac is warning me the pending switch to 64 bit will mean the Office suite will no longer work. &nbsp;But I still need to be able to edit existing documents.</p>
<p>I gather this is going to require me to uninstall the whole suite then reinstall. &nbsp;How do I do that?</p>
<p>All assistance appreciated.</p>

            Hello Donald !
<br />
<br />If your using Windows 10 (might work in others versions as well)  type in the start menu "Choose default app by file type" Then, scroll down until CSV files, then Change the default app to Excel.  
<br />
<br />Now , all files in CSV format will open in Excel
<br />
<br />Hope it helps !<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1268973c-0e61-42c2-8521-4d0b81a87d48?upload=true" />

<h2>            N95 8GB Video Problem - Stopping at 37&#126; min.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I've been having this problem ever since I got my cellphone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some full-length movies on my device but the video always stops between 36 and 37min.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the audio continues, the screen just turns greyish. Until this, the videos work perfectly</p>
<p>and on the computer they function full length, I converted them using the video manager too so there</p>
<p>shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Any idea what I could do about that..?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Look at the router settings, consider flashing it and resetting the admin login password for the router (not the wep key), if it is still set at default. If you still have issues, consider a Win10 clean install/reset (again), if the recommendations, below,
 do not resolve your issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be cautious of any email with links to your provider. &nbsp;Popular websites or their advertising partners can become infected, never click on the agree or cancel or any other option that pops up on a web page (unless you are very familiar with it), close the
 browser; &nbsp;if you cannot control/close the browser, restart the computer and do not restore the previous browser session, if asked when reopening the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a desired 3rd party(non-Microsoft) program/app, please refer to their support to resolve compatibility issues in win8/10, or other versions of Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider reviewing the following, and running the bleepingcomputer tools, and malwarebytes:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>For the protection of what is important (if win8/10):</p>
<p>Make sure your FileHistory backup is up-to-date (right click start, control panel, FileHistory-Turn it On). (it requires a usb external harddrive (Windows 8/10 will, automatically, create the FileHistory folder on the usb drive, when FileHistory is turned
 On); &nbsp;or network harddrive can be used (make a 'FileHistory' folder on the Network Harddrive to connect the app to).... If you keep things in non-standard places, make new Libraries, and add the folders to your custom Libraries. Check to see where quicken
 , printer scan-to folders, or any other user installed software is saving data. &nbsp;(You can backup quicken/intuit programs to a OneDrive folder, but&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;let database files reside in OneDrive; &nbsp;although, they can be included in Libraries (and probably
 already are), they will not backup when open. &nbsp;(some (other) databases can not be restored easily from raw data alone).</p>
<p>see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/libraries-faq#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/libraries-faq#1TC=windows-8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you suspect malicious activity or malware (in any version of windows) use these tools from bleepingcomputer (they are relatively quick): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/</a>&nbsp;(the
 other two (2) suggested tools are on the bottom of that page), like rkill (1), jrt [junkware removal tool] (2), and adwcleaner (3) (run all of them, in that sequence)(i put them on the desktop, and run them from there)(as administrator (right click))(if they
 get hung (10 min) for any reason, close the running tool, go to the next tool, after trying them all, if any are unsuccessful, re-run them again (in sequence) in safe mode; &nbsp;also run Malwarebytes, while in safe mode during this process (if its definitions
 are updated), before adwcleaner. &nbsp;Uninstall adwcleaner, after running it and the system has rebooted, by opening the program, and choosing the uninstall button, or its quarantined files may set off your antivirus. The other tools from bleepingcomputer can
 be safely deleted, after running them; they are updated often, so the old versions are not necessary. After running the tools, if they found anything,&nbsp;<em>you need to reset
<strong>all</strong> your browsers to default</em>, then check for any unfamiliar plugin/addins within the browser. then run malwarebytes &nbsp;again.</p>
<p>in a lot of instances, &nbsp;you have to remove the malicious activity one layer at a time, so you may not want to delete the tools after the first run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Malwarebytes (Free):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/</a><br />
</p>
<p>uncheck the box at the end of the install for trial, or convert to free at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebyes is a good addition to your antivirus software.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure in Malwarebytes the 'Scan for rootkits' box is checked-&gt; Settings-Detection and Protection</strong>. &nbsp;Free means manual, so, you have to open it, and run it occasionally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>geek uninstaller can help to uninstall programs that are unusual, it works on 32-bit and x64 programs (and it stays free)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download</a></p>
<p>only get the free version.</p>
<p>right click on the program in geek, will let you force uninstall, without running the apps native uninstaller (only use the force method, if the installed program is malicious, or will not uninstall normally).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try HerdProtect (free), &nbsp;<a href="http://www.herdprotect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.herdprotect.com/</a>&nbsp; ,be watchful of false positives, only remove unchecked items at the end (by putting a check in the box), if they reside in a
 temp type folder or you are sure about them, remember to run it again in a few hrs(per mfg instructions). &nbsp;I, generally, recommend uninstalling HerdProtect, &nbsp;after a few weeks, as it's cache gets large fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Pre-installed or user previously installed antivirus may inhibit the current antivirus (even a current norton installation), use the mfg removal tools to completely remove them, if they were ever on your system.***<br />
</p>
<p>Use the mfg removal tools to completely remove them, after running the uninstall in Programs and features see:</p>

<p>use free version only-for personal use</p>
<p>This tool (cryptoprevent) does not run in the back ground, it automatically changes registry settings (some recommended by Microsoft), but it does update occasionally, so check it for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe change the default dns servers of the network adapter or router (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are google dns servers).</p>
<p>You can not bypass your internet provider's setup page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the default login password (not the wireless key), on the router.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 will not open downloaded files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theahutcheson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 will not open downloaded files</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Office 2016 on two different computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first, files open just fine when downloading from sites or emails. On the second, I consistently get errors on trying to open downloaded Excel and Word files that are XLSX or DOCX files.&nbsp; Word claims they are corrupt or there is an issues with the
 permissions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I email them and open them on the other computer, they open just fine. But resending them to the second computer does not solve the problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2016 on the second computer as advised, but it did not solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open any file that is resident on the computer just fine. I can also open any .doc or .xls file from a thumbdrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How can I import the &#39;pst&#39; file in to the Hotmail Email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keyur madhusudan shah  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I import the &#39;pst&#39; file in to the Hotmail Email account in Outlook 2013&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two calendars, one Hotmail email account &amp; people (contacts), all in Outlook 2013, which is&nbsp;installed on my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since I wished to migrate from my desktop PC to a laptop, I did the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;first exported the data (i.e. the emails, calendars &amp; contacts, including all subfolders) of my Outlook 2013&nbsp;to/as a 'pst' file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I uninstalled the Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013 software from my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thereafter installed the Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013 software in my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I&nbsp;configured the Hotmail email account whilst installing the Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013 software in my laptop,&nbsp;the 'pst' file could not be imported in to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I did not configure the Hotmail email account whilst installing the Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013 software&nbsp;in my laptop I could import the 'pst' file in the Outlook Data File folder. However, this information could not be imported in
 the Hotmail email account folder. It could only be imported in to the Outlook Data File folder&nbsp;which does not allow the data/information&nbsp;to sync with my mobile thru' the said Hotmail email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is - how can I import the 'pst' file in to the Hotmail Email account in Outlook 2013?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Keyur,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note, if any data is exported as a PST file it cannot be imported and merged with the Hotmail/Outlook account as Hotmail account uses an OST file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How were the calendar and contacts information arranged on the old computer? Did you have the Calendar and Contacts data arranged in a PST file, separate from your Hotmail account
 folder? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case the calendar/s were part of the Hotmail account on the old computer, check if you can find the calendar/s in your Hotmail account folder after the Hotmail account has completed
 syncing with the server on the new computer? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the above and let us know.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.

<h2>            Nokia N86 &#47; E71 email app help</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have got a Nokia E71 and the N86, on my E71 i am using the latest mail for exchange which works fine but i cannot view subfolders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my N86 i used the default e-mail setup guide and during that setup it asked about being corporate which i said yes then selected mail for exchange. once this was fully setup i could view subfolders. How do i get this version for the E71?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>JDobbsy1987</p>

<p>Although E71 supports e-mail accounts from over a thousand ISPs such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, hotmail and even corporate email accounts. Exchange client synchronizes your phone with push e-mail, contacts, and calendar appointments from Microsoft Exchange, but
 you cannot access e-mail subfolders--something I find baffling in a business phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;you can't have the ability to subscribe to multiple IMAP sub-folders.</p>

<p>Have you any idea of the app that is built into the N86 then?&nbsp;&nbsp; as this has got somthing called 'E-Mail' and when i went through the setup of that it asked me if it is a corporate e-mail..... i said yes and it then gave me the option for mail for exchange
 which i selected and once setup i can view all subfolders?</p>

                    My OS is Windows Vista Home Premium and I recently updated to Windows Internet Explorer 8.&nbsp; For the most part it works quite well but in getting used to the program I have&nbsp;to say I absolutely HATE the re-open closed tabs feature.&nbsp; Even on my home compute
 I feel that I should be able to control my privacy.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to disable the feature completely?

<p><span>Hello phcl9,</span></p>
<p><span>While you cannot disable this feature in normal browsing you can use InPrivate Browsing and it will not log the sites you have visited, the tabs you had
 open, or save cookies for websites you have visited.<span>&nbsp; </span>To use InPrivate Browsing click on the Safety button and click on InPrivate Browsing.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<h2>            Question about Windows 8.1 and anti virus software</h2>
                    Howdy folks,
<div>I have been around computers for a bit. I recently purchased a ASUS G750JH laptop It has Windows 8.0 which I updated to 8.1 My question is I tried to install Microsoft security essentials but could not as it is not supported on 8.1 I do have defender that
 looks like MSE does it also scan and remove and possible virus? Or do I have to install a stand alone anti virus program? if so what do yall recommend?</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in using Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Enhanced Protected Mode in Internet Explorer helps keep your data safe.</p>
<p>There is no single thing that can keep you secure by itself, so we pursue multiple strategies, including:</p>
<p>Protection from socially-engineered attacks.</p>
<p>Protection from attacks designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Web sites.</p>
<p>Protection against attacks designed to exploit the browser or operating system</p>
<p>Protecting your personal information.</p>
<p>Protecting your corporate assets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you get any error message when you login to answers.microsoft.com website after adding to the trusted sites?</p>
<p>2. Do all other websites work correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to reset Internet Explorer settings to it's default and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after the reset.<br />
<br />
a. Close all Internet Explorer and Explorer windows that are currently open. </p>
<p>b. Start Internet Explorer. <br />
c. On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, tap or click <strong>
Internet options</strong>. If you don't see the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, press Alt.
</p>
<p>d. In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> window, tap or click the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab. </p>
<p>e. Tap or click <strong>Reset</strong>. If you're using Windows Internet Explorer 6, click
<strong>Restore Default</strong>.</p>
<p>f. In the <strong>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong>Reset</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Select the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> check box if you also want to remove browsing history, search providers, Accelerators, home pages, Tracking Protection, and ActiveX Filtering data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>g. When Internet Explorer finishes applying the default settings, tap or click
<strong>Close</strong>, and then tap or click <strong>
OK</strong>. </p>
<p>h. Exit and then start Internet Explorer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it helps. If the issue persists, we will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Thank you Rajith R for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When enhanced mode is not enabled, everything works normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;when enhanced protected mode is enabled and 64b processes enabled &nbsp;(after a IE reset),</p>
<p>&nbsp;considering I am not logged in,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;when answers.microsoft.com is not in the trusted site list,</p>
<p>&nbsp;when I log in to answers.microsoft.com I have an error message saying that the page has been reloaded due to an error in the page (and I'm then logged in). As an alternative, IE may hang there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;when answers.microsoft.com is in the trusted site list, I cannot log in, period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;is the enhanced protected mode with 64b processes in production status or in beta status ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;would you recommend using it for vanilla users or only for places where security requirements are higher than most places ?</p>

</p><p>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still under development stage you would be facing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you exactly mean by vanilla user? Do you mean a basic or a local user?</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;I understand I can be facing issues, I accept it, I like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;As you recommend, I'll enable Enhanced Protected mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Would you recommend 64 bits processes ?</p>

<h2>            Computer infected with virus, has removed most of my access</h2>
                    <p>Original title; Lets put this at the top</p>
<p>I need help and I've exhausted the search for 'already answered &amp; solved' questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my laptops are slowly being taken over by a virus - Malware - rootkit?</p>
<p>They are on the same network, but this Vaio is my main laptop and i can't do a thing with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already reinstalled window 8,&nbsp; 3 times now, (plus all the blooming updates needed to install 8.1)but each time this 'thing' comes back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has changed my user name to rubbi_00, and blocked my access to most of the computer.</p>
<p>I have scoured the internet for help and have hit it with every anti virus/malware/rootkit software I can find free (cant afford to buy only to discover it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It always disables Windows defender, my Mcafee, fire wall etc</p>
<p>I have tried all above in safe mode and it makes no difference at all, its in safe mode too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the ant-virus software either came back with impressive logs on the stuff they found and was then disabled or were disabled before they even got going.</p>
<p>For example malwarbytes and spybot have got no chance of starting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also when i go online and search for help with getting rid of this 'thing' the page is rerouted to something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I can think of is a total reformat of my hd, but my windows 8 is installed on the laptop along with Sony's Assist.... (which has so far been a god send and the only way to restart my computer when it has been totally wiped .. as it has
 twice now) </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: Besides asking for help generally, I need a bootable windows 8 but I first need to know how i can save my recovery and Sony assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is it possible to reformat just the C; drive and then recover my Windows or will the recovery drive be infected too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently confirmed to myself that it is actually a rootkit, what else could change the computer setting so I am a guest and 'it' is the owner?</p>
<p>I really need some help here, and i managed to save a couple of antvirus logs before they were ousted off my computer, but I can't understand them, maybe you could?</p>

            <p>You can try using Malwarebytes in an attempt to get rid of the virus/malware:</p>
<p>https://www.malwarebytes.org/antimalware/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what you've said there may been an infection on your network, and I would suggest to first, try running malware bytes, and also get a free version of AVG, make sure both of the programs exclusion lists are clear before you run a scan. I suggest
 running the malwarebytes scan first, as it will commonly scan a file, and that will cause a chain reaction that AVG will catch immediately as-well. Therefore preventing further spread of the infection. Malwarebytes will come with a free trial, this will allow
 you to run a Hyper scan, this scan is faster than the threat scan, but as it suggests, run a threat scan after you run a Hyper scan, if (and even if not) malicious items are detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also call your ISP and see if they can check to see if there could be a security breach on your network, I called my ISP once and they asked me if I wished to have them check out my network or whatever for anything unusual, but anyways, your ISP
 should do that (I'm not sure, don't hold me to that one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes keeps the items that it finds in a Quarantine, and what you can do is permanently delete them from your system, do that. You can try and create a backup, but chances are doing so will keep the virus or rootkit on the computer, which is a huge
 pain, but it may work. I suggest only trying to make a backup after doing what I suggested above. When you see the names, if they are detected by malwarebytes (You will be shown the names of what it has found) Write them down, and post them in a reply here.
 It's an idea to keep an eye out for anything in the exclusion lists of malwarebytes or AVG, because the rootkit may try to add itself to the exclusion list(s) so that it won't get detected or removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, and good luck! :)</p>

<p>Some laptops come with pre-installed 'anti-virus' that are mostly just a marketing scheme, because it puts their name out there, and can drum up business &nbsp;because people will know the name because it's what comes with their computer, but there are better
 alternatives to McAfee.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for all that, as it happens I have tried both those and both found lots of malware - virus -&nbsp; trojans etc, hey were quarantined, but the rootkit remains.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of registry changes ... and i mean a lot!</p>
<p>All that was fixed but it still remains!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and I think i have tried every Ant Rootkit now and i have to say Gmer is by far the fastest scan, found far more than the others but i don't quite understand the logs, so i wont delete till i do</p>

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<p>We can only deal with one (1) computer at-a-time. Let's start with the Win8.1 computer.&nbsp;
<em>Assuming Win8.1 64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. <em>Assuming you started with Win8 =&gt;</em> When (approx. date) was Win8.1 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed McAfee&nbsp;application and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription</em><em> expire?</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>Chances are the McAfee application disabled Windows Defender.</li></ul>
<p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Assuming you used the preinstalled&nbsp;McAfee free-trial, had the free-trial period already expired by the time you purchased &amp; installed the current McAfee application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did you (a) uninstall the McAfee free-trial AND THEN (b) download/run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool &amp; reboot AND THEN (c) do a clean install of the paid McAfee application or did you just upgrade the free-trial to the paid version?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be&nbsp;playing a role&nbsp;here.</li></ul>
<p>6a. Is KB2976627, KB2976897, KB2918614, and/or KB2978668 listed in <strong>Installed Updates
</strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. When (exact date) was KB2919355 installed according to <strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v14.0.0.176 </strong><em>for Internet Explorer</em> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;
 PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's

<h2>            Nokia N81 8gb Screen goes crazy</h2>
                    ok so i buaght my Nokia N81 like in january last year and ive been using it quiet regularly....<br />
Until today... I slid the phones slider to reveal the keys to write a text message, when the screen went crazy with funky colours and such lines and random things on the screen. If i slide it up and down while its like this it changes its effects and stuff
 as if its something to do with the contacts of the slider and the screen. If i let the screen black out into powersaver it returns normal but if i slide it again to close the phone or open it back up it goes nuts again.<br />
<br />
i tried leaving the battery out but no use.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOTS OF HELP please ?<br />
i was thinking a factory reset ??

            it might be a hardware issue you are right, but first of do all necessary back up of your files. is your phone up to date with firmware? if yes good, if no it is also worth updating.<br />
try this code first *#7780#- factory default settings restored<br />
<br />
if that does not work try *#7730# reset<br />
or as a last resort you can try the *, key #3 button and green/talk button with a fully turned off phone. hold down those three buttons power on and wait to release them until you see the handshake or boot up Nokia screen. if that fails and nothing improves
 then it would probably be in the hardware category issue.<br />

<p>Hey i have this same problem, and ive worked out that; whenever i slide the screen up it somehow disconnects with the rest of the phone and hence the screen becomes very dark or has those screen refresh lines. However, i am wondering what ever happened to
 your issue and whether it was fixed with the steps given or whether it was a ahrdware problem and that the phone needs to be serviced.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi! I have the same problem as well! And this is the SECOND time this is happening! The first time I took it back to my SP, and they then replaced it with a brand new handset; that was 10 months after using my phone for the first time. Now, 8 months after
 receiving my brand new handset, I have the same problem again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was very strange to me, before it first happened, was that my slider became REALLY tight and difficult to manouevre,&nbsp; so I slid the screen up and down as it felt like there was something obstructing the slider, and out came a clear piece of sticky plastic
 film... I took no note of it, until the same thing happened to me about 2 weeks before my phone went wonky again.The funny thing is, my fiancé has the 2gb phone, and he seems to have no trouble at all with his handset, and he's now had his phone for more than
 a year (that's longer than I've had both of my handset before going crazy), so I'm thinking it must be a problem with the N81 8gb models. Now I need to take the phone back AGAIN, which I'm not very happy about... I don't want to have to take my phone back,
 or repair it, every 8 to 10 months... It's a waste of my time AND money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing... when they replaced my handset, I asked them what the problem was with my phone, and they said that they didn't know, but that they couldn't fix it! SERIOUSLY?! So now how exactly will I get to repair my phone if the Nokia technicians
 can't even find the problem NOR fix it?! I've basically spent ALL this money on a phone that only works for a few months until it's irrepairably broken... I don't think I'll be using another Nokia after this again...</p>

<h2>            Why do I have to sign in to Office account EVERY time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why is it that I suddenly have to sign in to my Microsoft account every time I open any one of my Office 365 applications? This is new behavior and I find it very invasive. I have signed in and verified my subscription numerous times but continue to be prompted
 every time.</p>
<p>It should be MY CHOICE if I work while signed in, and I should not be harassed to conform.</p>

            I'd suggest doing a quick repair of the installation. That should fix it. 
<br />
<br />Please click Windows Start
<br />Choose Settings
<br />Click Apps
<br />Click on Microsoft Office in the list
<br />Click Modify
<br />Choose Quick Repair
<br />
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:

<p>Hi LeighBettenay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To solve the issue, you can try the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open an Office application like Word and go to File &gt; Account.</span></li><li>
<span>Click Switch Account and then sign out all the accounts.</span></li><li>
<span>Exit all Office applications.</span></li><li>
<span>Remove all the stored Office related credentials in the credentials manager (<strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;
<strong>User Accounts</strong> &gt;<strong> Credential Manager</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Credentials</strong>).</span></li><li>
<span>Run <strong>regedit&nbsp;</strong>as&nbsp;administrator.</span></li><li>
<span>From <strong>Registry Editor</strong>, browse to:<br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Delete the <strong>
Identity</strong> folder.</span></li><li>
<span>Open Word and sign in.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Note: Before you modify the registry,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up the registry for restoration&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;in case problems occur.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>WARNING:
</span></em></strong><em><span>Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting
 from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Edit at your own risk.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>No, that worked only for the first log-in. Once I signed out and tried to use any of the Office applications the bloody prompt was back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might seem odd to you that I want to work without remaining signed in to a Microsoft account, but that is the way I've done it for 20 years and I don't see why I should have to change now. I don't need one drive, i don't need the Microsoft store and I
 don't need messaging or other such stuff. I just want to work quietly away with my programs (which I refuse to regard as "apps") and I don't want to be harassed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts? By the way, i tried Jason's helpful suggestion but that didn't work either.</p>

<p>Hi LeighBettenay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should work for at least 30 days if you don’t sign in to Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation on your side, I’d like to confirm the following information.</p>
<ol>
<li>When do you get the prompt, opening the application or a file?</li><li>A screenshot of the sign in prompt.</li><li>A screenshot of your product information. Open Word and go to File &gt; Account, capture all the information under Product Information.</li></ol>

<p><span>Dear Ran</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your response. There seems to be no way to send information direct, and I'm not keen on splashing my contact info about the net- hence images attached have this removed- but you already know it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The prompt comes every time I try to open anything in Office- eg a blank document in word, a previous document, or my email</span></p>
<p><span>For example</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88e726a7-1b36-437f-b15a-de553d027bd5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88e726a7-1b36-437f-b15a-de553d027bd5?upload=true" height="224" width="371" /></a></p>
<p>Details of my office installation are:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23b32bb4-a6eb-43ca-826a-503d4e762525?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23b32bb4-a6eb-43ca-826a-503d4e762525?upload=true" height="298" width="494" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think this is new behavior- I have had this license for several years and several months on the current computer.</span></p>
<p><span>I think it started to happen after the last major Windows update. Note that I have Office licenses on other machines and it does NOT happen on my Windows 10 laptop (or at least, not yet…).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hoping this assists. I would be happy, by the way to log on every 30 days. That would not be a major imposition whereas the current situation most definitely is.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Leigh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the screenshot, the Office application you installed is not from an Office 365 for Business subscription. Since this is the Business category and there may be some difference between the Business version and the Home version, I moved the thread
 to the Home category. The engineers there will help you further.</p>

            Dear Cas65,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You have posted your question in Outlook.com forum, so I assume that you are using it in browser.
<br />
<br />I have tested on my account and drag and drop works. Please try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can cause problems. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>
<br />
<br />It is better to avoid Safari, Firefox and Chrome for this as there are lots of problems with browsers recently <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a> That is why please test this in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer in Private ( CTRL+SHIFT+P )

<p>Hi Parmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply, unfortunately the link is not really of much use to me, since making these changes to the appearance of the interface doesn't solve my problems with the functionality of the new outlook. Apart from that I always used the pre-reading
 pane, though now it is unreadable because it is so narrow and can't be scrolled</p>
<p>So my difficulties are: </p>
<p>- I can't drag and drop emails into folders&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I can't adjust the width of the columns to maximise the part I want.</p>
<p>- I have to scroll more to access my folders, because of the wide prompt to Upgrade to office &nbsp;&nbsp; 365</p>

<br />
<br />Try to reset network settings and check if this will help.To run these networking commands in a command prompt window
<br />1. In the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.
<br />2. At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<br />Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.
<br />Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

            <p>Hi Rich, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your Outlook concern, you cannot open your Outlook since Outlook 2003 is not compatible with Windows 10. Versions of Office prior to Office 2007 are no longer supported and may not work on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the list of Microsoft Office versions that are compatible with Windows 10:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Office 2016 (Version 16)</li><li>Office 2013 (Version 15)</li><li>Office 2010 (Version 14) </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

            <p>I was running Office 2003 with Outlook 2003 on Windows 7. I upgraded to Windows 10 without a problem with Office 2003 and Outlook 2003. All was fine for months then about a month ago when I tried to open Outlook 2003 I got a message that said "can not access/find
 files contract your system adminstrator". Since I am my own "systems adminstrator" I loaded up the Office 2003 disk and attempt to reload Office 2003. in the process I got message that said it could not find vfpodbc.dll in Windows System32 folder. I checked
 and yes it was not there!! I clicked "ignore" and continued the Office 2003 install process. At the end all Office 2003 programs run except Outlook 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I seem to need "vfpodbc.dll. Where do I get it? Why did I lose it? How do I reinstall?</p>
<p>Help please</p>

Thank you for the response. I understand but why did Outlook 2003 run for months on Windows 10 without a problem? And how do I get a safe working copy of vfpodbc.dll and install it? Or am I forced to buy the latest version of Outlook? And if I install the latest
 version of Outlook will it pick up my contacts and emails tied to Outlook 2003

Hello Doug,
<div>Thanks for the prompt response.</div>
<div>I followed your instructions and managed to downloaded the files and install it.</div>
<div>I'm trying to use an existing word document that is already connected to a EXL file as the data source and do a simple mail merge as a monthly letter to a all group members.</div>
<div>I could not understand which option should I use from the 5-6 options you provided in addition I could not undestan how to work with each one of them ( what does a legacy means? what it is protected etc.)</div>
<div>I tried every single option none of them work at all.</div>
<div>It asks me to save the doc which i didntt want to, then it started prompting the browser scree and many other "surprises' except of what I was expecting it to do.</div>
<div>
<p>Could you pls send me a simple step by step instruction which option to select and how to use it. Please keep in mind that all data fields already defined in the word document which was working fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Update &amp; Security Window “Activation &gt; Edition Windows 10 Pro”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why the different edition numbers between DISM /Get-Currentedition &gt; 10.0.10240.<strong>384</strong> and Msinfo32.exe &gt; "Hdwe. Abstraction Layer Version = 10.0.10240.1<strong>6392</strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How long will the "Insider Program" run? Will/can my edition of Win 10 pro be converted to a fully licensed OS at some future point without upgrading my Win 8.1 pro?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remark: If the above answer is no, then I plan on Updating my Win 8.1 Pro to Win 10 pro. I don't want to do this for awhile as I don't feel that Win 10 build 10.0.10240 is fully ready for prime time and I would like to stay in the "Insider Program". I would
 like to keep all 3 OS's, however as I understand&nbsp; you have to go the "Upgrade" route to be legit thus loosing my Win 8.1 pro in the process. I do not wish to upgrade my Win 7 as long as I can as Win 7 is it is my work horse and everything works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for comments or suggestions.</p>

            The insiders program will continue once the RTM roll out process has been completed. The next phase of testing for Windows 10 will resume after that, probably about mid-August. As for upgrading your window 7 or 8 to 10, you must remember that you will
 have until July of 2016 to do that, so you do not need to worry about missing the "Free" upgrade path right now. To receive your RTM version of Windows 10 you must be upgrading from Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 or purchase a separate license for Windows 10.
