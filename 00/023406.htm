<h2>            Microsoft Word template to all users</h2>
                    <p>So I am trying to integrate a word template to all users with certain onedrive accounts. Is there a way that I can put a template onto the onedrive account of all users with the username *** Email address is removed for privacy *** without having each person (hundreds) having to
 save the template manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Word 2016 keeps losing files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane.jacobs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word 2016 keeps losing files</h2>
                    <p>I've had a problem that might be two separate ones, but both have had the same result. Word keeps losing my documents due to errors, and I need it to stop before something important gets deleted.</p>
<p>Firstly, I tried opening a Word document I'd written and saved a month earlier, only to find the (1300kb) document was completely empty. Save data said I had opened and saved it after only 5 minutes, but I know for a fact that I had the document open for
 at least an hour during a lecture, and that I had saved before, during, and after I was typing. It even says in the file explorer that the document is 1300kb, but it contains literally nothing.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was in the middle of typing a document when it froze completely. My cursor would not show up while it was on the document and I couldn't type, select anything, close the document, minimize the document, or save it. When I briefly tried switching
 from the document to Chrome on the task bar, I found I couldn't switch back to the Word document at all - it was like the system was completely refusing to acknowledge that it was even there. But Word wasn't frozen at all. I could open new documents, and even
 an earlier saved version of the frozen document without Word trying to tell me the document was already open. In the end I had to lose everything I'd typed since the last save, which was a substantial amount because this happened at the end of a very long
 and fast-paced lecture.</p>
<p>At this rate I'm starting to lose trust in Word 2016 completely. I'm almost too worried to use it at all in case I lose something really important, like an essay or the last of my trust in the application. I've tried everything to recover the lost documents
 but to no avail, and I don't know what to do short of deleting my Office Suite and writing everything by hand.</p>

<p><span>Hi Jane.Jacobs,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that the Word 2016 application freezes when you write the lecture and then the file can’t be saved fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Where do you save the document, in the OneDrive for Business library or the site library in SharePoint Online?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the new OneDrive sync client</a> to sync the files and open the files to edit them and then encounter the issue? Do you edit the files in Word Online directly?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does the issue happen in the specific file?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the Word 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, I suggest you do the following to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>1. If you edit the files with the Word 2016 application, check the result when you edit them in Word Online directly.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;the Office 2016 icon&gt;Repair and then do a test.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Run Word 2016 in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and do a test.</span></p>
<p><span>4. If you have another computer with the same version of Office 2016 installed, do a test.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook and Outlook Web Access&#58; Add Accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a bit of an issue with using Outlook and Outlook Web Access (OWA). &nbsp;I have added my hotmail account to my Live@edu (University) account using OWA, which gives me the option to receive all my mail (university mail + hotmail) in one place! &nbsp;Also, when
 i go to send a new message, i have the option to send from my hotmail or from my university mail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem arises when I add my Live@edu account to my Outlook 2007. &nbsp;It receives all the messages from both accounts (Uni + Hotmail), but when I choose to send a new message, it only sends it from my Live@edu account and doesn't give me the option to send
 it from my hotmail.</p>
<p>Initially I had both on Outlook 2007, and then realised I could add my hotmail onto my OWA, which meant on OWA, I had Live@edu + Hotmail TOGETHER, and then in Outlook 2007 I have Live@Edu + Hotmail TOGETHER (i.e. same as OWA) + Hotmail seperately (i.e. i
 have 1 set of messages from my Live@edu, and 2 lots from my hotmail). &nbsp;After deleting my seperate hotmail account, i still have messages from both my Live@edu + hotmail (as OWA), but i don't have the same option to choose the account to send from as per OWA.</p>
<p>Any idea as to how I can have both my Live@edu and Hotmail on my Outlook 2007, but without having to have two lots of emails from my hotmail on there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ravi</p>

<p>OWA is simply a web interface into your Exchange mailbox.&nbsp; It's not really a mail client, per se.&nbsp; If you can see both Hotmail and your school mail in one place, then you must be forwarding your Hotmail to the school's Exchange account or Exchange is reaching
 out to Hotmail via POP to pull it in.&nbsp; OWA cannot access Hotmail directly.&nbsp; If you can send mail so that your messages appear to come from either the school address or Hotmail, then the school must have added the extra address to your Active Directory record.</p>
<p>When you use Outlook to access your Exchange mailbox, you also see both school mail ad Hotmail because both are in the same school mailbox.&nbsp; When you add the Hotmail account to Outlook, you're not accessing the Hotmail mailbox separately from the school
 mailbox so you see the messages both in the school mailbox (because you're forwarding the Hotmail there or Exchange is polling the Hotmail mailbox) and in Hotmail, since you're accessing the actual Hotmail mailbox.&nbsp; If you have two accounts defined in Outlook,
 you will have the option to choose the sending account.&nbsp; The word "From" in a new message window should have a drop-down on it that will allow you to choose your sending account.</p>
<p>Log into your Hotmail account using a web browser and see if you are forwarding your Hotmail to your school address.&nbsp; If so, cancel the forwarding and Outlook will then cease duplicating the messages because you will have cancelled what you did to cause
 the duplication.&nbsp; If you are not forwarding your messages, then ask the school's mail administrators to stop polling your Hotmail account.</p>

                    <p>I have inserted a logo and 2 footer elements (page number and another text box) on my master slide. When I close out of master slide view, only the logo shows up in the presentation - the other two elements do not.&nbsp;The text color is dark&nbsp;gray, so the contrast&nbsp;with
 the background is fine.&nbsp;The background of the master slide is solid (white) and is not another graphic/element that could be hiding these text boxes. Even so, I have selected the text boxes and clicked "bring to front" in the Format ribbon - they still don't
 show up.</p>

            Usually, it clears automatically when messages are sent.<br />
<br />
However, if you have some messaging sitting in the Outbox that has failed and cannot be sent (for whatever reason), then you need to remove it from the Outbox first (cancel the sending, move it to Drafts and/or delete).

<h2>            Microsoft Word 10</h2>
                    When opening a new 'blank page' and starting to write the top ribbon and tool bar fade away, then the little blue circle is there going round &amp; round — I cannot save anything, I cannot write anything, the only thing I can do is close it down and pray to
 all the computer gods that I did not lose my work. &nbsp;This has been going on since they installed Word 10 on my new HP (which I will never buy again). &nbsp;A lapse of time it is usable and I have to look everywhere for my work and then it happens all over again.
 &nbsp;Very frustrating &amp; stressful &amp; I am saving everything every few words. &nbsp;Help please and thank you very much for being there!

<p>Voice command 1.6 is very tricky to use on WM6 devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some devices it is absolute no problem and on other devices people are screaming for help with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website states clearly that it is for WM5 (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/voicecommand/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/voicecommand/default.mspx</a>)
 but in their specific system requirements page they also list WM6 (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/voicecommand/sysreq.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/voicecommand/sysreq.mspx</a>)</p>
<p>but at the webshops the claim also that it will work with WM6 (using the language minimum requirements are WM5)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a big issue. And it is a hit or miss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making sure that the MS developers are aware of this.</p>

<h2>            WANTING A NOKIA WITH A LARGE FONT&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am looking at buying a new Nokia phone, I have the Nokia 6120 at the moment and although I have the Font set to LARGE, it is still quite small.<br />
Does anyone no of any latest Nokia's that have bluetooth, with a good size font and a decent size keypad???<br />
There are so many on the market and you are never able to see one working before you buy it.<br />
some of my older phones have had a larger text than the one I have now.

            Larger screen = larger fonts.<br />
<br />
The N95 8GB has the largest screen 2.8", the old N95 has 2.6" and the N81 and N82 have 2.4" screens.<br />
<br />
As an alternative you could buy a program to enlarge the fonts.<br />

            I have a 6300 which has an option to increase font size. Unlike most phones it does actually make the text legible if you have problems like me. I also have an N95 8gb with the psiloc font enlarger application and it works brilliantly. Without the application
 the "large" text is no bigger than any other phones default setting. You have to buy into the whole N series thing though which might not interest you. Personally I love it.

            I too have the 6120 but have been unable to find anywhere on it where I can enlarge the font, which I find is ridiculously small for my aging eyes. I tried Settings, but couldn't find anything about fonts...I know I probably sound extremely ignorant, but
 any help for this user would be appreciated

<p>The Nokia 3110c has large fonts for texting and is configurable in the phone book. I would suggest using only the normal size in the phonebook. Blue tooth is included. Very decent size battery.. The keypads are good old white on black and quite a decent
 size probably the biggest in any current nokia. The signal strength is among one the best i have tested in a nokia GSM mobile. The screen would be good if where more like the nokia 6300. But works in the sun and is quite acceptable. Seems to display like a
 mono screen in Bright sunlight. I have had mine 2 and a half years with no problems and has been purchased for all our staff where i work with no complaints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3110c is an ecellant everyday GSM mobile for talking and texting which can last up to a week on one charge. It is not for people who need a smart phone. But has enough features to keep you organised.</p>

<p>I need software that enlarges all the font without using smth like a magnifier. Just like the font enalrger for the SMS and deep menu's. But I won't everything, when you press options in the menu, the first menu - everything</p>

                    We had a power outage (my computer was off) and when I turned it on the next day, almost all of my favorites were gone. However, when I went to re-save a site to favorites I got a message saying the path already existed. How can I restore Favorites?

            <p>Usually when the computer loses power unexpectedly, the file system becomes unstable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when files don't appear on the windows explorer, ie index, then it is because they have become unindexed by the master file table (mft)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what you need to do is to run a check disk in order to reconcile all the&nbsp;files with the master file table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can right&nbsp;click on the C drive&nbsp;via explorer, then select properties, then under the tools tab there will be a check disk feature.&nbsp; Also, you may want to do a defrag after the check disk is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Barring any major corruption, the check disk should be able to run after you reboot the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; then afterwards the system should reboot and launch windows normally again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 6.9 or Windows Mobile 7 on HTC Desire</h2>
                    I have recently purchased my new HTC Desire Smartphone through Telstra and now am confused with all the info on Windows 7 Mobile software, i seem to meet the specifications for it but is it a case of downloading the it via the browser on my phone and installing
 it or do i need to first install an app on my computer? i already have the HTC app for syncs for contacts etc so i don't see the need, but is the Desire compatible and can i then..... which is my goal..... access internet TV from around the world using a service
 i have subscribed to already and access via my desktop and HD TV... on my HTC..... does this make sense to any one, it's driving me crazy and i don't want to stuff up my phone but really would love the accessability that i, hopefully, may be able to achieve.

<p>Hello. The HTC Desire seems to be running the Android operating system developed by Google. There will be no official way to put Windows Phone 7 (the new MS operating system) on it. The difference is like "apples and oranges" and not compatible. If you want
 to access internet TV, try this app:</p>

<h2>            Virtual PC&#58; Network cards missing, after Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 update.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>I have a Windows 8.1 computer, running Hyper-v.</p>
<p>Under Hyper-v i have a other virtual Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today i wanted to try Windows 10, and i therefore upgraded the computer to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade of the virtual machine, all network adapters are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a lot of diffrent solutions.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Removing the network cards.</p>
<p>Removing all drivers.</p>
<p>Restarting and testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking reg:</p>
<p>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\Connections\ClassManagers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating the key:</p>
<p>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\</p>
<p>Config (This was missing, so i tried creating it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what the error is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>I'm running a sfc /SCANNOW to see if it does anything.</p>
<p>An error was found, and fixed, but there problem is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no luck.</p>
<p>Now i will try to do a "factory reset" of the system.</p>
<p>I have a backup of the files, and will try a other update on the files after this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Jens</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone App for Desktop crashes when connected to phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to open the desktop app it crashes.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It opens fine</span> when the phone is not connected.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It opens fine</span> when the phone is locked.<br />
- <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But when the phone is unlocked, the desktop app crashes.<br />
</span></strong><br />
</p>
<p>I reinstalled the drivers as well.<br />
tried different usb ports.<br />
tried in safemode - the usb ports of course were disabled. but wanted to see if the app opened.<br />
opened in diagnostic mode in msconfig - still the app crashes.<br />
<br />
Prior to detecting this issue, the only thing i did was to manually go into the phone storage via my computer and delete all the songs and left the music folder empty. I did this as i wanted to resync the music library from the start.<br />
- Unsure if this had anything to do with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also upgraded to Win10 on my phone about 2 months ago and had not connected the phone to the Computer after that.<br />
- Unsure if this is the issue.<br />
<br />
Phone : Lumia 640XL Win 10<br />
Laptop : Win8</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Does the App support Windows 10 Mobile?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions?<br />
<br />

            Hi Dharshana, <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that there's a conflict with your Lumia 640 XL that's why the Windows Phone App for Desktop crashes when you unlock the phone's screen. It's also possible that there's an issue with the USB cable. To isolate this, have you tried using a different USB
 cable? Have you checked if your phone has the latest OS build version? Go to <strong>
Settings &gt; Update and security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates</strong>. You can also try performing a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This will refresh your
 device's software. <br />
<br />
Update us about the outcome so that we can provide further assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. the cable is new, but checked with another cable, same issue.<br />
2. phone is fully updated.</p>
<p>3. performed soft reset.<br />
<br />
in addition:<br />
1. also installed a VM with win10</p>
<p>2. still the app crashes.</p>
<p>3. but the phone companion app opens and detects the phone, but lacks the functionality the app in question has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dharshana.</p>

            You're welcome. There's a possibility that there's a compatibility issue between your Lumia 640 XL and the Windows Phone app for desktop as it's a classic application for PCs. You can try installing the same app on another PC, then try connecting your
 phone. This is another way of isolating the issue. <br />
<br />
Let us know what happens.

<p>Yes, i think i primarily have an issue with the phone after it was upgraded to Win10, as before that it was working fine.<br />
Hard resetting the phone 'might' fix the issue, but dont wanna take that chance.<br />
<br />
And since i tried this in another VM, i dont think trying this another separate PC would do any good, nor do i have another PC.<br />
<br />
However, i found an alternative, not the best, but kinda works. its a long way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded my entire library to windows media player.<br />
but didnt want to re-create all the playlists.<br />
so via the 'MusicBridge" application, i transferred the playlists into WMP.<br />
However these are static playlists and is disconnected from itunes after the transfer.<br />
So everytime i update the playlist in itunes, i need to the run the above app to once more transfer the playlist to WMP.<br />
</p>
<p>And as for the library, my itunes library has a specific collection and doesnt have all the songs, nor are they stored in the itunes library, its in another folder [in another partition].<br />
But there's no way to copy this selective library over to WMP, and so have to upload the whole folder to WMP.<br />
<br />
So basically, if there's no other solution to the main issue, i guess you can close this ticket. Hopefully someone else might find what i've done as an alternative, Until Microsoft releases a viable solution, either for this app, or the phone companion, though
 it may never happen since the phone production was stopped. Kinda feels like we were scammed and puts us in a difficult position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.<br />
Appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            Synchronizing HTC HD2 and outlook contacts</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
Windows 7 with Center for Windows Mobile units.<br />
Outlook (using kerio outlook connector for the server connection)<br />
HTC HD2<br />
<br />
I am trying to transfer my contacts from my old Ericsson mobile to my new HTC HD2.
<br />
<br />
Step one extract all contacts to a file, worked fine with the program MyPhoneExplorer.<br />
Edited all my contacts to make them look nice with country prefix etc...<br />
Uploaded the contacts via a comma separated file into outlook.<br />
All new contacts loaded into Outlook into a new folder called mobile.<br />
<br />
Now when I try to connect with my HTC thru the center a sync is done but not with my contacts.<br />
<br />
How do I replace my contacts in the phone with my outlook contacts in the mobile folder??<br />
<br />
Thankful for any help!<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Lars

<br />
Activesync will not sync contacts that are not in the default Contacts folder. <br />

            <p>Put your slope (length of hypotenuse)&nbsp;in B2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [I assume this is a linear measure and not an angle]</p>
<p>A2:&nbsp; slope&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (label)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>A3:&nbsp; ribbon&nbsp; (label)</p>
<p>B3:&nbsp; ribbon value</p>

<p>
</p><p>volume&nbsp;for your cone would be&nbsp;&nbsp; C2:&nbsp; =((0.6*B2)*(0.8*B2)^2)/3</p>
<p>
</p><p>The added&nbsp; divide by 27 I ignored thinking it was spurious.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what ribbon is but I assume it is the length of top of the pile (part that separates the two halves of the cone) although dividing by 27 is confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Volume for your body would be&nbsp; C3:&nbsp; =B3*(0.6*B2)*(0.8*B2)/27</p>
<p>
</p><p>C4:&nbsp; =C2+C3</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears you are assuming the angle of the slope of ~37 degrees</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing you are using the formula for a pyramid for your body, but seems to me it should be a prism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;&nbsp; ribbon x height x radius&nbsp; might should be ribbon x height x 2 x radius&nbsp; but its your formula.

<h3> hellhunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows MyPhone and Mobile Device Center</h2>
                    
<div>So this is what I&nbsp;submitted&nbsp;to the 2010 Office BETA Frown:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Apparently 2010 is not yet integrated with Windows Mobile Device Center. I cannot select any Outlook to sync. I get a blank window that just says 'Error" when it attempts to load the inforamtion from Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"What's worse is that Device Center is competely devastating in its design. I dont' know who thought that deleting everything from the phone was a good idea just because your Outlook profile or information was lost or you have to recreate a partnership.
 I attempted to get aroudn this my using MyPhone, but apparently that only has a one-way sync. Despite my liking of Samsung's OMNIA and OMNIA II hardware and their software, the aweful software design support for Device Center and My Phone is going to make
 me choose my 30 return and go pick up a DROID. I am saying goodbye to Windows Mobile."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know if anyone else has had experience with having re-partner their device or having to reinstall Office, but the Windows Mobile Device Center is horribly designed. Why on Earth would anyone think deleting everything would be a good idea I don't
 know, but they should be smacked across the head. Secondly, if you're going to create web-based sync, why the ____ can't it restore the information to the phone over the account? what the ____ is a one-way sync good for? I shouldn't have to backup my phone
 everyday because syncing my phone might erase all my contacts (which I've gone through twice now). Luckily I do have enough backups to work around it all. As integrated as MS products are, which is what&nbsp;enticed&nbsp;me to go WinMo, the&nbsp;asinine design concepts of
 the software are too massive to stay with it. Must be why I'm writing this on Chrome and switching to Android come Monday.&nbsp;</div>

            So apparently looking at MSTechNet, the x64 version of Office2010 is not compatible with WMDC. That's a real disappointment for those of who try to maximize efficiency on their system. You would think that the installer&nbsp;would&nbsp;have a built-in checker for
 these kinds of things. "Oh look installer has detected a WMDC partnership, maybe I&nbsp;should&nbsp;flag the user that x64 isn't compatible before I install it and let WMDC delete everything off the user's phone."

            Well it isn't an Office problem. MS would have to upgrade WMDC directly. That still doesn't fix the whole "let's delete all your information" design disaster they made.
<div><br />
<div>And after a good couple hours of research and evaluation I'm staying with my OMNIA II. Since I can't sync with WMDC anymore I don't have to worry about the deletion problem and I can use MyPhone (which isn't quite as design flawed as WMDC) and RescoBackup
 to manage my "Cloud."</div>

            The scrollbar disappearing gets me. I leave my cursor on the down arrow but by the time I have read some the page the scrollbar and arrow as gone! Now fully appreciate that might be fine on a touch screen, but I am on a laptop no touch screen&nbsp;so it is
 very&nbsp;annoying.&nbsp;If there was a setting to always show scrollbars (like the&nbsp;always show menu's one in some apps) then&nbsp;that would be good.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem, I get lost while working with various documents and images, also in the file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's multiple posts on various forums about this serious issue, but at this time no solution in sight.</p>
<p>On the phone Windows support´personnel suggested something would be done about this in Windows 10, but since they're not developers I wont hold my breath on that promise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A post on another forum gave the following information of what have been attempted in order to solve this. Sadly it is only negative information of what has not worked. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I've tried disabling hardware acceleration in Office, and I've also tried disabling window control animations from Windows itself. All that does is make the scrollbar disappear instead of fade out.
</p>
<p>Looks like we're out of luck unless someone can find a registry hack."</p>

<h2>            Exchange Online RTO&#47;RPO</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Please can someone point me in the direction of official Microsoft documentation that states the RTO and RPO for Exchange Online.</p>
<p>I've found a couple of blog posts dated 4 years ago but need something up to date and official.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Gareth</p>

<p>Hi Gareth,</p>
<p>I have done some research and found that our current RPO and RTO are as follow:</p>
<p>Nearly instantaneous RPO: Microsoft protects your Exchange Online data and makes a nearly instantaneous copy of your data(up-to date).<br />
1 hour RTO: Organizations will be able to resume service within 60 minutes after service disruption if a disaster incapacitates a hosting data center.</p>
<p>But I didn’t find any newer official documents regarding Exchange Online RPO and RTO. Additionally, to better understand how Exchange Online stores and protects user data, here are two articles for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-high-availability-and-business-continuity.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">High Availability and Business Continuity</a>.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn440734(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Backing up email in Exchange Online</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can refer to <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-trust-center-welcome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Trust Center</a> for the details of Exchange Online data protection.</p>
<p>Feel free to post back If anything is unclear.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better know your concern, we'd like to ask some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What do you mean you switch from Hotmail to Outlook.com, did you change your Hotmail.com email to Outlook.com email?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried sending an email to your Hotmail account using a different email and getting an error message?</p>
<p>
