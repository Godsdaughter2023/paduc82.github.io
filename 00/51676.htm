I am updating now, but I noticed that the following two automatic updates were installed just before it stopped working.&nbsp; any chnace either of them caused the problem and if so how can I uninstall these two updates? The program did give an error message about
 validating or finding a file before it said it was not working.&nbsp; thanks:<br />

                    <p>OT- battery won't charge</p>
<p>I have windows 10 and my computer, a lenovo thinkpad showed that it was 100% charged when I turned it off. The computer said instalig updates and "don't turn off" so i let it run.
</p>
<p>Then I thought it was off at 100% .</p>
<p>I came bacdk to start the computer and it wouldn't start. I plugged it in and it started very slowly, doing more updating. Then it started (plugged in) but the display said that the battery was at 0% and was not charging!
<br />
What gives?<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to a <span>software or hardware problem that prevents the battery from working correctly.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>As of now I suggest you&nbsp;to&nbsp;follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may shut down the computer completely, unplug the power cable, remove the battery and let it rest for about 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, put the battery in its place, plug in the power cord and restart the computer to check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A simple way to check the integrity of the battery is to remove it entirely and plug in the power cable to the laptop. If the laptop powers on properly, the problem is likely with the battery.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A non-charging battery can sometimes be caused by an overheating laptop. If the laptop is charging for a very long time then the battery becomes quite hot. As the temperature rises, the battery sensor misfires, telling the system
 that the battery is either fully charged or missing completely, causing the charging problems. This problem becomes far more likely when dealing with older laptops which don't have the quality of cooling technology used today, or when using the laptop on the
 couch or in bed, with a blanket or pillow covering the cooling vents. Let the system cool down and take the time to make sure that the air vents are clean and unobstructed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You may contact the computer manufacturer support to check if the issue is with the battery itself. If need be then they will replace the old battery with a new one.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the information helps. Please get back to us with a reply so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Touch keyboard overlaps Applications&#47;Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Touch keyboard overlaps Applications&#47;Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I have upgraded to Windows 10 on my Surface 3, it appears that the Surface touch keyboard (not to be confused with the Windows on-screen keyboard) no longer provide a similar behaviour as that of Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, opening the Surface touch keyboard will resize/move some applications (e.g. the desktop icons, Internet Explorer), so the touch keyboard does not overlaps on top of the application - Albeit with a smaller viewer area, it does not hide any
 portion of, say, the webpage you are viewing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, this appears to not be the behaviour any longer - The touch keyboard will overlap and no longer resize any application which previously does in Windows 8.1, notably Internet Explorer. This is a pain as I then have to "undock" the keyboard,
 move it to an area I am not working on to see what I am typing, move the keyboard around again to see what I am replying to, etc....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At the moment I have reverted to Windows 8.1 to resume the "no overlap" behaviour, but perhaps there is a setting I might be missing on Windows 10? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is a significant problem. For me, it is most aggravating when using Excel. &nbsp;The keyboard rudely covers up the worksheet tabs at the bottom of the screen. I am also looking for a solution to this problem and am surprised I have not found one yet.
 &nbsp;90% of the time I use my Surface Pro 3, I am in Excel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 Upgrade wrong Amd Mobility driver update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After i updated my ASUS Laptop to Windows 10 I checked the drivers and i saw that the wrong display driver was installed(installed
<strong>BEFOR Windows 10 update:</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
AMD Radeon <em><strong>6470m</strong></em></span> <strong>AFTER Windows 10 update:</strong> AMD Radeon
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>7400m</strong></span></em> Series). Now my display is flickering sometimes and sometimes the Laptop just crashes with: UNEXEPTED_STORE_EXEPTION. So my question is how can I get the old driver from Windows
 7 back?</p>

    <title>Computer won&#39;t play through headphones - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t play through headphones</h2>
                    I got a new hard drive for my laptop a few months ago after my old one experienced "physical failure". &nbsp;Ever since then, a few things have been off. The one I want to fix most is the headphone issues. When I plug headphones into the jack, the little bubble
 pops up saying "You just plugged a device into the audio jack". However, sound still comes out of the speakers, and when I open up the playback devices window, it doesn't list the headphones even when I tell it to display disabled devices. The headphones work
 fine, I tested them on my roommates computer.

            Hola, Jose.
<br />
<br />Algunos de los métodos que puedes utilizar para intentar corregir este problema:
<br />
<br />1. Cable de la cámara desconectado o dañado
<br />
<br />Observa que físicamente la cámara esté correctamente conectada y no esté el cable dañado.
<br />
<br />2. Software antivirus
<br />
<br />Si tienes instalado un antivirus de terceros, desinstálalo (temporalmente) utilizando para ello la herramienta de desinstalación específica que ofrece el fabricante.
<br />
<br />3. Activación de la cámara
<br />
<br />Pulsa las teclas Windows+I, se abrirá el cuadro de Configuración. Haz clic en Privacidad y, a continuación, en Cámara. Observa que la cámara está activada para permitir su uso por las aplicaciones. En algunas instalaciones será necesario activarla de nuevo mediante las teclas de función, pulsando la tecla FN + algunas teclas como F6, F7, o F10. O incluso las combinaciones Alt+ F6, F7 o F10.
<br />
<br />4. Actualizar el controlador de la cámara.
<br />
<br />Abre el Administrador de dispositivos (devmgmt.msc) y expande Dispositivos de imagen. Haz clic derecho sobre la cámara y elige Buscar cambios de hardware. Haz clic en Actualizar software de controlador &gt; Buscar software de controlador en el equipo &gt; Elegir en una lista de controladores de dispositivo en el equipo. Marca la casilla Mostrar hardware compatible y selecciona el dispositivo que aparece (si aparece más de uno, tendrás que probar cada uno de ellos). Haz clic en Siguiente y espera a que finalice la instalación del controlador.
<br />
<br />Nota: si no aparece la cámara en Dispositivos de imagen del Administrador de dispositivos, conecta la cámara en otro puerto y comprueba si se muestra. Si tampoco aparece, haz clic en la ficha Acción &gt; Buscar cambios de hardware.
<br />
<br />Si todos estos pasos no funcionan, busca un controlador actualizado para tu cámara en la web del fabricante.
<br />
<br />5. Para ediciones Windows 10 N y KN.
<br />
<br />Para este tipo de ediciones de Windows 10 será necesario instalar el Media Feature Pack

<h2>            KB 926185 doesn&#39;t seem to work</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem in a dual boot Win 7 Pro 64 bit/ Win XP Pro 32 bit system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7 creates Restore points ok and these are still there after a reboot back into Win 7; but when I boot from Win XP it deletes them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a well-documented problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB 926185 suggests a Win XP registry modification to fix the problem - but, unfortunately, I can't seem to get it to work.</p>
<p>I add the registry key \DosDevices\F: (F: is the drive letter for the Win 7 system) under MountedDevices\Offline as per KB 926185 but nothing seems to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win XP accesses the Win 7 disc just as before; and when I boot back into Win 7 the restore points are still deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the drive is still there in the registry under MountedDevices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Hi,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">We would be glad to assist you with the restore points on windows 7.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">This problem occurs when you start the computer by using the earlier operating system, such as Microsoft Windows XP. In this situation, the earlier operating system deletes all the restore points that were created in Windows 7.
 The earlier operating system also deletes all Complete PC Backup files except the most recent version of these backup files.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">You could try the following steps and check if the restore points are available.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Method 1: To work around this problem, use the Bitlocker feature on the volume in Windows 7.. When Windows 7 starts, the Bitlocker feature should be enabled on the Windows 7 volume on which Windows 7 restore points are enabled.
 When Windows XP starts, the Windows 7 volume on which the Bitlocker feature is enabled is inaccessible. Therefore, the Windows 7 restore points are intact. Follow the steps below to enable Bitlocker in Windows 7:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click Start, click Control Panel, click System and Security, and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click Turn On BitLocker for the operating system drive. BitLocker will scan your computer to make sure that it meets the BitLocker system requirements. If your computer meets the requirements, BitLocker will inform you of the next steps that need to be taken
 to turn on BitLocker, such as drive preparation, turning on the TPM, and encrypting the drive.<br />
3.&nbsp;If you have a single partition for your operating system drive, BitLocker will prepare the drive by shrinking the operating system drive and creating a new system partition to use for system files that are required to start or recover the operating system
 and that cannot be encrypted. This drive will not have a drive letter to help prevent the storing of data files on this drive inadvertently. After the drive is prepared, the computer must be restarted.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">If your TPM is not initialized, the BitLocker setup wizard will instruct you to remove any CDs, DVDs, or USB drives from the computer and restart the computer to begin the process of turning on the TPM. You will either be prompted
 to enable the TPM before the operating system boots or in some cases you will need to navigate to the BIOS options and enable the TPM manually. This behavior depends on the BIOS of the computer. After you confirm that you want the TPM enabled, the operating
 system will start and the Initializing the TPM security hardware progress indicator will be displayed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">If your computer does not have a TPM, you can still use BitLocker, but you will be using the Startup key only authentication method. All of the required encryption key information is stored on a USB flash drive, which the
 user must insert into the computer during startup. The key stored on the USB flash drive unlocks the computer. Using a TPM is recommended because it helps protect against attacks made against the computer's critical startup process. Using the Startup key only
 method only encrypts the drive; it does not provide any validation of the early boot components or hardware tampering. To use this method, your computer must support the reading of USB devices in the preboot environment and you must enable this authentication
 method by selecting the check box Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM in the Group Policy setting Require additional authentication at startup, which is located in the following location in the Local Group Policy Editor: Computer Configuration\Administrative
 Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives. After the TPM is initialized, the BitLocker setup wizard prompts you to choose how to store the recovery key.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">You can choose from the following options:<br />
1. Save the recovery key to a USB flash drive. Saves the recovery key to a USB flash drive.<br />
2. Save the recovery key to a file. Saves the recovery key to a network drive or other location.<br />
3. Print the recovery key. Prints the recovery key.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Use one or more of these options to preserve the recovery key. For each option that you select, follow the wizard steps to set the location</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Also check if there is sufficient space available on Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Hope this helps.</span></p>

</p><p>Why doesn't Method 1 shown in KB 926185, in which the Win 7 volume is marked as offline in the Win XP registry,&nbsp;work?</p>

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response</p>
<p>
</p><p>As told in the previous post, Windows XP is deleting the restore points that are created in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>There might be many reasons as of why the steps provided in KB 926185 aren’t working. Here are another method that could help you out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: You could try changing the drive letter for the partition that contains Windows 7. Please refer the below link:</p>

</p><p>Following the suggestions in that link, I have tried removing the drive letter for the Windows 7 volume using Disk Management under Windows XP - but that has had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 drive appears to be inaccessible under Windows XP now but it is still managing to delete the Windows 7 restore points.</p>

            <p>It would be a good idea if Microsoft were to issue an update for Windows XP that stopped it deleting Windows 7 restore points - there must be quite a few users who are using the Windows XP/Windows 7 dual boot approach to migrating from Windows XP to Windows
 7 and who are getting their restore points deleted everytime they have to boot back into XP in consequence. It all makes the migration rather more hazardous than it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can&nbsp;imagine also that there will be quite a few users who could be using this migration route but who haven't noticed that their restore points are being deleted, because they may not have thought to check this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They may only find out they've gone when they need the restore points for real - and it may be too late by then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft did issue an upgrade to fix it, I wouldn't have thought that it would be too hard; and it could be regarded, not as an upgrade to XP, but as a migration aid for Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not sure.</p>
<p>In Mail, my Gmail contacts show up BETTER than Gmail because Mail app recognizes nick name for the contact.... Gmail autofill does not</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you make custom email tags, they don't sync well. Like some phone numbers don't sync to the contacts app when they are tagged with Google voice</p>

<h2>            Random Crash Problem</h2>
                    <p>this is very long post, because so many thing that i already tried to solve this by using information that i got by googling. i will tell u from the beginning (i wrote what i already did on note for documentation). i try to make it very short here.<br />
<br />
This issue happened after i got my laptop from service center (22 february 2018). i sent it to solve my cpu overheat issue and some broken keyboard keys issue that already solved now.
<strong>I was told that my memory also got replaced because the found the error on it</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>random crash issue came when i used my laptop in my home. my laptop suddenly/randomly restarted when i leave it (its on idle condition). the issue is reproducible. after some minutes, my laptop crash and restart again.</strong><br />
<br />
so i tried to download and install updates that appear on windows update, update some driver with help from Driver Easy app. but still the crash randomly happen. here you are the crash that i got, so very diverse<br />
IRQL NOT LESS EQUAL - PAGE FAULT In NONPAGED AREA - MEMORY MANAGEMENT<br />
<br />
after several crash, i tried to<br />
<br />
1. memtest86 (only 1 attempt) &gt; result = no error<br />
<br />
2. windows memory diagnostic &gt; result = no error<br />
<br />
3. sfc scannow &gt; result &gt; stopped in the middle of process. i tried 2 times, all fail<br />
<br />
4. try restore using system restore &gt; fail<br />
<br />
5. in my attempt to solve this, suddenly crash happen - CRITICAL PROCESS DIED<br />
<br />
6. try to rollback drivers to old version using reinstall/repair in the installer/setup that gived from manufacturer when i bought this laptop<br />
<br />
7. check HDD using HDD Sentinel &gt; result 100% performance, 100% health<br />
8. check error HDD using HD Tune Pro&nbsp; &gt; result = no error<br />
<br />
9. try to reinstall my windows 10 pro. (I got some problems when trying to reinstall OS, need about 3 days to trial and error around the installation (too long if i post it here and because MAYBE its not related to this problem. In the end (26 february 2018),
 i successed install it by using installer from USB Bootable. before reinstall windows, i format partition C (when my old windows installed but kept partition D and F)<br />
10. So here we are, fresh OS<br />
<br />
But its not finish there, prepare for part after reinstall w10<br />
<br />
===============================================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
after got fresh OS, i did:<br />
1.install some update and some driver&nbsp; from windows update (actually i dont wanna install the driver, but yeah, too late for me to realized what kind of file that i download and install)<br />
2.install driver from partition F (manufacture driver)<br />
3.install some apps like mozilla etc<br />
<br />
<br />
i felt safe this time until, random crash happen again. after 3 crash that actually same code like before: SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION -IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL - PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA<br />
<br />
so i do:<br />
1. run windows memory diagnostic &gt; no error<br />
<br />
2. cmd &gt; sfc scannow &gt; cant complete<br />
3. cmd &gt; chkdsk r f &gt; complete &gt; i look the result from event viewer &gt; no error<br />
4. googling and found out if malwarebytes can cause crash . So I uninstalled malwarebytes taht i installed. and i was amazed how he knew the spesific culprit. so i found Driver Verifier. lets try it after looking the tutorial.<br />
I hope my problem culprit is malwarebyte like i found on googling but this happen when tried Driver Verifier<br />
<br />
5. Crash!!! (happened before i can go to desktop screen (DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION) - LGbusenum.sys (its from Logitech Gaming Software that i installed. the crash was looping&nbsp; 3 time if i'm not wrong until i put i put my USB booatble windows installer
 to reach windows repair. i chose system restore but failed. to make sure its not happen i open cmd &gt; verifier /reset<br />
<br />
6. I go to repair windows ( i dont know its success or not, i leave my laptop). in the end, my laptop rreach the desktop screen<br />
<br />
7. I Uninstalled Logitech Gaming Software<br />
8. Check again by using Driver Verifier, Crash again!!! (DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION) - winio64.sys (its from MSI dragon Center that i installed<br />
9. after success login into desktop screen, i try sfc scannow 3 times. at this time, 3 test = all completed but with result: Windows Resource Pretection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<br />
Details are include in the CBS.Logwindir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log<br />
<br />
10. try DISM<br />
DISM (Check Health)<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth &gt; result = no component store corruption<br />
<br />
DISM (Scan Health)<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth &gt; result= stop at 16,1% &gt; Error: 87 (DISM log file : C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log<br />
<br />
DISM (Restore Health)<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth &gt; result= stop at 88%<br />
<br />
11. i try to reboot and get Window preparing to configure windows<br />
<br />
<br />
===============================================================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
After that i wanna tried from beginning again (27 february 2018 )so I do:<br />
1. Uninstall &amp; delete all drivers that listed on my manufacturer driver setup except WIFI driver + disable service windows update (i dont want it will install driver again like before)<br />
2. uninstall some apps<br />
3. redownload some apps setup<br />
4. try to install driver 1 by 1&nbsp; and also apps ( around 15 minutes - 30 minutes between instalation, after finish installation, i always reboot the laptop.with this way hopefully when crash happen, i can found out the culprit easily). To waiting random crash,
 sometime i using the laptop for browsing/googling, if not i just leave it idle.<br />
5. look good until i install nvidia driver. doing uninstall DDU to make sure uninstall driver is clean before clean install driver. the installation was failed (before this i never fail install nvidia driver). Googling for the solution &gt; disable AV. So i disable
 my defender and it can instal the driver<br />
6. try test the function of nvidia driver = work well. i play dota 2 about 1 hour. its good, no crash.<br />
7. i using regedit to disable DVR because wanna test it by play CSGO game http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=794389603)<br />
<br />
8. after doing edit registry, i reboot<br />
9. leave it on idle condition (only open steam app). suddenly after some minutes it already restart after i came back.<br />
10. check the bluescreenviewer: CRASH!!! PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (ntoskrnl.exe)<br />
and then check whocrashed: 4 files are analyzed<br />
<br />

7. this time when i want to backup the minidump, give me error when try to unhidden folder windows &gt; error applying atributtes to file windows/bfsvc.sys<br />
and now, i didnt find to choose setting for unhidden folder on my disk. nevermind, i got the setting to show hidden folder through control panel<br />
<br />
<br />
===============================================================================================================================================================<br />
i'm so tired to try solve it<br />
<br />
<strong>my question:</strong><br />
<strong>whether this crash problem is caused by software only or hardware only or both?</strong> I suspect my RAM because the only hardware thing that replaced before i got this issue is RAM beside the keyboard. But windows memory diagnostic result is no error.
 memtest86 result is no error ( though only 1 time test). How to make sure my RAM that replaced is the culprit?<br />
if it caused my software, why so much driver alternately caused this crash even I only look 3 crash events (1st driver verifier test whow logitech driver, 2nd test showed MSi dragon center, the last one crash happened after my last activity is installed nvidia
 driver. why long time ago i didt got this issue when i installed all that driver.
<br />
it make no sense for me. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
i also got Interisting info after read discussion by windows 10 community in my local forum. He complained his laptop got random bsod when doing draw or render using CAD with code Driver State Power Failure. and this person refered this as the culprit (windows
 1709) https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1035514/geforce-drivers/any-temporary-fix-for-bsod-caused-by-poopsofts-1709-update-/post/5285142/#5285142<br />
other person in the forum also complained about random restart when he play game or render video. he never had this issue on previous windows version that he used before. He also claimed the temporary solution for himself is setting nvidia control panel to
 using Nvidia GPU not intel with max performance setting on "heavy" apps<br />
i know, its not clear about the code that cause the crash that talked in that Nvidia thread. IF that issue (conflict between windows 1709 and nvidia driver) is happen to me, how to make sure my crash problem is caused its nvidia driver? because when this crash
 problem starting to come, i dont know my windows version build before and after the problem, so i dont know if i'm using different version or not when i never have this problem before.<br />
<br />
edit; added my laptop specs<br />
i7 7700HQ 2,8 GHz - GTX1050 2GB GDDR5 - Memory DDR4 8GB 2400Mhz - 1TB HDD - Windows 10 Pro 64 bit<br />
<br />
<strong>edit:</strong><br />
28 febrary 2018<br />
update what i already did bases on suggestion on nvidia forum when i told my problem (link above) :<br />
<br />
1. download intel driver 4836 and nvidia driver 382 <br />
2. uninstall intel driver and nvidia via DDU in safe mode<br />
3. install intel intel driver 4836 then reboot<br />
4. install nvidia driver 382 then reboot<br />
5. test nvidia driver is working or not &gt; playing game (dota 2) 40 minutes<br />
6. leave laptop on idle condition about 1 hour, using it for browsing, watch youtube about 1 hour<br />
7. shutdown it<br />
<br />
==========================================================================================</p>
<p><strong>1 March 2018</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. retest again, after booting intio dekstop, no wifi connection, i only open windows explorer (My PC) then just click desktop, leave it 4 hours = no crash<br />
2. shutdown it, and then a few hour later, use it for browsing about 30 minutes, see ur next suggestion to make sure &gt; i chose disable fast startup too &gt; then i reboot<br />
3. using it for browsing, but suddenly mozilla crash, i try to linked it to my problem. it said, it can be related to GPU thing like its driver , so i try to disable hardware acceleration, restart mozilla<br />
4. after that, my mozilla still random crash but now only crash tab not a whole app. i dont test it further about crash.<br />
5. i try download offline chrome installer via mozilla<br />
6. i double click the chrome installer and i also directly disable my wifi<br />
7. a couple second after that, my laptop crash (even the setup not had time to showup).
<br />
8. I check the screen: PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA (code is same like before) but with extra info &gt; what failed: win32kbase.sys<br />
<br />
a. check bluescreenview:<br />

9. try to install chrome again to make sure its not from the setup. It can be opened and succesfully install the chrome.<br />
<br />
I wrote about the mozilla thing just to make detail event, because i dont know if its related or not<br />
<br />
========================================================================================<br />
retest again after a few hour later from latest crash ( i immediately shutdown it after installed the chrome)<br />
but now its a "working test", i turn on it, put the laptop to run game app (dota 2) for 3,5 hours &gt; result = no crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>right after i finish my post above (right after infinish my 3,5 hours test for running game) and close mozilla, i wanna shutdownn my laptop, suddenly crash happen again :/ Im not focus it happen after i click shutdown or before that Crash dumps are enabled

<p>Hello Gutama, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You've did a lot of efforts to solve the issue and we can definitely see it. It shows on your post that you've already eliminated drivers and software that are failing and causing Blue Screen errors. Another that is noticeable upon reviewing your very post,
 almost all of the crash logs (.dmp) has this: <strong>Bug Check 0x50: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
The code must be related to hardware, though the crash logs says that it could be drivers that are yet to be verified, it is still ideal to isolate which hardware must be linked to the said error. You've mentioned that you installed new RAM. How many sticks?
 if you have 2 (or more) sticks plugged, it is best to <span>test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
Remember: The info provided is good for isolation. if you found out that <strong>
non</strong> of any hardware</span><span> (RAM sticks)</span><span> mentioned fails, You may proceed on checking your hard drive:
<br />
<br />
Go to Command Prompt (Admin) and input this command: </span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><em>Chkdsk /f /r</em></strong><br />

<p>RAM was replaced by MSI service center. They said they found something error in the old one. So they gived me the new one. But after that, this crash happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop only have 1 stick and 2 ram slots. How to test it to make sure the result? My test before wasnt good enough? i cant move the stick to anoher slot by myself, because it will void my warranty</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check my post, about Chkdsk f r, i already tried it before. The result is good. Why i should try it again? For confirmation?</p>

<p>My bad for the chkdsk, sir. All apologies. But if you would feel like doing it again, it is best advised. Chkdsk, DISM, SFC, and alike are best recommended to be done more than once in a consecutive behavior.
<br />
<br />
Going back to the <strong>Memtest86</strong>, this actually the best recommendation to test the RAM that anyone would know. It is also known to have this what they call
<em>6-8 Passes</em>. Were you able to complete it? More information about the <strong>
Memtest86</strong> here:&nbsp; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/memory-problems/21c3f63f-f570-4522-b2ef-ecc7b7ff6461">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You would also love to check the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">Driver
 Verifier</a></span></em> to track-down misbehaving drivers. <br />
<br />
But then again, <strong>it is highly recommended to check the RAM stick and the slot where it sits.</strong> This will require detaching the PC. Since the PC is still under warranty, lets take it as an advantage to get professional help on doing these things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Please feel free to get back when you have updates. <br />

All the best for you. </p>

<p><strong>I did SFC /scannow again, at 47% verification, it stopped. Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation. What does this mean?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Last time it was successfull 3 times in row</strong>. I dont know why it cant finished. Its not the 1st time failed. At beginning of this crash issue, it cant finished too (just checked my working history above<strong>). Its weird going from failed

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Are driver and software factors eliminated or not like you said at 1st post based on this sfc scan? Or are comingback to be suspected?</strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Btw why doing test for RAM is the most recommended for u? Its based on the result i have done so far?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>And is it normal doing chkdsk need to reboot 1st?</strong> I saw other people can did it on windows. But mine cant. Last time i did chkdsk,it also need reboot 1st althought i still can see the result. (after googling how to see it, via event viewer).
 And the process taking so much time till i think it stuck at 11% forever. I dont know how much time it needed, because i just leave it. Whne i cameback, it alreqdy on desktop screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to chkdsk again (now) its like before:</p>
<p>The type of thebfyle system is NTFS. Cannot lock current drive.</p>

<p><strong>I did SFC /scannow again, at 47% verification, it stopped. Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation. What does this mean?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>One of the factors could be a very busy hard drive. Running the SFC in Safe Mode will eliminate possible factors on why it would stop in certain percentage. We're yet to identify if the drivers (eliminated ones or not) and software are factors in this behavior.
 But <strong>did the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">Driver Verifier</a></span></em>

<p><strong>Btw why doing test for RAM is the most recommended for u? Its based on the result i have done so far?</strong></p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>In this, we're still basing on the crash logs that you've provided, and knowing that there were hardware changes that happened prior to this,
<strong>it is best to test each <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RAM slots</span>, with your perfectly working RAM stick.
</strong><em>Please understand that it sometimes happens to a new product to be defective</em><em> and will need immediate replacement.</em>&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
_______________________<br />
<br />
If we're confident about the RAM sticks, <strong>you can check your Processor</strong>. If you're using an<strong> Intel Processor</strong>, as what we know, they have an exclusive CPU testing applications for their respective units.
<strong>That is the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool.</strong> <em>For further information on how the tool works, and where you can obtain it,</em>
<em>please contact Intel support team</em>. <br />

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p><br />
This is Perfectly&nbsp; normal, and you must be referring about the chkdsk command trying to verify the disk before performing the test. It has its own testing environment (must be like pre-Windows Environment), like the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, which runs
 in DOS environment. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
On the provided results of your hard disk check, we can now say that the hard disk is free from any kinds of issues. No more checks needed for it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand that it is a bit hard to make decisions on testing the hardware physically since this may put most of the things at risk. But with professional help from your vendor, we're encouraging you, knowing that everything should be fine.

<p>I forgot to add latest crash info. Here:</p>

</p><p>On Thu 01/03/2018 21:21:18 your computer crashed or a problem was reported crash dump file: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP This was probably caused by the following module: ntkrnlmp.exe (nt!SeConvertSidToStringSid+0x9442) Bugcheck code: 0x154 (0xFFFF870FB589D000,

 The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time</p>
<p>
</p><p>(This crash info already be put on main post by me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=========================</p>
<p>1. tried Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool. The result is good (all passed)<br />
</p>
<p>2. tried sfc /scannow again in safe mode, it reached 100% verification <br />
but the result is not good i think, same like my result before.<br />
Windows Resource Pretection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<br />
Details are include in the CBS.Logwindir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log<br />
<br />
after restart, windows configuring something, but then couldnt complete update and undo changes. (i forgot the sentences)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean? Problem on OS or Apps or Driver or Hardware?<br />
<br />
3. about Driver Verifier, if you read my post, i did 2 times. but it made my laptop got BSOD looping (about 3 times) before go to repair/recovery screen. i am afraid it can broken my laptop more.
<br />
<br />
And also the result was weird. 1st result said it because driver from my logitech gaming software app, but after I uninstalled it and tried it for 2nd time, it said another driver from MSI dragon center app.
<span><span>it makes me doubt the results. Moreover, i didnt have problem before with these software installed. I afraid&nbsp; this driver verifier give wrong result</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>4. About the crash that can be so much random. Is it also indicated if its hardware problem? In my opinion as common/nonexpert person about this, if its software, why the crash not consistent happened in one point. Because software will always
 run after booting, if something wrong happen to them, why the laptop need different time to know it (by doing crash and restart)?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Like today (4 MARCH 2018), </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>20 minutes im using the laptop, browsing (mozilla), open steam, open game and close it ( only 5 minutes), back to browsing. Then crash happened. If im not wrong its PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA again</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I will try to bring it to Service Center again for checking the RAM memory. what should i tell them? what informations are important here to help them? I afraid if I tell the unimportant ones and miss the important ones</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. If do memtes86 with 6-8 passed result, (updated: passed 7x memtest86) (6 March 2018)</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it still RAM memory and other hardwares need to be tested by service center? Or already confirmed if nothing wrong with the RAM memory stick and others hardware?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what i must do next? </p>
<p>Try update BIOS?</p>
<p>update drivers again?</p>
<p>(although when i used the BIOS and manufacturer's drivers, i didnt get this problem, thats why i hold/dont want to update bios and drivers after reinstall windows).
</p>
<p>Its so weird, same bios, same drivers suddenly cause crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw before i reinstall to windows 10 pro 1709 build, im using older build which also got crash after return from service center( i dont know the build but the characterictic are: interface slightly different than now, windows defender is not merged with
 windows update and others, maybe below 1703 build). Its safe to say, its not about the OS build?</p>

<h2>            skype for Ubuntu 16.04</h2>
                    <p>I am really struggling to find a way to install skype in ubuntu, I have tried everything: downloading skype from the skype website, using the terminal, but no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>I struggle to understand how something that should be so simple to do: download and install, it becomes a complex and time consuming task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any simple instructions on how to achieve this are very welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>a very frustrated new ubuntu user :) (I was hoping to be better than windows, but I have already changed my mind)</p>

<p>After downloading the correct file for Ubuntu (skypeforlinux-64.<strong>deb</strong>), right click on the file in your file manager and choose to open with gdebi (package installer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If gdebi isn't installed (apparently it isn't by default) you could install that first:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sudo apt-get update<br />
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core gdebi </p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, alternatively in a terminal do this to install Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sudo dpkg -i path/to/file.deb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, change "path/to/file.deb" to suit wherever you downloaded the skypeforlinux-64.deb file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I'm assuming you have a 64-bit PC and Ubuntu install. It won't work on 32-bit.</p>

<p>If you installed Skype and used your existing account to log in it should have picked up your old contacts without any other input from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise:&nbsp;To add contacts just use the Search Skype box to search for your friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be exactly the same in the Windows version of Skype I think. Nothing different in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Well, it's different. It's NOT Windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's more secure than Windows but until you get used to it Linux can seem a hassle to use because of the enforced security. But that's what helps to keep the nasties off the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why you had to make the file executable, my copy isn't and it installed fine using Qapt here in Kubuntu. Qapt is similar to Gdebi.</p>

<h2>            Upgrading to larger System C-Drive</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>I just upgraded my Win10 system (Dell XPS 8700) to the Win10 Anniversary release and all is fine.
</p>
<p>My current C-Drive (System drive)&nbsp;is an mSATA 256GB disk and I am running out of space. Most of my data files (Photo Images) reside on a large D-drive. My plan is to upgrade the current mSATA with a 512GB mSATA drive.&nbsp;Can I use the System Image BU utility
 to save and restore the system drive? After the restore, will Windows recognize the 500GB capacity of the new drive?</p>

            <p>Perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When System Image creates the new drive it will replicate that layout including the sizes. Because C is currently the last partition in the sequence it will be immediately followed by an extra partition with a black top bar as unallocated space. Right click
 the C drive in the lower panel and one option should be to Extend&nbsp;Volume as a selectable option (i.e. not greyed out). Click on that and it will take you through the process with the option to use all of the free space by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partitions (or Volumes ) must be contiguous. You can't have part of a drive, then a different partition and then go back to the 1st volume so it is two parts.</p>

            Hi PK Helland ,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Forums.<br />
You can manually download the update from the Microsoft site and install it.<br />
Its better to have all the updates installed on the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope it helps<br />

            <p>Thank you for your response. I followed the steps you gave me and &nbsp;I did not find the folder there. However, you led me in the right direction. I did steps a. and b., then navigated to C:/Windows/ and looked for folders that had the date and approximate
 time that the error occured and found the "system" folder. I clicked on system and the Software Distribution folder was there!</p>
<p>I guess now, I'm just wondering if it's necessary to move the Software Distribution folder back to Windows, AND if so, how do I go about doing this? I just want to make sure I can find it again if&nbsp;I need to.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>I have figured out to how to get windows defender to work with the error code in affect! Go to<strong>start menu, search, run, regedit.exe, hkey_local_machine\software\policies\microsoft\windows defender.&nbsp;Look to your right in the same window and&nbsp;you will
 see DisableAntiSpy... right click on that, then left click modify make the value data zero. min the window go to control panel click windows defender it will ask to turn back on, then click it to. it will say the same error code then close the error code window
 and there is your windows defender!!!! You will have to leave the value data at zero though!! If that works close the regedit.exe window. I wouldnt recommend messing with anything else in the regedit unless your brave so be carefull and always back up before
 you venture in any&nbsp;cpu operation!!</strong></p>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying SkiddyRex78952.<br /><br />Happy New Year to you as well!<br /><br />It sounds like the issue comes down to the controller if that's the case. While I understand it may be frustrating, a replacement is going to be your best option to get you back to playing with multiple controllers properly.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I recently set up a virtual machine (e5 xeon, windows 10 database 2016) to play Fortnite. I installed the Epic launcher until there was a message telling that NET Framework 3.5 could not be installed. But this is probably not the main issue. After I downloaded
 Fortnite in the launcher and tried to start it, an error message appeared which tells I have not installed DirectX 11 feature level 11. I checked the drivers, used an emulator and tried to update the machine(it didn't work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't know what I should do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi KevnW03,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To play Fortnite, it requires you to have a DirectX 11 installed on your computer. Regarding your concern, can you tell us the make and model of your computer where you set up a virtual machine? Also, can you tell us the error message that you received after
 you update the virtual machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the Epic Launcher, it's possible that it needs to install NET Framework 3.5 to run the program. Can you tell us if this was installed on the virtual machine as well?</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>first of all, thanks for your reply. The model number is Standard_DS12_v2 and I set it up with Microsoft Azure. I have installed DirectX 12, but I can't install Net Framework 3.5. The system always says it is not possible to install. The error message of
 Epicgames after I updated Windows was the same. "DirectX 11 with feature level 10 is required to run the engine".</p>

<p>You shouldn't need to use an emulator with the PC version if you are running 64bit Win10 . Or maybe you do if the</p>
<p>developers have been too slack to do a proper conversion ?</p>
<p>(Don't know why the article below mentions 64bit PC. Cpu's have been 64bit for over ten years now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are four virtual machines listed in the article that are known as being suitable for the game, so Azure may not work ?</p>
<p>Apparently <em>PCSX2</em> is a good free option.</p>

<p>How could I reinstall it? I was looking all evening for a link to Microsoft Store, but I didn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In settings was option to uninstall it, so I assume there must easy way to install it again.</p>
<p>Without that app games like Sea of Thieves or Gwent stopped working.</p>

            Hi, the following will re-install all default apps: 
<br />
<br />Press start &gt; search for powershell and run as admin &gt; 
<br />
<br />
<br />Copy and paste this into powershell and hit enter: Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps.

<h2>            Could a game that freeze stop working damage the console&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have xbox one x and wonder if it could make any damage to the console when a game freeze/stop working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you push xbox button to end the game and you get back to desktop (do not need to force restart)&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the console itself do not freeze since it respond and you can end the frozen game.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I playing metro exodus on second last chapter, to get here it have freeze around 5-6 times last two weeks (known issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forza horizon also froze the other day, same thing on forza on my sons one x it happen one time yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appriciate some answers on this :-)</p>

<p>Hi there WindyRunner&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it would damage the console, But I have came across this a few times myself, Normally it has varying reasons, like example the game is on a external hard drive and it couldn't load the section so it froze the game and console.&nbsp;</p>

            Not likely that it will cause any damage to the console it is just a software problem.&nbsp; I have it happen sometimes and have never had any console damage because of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            When a game freezes it shouldn't affect the console in a way that would damage it and there are varying factors that would cause the game to freeze. For sure, there have been known issues with Metro Exodus, I am not sure about Forza though. If you are
 able to play other games just fine than you have nothing to worry about. I don't think the Devs have come up with a patch for Metro in terms of it randomly freezing or just kicking players back to the home screen yet so you'll have to bear with it.

            It shouldn't effect your console specifically however game crashes can lead to corrupt save files if the game were to crash while saving.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for all the answers on so short time :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finished shadow of tomb raider without issues, my other games like bo4 or bf5 have never got frozen before. On forza horizon 4 it have happen twice plus one time on my son x so i just wantes to know it have nothing to say and worry about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember back in time on my xbox 360 then it always completly froze, whats nice with the one is that you can just end the crashed game and open it again or play something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excactly when it freeze the fan slowing down like it do when you exit a game and getting to desktop, so almost like the console exit it and just left a frozen screen. I Using only thw intern disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two times it gave me a loud drrrrr sound when it froze.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to know it’s just a software crash that cant damage the hardware, since the xbox respond and work just fine after closing the frozen game. Maby worse if it completly crash and you must unplug the power, never happened so far :-)</p>

<p>All games on the Xbox One run in a more or less virtualized environment. So the game can't access the hardware in a way to be able to damage it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a game crashes in the virtual environment, and you can still access the Guide menu to end the game, your console is in perfect working order (regarding hardware).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else can be resolved by a reboot of the console. Or in severe cases by re-installing the system from an USB stick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no hardware can be damaged by the game crashing.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Touchscreen acts as mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grimdbu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchscreen acts as mouse</h2>
                    <p>I bought an LG 17mb15t-b touchscreen monitor. I have a pc running Windows 10 (Version 1607 OS build 14393.479).</p>
<p>The touchscreen has a VGA connector and a USB connector.</p>
<p>Windows detects the monitor in&nbsp;Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers as 1 normal Display (VGA connection) and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>1 mouse </strong></span>(USB connection).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The touchscreen acts as a mouse even in Tablet mode, I can see the cursor (even if I have no mouse or keyboard connected) and I can move the cursor with my finger like with a mouse, and I can't scroll in web browser like on a tablet or a smartphone. No swipe
 gestures work. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In Device manager it's not detected as an touch or pen device is basically a mouse not a touchscreen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the LG support site I found they only have drivers for Windows 8.1. Is there any way I can make Windows 10 recognize it as a touchscreen or do I have to change the monitor with another model/brand?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I tried the Windows 8.1 driver from LG site and still same issue. I tried windows driver update and still same issue.</span></p>

<p>delete that add on and clear your cache by going to settings, storage, hdd, press y button, and select clear cache, then restart your console and try downloading it again. this should hopefully work.</p>

<p>Not really, I tried that five times now. It always fails at 80%. There's something going on. Isn't there a way to download this through a PC to a USB stick and then take that to the Xbox?</p>

<p>Seems MS is *** with us. I think the most logical explanation is that the source file Capcom gave MS is corrupted. Let's see how long they take to realize this and fix it. As long as they fix it eventually and don't charge me for the game again once it's
 up and running, I'm game. I still feel this is unnecessary.</p>

<p>I'm just talking to another one that have the same issue. First I thought it was on the root file, of market place, but now I'm not so sure. Because DD is region blocked, and I have GB account, and this friend of mine has US, so it's two different root files...
 I'm looking on the forum, there are people that have issues with Space Shooter Bundle and BF3, so I really can't even picture whats going on.</p>

<p>Region issues can cause downloads to stop at 80%. So Gabriel is correct in that. If a game is region locked and your physical location does not match your account region, you will not be able to download it.</p>

<p>Now I disagree with you Smwutches. Like me, I have an european xbox and an european account, and it ever worked just fine, even tho I live in Brazil. I everyone that i know who bought this game from marketplace is having the same issue.</p>

<p>That's why I said it can cause issues, not that it definitely is the issue in this case. I'm not 100% sure that game is region locked or not.</p>
<p>The region of your console wouldn't matter. It's only the account region and your physical location that matters when it comes to download. So if you live in Brasil, but you have a European account, there will be content you can't download because your account
 region is not set to Brasil.</p>

<p>From play asia web site, it says Dragon's Dogma is Region Locked. Though here, when I had a Brazillian account, and tried to download a locked game, it says it didn't match my region. So I discard the region being an issue for this problem.</p>

<p>what you are talking about is completely different</p>
<p>region locked content dlc is not listed on play asia anything listed on playasia are Disks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no garentee you will receive an errors usually because people do not mismatch theirregions</p>
<p>and its not supported</p>
<p>for the best experience your account region and actual region should match</p>
<p>you will continue to have issues with dlc as long as your account region doesn't match your actual region</p>
<p>&nbsp;it is recommended by the terms of use and support that your account region should reflect your actual region unless you don't live in an xbox live region</p>
<p>then you have to provide your own method of gaining access via live</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>why don't you create an new inregion account and see ifit works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>migration can take a few -30days to complete</p>
