            <p>Same situation here... I was able to run the Poweshell command after I installed Windows 10 and has some missing apps... only for one user, the other user had them all (on the same installation/computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, after a Windows Update, those apps disappeared and when I tried the command again, I get this error message.</p>
<p>It looks like the update was trying to fix what we already fixed and messed things up?..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, please help, this is a massive headache and we need a fix... does it have something to do with some admin settings (this user is an admin)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the start button does not work, Edge disappeared, the Windows Store disappeared (that one was not working and I tried fixing it with that Powershell command)... but this happens only for one of the two users/accounts I have set up on this computer...
 so weird...</p>

            <p>After trying all the fixes talked about above and many other found in other places, I tried a reinstall but by choosing the option to keep all the applications and settings already installed: it did not fix the problem for the user affected (of the two defined).
 So.... I gave up waiting for a fix that would resolve this one user issue and... I copied the few things I really needed for that user (mainly the Outlook files, a few pictures and documents), created a new user (of the local login variety), made&nbsp;sure everything
 I wanted was there and working, associated the new user with the old Hotmail/outlook account&nbsp;and... deleted the old user account: everything seems peachy so far (I do have my fingers crossed though :) ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me that if I went this way from day one, I would have saved myself a lot of trouble and wasted time... for future problems, I think the wise way to go is:</p>
<p>- check the Internet for some possible fixes, if anything that seems to make sense shows up, try it... give this 1-2 hours of research at most</p>
<p>- consider creating a new user while backing up the critical data... this will take 2-3 hrs at most</p>
<p>- consider a full reinstall if everything else fails... it's easy to do this with the online package</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course this would work well if the issue is not a catastrophic one that would require a recovery from a backup (do one at least once every 3-6 months)... the old backup style is now available and with the large HDs these days, we should be able to
 set it automatically to run at least once every 90 days so it should not be a major hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done with this issue... not thanks to a clear direction from Microsoft... they should have at least mentioned something like "this is a serious problem that has so many potential causes that we have not yet figured out a way to consistently solve it without
 creating a new user"; when you look at how complicated the Register info is you realize that it is very, very hard to pinpoint exactly on where the problem is and how to fix it but I would expect a brave recognition of their limitations (we all have them and
 it is a sign of bravery to be honest and upfront about it, like their (Microsoft's) old advice that sometimes, when things do not work as expected, the best solution is to "lower your expectations" :) Sounds silly at first glance but it does have quite a bit
 of wisdom in it :)</p>

            <p>I can't believe how incompetent Microsoft are not fixing this. Notice how Google's android store doesn't do this. I only discovered I had this problem when I tried to open&nbsp;a jpg file and photo viewer had gone, the found the store doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lesson for Microsoft......don't release a product until you've ironed out basic problems, and get out a fix quickly for any that affect normal functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not be reinstalling windows to effect a cure, I don't agree I should have to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linux is calling me, if I'm going to have to mess with command line and powershell I may as well use Linux where I get more control and a lot more help</p>

            <p>I got exactly the same issue as Mahesh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what's wrong with the updates using the Windows Store, but come on, this cannot be the case every couple months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had similar issue already and good thing that this was just bought Surface Book, but wasn't expecting this kind of issues right out of boxing the unit.</p>
<p>Nevertheless this happens again on a different application, this time it's Drawboard PDF. Can't do anything with it, not even uninstall the App (this just makes things 100 times better). It's like you're stuck and you have to Restore to defaults as there's
 no fix for the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to complain too much as obviously it's a bit irritating, but the fact I've not seen any nice and easy fix for it from MS, it's just makes me not buy any new Windows product at all.</p>
<p>Should have gone with Apple or straight Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there's any fix for this ?</p>

            Wow, I really don't &nbsp;know what to say. &nbsp;Reinstalling Windows 10 fixed one problem, then broke the store. Dism doesn't ever work unless you run it local against &nbsp;the .wim file. &nbsp;This operating system sucks so bad. Oh, and I forgot creating a system backup
 image doesn't work either. &nbsp;burned a fresh install to 4 dvds and tested by restoring. &nbsp;Bomb. &nbsp;I am happy I can use the one app, written by a company other than microsoft, that I need to put food on the table. &nbsp;It's really creepy that they are shoving this
 OS down everyone's throat and it is so broken. Reinstalling doesn't work? ****. Why would this OS ever even be released? &nbsp;I feel like I'm in a science fiction movie, where everything has gone to ****.

 "start" menu doesn't even show tiles. &nbsp;It's just the standard start menu. &nbsp;I think I'll create a system restore and just count my blessings.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Trusted PC:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A trusted PC is a computer that you've added to the password reset information for your Microsoft account. This information helps Microsoft verify the identity of the person using the trusted computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: You should only designate a computer as a trusted PC if you're using a private computer. If you share your computer with others, anyone who uses the computer can reset your password without your knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>What is a trusted PC?</strong><span>:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-what-is-trusted-pc-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Trusted Device:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you ever forget your password, or if someone gains unauthorized access to your account, it's easier to reset your password from your trusted PC. When you request to have your password reset from a trusted PC, Microsoft
 trusts that you are who you say you are and doesn't require you to provide any additional information to verify your account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>When you try to view or edit sensitive info related to your Microsoft account—like your credit card details—we might ask you for a security code first, to make sure that only you can get in to your account. But if you
 use a device often you can designate it as a trusted device. On trusted devices, you don't need to enter a security code each time you try to access sensitive info.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can mark a device as trusted just by selecting a check box. When you're prompted to enter a security code to verify your identity, select the “I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code” check box,
 and we'll no longer ask you for a code when you sign in on that device.</span></span></p>

 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9,
 F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If your recovery partition is not available or
 damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>------------------------------------</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This is how the recovery
 partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Acer, press and hold
 ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recovery partition is not working, you could download and reinstall the original edition listed on the COA sticker.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, </strong><strong>how do I find the product key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit.&nbsp;It
 looks like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0f490afc-06fb-47e1-92e9-647fed014b3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/698f531d-e79c-4328-9d9a-e7162dc16736" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: download the ISO for the edition listed on the COA sticker:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span><span>Download Windows 10, 8, 7 ISOs</span></span></p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span><span><span>https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool</span></span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Burn the ISO file to a blank DVD Or create a bootable copy on a empty USB thumb drive.
</p>
<p>Step 2: boot from the install media then format the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Click Install Now</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Accept License Agreement</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Click Drive Options</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Select the drive/s click Delete</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Click New</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Click Apply</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Click OK</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>You can then use the product key on the COA sticker to reactivate: <br />

Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, if you have not already tried and failed, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that has windows 7 with the same bitness
 (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you are likely into a re-install.&nbsp; Takes a lot of time, but not all attended time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You may have to try several to find the right one.&nbsp; I am assuming the original equipment hard drive is still in place.&nbsp; I am also assuming this manufacturer did what he was supposed to do and put that factory restore partition on that drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience F11 is the most common entry key.&nbsp; Remember well, you must start pressing that key the instant the system starts.&nbsp; If you see Windows, you waited to long.&nbsp; Try pressing the key repeatedly about once a second until you see a response that
 looks like what you are looking for.</p>

<p>
</p><p>StrikeX makes computer cases and things for do it yourselfers who want to built their own custom systems:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.aerocool.us/strikex/strikex_case%20index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.aerocool.us/strikex/strikex_case%20index.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Only systems that come with Windows preinstalled&nbsp; from the factory from major system manufacturers are likely to have a built in recovery partition included that will allow you to perform a factory reset.&nbsp; That might allow you to return your system to the
 condition it was in when it left the factory.&nbsp; Sometimes even that doesn't work right or go smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you built your system yourself, someone built it for you or you bought it assembled from parts there isn't going to be a recovery partition and no amount of or combination of F keys is going to help (but you can sure try).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did see one "complete" Strike-X system on Amazon which looks pretty nice but that is not what you have (according to your msinfo32 information):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/CybertronPC-Strike-GTX-Gaming-PC-Red/dp/B007Z36JXM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/CybertronPC-Strike-GTX-Gaming-PC-Red/dp/B007Z36JXM</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely unlikely that even that complete system has a built in recover partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information provided so far, nobody is asking the right questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us how you acquired your system - you built it yourself, somebody built it for you, you bought it preassembled from a shop or a store, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how you acquired your system how do you think the operating system got installed - you installed it yourself, somebody installed it for you, it came already installed on your preassembled system from a shop or a store, etc.&nbsp; Still if it did not
 come from a major manufacturer of complete computer systems there isn't likely to be a recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Windows was installed we can see it is Windows 7 Home Premium so if your system is in such an afflicted state that you want to start over, your system is going to have a functional CD/DVD drive and&nbsp; you are going to have to come up with a genuine
 bootable Windows 7 Premium installation CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your system have a functional CD/DVD drive?</p>
<p>Do you have a genuine bootable Windows 7 Premium installation CD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it would be helpful if you have the CDs that came with the ECS motherboard so you can at least install the basic bits and pieces of software (drivers, etc.) that are specific to that motherboard but you may be able to get that from the Internet if you
 can get on the Internet once you get Windows reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is data on the system you want to keep you do not necessarily have to take the drive out of the system to save it (not everybody has that luxury or knowledge) but you can copy the data to an external device or to the cloud in a variety of ways and
 recover it later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any programs or games you have installed since you first plugged your system into the wall would have to be reinstalled from scratch (even if you used a factory installed recovery partition).&nbsp; You might be able to use some of the data you backed up to restore
 some things to a previous state before you started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Optionally you could see about trying to fix your system issues if they are not too severe but sometimes folks think starting from scratch is their best and only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see about fixing what you have you are going to have to provide more details about specific problems.&nbsp; The folks here in the community are good a fixing problems without having to do a complete reinstall of the operating system...&nbsp; but sometimes
 that might be the "best" option.</p>

 (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you are likely into a re-install.&nbsp; Takes a lot of time, but not all attended time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

<h2>            How to Access Java in Windows XP</h2>
                    How do I access Java on my computer? When I go to control panel I can not find Java. I've never been able to find Java in the control panel on this computer by the way. I need to because I need to clear the Java Cache on my computer.<br />

            That still sounds a little wacky, but thanks to the MS Answers forums implementation we don't know anything about your system you could search your system for:<br />
<br />
<b>javacpl.cpl</b><br />
<br />
and if/when you find it, copy it and paste the javacpl.cpl file nto the c:\windows\system32 folder so it will then show up in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
After opening Control Panel, right click an empty area and choose to 'Sort by Name' and that will reorder thing alphabetically so you should then see it listed (sometimes twice is necessary).<br />

            As long as you're thinking about Java, you might think about uninstalling it, disabling it, or at the very least making certain that you have the latest version (or an old version: Java 7 update 11 is semi-fixed; Java 6 and earlier isn't subject to the

            Hi Parth,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />Greg Carmack provided a link to another thread which may be instrumental in fixing your issue, check it out (original link since I wanted to give the former credit): <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-defender-app-browser-control-marked-in-red/a0f9050a-6e69-4e43-a0f7-0ca77c911d29">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Basically, GreginMich (the original poster of the other link in the one above) said you should perform this command:
<br />
<br />REG DELETE "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware 
<br />
<br />Should that not exist, if you have Windows 10 Pro, you can fix this by going to Group Policy (Windows key + R &gt; type in gpedit.msc) and navigating to the following:
<br />
<br />Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Defender Antivirus
<br />
<br />You then go to the listing "Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus" and disable that, as it will say:
<br />
<br />"If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, by default Windows Defender Antivirus runs and computers are scanned for malware and other potentially unwanted software."
<br />
<br />Keep me posted, Parth.

<p>Hi Ethan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried the fix suggested by you and Greg Carmack. I ran this command-</p>
<p>REG DELETE "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my PC but sadly, the problem still persists - "This setting is managed by your administrator" under Apps &amp; Browser Control.</p>
<p>
I have this edition of Windows- Windows 10 Home Single Language.</p>

            Parth,
<br />
<br />Another thing you could do is repair upgrade (as suggested by Andre Da Costa one time with the same issue), where you use the Media Creation Tool and select "Upgrade this PC now". No guarantees that this will work, but I would like for you to determine if it's worth it or not. Unfortunately from the resources I've looked at, this issue is not worth documented and is difficult to fix, if not impossible.
<br />
<br />When you're ready, click the link here to download the Media Creation Tool: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity.
<br />
<br />Good luck, and thanks so much for hanging in there.

If you click on it - it will take you to the location where you either get the driver download for your operating system (Windows 7) after choosing that from a drop-down OR an explanation of what you need to do (if HP still supports that device) to make it
 work in Windows 7 properly.</p>
<p>Even if you have the original CD/DVD that came with the device - chances are the drivers you will find at the above location (per the actual model of your device) and the associated software will be newer.</p>
<p>Once you download the proper (latest) drivers - you should be able to scan in (select) a higher DPI.&nbsp; The higher DPI you select for your initial scan, the larger the picture (and file size) will be.</p>
<p>You *have* to start with a good image in order to do much to it.&nbsp; Starting larger (higher DPI) is a better thing than starting small and trying to increase the picture size (DPI) without loss of quality.&nbsp; You can rasterize the picture (which will smooth
 certain things and such so that you can enlarge/shrink the picture with minimal quality loss from the original rasterized image) but that is a pretty specialized thing that I would not recommend for photographs.</p>
<div>Verify that you are using the correct resolution for the scanning task. Use the table below as a guideline to set the resolution for specific tasks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><span>Scanning task</span> </th>
<th><span>Resolution (ppi)</span> </th>
</tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Images for E-mail or for viewing on a CRT monitor</td>
<td>75 - CRT monitors display information at 72 dpi</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low quality images for display on a LCD or plasma monitor</td>
<td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Text <br />
<br />
Medium quality images</td>
<td>300</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High quality images for printing</td>
<td>600<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High quality images for enlarging and printing</td>
<td><br />
1200 dpi or higher<br />
Higher resolutions require large amounts of disk space and slow your computers performance. You may encounter memory errors when scanning at the higher resolutions.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get the "Director" installed...</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to enable scanning at a higher color depth:<br />
1. In the Director, click Settings.<br />
2. Point to Scan Settings and Preferences.<br />
3. Click Scan Preferences.<br />
4. Click the Quality vs. Speed tab.<br />
5. Click Scan at Maximum Pixel Depth , then click OK.<br />

            <p><span>Hi vineel nani,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I gather that you want to know the difference between Windows 8 Developer Preview, Windows 8 Consumer Preview and Windows 8 full
 version. You have ISO files for all the 3 versions and want to know about which is the best version to install.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Congratulations for your decision to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note the Windows 8 OS went through three main phased of development:
<strong><span>Windows 8 Developer Preview &gt; Windows 8 Consumer Preview and Windows 8 full release version</span></strong>. The developer preview was the first release of Windows 8 and both developer
 preview and consumer preview are pre-release versions of Windows 8. The Developer Preview was released for Developer to test the Operating System and develop Apps for Windows 8. The Consumer Preview was the Beta version of the software release for testing
 purpose. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows 8 is the full release version which has been released after developer and consumer level testing.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So the best version for you to install would be the Windows 8 version.
</span></p>
<p><span>Please note, while installing Windows 8 from the ISO files on your computer you will have to use the Windows 8 Product Key to install.
 In case the same product key has been used on another computer to install and activate Windows 8 then the product key may not activate on your computer. So, I suggest checking the Product Key and installing the product if not already installed on any other
 computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about Windows 8 please refer to the following Windows links:

<h2>            Windows 10 flashing screen</h2>
                    Installed Windows 10 this morning. Since then my home screen is constantly flashing off and on. &nbsp;I can't do anything on my computer. There are no icons on the desktop, my cursor is an arrow with a loading circle next to it or sometimes it's just the loading
 circle. I can get to the task manager by pressing ctrl, &nbsp;alt, del, but have now idea how that helps. The screen shows my regular background, &nbsp;but, nothing else. &nbsp;My computer is ruined because of this and I &nbsp;need help in regular talk, not tech speak, please.

            I have this problem as well. My laptop is an HP Pavillion dm4-1160us that was running Windows 7 with all current updates. &nbsp;The Windows 10 interface loads fine until I enter my password to unlock, then it quickly populates the desktop and immediately begins
 flashing rapidly and all the icons and apps appear and reappear several times per second. &nbsp;Nothing can be done to interact with it in this condition -- mouse and keyboard have no effect, except that CTRL-ALT-DLT does work, which allows me to restart (but the
 problem recurs). &nbsp;I have tried booting in Safe Mode but that gives me a frozen screen. &nbsp;Rather than revert to 7, I'm currently waiting until Microsoft lists a solution. &nbsp;I have read that this happened with some Dell and HP screen drivers in early pre-releases
 but that MSFT thought it had fixed the problem. &nbsp;I assume it's&nbsp;still&nbsp;a display&nbsp;driver issue.

            I have been on the phone with support for two hours now with this problem. Long story short,&nbsp; there are drivers that are not compatible with Windows 10 on my Lenovo IdeaPad. The tech support tried to find updates and couldn't.&nbsp; Now I am waiting for a ticket
 # and trying to go back to 8.1.&nbsp; The tech said this could take 4 to 5 hours.&nbsp; Was I dreaming when I read that Microsoft would check for compatibility before upgrade? YIKES... started this morning at 6 am... It is 5pm now....

<p>CTRL-ALT-DELETE, choose restart, and while it boots hold down SHIFT.&nbsp; You should get an option of choices, one of which will lead you to safe mode.&nbsp; I believe you also get these choices if you hold down your power key to reboot.</p>

</p>
<p>Also, we are far from being the only ones -- There is multiple reports, like here:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/windows-10-screnn-blinking/06f5d644-5b67-46ab-b52a-1a1dc4cd93d2</p>

            Exactly, I &nbsp;have a call into tech support as a last resort. I'm waiting for a call back. They said it would be approximately 168 minutes. They're experiencing higher than normal calls. No kidding. I even tried putting in my recovery disks from when I bought
 my computer and it won't even run those.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ACER TL and exactlz the same. Came so far to the safe mode restart, there are some tutorials out there. but please know that the button changed from F8 to F4. Just to mention. I loaded the newest Drivers I could get for graphic Card and Screen via
 usb&nbsp;over my Surface but nothing changed.&nbsp;I am also still looking for a solution :(. ..and I am frustrated and disapointed :). Glad if somebody would have a solution...also safe mode even&nbsp;I choose the Network enabled one does not allow me to enter the Internet
 to load updates dierectly...maybe i just try to Change the Screen and take My touch one back when this is solved :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem. &nbsp;After installing the upgrade my screen flashed every second or so and was not able to do anything as the cursor was also the 'loading circle'. &nbsp;Screen resolution was lower than normal so I'm guessing maybe a graphics driver issue.
 &nbsp;Checked the vendor for a Windows 10 driver and not available so thankfully from other posts was able to go back to Windows7. &nbsp;Pretty disappointing that the upgrade couldn't figure this out. &nbsp;I suppose I could spend the weekend trying to debug but I don't
 see it's worth it. &nbsp;Thanks to those who posted ways to get to safe mode or I would have been stuck:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Boot in safe mode - Hold down shift key then click 'restart'</p>
<p>2) In safe mode, get to settings screen (Windows Key - I) then find the menu option to revert back to Windows 7, or whatever you came from</p>

            I have also <em>flashing screen problem</em> after installing <em>Windows 10</em>. A friend of mine also have it. Both of us have Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro laptops.&nbsp;In our case flashing doesn't appear all the time. If it appears usually&nbsp;entering few times&nbsp;START
 stops it.&nbsp;I hope <em>Microsoft</em> will soon pay attention on this problem.

If the problem just started recently, try a system restore to when it was working:

You may also try reinstalling the InDesign program and see if that fixes the problem.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in<br />
Safe&nbsp;Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should
<br />
be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google<br />
Earth)&nbsp;has been known to cause this issue.<br />
<br />
Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by
<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back
<br />
to ADMIN.&nbsp;This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following
<br />
the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same<br />
password&nbsp;(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if
<br />
needed.<br />

If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one

            I had this issue as well,&nbsp; I repeatedly tried the F8 option but got a loud beeping and had to quickly shut down the comp. Got an error message about windows not shutting down properly and went thru the F12 boot option button and somehow that fixed the
 problem.&nbsp; In doing all this I learned that I really do need two accounts and not just one admin. account.

Glad you were able to resolve the issue.<br />

Actually it best to have several extra Admin Accounts - make them and use the same password.<br />
Use is emergencies.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t re-allocate unallocated space from deleted partition</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a partition a while ago for half my disk to use for backups. I decided I don't need this anymore, and am most likely going to use an external 1TB drive to store backups. I deleted the partition, but now the space is "Unallocated", and I don't have
 the option to Extend Drive on the other half of my drive (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3f559f4-52ae-4936-aff4-a5aca04901d7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a 3rd party partition manager, but couldn't select the unallocated space to merge to my existing space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried using Diskpart from the CMD window, but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I re-allocate this space to my existing space (shown above)?<br />

            <p>I tried the link you recommended, but didn't find any solution to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of them were suggesting different 3rd party programs for the problem I'm having, but it seems like the unallocated space I want to merge has to be directly adjacent to the space I want to merge it to. Is there any way around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see by the image, there's a 858MB space for Recovery that is between my primary partition and the unallocated space I want to merge with. Is there any way to move the 858 space on the other side of the unallocated space so I can merge the two
 that I want to merge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>How do I transfer game console licenses&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apota  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I transfer game console licenses&#63;  </h2>
                    
<p><span>Well, I have 2 Xbox consoles. I have an 250GB Elite and a 320GB Slim. &nbsp;I'm trying to get all of my console game licenses over to my Slim. I have a bunch of lisences on my Elite because I had that console first and then when I got the Slim they started
 going over there. &nbsp;So, they are split between the 2 and I don't know what is where anymore.
</span></p>
<p><span>I followed the instructions that say to use the transfer license function on the Elite console, and it says all the licenses are transfered, but where are they transfered too? &nbsp;I really don't understand it. &nbsp;It says after you transfer the licenses
 you need to download the content again to transfer the local licenses. So, I tried downloading all the content all over again on my Slim thinking it will transfer the licenses. &nbsp;But it's not re-downloading the content like it says it is. &nbsp;Because it takes
 like 2 seconds to download and it says it's done, but it doesn't take 2 seconds to download 6.7GBs, etc. &nbsp;So, it's not downloading the content. &nbsp;I thought it was just downloading the license info then, but it's not because I tested the Elite and the licenses
 are still on there. They didn't transfer any place, unless using that option on my Elite transfered all the licenses to my Elite? &nbsp;But why is it saying I need to re-download them? &nbsp;The only reason I can see it saying that is because it's thinking your doing
 it on a new system or one that had a new hard drive where the content isn't on it yet? Can somebody please help me? &nbsp;Thank you!</span></p>
<p>Here is a copy of the info Microsoft has on there website regarding it, but I must be doing something wrong because it's not working:</p>
<div>
Transfer content licenses
</div>
<div>
<p>You can transfer content licenses from one console to another once every four months.</p>
<p>If your console was recently repaired, or if you’ve purchased a new console, use the license transfer option on your console to transfer content licenses. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>On your console, sign in to Xbox LIVE using the gamertag that you used to purchase the content.
</li></ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Go to the&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>Account</b>. </li></ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Your Billing Options</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>License Transfer</b>. </li></ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to transfer the content licenses. </li></ol>
</ol>
<p>After the licenses are transferred, you need to download the content again to update the local licenses. This way the content can be used by other profiles on your console and when you’re not connected to Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>For information about how to download previously purchased content, please see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Buy and redownload content from Xbox LIVE</a>.</p>

<p>Running the license transfer from the Elite transfers all of your licenses to the Elite. The downloads are so small because they are only refreshing the license for each item rather than downloading the whole thing.</p>

<p>Hi All. I purchased a new laptop 3 days ago and its been running fine until Windows 7 performed some updates. Since then I am unable to create a new folder - it comes up with the error message</p>
<p>'Unable to create the folder 'New Folder' The system cannot find the file specified.'</p>
<p>I have searched the forums and performed the following.</p>
<p>- Checked the registry - everything was fine</p>
<p>- Ran System File Checker - everything was fine</p>
<p>The only way I have been able to create a new folder is by using command prompt which I shouldnt have to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas anybody please???</p>

<p><span>Hi gashalasha7,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 which location are you creating the new folder on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First check if you are able to create new folder on a different location.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you face similar issue while creating new folder on different location I would suggest that you scan the computer for any malware or virus infections.</span></p>
<p><span>The below scan only works on 32 bit version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>You may use Microsoft security essentials to scan your computer</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you create a new user account and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a user account</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Plugged in, not charging</h2>
                    My HP Laptop was charging fine until a few days ago. It now turns off if I unplug it, and when&nbsp;I turn it back on, it says that the battery&nbsp;storage is running low and asks if I want to continue with startup. When it&nbsp;is plugged in and on it&nbsp;says "plugged
 in, not charging." If I click on the battery symbol on my task bar, it says 100%. I do not understand why this happens or what happened to the battery, as this laptop is only about&nbsp;one year old.

<p>Most manufacturers do not (innately) warranty the batteries for more than one year *for a reason* (I'll let you figure that one out. heh)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>May not be the battery, but it is unlikely it has ANYTHING to do with the Operating System as what you said indicates you get the warning from the HARDWARE first about the battery running low when powering up. &nbsp;Could be the charging component of your system
 is broken, the power adapter is broken or the battery is actually bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact the manufacturer (and/or those you purchased the system from) about the situation. &nbsp;If you have an alternative power adapter to charge with (even if it is an auto/air one) - try it now to see if the adapter is the bum part. &nbsp;Try charging the battery
 without ever booting into the OS by figuring out how to get into the system BIOS and letting the system charge while in there.</p>

    <title>Least Privilege, Windows 10, and Microsoft Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cruis3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Least Privilege, Windows 10, and Microsoft Accounts</h2>
                    <p>We are supposed to run with all users as standard, non-admin accounts. However, the first account used to log onto the computer is by default the administrator account. This would seem to violate the policy of least privilege, especially if one considers
 that most people are really not that savvy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that UAC keeps accounts running as a standard user and prompts one if administrative privilege is required; but, if the only impediment to that is clicking "Continue", which most people are going to do without thinking, because if they do not,
 then the action they are attempting will not work, then the system is literally no better than just running as an administrator all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one bothered by this? At a minimum, a better prompt, indicating what app needs what permission, or what application is trying to install itself, as well as the requirement to re-enter a password or PIN might make people a bit more cautious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue is that disk encryption will not work if you do not use a Microsoft Account for that first account which is the default administrator account. So if you are trying to keep things safe with a separate local admin account, you lose disk encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that for all the talk about things being secure, nothing has changed, everyone is an admin, and machines will be pwned like always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; John</p>

            <p>Every Windows installation needs an Administrator account in order to perform tasks that require Administrator permissions. For that reason, when you clean install Windows 10, the first account is automatically an Administrator account. All subsequent accounts
 are Standard users.<br />
</p>
<p>Many users are unaware that they should be using a Standard account for their day-to-day computer use. I agree that it would be a good idea for Microsoft to include a prompt for this when installing Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see what applications or tasks require Administrator permissions, look for the shield symbol on the icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk encryption works fine in a Local account.</p>

            <p>I work in IT, I understand the reason for an administrator account. I also understand that security and convenience have nothing to do with each other (god help us when the IoT really gets going.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then I come home and I see regular people using computers with various levels of ability, but none understanding how the hardware, software, and internet work...they agree to items without understanding what they are agreeing to, whether a EULA, an application
 requesting access to various resources, or a website wanting to install something. They just want to do something and they know that if they do not agree, they will not be able to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just think that the default setup should walk users through the creation of&nbsp;a local admin account and explain why it needs a separate password that they should use when they need to perform certain tasks. A first step, perhaps, in getting people to think
 before they do something...Nah, what am I thinking, people won't think, especially if it is inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the disk encryption, yes, bitlocker will work with a local account (on pro), the message I received on a Windows 10 Home machine, in settings, was that the C: drive would not be encrypted without a Microsoft Account. Probably has something to do
 with the fact that it wants to store the recovery key with your MSA.</p>

            <p>Even though I see your point, I think that there is little chance that Microsoft would change this, because you are basically asking them to go back to what they had.&nbsp; In past Windows versions they asked for the Administrator account password and then for
 the user accounts that the person wanted to setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have to ask why did they drop it?</p>
<p>And I think the most likely answer is that based on the feedback they got, people fall into two categories.</p>
<p>The ones that already know all of this and can set it up for themselves, and the ones that won't have a clue no matter how much text you put on the screen.&nbsp; So instead of pushing away the novices, they just dropped the Administrator account in favor of the
 idea that UAC is "good enough".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah the security model stinks, where you ask a novice if you should do something, but inconveniencing them by forcing them to log into another account, really doesn't add any more security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I really get your comments.&nbsp; You see the shield on the operations you need permissions on, and prompts for things like installs or running a program in compatibility mode already tell what program is requesting the permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But anyways you might want to use the Windows Feedback app to submit the suggestion.</p>

            <p>WLM uses the IE print engine, so that is likely why you cannot print.&nbsp; See here:&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think method 1 is the issue.&nbsp; Try 2, 3 or 4 and check in IE.&nbsp; Once you fix it in IE, then it should work in WLM.</p>
