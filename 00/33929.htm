<h2>            Can i remove and reinstall windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I was just wondering if I could remove and reinstall windows from 8.1. Doing that, will it reinstall normal windows 8 instead of 8.1?
</div>
<div>Also, when is the windows 8.1 recovery media or ISO recovery files available to download?
</div>

            <p>Hi Conor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your PC came with <span><span>Windows 8</span></span> you might be able to restore it back to
<span><span>Windows 8</span></span> by refreshing your PC. Your personal files won't be affected, but apps that didn't come with the PC will need to be reinstalled. For more info, see

            <p>Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These options are built-in to Windows 8 also. </p>

            A full screen picture of a bridge or river. &nbsp;I want my desktop back when it wakes up. &nbsp;ALSO, this pewter is now suddenly asking me to log in with my password. &nbsp;It is not set up to require a password. &nbsp;These 2 problems have just started within the last
 week. &nbsp;I simply want my pewter to wake up &amp; see my desktop with my icons. &nbsp;I have not installed any new software or made any changes. &nbsp;This morning I hit cntrl/alt/delete which got rid of the picture but took me to the password protected log in screen. &nbsp;The
 only way I can fix this right now is to reboot. &nbsp;I know micropuke is screwing with all win7 &amp; 8 users. &nbsp;Why are they screwing with win 10 now? &nbsp;TY

<p>Sometimes it is a nice picture... but then they change it, to something weird or sometimes I don't even know what it is. mostly I just find it seriously annoying.</p>
<p>And the constant request for feedback - seriously, must we rate everything all day long, I am totally over it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to choose what I see on my own computer, not have you put pictures up there all the time. it is an invasion.</p>
<p>Please stop the pictures, or at least if I click that I like one, just leave that picture tehre, don't keep annoying me with different ones.</p>

            The procedures described did not solve the problem. What is additionally annoying is that the same picture is shown again also if previously it had been indicated as "not liked".

    <title>Black bars on sides of monitor after moving to new home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1john5vs7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black bars on sides of monitor after moving to new home</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 on my machine. 2 days ago everything was totally fine with the display. I then moved to a new home. I setup the same computer with the same monitor and I have them connected with the same VGA cable. However, when I booted up, I noticed
 that suddenly my display was coming up as a square on a rectangular, widescreen LCD monitor. The resolution of the system is set to 1024x768. When I try setting it to anything else in the list of options, my monitor intermittently dumps to a black screen with
 a floating warning that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Not optimum mode</p>
<p>Recommended mode</p>
<p>1600 x 900 60 Hz"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is there is no 1600x900 option in the list of available resolutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on a Samsung monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that this particular system is setup such that it has two VGA outputs on the back of the box. One of them is coming off of the motherboard and doesn't display anything if I plug in to it. The other is coming off of the video card, and it is
 this output that is giving me the headache!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recognize there are several other posts on the forum about black bars on the side of the screen, but after reading through them they didn't seem to be addressing what's causing my problem. I note that if I switch to a higher resolution, I can get the black
 bars to disappear, but I still get the "not optimum mode" warning and this means that every 60 seconds my screen goes black, I see the warning, and I have to push "source" on the monitor itself to get it to cycle back over to display anything. Very frustrating
 and not an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll also check with Samsung to see about possible workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a secondary question, can anyone explain to me why it is that this kind of thing ONLY ever happens to me when I move? It seems like each time I move to a new location, something magically goes haywire with my machine and it's usually display-related.
 Am I knocking something lose? Does the machine being disconnected from a power source for a couple of days cause it to go into some kind of really bad default mode? I'm confused. To me, if it was working when I last shut it off, it should be working when I
 turn it back on again barring some kind of severe trauma like dropping it.</p>

            <p>With due respect, I fail to see how this is a solution to the problem specified at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I have not asked my home inspector about this. The reason I have not asked my home inspector about it is twofold:</p>
<p>1. I do not have a home inspector. We are renting.</p>
<p>2. A home inspector wouldn't know anything about computer hardware issues unless s/he happened to be a hobbyist on the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to await assistance with this problem.</p>

            <p>My point exactly - it has nothing to do with where you live, so why would you bring that up as a possibility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using an LCD/LED monitor you should know that these monitors have a native resolution equal to the number of pixels in the monitor. That native resolution is the video resolution you should be using. Based on the information you provided, the
 native resolution of your monitor seems to be 1,600 x 900.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to operate the monitor at anything other than its native resolution, the graphics card or chip in your computer has to process the image to make it fit into the non-native resolution. At the very least, the image will not look sharp and at the
 very worst the graphics chip will be unable to work with the non-native resolution and your monitor will simply go black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, VGA is the wrong connection to use with a LCD/LED monitor because that provides an analog signal that the monitor then has to convert to a digital signal. The conversion requires additional processing that can interfere with the image on the
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum up, you should be using a HDMI connection and a video resolution of 1,600 x 900. If your graphics card or chip can't produce that resolution - it must very quite old - then you need to buy a graphics card that can deliver that resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most any modern graphics card has an HDMI connector, but if your monitor does not have a HDMI connector - it's an older monitor - then you can also use a DVI connection, which is a digital connection. You'll need a DVI cable.</p>

            <p>Mate, I brought up the move because everything worked 100% fine before the move and it worked 0% fine after the move. There were no hardware or software changes made, so I assume the move had something to do with it because computers don't typically magically
 decide to stop working. For example, perhaps the computer was damaged in some small way in transit that would result in the display adapter going haywire. Perhaps knowing that there was a move could prove to be a diagnostic criterion that would allow a knowledgeable
 person to help find a solution. But you go right ahead and be tongue in cheek about it if that's what gets you through the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This monitor does not have an HDMI I/O port. Only VGA adapters for Mac or PC. I think the Mac option is the DVI you're talking about and I have one of those lying around from an old P.O.S. Mac PowerBook that died just out of warranty that I'll try using
 in lieu of the VGA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it works, great, but you get zero thanks because you comported yourself like an **** instead of offering neutral help. Just because you know something I do not does not mean you are superior to me because I know plenty you don't, I guarantee you. So
 humble yourself a bit or don't bother giving an answer next time.</p>

            <p>Well deleting files/folders from explorer, unless they are simply data files is a v.bad idea, as a result of this you have probably corrupted any uninstall option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You boot into safe mode by repeatadly hitting F8 as soon as you pwr on, or untill you get a bios beep, eventually the safe mode boot screen will appear, once booted Control Panel&gt;Uninstall a program</p>
<p>If that doesn t work you would need to use Dell support forums for advice</p>

<h2>            Setting a custom logon&#47;logoff sound in Windows 10 not working</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded one of my desktops from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to set my logon and logoff sounds to the Windows NT 4.0 sounds but when I set them, they don't play. I have already edited the registry key to display the logon/logoff option in sounds and have set the sounds to the NT versions in .wav, but they never
 seem to actually play when I log in or out. I have sound drivers installed and the volume is at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try a tool for setting the startup sound in Windows 8 but it made the sound play really badly.</p>

    <title>Media player issue with seeing my DLNA server. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media player issue with seeing my DLNA server.</h2>
                    
<p>I've had this issue plenty of times. Rebooting the Xbox One has never worked. &nbsp;Sometimes rebooting my router works. &nbsp;My router is a custom firmware Asus with a miniDLNA server. &nbsp;Usually before I lose my mind and break my Elite system, I'll shut off the Xbox
 and go on my Ouya. &nbsp;I know the Ouya is more "open" than the Xbox, but the Xbox has slowly turned into what my PS4 is, a paperweight. &nbsp;I've tried troubleshooting the issue in a myriad of ways, but in the end when the Xbox doesn't end up ever working, the Ouya
 saves the day. &nbsp;I'm wondering if it has something to do with me or is there something I can do on the Xbox to make it see my router better? I tried checking online, but most of the stuff I find when I search DLNA, xbox, media player, etc., all I get is how
 to setup a dlna server on my pc to stream to the xbox. &nbsp;That's not what I am looking to do.</p>

<p>No, it is connected via wifi. Usually when it is not connecting, I'll test hulu and netflix and they're fine, so I am online. I'll also test the connection settings. &nbsp;Also, the Ouya is sitting right next to it.</p>

<h2>            Sound Output for Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have a Dell Latitude docked at my desk. Yesterday I un-docked it and re-docked in a conference room with a Sharp HDMI TV screen. System sounds and iTunes played perfectly over the speakers and on the TV. When I un-docked from the conference room and
 re-docked at my desk. I lost sound output to my speakers. I still have the icon in the system tray. But no applications will display (no System Sounds or iTunes).<br />
<br />
I can only use Skype through my USB headset. Adobe Flash Video and other web videos will only play sound over my USB headset. iTunes will not play on any output.<br />

<h2>            delete old microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>how do i delete an old Microsoft account. My laptop has an old email address associated to its login and sleep modes but none of the last 3 passwords I have written down are working.&nbsp; Because the email address is no longer valid resetting the PW and then
 updating the email address is not an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I go to <strong><em>Setting -&gt; Accounts -</em></strong><em><strong>&gt;</strong><strong> Email &amp; App Accounts
</strong></em>I can see the old account and my other active account, but the <em>
<strong>Manage </strong></em>option routes me to the Microsoft page where it is again asking for my password.&nbsp; So How do I delete the old account or merge the old with my new account. ,&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this old email address is tied to my computers Sleep mode I can't
 log in after it&nbsp; goes to sleep, I have to do a force reboot to bypass the sleep mode's re-log in process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm on Windows 10.</p>

 , i have cleaned my fans , power supply and shut down some of the apps , and cleaned up the computor of pic ect and it still shuts down , i tryed adjusting power in the system , noticed some difference , not all , it shuts down faster , i have looked at what
 was running on back ground only 50% of&nbsp; my burning program is using up , nothing else except for 1 or 2 percent for other things , what can i shut down or get rid of , i use internet explorer thats it

<p>If you intend to run a malware scan, I suggest you use a number of different software products (because no one or two products are capable of catching everything).&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).&nbsp; I know that's a lot of programs, but doing so will make as reasonably SURE as possible your
 system is clean and rule this out as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>===================================================================================================================</span></p>
<p><span>I'd like to run a more extensive diagnostic test of your hard drive and RAM (both of which cac cause this problem:</span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get
 the diagnostic utility from: </span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>=====================================================================================================================</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a more extensive troubleshooting
 routine to try to identify the problem (assuming it is a software problem):</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule it at the next restart.&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove
 that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning shutdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>You may have a problem with one of your device drivers.&nbsp;
<span>
Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do so for as many devices as you have time for - this will help your system in other ways besides just possibly resolving
 this issue), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>Here are sosme guidelines on system maintenance that might help you save space and improve performance:</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of
 various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software
 solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop).</span></p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands
 of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster (though perhaps not
 so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>=================================================================================================================</span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<h3> aldc  say:</h3>
<h2>            System says processor and memory&#40;ram&#41; are not available&#63;</h2>
                    I uninstalled McAfee software that was running perfectly.&nbsp; I reinstalled new McAfee software and it failed.&nbsp; The McAfee technician looked at my system and maintenance&gt;system window and it showed that the processor and memory(ram) "not available."&nbsp; According
 to the McAfee tech, this is a problem with my Dell Inspiron 530 computer.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any thoughts that you have on how to restore system so that it lists (1) the type of processor and (2) amount of ram.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi Aldc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Have you made any other changes to your computer other than uninstalling McAfee software?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Why do you uninstalled McAfee software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows
 7</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:
</strong>System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder
 (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators
 group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>, the <strong>sfc /scanonce</strong>, or the <strong>
sfc /scanboot</strong> commands to repair its contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:
</strong>You may also try to create a new user and then check if it helps.</p>

</strong>If it works fine in new account, then your current account might be corrupted.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Starter.  Will connect wireless but no internet access.  Can connect to other routers</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 starter.&nbsp; I have been able to connect to this wireless router for several month. Suddenly it says no internet access.&nbsp; I have enabled and disabled the wireless card and have deleted the connection profile and recreated it.&nbsp; I am
 connected to the router but "no Internet access". I can still connect to other routers ex home, family, but not this one.&nbsp; I brought over another computer running XP and it connects.&nbsp; I have successfully connected my Iphone as well.&nbsp; I am running MS Security
 Essentials and just did a full scan.&nbsp; I have not upgraded to Windows Service Pack 1.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to fix this? Thanks in advance.

    <title>Sound Blaster Recon3di Control Panel Crashing in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flynhawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Blaster Recon3di Control Panel Crashing in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a home-built computer with an i5-6600K that is water-cooled and mildly overclocked and 16GB of Geil Super Luce DDR4-2400 in a 4x4x4x4 setup, and a Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 7 motherboard which has, among other things, a Creative on-board audio chip which
 uses software called Sound Blaster Recon3di Control Panel all running on Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit in a well-ventilated case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to open the app it crashes giving me the following info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;APPCRASH<br />
&nbsp;Application Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBRcni.exe<br />
&nbsp;Application Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.12.3.0<br />
&nbsp;Application Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;53298cd2<br />
&nbsp;Fault Module Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;KERNELBASE.dll<br />
&nbsp;Fault Module Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.1.7601.23889<br />
&nbsp;Fault Module Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;598d4d26<br />
&nbsp;Exception Code:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;e0434f4d<br />
&nbsp;Exception Offset:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0000c54f<br />
&nbsp;OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.1.7601.2.1.0.768.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are no viruses or other malware on my computer having done scans with AdwCleaner, Sophos, CCleaner, Malwarebytes to include their Junk Removal Tool and anti-rootkit scans, Temp File Cleaner, and Farbar Recovery Scan. I've done an SFC /SCANNOW
 which reported it had found and repaired files, but that it could not repair FDEPLOY.dll, FDE.dll, GPEDIT.dll and GPTEXT.dll. I tried doing an SFC /SCANFILE for both KERNELBASE.dll (in the \windows\system32 directory) and SBRcni.exe which is the executable
 for the SB Control Panel software, however Windows reported that it could not perform the requested operation in both cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and re-installing the SB software. I looked for an updated driver for the audio chip, but have the latest one (which is 6.0.101.1049 from Dec 15, 2016). I have not tested the memory which is running at its rated speed and timings
 in the XMP profile. I have no problems with any other software on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KERNELBASE.dll appears in several locations throughout my computer and I've only tried the SFC /SCANFILE on the one in the \system32 directory. Should I try all of the others or am I barking up the wrong tree? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

 pulling 144 fps at 1080p. I also searched Gigabyte's and Creative's sites prior to posting here. /edit]</p>

<p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p><span>If you have issues opening Internet Explorer because of DLA(Drive letter access) program, then you may follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Close all Internet Explorer windows.
<br />
</span><span>2.&nbsp;Open a new Internet Explorer window. You will see an Internet Explorer window that states that the "Drive Letter Access" Internet Explorer add-on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can cause Internet Explorer to crash or to stop responding. <br />
</span><span>3.&nbsp;Click
<strong>Always open Internet Explorer without this add-on</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer this KB article for more information:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>So then I have downloaded Windows 10 ISO on a USB flash drive. Then I managed to click on The Repair Computer tap.</p>
<p>I have tried alot of things many times, but still won't work. After serching on the web for alot of&nbsp;</p>
<p>fixes, I still had no luck. When I press the F2 options now with the USB Flash drive in, it only lists the USB on boot options not Windows Boot Manager. It's like my old files and all is gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to reset my computer it stands "The drive Windows is installed on is locked. Unlock the drive and try again" I searched on the web for that to I tried many fixes with no sucsess.</p>
<p>The computer was bought this summer so It's pretty new. I haven't installed anything lately, Windows 10 worked nicely about a mounth before the isuess came. I haven't dropped my PC or caused any other damage to it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So the thing I got out of that was that I need to re-install Windows 10 Pro. But will I lose my activation key if I do so? Since basicly all my files and everything will be deleted (right?) and I will install Windows again and start over. Is this the case?
 Will I have to buy another key?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case I will just buy Windows 7 again, too much bugs with windows 10...</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate your time and effort for getting back to us and I apologize for the delay in responding.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me help you to understand about the activation of Windows 10. You do not need new activation key after reinstalling windows 10 If your
 currently installed Windows 10 is already activated. However if your current OS is not activated then upon re installing Windows 10 you will have to activate Windows 10 and for that you will have to buy the product key. So I suggest you to make sure that your
 currently installed Windows is activated. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Re-installing Windows 10 you will have an option of whether to keep the files and folders or delete everything. you can choose the option to
 keep your files and folders. However to avoid any data loss w suggest you to take a back up of your documents, files and folders.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            Hi Gabrielle,
<br />Use third-party ShellExView program to turn off all non-Microsoft extensions. Than turn them one by one and each time create a folder to find the guilty.

                    In the side quest "Blood on the Ice" there is an objective "Get Assistance from Jorleif". I've already talked to him but this objective remains uncompleted. Another glitch happened on a Misc quest, asking me to kill a dragon and after which I will need
 to collect bounty from Skald. But even I've already got the gold from Skald, the quest is still out there.

<p>LOL the objective asking you to "Investigate the Crime Scene" is not actually a bug... You should follow the blood path and you'll find yourself in front of a house with a Master lock. I don't know where to find the key so I picked it... Took me 10+ lockpicks
 to unlock.</p>

<p>I have just about each one of these. After an annoying amount of trial and error some are okay. In my game Skald's bounty is broke along with other bounties. After the investigation in Windhelm you get the key from the guy in the Jarls castle, follow the
 blood.</p>

<p>I have the key to the Windhelm house, they just won't let me buy the house. &nbsp;I was never able to trigger the quest "Blood on the Ice," and when I go and look inside the house, there are blood spatters that say, "Investigate investigation target." &nbsp;I've opened
 the secret compartment, etc, and know who the killer is, it just won't let me buy the house.</p>

<p>Wurzy, how did you get the key to the house if you didn't start the Blood on the Ice quest? The whole thing triggers in the graveyard and the woman who has the key can be hard to find but if you got the key some other way, having it or going into the house
 won't trigger the quest. I did it all in one trip and that seems to be the optimal way to avoid glitching it. That quest works if you follow the directions step by step.</p>

<p>I don't know how I got the key...maybe I just lockpicked my way into the house...either way, I don't have the quest listed either in active or finished quests, and I never had the graveyard scene, or whatever it is at the beginning...</p>

<h2>            USB to RS232 cable keep receiving a Code 10 message</h2>
                    <p>I have got a Symnet Audio Matrix for work which can be connected with Ethernet or RS232, as connecting via Ethernet turned out hopeless, I turned to use RS232. I have a laptop on Windows 7 Ultimate, and purchased a USB to RS232 cable for the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After plugging in the cable, I keep receiving a Code 10 error from the device manager.&nbsp;Windows was able&nbsp;to identify the&nbsp;cable, but was not able to have it working. I have tried updating drivers using the device manager's update drivers option, and have swopped
 around all the available USB ports&nbsp;my laptop could offer, which all turned out no luck.&nbsp;Is there anything I could&nbsp;do to have the connection secured?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My laptop&nbsp;is running on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1, the&nbsp;cable's manufacturer is Prolific. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the Laptop?</span></p>
<p><span>The Code 10 error code is generated when Device Manager has insufficient information or the error that is bubbled up by
 the device drivers is not recognized by Device Manager. Additionally, this error may occur when one of the drivers that the device needs does not start. If many drivers are being used by a particular device, it can be difficult to determine the one that failed.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the article to learn more about the error codes:
</span></p>

<p><span>Usually error code 10 occurs if the device does not have latest drivers. Downloading and installing the latest drivers for
 Ethernet card might fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you download the drivers from the Manufacturer’s website and try updating the drivers and check if the Ethernet
 card works fine or not.</span></p>

<h2>            How can messages be marked as junk in Windows 10 Mail App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Windows 10 since I accepted the free download and have a question about the Mail App. Is there a way to mark messages as Junk or, even better, as Phishing? So far, I cannot find a way to do this, but surely there must be one, given Microsoft's
 concerns about security.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Just received a query from Microsoft as to whether I've received a solution to my problem. As already indicated, the answer is
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no</span></em></strong>. Could this have anything to do with the fact that I am currently resident in Italy and thus running the Italian version of Win 10? I seriously doubt it, but since the letter J does
 not actually exist in the Italian alphabet, perhaps the correct combination would be Ctrl + [some other letter]???<br />

</p><blockquote><span>Yes, you can mark the message as junk by right clicking on the mouse and below you will get an option as Junk.&nbsp;</span></blockquote>
<p>You must be referring to the Windows 8,1 mail app, because in Windows 10, right clicking on a message does not show you an option as Junk. All you get is a menu with 5 options: Archive, Delete, Set Flag, Mark as read and Move. No Junk option anywhere.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing CTRL-J doesn't help either (not in Windows 10 anyway)</p>

            Put Microsoft Essentials on 10 then use the Mail Program from that. I think that the Win 10 Mail App is junk in itself as its functionality is abysmal.
