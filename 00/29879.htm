    <title>windows 10 crashed and i dont have cd to boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miodraglaketa  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 crashed and i dont have cd to boot</h2>
                    so i had Windows 7 on my laptop and i recently upgraded to Windows 10 and few days ago after update i couldnt start my pc. all i get&nbsp;is a black screen with blinking underline cursor. i can&nbsp; access bios screen but&nbsp; there is nothing that i can do from there
 so my question is: is there any possible way to fix this without having to pay someone to reinstall Windows for me. btw this is the second time this is happening to me with Windows 10 and i really dont want to spend Money for installing Windows again. and&nbsp;i
 dont have any cd for Windows.

            <p>Boot from the usb, your bios screen maybe has something like F12 = device select menu</p>
<p>You may need to temporary allow boot from usb in bios.</p>
<p>Then you can choose the Repair Environment on the USB installer and try Startup Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also at the bios screen hold in your power button for&nbsp;about&nbsp;5 seconds and it should reset the computer - do that 2x and the 3rd time it should enter&nbsp;windows repair environment on your hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>~</p>
<p>Once you get back in windows, you might look in Device Manager at your Disk Drives &amp; its Property / Policies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you can lessen chances of&nbsp;this from happening again in the future&nbsp;there with a settings change.</p>

 Normally, drivers and the like come from the device manufacturer. <em>( the above was for W7 ( assume 32bit as they also have a specific W7 64bit listed ).</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>If thats no good, then see the FAQ tab, specifically - <em>"To use the product you are using in the Windows 7 environment"</em> question.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><br />

<p>Hey there, this is the info I found on this site for canceling your XBL account. The first link is mainly for canceling your membership and the 2nd link should take care of everything else like clearing up the account, removing your email and officially
 close your account.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry you feel this way! If you wish to just delete your profile (however have it available to access in the future) then view how to do so
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>. On the other hand, if you are wanting to cancel your subscription to Xbox LIVE, then follow the advice given by the previous post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Is your Laptop properly connected to your Internet?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you install or update a third party Anti-Virus program that changed Firewall settings on your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a better solution to your bad WiFi connection downstairs, may I recommend you get a pair of
<a href="https://www.devolo.com/magic-2-wifi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
those homeplug adapters</a> that you can plug into your electrical outlets, which will then inject a network signal into your house's electrical wiring.&nbsp;<br />
Then you can use your house's electrical wiring as a wired network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply plug those near your router and your console, and connect the router with that plug near it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boom! You got "internet" in your electrical wiring. Now every electrical outlet in your house can provide you with internet access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply plug a second adapter into an outlet near your console, and depending on the adapter model you bought, it will broadcast WiFi, or you simply plug in an ethernet cord.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more PC forwarding hassles.</p>

            Hi there depending on what you have your internet hotspot set as the xbox may not be able to connect to said hotspot for a number of reasons try the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Android&nbsp;<br />
Make sure your SSID is suitable&nbsp;<br />
Make sure your password is correct&nbsp;<br />
If the AP Band is on 5GHz then turn it to 2GHz for better results&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Iphone&nbsp;<br />
Enable Mobile Data&nbsp;<br />
Enable Personal Hotspot&nbsp;<br />
Check the information is correct&nbsp;<br />
Name the SSID with a suitable name<br />
Check the password settings<br />
<br />
Go the the xbox network settings and set up a new connection re enter the information again this time making sure everything is correct and enabled correctly also ensure that you have a data plan of x amount of data i.e. unlimited would be the best option.<br />
<br />
If your still having trouble with the hotspot feature i would refer to your handset manual for more options and pin point the cause of the unsuccessful attempts to connect to the xbox console system.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
Alec&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Windows 10 does note recognize the backup image I created - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loey_lee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 does note recognize the backup image I created</h2>
                    <p>I created a system image once I installed Windows 10. I realized that I forgot to backup some important data from my previous windows installation. By that time I had already performed a clean install via the reset feature. My only option was to re-image
 my drive to my old installation and then properly backup the files. When I put the windows 10 disk into the tray and booted into it, I realized that it wouldn't recognize the Windows 10 image I had created on an external HDD while it DID recognize the windows
 7 image I had made. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured perhaps Microsoft designed the image recovery feature to only allow imaging of only the same OS as the one currently installed (I doubted it, I couldn't think of anything else).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the windows 10 disk, I decided to try formatting the windows 7 installation and clean installing Windows 10 directly from the disk this time. Everything installed fine; however, Windows 10 still doesn't recognize the windows 10 image that is located
 in the WindowsImageBackup folder. The windows 7 image backup is located there too, and it is still being detected but the windows 10 image is simply ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disk I have is the windows 10 pro disk; however, the image is for windows 10 home. Would that be the reason? I initially used the upgrade tool to from windows 7 home to windows 10 home, but it would be really odd if Microsoft allowed me to image windows
 7 home premium onto the HDD with a windows 10 pro disk, yet the same can't be done with a windows 10 home image!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>I never could figure out why I couldn't restore my windows 10 image; however, I discovered that after the upgrade, I was able to clean install windows 10 home with usb boot media I made with the creation tool. &nbsp;I skipped the product key portion of the windows
 10 installation wizard and to my surprise windows 10 home activated when I checked the activation status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought you could only activate by upgrading and then doing a reset. Microsoft seems to have registered my motherboard on their servers so I don't need a product key for clean installs via ISO or USB boot media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still sucks that image recovery doesn't work, but at least I've got windows 10 back and running.</p>

            I am disgusted with the pop-ups that <em>came</em> with the last Microsoft "update" or shall I say A BRAND NEW SET VULNERABITIES... I just love the exposure, guys! Microsoft is in a shambles, Outlook is apparently in it's death throes, nothing works and
 10 is&nbsp;a DISASTER. Perhaps Mr. Gates or whom ever he has in control of the joint, should stop worrying about his eugenics programs in Africa. I'm off this popsicle stand and going to Linux!&nbsp;

    <title>Cannot get a clean install of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> romeo987  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot get a clean install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <div>I am out of ideas, and hope someone can help!<br />
I have three desktop computers (all legacy BIOS, 2 Dell, one Intel, all basic with no add-in boards) which all ran quite well on Windows 7 for some time (years). I upgraded them all (over a period of time) to Windows 10 using the normal MS Online free upgrade
 method, and all appeared to operate OK.</div>

<div>Then, out of curiosity, I ran sfc.</div>

<div>All three came up with "found corrupt files but could not repair".<br />
All three CBS logs (the portion relating to the current scan) showed many 1000's of lines (around 6-8MB of .txt).<br />
&nbsp;- each group of 100 scanned files returned between 10 and 100 instances of "Primitive Installer committed for repair" (not sure what that actually means, but doesn't sound good!)<br />
&nbsp;- many (scores/ hundreds) of instances of hash mismatch followed by "..could not reproject..." or ...cannot repair..." (ditto - doesn't sound good!)<br />
While the pattern of the log was the same for each machine, (and in subsequent tests described below) I did not check for exact identicality - the logs are simply too overwhelming.</div>

<div>Following this suprise, here's what I have done (some steps repeated more than once, with very similar results):<br />
1. Using the MCT, I prepared a USB media, took one of my PCs (bare Intel DQ45CB mobo with last available (legacy) BIOS, 4MB RAM, SanDisk SSD), wiped (reformatted) C: and did a clean install from the USB. No hiccups. After nothing more than setting a basic configuration
 (time, region, user account), confirming that Windows had activated OK, and leaving all else at default, immediately ran sfc /scannow and got a similar fail result.<br />
2. Tried an inplace upgrade using the Windows download tool (microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) -&nbsp; this failed with "problem running this tool... too bad ... error 80070570-0x90002". (Got no further with that, despite hours of googling)<br />
3. Tried a clean reboot, as suggested by some responses to similar problems, by deactivating all non-MS services (there weren't any!) and disabling all startup services (One-Note was the only one). Following this, MS Edge would not start up and IE came up with
 "IE has stopped working" window as soon as it started, so I could not proceed further down this path.<br />
4. Did a local "reset this PC", followed immediately by sfc /scannow, with a similar fail result (brand new 6.5MB CBS log with the same pattern)<br />
5. Did dism /online /cleanup-image /restore health which failed with Error 14091 "..name of attribute not within legal range...". (Notably, the dism log (mercifully only 97KB) makes no mention of either "attribute" or "legal range").<br />
6. Ran memory test and Intel CPU test - both passed OK.</div>

<div>While the PCs appear to be working OK, sort of, there are little niggles like upgrades that persistently fail to install on one machine, but not the other two, some local network functionality that isn't consistent between the machines, occasional BSOD,
 etc. </div>

<div>What's going on? Why can I not get a clean installation into a plain vanilla environment? And why won't ANY of the fix-it mechanisms work? What else can I try?</div>
                </div>

<p>Can you share CBS.log file on onedrive and give a link to me?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and efforts. I can see how sfc might give false "positives" (negatives?) after a lot of use, updates, etc, but immediately after a brand new clean instal???? And this doesn't explain why dism fails, and why in place upgrade fails, and
 why all 3 computers are showing similar issues.</p>
<p>Here is a link to my CBS log that shows the session I ran immediately after local reset.</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkDEPDAEuEmEa_XKYxylB-6OHtM </p>
<p>
</p><p>For reasons best known to MS, the log has grown a lot since yesterday. the session that failed in the way I described is at the start of this file starting 27-07-2016 at 18:01.</p>
<p>(I haven't used one drive before, so I hope I got the upload/sharing bit right!).</p>
<p>All help and suggestions eagerly awaited and gratefully received!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>hey zigzag,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. I dragged and dropped the CBS log file directly into One Drive just as it told me to, so I'm not sure what you mean with your first comment.
</p>
<p>And my W10 is an upgrade from a full retail Windows 7 Ultimate (I still have the DVDs). And slmgr tells me I have "Windows Professional Edition 10.0.10586.494 Windows Operating System RETAIL channel", and it is "permanently activated". So I don't quite get
 your second comment either.</p>
<p>Unless, like sfc, dism and in-place upgrade, it turns out that slmgr is yet another MS function that is not working properly on ALL THREE of my machines. In which case, I need even more help than I thought.</p>

            <p>Hi, zigzag</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your continued assistance. </p>
<p>That command runs fine and seems to confirm what I think is the case - but it also appears to contain a lot of very complex product IDs, Installation IDs, keys, etc. I have redacted most of the unique codes in the following, but am happy to&nbsp;post the whole
 thing if you need to see it, and can you confirm that I am not compromising anything.</p>

            <p>Thanks, zigzag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a bit of a relief -&nbsp; I guess this establishes, at the very least, &nbsp;that I am not fighting with cracked or illegal versions of Windows. I must say I'm impressed with how the new W10 activation business seems to work so quickly and flawlessly through
 the many re-installs I have done since upgrading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...how do I get back to getting some traction on my original issue, which stands.</p>
<p>Why can't I get a clean install on any of my three PCs?</p>
<p>Why does sfc not run clean immediately after a clean install?</p>
<p>Why does dism fail to complete (stops and throws up an error)?</p>
<p>Why does the W10 in-place re-install tool fail (ditto)?</p>
<p>Why do NONE of these things work, apparently not on ANY of my PCs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zigzag, I appreciate your help so far. I really hope you (or someone else) can give me a little more...</p>

            <p>So I've reset my test machine a couple of times (similar result) and a couple of nights ago thought I would try another in-place re-install. That option is now gone; the only option is to download the brand new version of W10. Clicked OK, and the big white
 window "Thanks for installing..." appears with nothing else except an "Exit" button. 24 Hours later, nothing has changed. So quit that, and now Edge doesn't work (again)!. Blank blue Edge opening screen opens, then simply closes again. Event viewer throws
 up hundreds of Errors and warnings - just looking at the list destroys my will to live.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to just simply get Windows 10 onto a Vanilla PC? What else can I try?</p>
<p>Am I the only person with a problem like this?</p>

            <p>I assume that you are trying to install 64bit o/s?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I'll just throw this out there see if it helps</p>
<p>This machine I'm using at the moment is a bit long in the tooth and although manufacturer states that it's good to run 8.1 64 bit had numerous problems not unlike you've explained here in the end nearly threw it out.</p>
<p>But I had full retail version of 8.1 which gave me both 64 &amp; 32bit so I tried the 32 bit version, sacrificed a bit of ram &amp; core and had no problem installing 8.1 upgrading to 10 and is currently running anniversary version no problems.</p>
<p>haven't had to run dism tool as sfc shows no worries. all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>don't know why this is but 32bit must be more tolerant of older hardware, perhaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it may be worth a try.</p>

<h2>            I need windows 10 installer repair tool because I can&#39;t remove icloud under windows 10 error 2324</h2>
                    <p>From other posts I found that this inability to remove icloud (generating error 2324 a fatal error) is usually solved by repairing windows installer. Unfortunately the programs for this are very old, and I don't see what program would be used under windows
 10.</p>
<p>Can someone please send a link for something that will reset windows installer so I won't be blocked by this error?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>Oh, this is bad news. I have to reinstall the Operating System because Icloud wont uninstal. This is really bad, and it requires a huge investment of time to reinstall and reconfigure everything. How can Microsoft survive with this manner?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, best to hear that Windows 10 has zero ability to deal with this, and that it can only be reset. Makes me also consider resetting to the level of considering alternate operating systems.</p>

<h2>            Fsx-Steam Edition- Error Message.</h2>
                    <p>Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed fsx-Steam edition on my computer which runs on Windows10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I formatted the hard-**** it was working properly, but now it continues to give me an error: Error loading GPS_engine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is, that whenever I try to load a previously saved flight, with all the flight plans, at first it saves it, but whenever, I try to re-load it, it appears without any plan-file. That is, it just shows the map, without any routh whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried unstalling the fsx trough Steam and installing it again, but it keeps giving me the same problem.</p>
<p>I do not know why this problem keeps recurring. Perhaps it has got to do; something with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me out, with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards and Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this is a problem with Win10.&nbsp; &nbsp;This type of error comes up when the wrong flight plan is used for the current flight.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'll give you a series of options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, I take a flight from VHHH to NZAA and before going on the flight, I file a flight plan, set up the flight at VHHH (with fuel, pax load, etc.) and then save that flight plan to desktop.&nbsp; &nbsp;After completing that flight, I save the flight and
 exit FSX, and that plan is still there on desktop (Leave it there).&nbsp; &nbsp;If I want to then go from NZAA to KLAX, I launch FSX using the saved flight and make up a new flight plan (as above) and save that to desktop.&nbsp; &nbsp;So now I have two flight plans on desktop
 - don't delete the first flight plan as FSX still has to reference the old one before you can take off using the new plan.&nbsp; &nbsp;After you finish this flight to KLAX, then the old plan (VHHH - NZAA) can be deleted.&nbsp; &nbsp; And you can continue to do this for future
 flights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, if I have misunderstood what you're doing and you are having a series of old flight plans on desktop (or in a folder), and you are simply going to a very old flight plan, thinking you can just use that to start on a flight without having to
 file a plan, then this won't work as your aircraft will be at a wrong airport as per the data on the plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Or, if you're flying on a saved flight plan and then exit FSX.&nbsp; &nbsp;Later on, you want to get back to that flight and flight plan, then this won't work properly as your aircraft will have moved.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, before you exit FSX, save the flight (giving
 it a specific name) and then you can come back to it at its navigation point, altitude, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope something here has answered your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thank you very much for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>Here I would like to point out, that I have had fsx-Steam for several years now, and I have been playing it several years as well, without me having any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have explained to you, when I create a new flight, with a new flightplan (eg. VFR Kingsford Smith Int. to Alice Springs) -all in Australia, and I also give the new flight a specific name, it does do the flightplan(gps type) and save it in the FSX file-documents
 file/ documents folder. Up to there it is also fine. But, when I go out of FSX on to desktop or any where else, and I try opeining FsX-Steam, and load the same flight, with the specific name, it loads the flight alright, but without the flightplan. Or else
 better, it just shows the map, without any routh saved before.</p>
<p>It hasn't got to do with the moving aircraft. As in the first place, I had not moved the aircraft at all. It is still standing on the beginning of the runway, as I had just saved it.
</p>
<p>It seems it is not saving the flight plan properly, (altough you can see it with the other flight folders) but when you re-enter into FSX it does not regognize it, even though it was saved with the proper name. It does not have to do anything with the aircraft
 having moved, as even so, when you save it out, on closind down, it should automatically save the aircraft's last position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do'nt&nbsp; know what is cousing the problem. But as I have explained I have been playing fsx-Steam for about four years, without having this kind of problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much, and I would be eagarly awaiting your suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your detailed explanation.&nbsp; &nbsp;So you can see your Flight Plan (i.e. the plan you saved that has a .PLN extension)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, and you are still having this problem, I can only suggest completely removing all your files from the Documents/Flight Simulator Files.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can, also delete&nbsp; fsx.cfg&nbsp; and FSX will rebuild it the next time.&nbsp; &nbsp;But of course, you may
 lose any special settings you have.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you want to delete the Logbook.bin file then copy/rename it elsewhere on your computer and FSX should rebuild that also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only thing I can suggest as it sounds that there is some corruption in that Flt Simulator Files folder causing FSX to not recognise your Flt Plan properly.&nbsp; &nbsp;But you will have to decide whether you want to take this action as you will lose all
 your saved flight plans and other entries in fsx.cfg.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done exactly what you have told me to do. Actuall I deleted all the folder/documents/</p>
<p>Fsx fligthsim-steam. I also deleted the .cfg file as you suggested. I also deleted the log file.</p>
<p>When you enter into the game it does these automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the problem keeps on recurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have uninstalled FSx-Steam edition, through Steam and am installing it again.</p>
<p>But I am not sure this would help, as I have already tried this method about twice.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you've tried just about everything now and the problem still occurs.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can't imagine what else it could be:&nbsp; I actually loaded a VFR flight and launched it to the runway and took off.&nbsp; &nbsp;After a couple of minutes, I paused it, saved it and exited the
 Sim completely.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then went back into FSX and loaded the saved flight and everything worked as it should, even with the GPS.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I'm at a loss as to why your saved flight is not showing the routing on the map/GPS as all the data that you put in when you submit
 a flight plan will be shown in the .PLN file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can sort it out, or else submit your problem to the Steam Community - maybe someone there has had a similar situation.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have said I have tried almost everything. I may try to install the game on another computer, with Windows 7 - perhaps to see whether it has got to do with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the steam Community, there where other users with the same problem, but I am not really sure how they got about to solve their problem. Perhaps by checking their Windows directory files? - with a special program checker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have said from the beginning, I have never had this problem, and it is rather frustrating, to have the game, but you cannot play it correctly.</p>

<p>I have been searching that forum as well - I don't think that any have been able to properly sort out the issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems to have been going on since 2015, before Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, they seem to have other issues not quite the same as yours, except
 for the GPS not updating or aircraft following the route.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure your issue is related to theirs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any add ons installed (maybe aircraft, scenery, etc.)?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or, when you uninstall FSX, do you uninstall it through Steam and then check your computer if there are any left overs?&nbsp; &nbsp;To do a completely fresh install, you would need to uninstall any
 add ons, then have FSX running properly before adding them back in, one by one and testing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe something added on or an incomplete uninstall is causing the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some reported to get the problem when flying online with Vatsim, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Don't know whether
 you do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I can't help further, as I run the boxed version of FSX and also use an FMC instead of the default GPS, in Windows 7.&nbsp; &nbsp;All the best Lawrence.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I do have several add-ons , especially aircraft and scenery files, which usually I download from flightsim.</p>

<p>Very strange indeed, that FSX (boxed) also gives the same problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm at a loss to even imagine how a saved flight plan (that has been saved through FSX - so it knows its location), can no longer be recognised by the Sim.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm out on a limb here but wondered whether you set up your flight plan from within the Flight or from the face page.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may be doing this already, but instead of setting it up from the FSX face page (with the spinning aircraft), set up the plan
 after you load a flight at an airport then go to the top Menu bar and then to Flight Planner.&nbsp; &nbsp;And save it from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;There should be no reason that this is any different than doing it the other way, but we're all out of ideas, so worth a try.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just
 can't imagine any Windows version (even the problematic Win10) would not allow a proper retrieval of a file (flight plan).&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe if all else fails, try another computer (friend's)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I use an FMC (okay to use with airliners, but not GA aircraft).&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a free version, so it is not an FMC in the truest sense, but rather it is the default GPS that has an FMC face and other features.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, even if this may not
 be suitable in your case, I was wondering if you wanted to try using that (you would need to make changes to your Gauges and aircraft panel.cfg folders).&nbsp; &nbsp;This could prove whether your GPS is at fault (i.e. if the FMC fixes the problem), or if it's FSX or
 even Windows.&nbsp; Anyway, if you wanted to try this, then I can get a link to the FMC for you.</p>

</p><p>Re:&nbsp; Vatsim.&nbsp; &nbsp;Here's the link:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.vatsim.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.vatsim.net/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a member of it or any online virtual airline as my flights are all long haul and require a full, time compression in the Sim so that I can complete the flight without becoming bored to death.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, time compression probably wouldn't work with virtual
 airlines/Vatsim as the pilot flies with others and also online ATC keeps air traffic in order.&nbsp; &nbsp;Very interesting stuff but sadly, not for my type of flying.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply and your trying to help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, whenever I go into Fsx-Steam edition, I first create a flight, by choosing an aeroplane, an airport and its location. I set the time, and than I create the flight plan, from that airport to another airport, in the same country or another. Usually, I
 do not set it from the face page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it is still giving me the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, I tried, (from the settings of my computer) to put game-off, (because in my compuer, I have X-box). I did this, as I thought it may be interfering with the Fsx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it did not make any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding FMC, I do not know what they are. You also mentioned,"making changes in my panel.cfg folder). I know what you are saying, but I am not sure how to go about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the more I meddle, the more it becomes complicated. And if you make changes, I suppose you have to make them in each and every aircraft. No?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only option now, is to try and load Fsx-steam edition on another coputer with Windows 7 - to see what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>Halo&#58; Master Chief Collection update and installation issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a wretched s0ul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo&#58; Master Chief Collection update and installation issues</h2>
                    
<p>I recently Pre-downloaded the digital copy of HMCC and I'm sure everyone is aware of the issues regarding the dropping percentages during installation. I managed to download the entire game within a day with only one instance in which the installation progress
 dropped from 58% to 31%. This happened after I was having party chat troubles and in an effort to fix them I had turned off my console and turned it back on. The dropping percentage wasn't a very serious problem for me otherwise.</p>
<p>The thing that really concerns me is the update that follows a complete installation. After HMCC had downloaded completely for me, the 15GB or so, update followed. The update didn't have any similar issues to the installation percentage drops, which was
 relieving. Later, the update had reached 100% and stopped. There was no completion, no notifications, no further progress. It just stopped and sat at 100% for 4 or 5 hours. I had tried every possible troubleshooting option I or anyone could offer and nothing
 worked. My only option was to delete the entire 45GB pre-download+the extra 15 or so GB update. I couldn't delete the update alone, It was stitched into the Game itself upon initial download. So I had to delete both. I'd really like to see a feature that would
 allow the user to delete the update itself, not the game and update entirely or if there already is such an option, make some instructions as to how to go about it. &nbsp;I will endure another full day of downloading HMCC, I enjoy the Xbox one too much to be upset
 at these little hiccups. I just hope that this will be addressed before it happens to anyone else. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. It has been sitting at 100% since last night. I had things queued for download after the update and they have finished no problem. Do I really need to download the whole thing again or is this something that will fix itself? Maybe
 it will just finish at 12:00am Tuesday?</p>

<p>A friend of mine said that everybody is going nuts on twitter because of the update not being out or not downloading properly or something but, as he was telling me all this, mine was updating and worked just fine.</p>
<p>I guess I got lucky as my game download went smoothly as well. Fingers crossed that we don't have the same problem that a lot of CoD preorders had where, instead of unlocking at midnight, it started the entire download again. That would kinda defeat the
 purpose of preordering a digital copy and downloading early so that able to play it at midnight rather than go pick up a copy at midnight.</p>

<p>Hi, I just bought this game on Monday, and &nbsp;I'm having a big problem with just the update. The game will install offline, but when the 18 gig update occurs, it won't go past 17% can anyone help me? Im very disappointed and frustrated and upset because it
 makes me feel I wasted 50 dollars on a pre owned game and will not work! Im running at 7 mbs internet and I do not know what is happening!

    <title>Create a dockable shortcut toolbar in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wynndose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a dockable shortcut toolbar in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a shortcut toolbar in Windows 10, and dock it to the side of the desktop with Auto-Hide.&nbsp; I could do this in Vista (and XP).&nbsp; I'd like to do it in Windows 10.&nbsp; Others have asked, but it looks like this can't be done.&nbsp; I am an old-time computer
 guy who has programmed in X86 machine language.&nbsp; (My first time at a console was at an IBM 360 when I was a kid- no video, just a line printer).&nbsp; I just can't believe this isn't possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So- how does one create a dockable shortcuts toolbar in Windows 10?&nbsp; I know about Quick launch, docking shortcuts and creating toolbars attached to the taskbar and other alternatives.&nbsp; I would like the dockable auto-hideable toolbar on the side (and top)
 of my desktop.&nbsp; The top toolbar is for oft-used documents (like a spreadsheet with common engineering calcs).&nbsp; The side toolbar is for often used apps, and I have a bunch of them.</p>

            <p>Yes, I know.&nbsp; That doesn't have anything to do with creating a dockable toolbar though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually installed Classic Start Menu to improve the functionality of the toolbar.&nbsp; Now it's just how I want it:&nbsp; Useful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the choice of cute or useful, I will always choose the latter- even if we're talking about cars or home appliances.&nbsp; A cute computer does me no good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Explorer search has been ruined.&nbsp; Are we going back to command-line computing?&nbsp; I installed a couple of third-party apps.&nbsp; Agent Ransack (great file search and grep), and Free Commander (file management for people who aren't afraid of their computers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I could control all the files on my system (like Unix root).&nbsp; TrustedInstaller owns too much of my machine.&nbsp; Things like editing the hosts file, and copying new fonts are blasted tedious now!</p>

<h2>            External Harddrive read only</h2>
                    <p>I am running 3 year old HP Envy on windows 7 professional and the Hard drive in question is a WD 8TB drive (under 6 months old).&nbsp; I use the C: drive only for programs and I work off hard drives.</p>
<p>Earlier today my computer crashed.&nbsp; It has not done this in a very long time.&nbsp; I working at the time off of my external hard drive, and when it crashed the drive did not shut down correctly.&nbsp; I rebooted and an info box appeared when the computer rebooted
 the external hard drive saying an error was detected and asked should I scan and fix any errors. I chose both.&nbsp; Everything booted up correctly, but when I went to work on my files it would open them but would not allow me to save.&nbsp; I checked the folder I was
 working in and properties said the folder (and eventually I found all the folders in the hard drive) were set at read-only (the box was filled in, not checked).&nbsp; I un-clicked the the read-only box and clicked apply (this folder, sub folder and files). I got
 an error message (for each file in the sub-directory)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>An error occured applying attributes to this file&nbsp; &lt;file name&gt; The opperation could not be completed because the volumn is dirty. PLease run chkdsk and try again.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>(incidentally when I check properties of the individual files the "Archive" box is checked.&nbsp; When I tried to uncheck that box in any file's properties I got the same error mentioned above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to the command prompt window, changed from C:\ to I:\ (the Ext. HD drive letter) and ran "chkdsk" and it came back with this error</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Error found. CHKDSK cannot continue in read-only mode</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And thus I have a catch-22 situation.&nbsp; Anyone know of a solution short of buying a new had drive and transferring all the info onto the on to the new drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelneu21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Problem</h2>
                    <p>In windows 10 a few hours and reboots after installing, I was given the message that my product key does not work anymore. The details are that my key has been blocked by the activation server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give you some insight on my day before this, last night/morning I installed windows 10 update through GWX which gave me no option to do a clean install so I upgraded and planed to reset after. This how ever didn't work because I have no installation
 media for windows 10 and could not complete a regular reset so using Microsoft's program thing I created my own. The regular reset function wouldn't work with the media on a DVD or flash drive so I ended up reinstalling windows 10 this time with the option
 of wiping my drive which worked and was activated. Now I'm at the top and I need help.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful if you could provide us the complete error message/error number you get while trying to activate Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround you may try to activate manually by following the steps listed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Push the start button<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Settings<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to Update and Security<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Activation&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            So I do not have the key anymore and upon going to activation I have two options. To enter a key or go to store; when going to store I hit check for genuine windows, it says it is genuine still nothing happens besides that. The error code is 0xC004C003.
 It says something about key being blocked by activation server. I believe it is because I reset my copy of windows and it thinks I'm using the same key in two pcs

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It seems like you have an issue with booting the computer and receive error code OXC000021a.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help and guide you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>I may need a few more information to understand the issue better</span></b></p><span>1.
 Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span>
<p><span>2. Are you using Tablet PC?<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span><br />
Let's first try to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if you face the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
a. </span><b><span>Boot </span></b><span>from the </span><b><span>Windows 8 DVD.</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>b. Swipe on </span><b><span>Repair your computer</span></b><span>.<br />
c. Swipe on </span><b><span>Troubleshoot </span></b><span>and then select </span>
<b><span>Advanced Options</span></b><span>.<br />
d. Select the option </span><b><span>Safe mode </span></b><span>and check if the issue persists.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to disconnect all external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span><br />
Perform clean boot if the issue does not occur in Safe Mode. Set the computer in ‘Clean boot’ state to check software conflicts. Refer the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span><br />
a) Swipe the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Swipe the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, swipe to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then swipe to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, swipe to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, swipe ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, swipe on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Swipe ‘OK’, and then swipe Restart.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services:</span></b><span><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Swipe the Services tab, and then swipe to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Swipe to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Swipe OK, and then swipe Restart.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns:</span></b><span><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, swipe to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items:</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box
 in either step.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns:</span></b><span><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem:</span></b><span><br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Step 7:</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Swipe the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and swipe ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, swipe the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) Restart the computer and check with the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span><br />
If the issue persists, you may try to perform Automatic repair from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
To perform Automatic repair on Windows 8 computer follow these steps:<br />
</span></p>
<p>a) I<b><span>nsert </span></b><span>the media such as (USB or DVD) and </span>
<b><span>restart </span></b><span>the computer.<br />
b) </span><b><span>Swipe F12 key </span></b><span>(typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.<br />
c) Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:<br />
d) Swipe </span><b><span>Next </span></b><span>and select </span><b><span>Repair your computer</span></b><span>.<br />
e) You will then see a </span><b><span>blue screen </span></b><span>and an option to choose.
<br />
e) Choose the option </span><b><span>Troubleshoot </span></b><span>and select </span>
<b><span>Advanced options.</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>f) You may choose </span><b><span>Automatic Repair </span></b><span>from
</span><b><span>Advanced boot option.<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Do get back to us and let us know the status of the issue, I will be glad to help you further. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>

            <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having this same problem. It may have something to do with the Windows update. I have tried everything that was recommend and the problem didn't go away updating NVIDIA driver, running the command prompts, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the problem was related to AVAST, even if you are not using it as your antivirus it may still be in your computer. You need to uninstall AVAST, but it won't work from the normal 'uninstall programs'. Check on google for how to uninstall AVAST
 and download the file called AVASTCLEAR. It will restart the computer in safe mode and perform the uninstall. That was it for me, I don't have the problem anymore.</p>

            <p>I upgraded from windows 8 to 8.1 and kept getting the 0xc000021a error. It would crash citing this error and restart, usually that would fix the problem and it would start OK next time. I tried to get my printer working with 8.1 as it was not and I also
 used driver max to update drivers that may have&nbsp; caused the problem. Now when I boot up the automatic repair comes on and mover to a screen where it asks me to choose my keyboard, but nothing works on the screen - , keyboard, mouse, tries other wireless mouse
 and keyboard and mouse with cable.</p>
<p>I went into recover and it says there is no restore point, but I know I set one a few days ago when I was using driver max software. The only other option is factory setting. I won't let me do a backup either, although the one I have will be reasonably recent.
 the only option I know left is a factory reset, but I don't want to do that unless it is really necessary. The reset takes me back to windows 7 too.</p>

<p>The machine cannot boot and shows error code OXC000021A. &nbsp;It then goes onto to diagnosing PC and then runs the attempting repairs which just goes on and on never actually fixing the problem. Yesterday PC ran for over 2 Hrs in this mode.</p>
<p>I have a system recovery disc, i tried boot up with this disc and managed to get restore option. But once restore is selected I get just a screen with the company logo.</p>

<p>After the last Windows Update, the computer started going crazy, freezing, wrong item clicked, many other mistakes.
</p>
<p>I shut it off, waited, then re-started. I got the same notice, as above, for 4 hours. I took a nap, when I returned, it was still "fixing".</p>
<p>I don't have a disc, Windows 8.1 was pre-installed. I have ordered a recovery disc, but it won't arrive for a week, or more.</p>

    <title>Laptop browser, word... display in 500&#37; after connecting to tv - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Laptop browser, word... display in 500&#37; after connecting to tv</h2>
                    After my laptop connected/disconnected to tv the first time, the laptop's browser/word display became 500%. I manually changed it back to 100%, immediately the display zooms back to 500%. I have tried clicking monitor Fn key or changing display resolution,
 nothing worked. Finally System Restore to an old date worked. Is there other way to solve the problem? I don't want to use system restore to fix the display problem each time after use tv as the monitor. &nbsp;Thanks.

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I tried IE , Chrome and Word, all displayed in 500% and won't allow me to change display to 100%. &nbsp;After System Restore, first time opened the applications, every one was still displayed in 500%. The good thing is I can manually change display to 100%,
 and it stayed at 100%.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem did not limit to a single application, it seems at the system level. I believe if I opened Excel or other application at that time, they probably would all display at 500%.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

<span>It seems that you will need to adjust the screen resolution of the computer when connecting to TV.</span>
