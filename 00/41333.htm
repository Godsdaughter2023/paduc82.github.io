            Hi Ash.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type Netplwiz in Start Search, highlight the account, choose Remove.  
<br />
<br />If not there go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People to see if the account is there to Delete.  
<br />
<br />If not in either place then please report back the exact name of the account.  What happens when you try to sign into it, leaving password box blank?  
<br />
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi AshBain,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />This might be the built-in Administrator account that you are talking about. 
<br />
<br />You can disable this account, so that it won't show as a user in the login screen (just make sure you have another administrator account to login such as your user account:
<br />- Open Command Prompt as administrator (search for it within the Windows start menu &gt; right-click &gt; run as administrator) 
<br />- Once this opens, enter: net user administrator /active:no
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can further advise.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<h2>            Windows key&#43;Space doesn&#39;t work for switching between input methods in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows key+Space doesn't work for switching between input methods in Windows 10</p>
<p>It worked for me in Win 8.1 and the language bar would pop up automatically to allow me cycle through different languages.</p>
<p>I usually have my taskbar hidden, so the Win+Space combo used to work perfectly for me as I don't have to move my cursor to check the input method every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to work with 5 languages, and the current Ctrl+Shift shortcut is very very very tedious every time I want to change from e.g. English(default) to Japanese(5th in the list).</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this? or will this function become history?</p>

<p>Sincé today it just stopped working. </p>

</p><p>By the way, using the key sequence indicated, even after changing it, does not work as well. There is no way, other tan by clicking the bar, to change languages.

<p>
</p><p>It's been too lone since this thread was posted so I don't know if you still need help or no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had this problem a couple days ago and it turns out it not about any windows setting. My keyboard actually has a feature (gaming mode??) that turns off windows key so that it wont interrupt some games, so pushing windows key + space would just be
 like pushing space bar....disabling that mode should fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>My new laptop keeps freezing when I play music or a video while - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thisisme272  say:</h3>
<h2>            My new laptop keeps freezing when I play music or a video while listening to the sound through the speakers. </h2>
                    I've just bought&nbsp;a new Dell laptop with Windows 7 installed on it. After using it for about one week, it started repeatedly freezing up in media player, internet explorer and the volume control on the task-bar.&nbsp;I called Dell technical support and they
 did their remote assistance thing. This seemed to fix the problem, but then a few days later the same thing happened again. So, I called Dell and they told me to restore the computer back to its original factory settings. Again, just a few days later, it started
 freezing. I called Dell for the third time, and they told me to restore the factory settings again.
<br />
This still didn't work, so I contacted them yet again, and they suggested that it could be the Windows automatic updates that were causing the freezing problems. So I disabled them, but, not surprisingly, the damn thing was still freezing up. For the FIFTH
 time, I called Dell and they told me to reinstall Windows 7, which I did, but this still didn't solve anything.
<br />
<br />
Then for the SIXTH TIME, I called Dell and they sent a technician to come to my house to replace the motherboard and several other parts. After the technician did this (and while he was still there), I opened up media player and played a song. I then started
 adjusting the volume, and surprise, surprise, it froze up. The technician said that it could be Windows 7 itself that was causing this problem, or it could be media player. He suggested that I un-install media player and download real player or something to
 see if it makes any difference. I tried using realplayer, but it didn't solve anything.
<br />
<br />
Just yesterday, I noticed that it now only seems to freeze when I listen to music or watch a video with the sound coming through the speaker, and not while the headphones are plugged in. I should also mention that for some reason, internet explorer isn't freezing
 anymore, so it's now only&nbsp;media player and the volume control in the task-bar that are causing problems. When I adjust the volume with the sound coming through the speakers, the volume control freezes, which then causes media player to also freeze. Even if
 I close these programs and open them up again, it still plays up, and I end up having to restart the computer. Does anyone know how I can solve this problem?

    <title>Random Disconnects from Xbox Live while using Netflix app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Random Disconnects from Xbox Live while using Netflix app</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox Community,</p>

<p>I'm hoping you can help with an issue I've been trying to resolve for a couple weeks now. I keep getting randomly disconnected from Xbox Live while streaming shows/movies on the Netflix Xbox 360 app. It can happen just seconds into loading the app to hours
 of watching. There are no error codes, the only thing that happens is a popup (similar to when friends sign online) says "Disconnected from Xbox Live" and shows a screen that with 2 options; 1) Connect to Xbox Live and 2) Exit. When selecting option 1, nothing
 happens. It looks like it is connecting or attempting to connect and then goes back to that same screen. The only choice that works is option 2, to exit the app.</p>

<p>Now, before you try to give some advice, let me list what I've done to try to fix this issue. Below is said list:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Attempted solution #1:</strong></span></p>
<p>Deleted system cache (3 times), Netflix app, and Xbox Live profile and then redownloaded profile and Netflix app</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Attempted solution #2:</strong></span></p>
<p>Checked all files on my harddrive for corrupted files and deleted any corrupt files found (there were 2 corrupt files found, both in the Call of Duty folder)</p>
<p>Deleted system cache (3 times), Netflix app, and Xbox Live profile and redownloaded profile and Netflix app</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Attempted solution #3:</strong></span></p>
<p>Contacted Comcast (my ISP) and had them walk me through opening 4 ports required for optimal Xbox Live performance: Port 88 (UDP), Port 3074 (UDP and TCP), Port 53 (UDP and TCP), and Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>Deleted system cache (3 times), Netflix app, and Xbox Live profile and redownloaded profile and Netflix app</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Attempted solution #4:</strong></span></p>
<p>Deleted Xbox 360 system update</p>
<p>Deleted system cache (3 times), Netflix app, and Xbox Live profile and redownloaded profile and Netflix app</p>


<p>I am now at a loss, Xbox support has referred me to the Netflix support team who in turn told me that it was an Xbox Live issue which is why I turn to the community for help. Nothing is more annoying than being disconnected from Xbox live right as the villains
 mask is about to be ripped off! (not related to any shows I've been watching but thought it would get my point across best :) )</p>
<p><em><strong>Thanks for your help! ;)</strong></em></p>

<p>I can play video games on Xbox Live with no issues, I can play DVD's while connected to Xbox live without being randomly disconnected, I play computer games on the same network with no connection issues, I use a work laptop on the same network that is uber

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You should be fully aware of what happens why you get you gamerscore reset. &nbsp;It isn't just reset your GS then start again. &nbsp;Here's what will happen:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[quote]</span></p>
<p>A LIVE player who obtained their gamerscore in this abnormal way will</p>

</li></ul>
<p>While players who have been identified by these criteria will start from a zero gamerscore, they will still be able to gain achievements for future games.&nbsp; In other words, we give them another chance to earn future achievements by earning them as other “fair”
 players do.&nbsp; <span><b>The original gamerscore correction will&nbsp;<em>remain permanent without any way to appeal.</em></b></span></p>

 gone. &nbsp;You really should have thought about all that before you modded your gamerscore, huh?</span></p>

I even contacted my company network team they said nothing will happens like i told.<br />
</p>
<p>
I tired to find out by using command mode codes like NETSTAT -A,B,N,O BUT and using pid i was try to find in task manager but &nbsp; its shown nothing. I could not able to identity. I used command "netstat -n 5 &gt; scan:txt" its shown no server available. i used "Net
 View" its given some error message like&nbsp;<a href="http://6118.no/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">6118.no</a>&nbsp;server available on this working group.<br />
</p>
<p>
When i working on internet my net connection get disconnected, even net working properly.<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi BalamuralikrishnaB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First and foremost, a corrupted Excel app is one of the possible causes why it's not working properly. I suggest that you follow the series of troubleshooting steps on the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Excel-not-responding-hangs-freezes-or-stops-working-37E7D3C9-9E84-40BF-A805-4CA6853A1FF4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Excel not responding, hangs, freezes or stops working</strong></a> article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, if you have doubts if your colleagues have tried to manipulate your account or work, please contact the security team and I.T department for this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly, the suspended applications may due to an idle time if you are not using the computer for a long period of time or it was disconnected to the internet. As you also mentioned, your internet connection is not working properly. These issues you're facing
 right now is best being handled by the I.T department since you're connected to a domain server. I can personally give you links which are
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10741/windows-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix network connection issues in Windows</a> but I doubt that you would need an admin privileges to perform these steps. At least, you have the options to try it for yourself. But in case it will ask for an admin rights, please coordinate with the I.T department
 right away to resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Note</span><span>: Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the KB article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
- Have you made any changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
Installing Windows Updates is very essential for the smooth functioning of your operating system.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to follow the stpes from the article and check if that helps.<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You cannot install some updates or programs</a><br />
<br />
<br />
You could try installing the updates in a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> state.<br />
<br />

            Hey Azeez,<br />
I believe this issue showed up after installing my new printer drivers/software for Samsung ML-2851MD. During installation I believe that I got a message saying
<br />
<br />
"The software you are installing has not passed Windows Logo testing to verify its compatibility with this version of Windows. (Tell me why this testing is important.)"<br />
<br />
I went ahead and installed anyway at that point and printer has been working fine ever since.<br />
<br />
Tried suggestions on the "you cannot install some updates or programs" link you provided as follows w/ results being still getting same results indicated in first message. Each time I tried to install updates individually instead of all at same time.<br />
<br />
.NET 3.5 - Won't install<br />
<br />
Visual 2005 - Appears to install, but still shows up as needing to be updated<br />
<br />
Visual 2008 - Won't install b/c says not available on update site and need CD to install<br />
<br />
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - used Microsoft Fix it 50528 <br />
Result - did not fix<br />
<br />
6, 8, 10 - did myself<br />
Result - did not fix<br />
<br />
7 - did not attempt as too complicated<br />
<br />
9 - did not attempt as not sure about some steps<br />
<br />
11 - did not attempt as will cause too much upheaval and not that worried about issue to attempt this.<br />
<br />
Clean Boot State - did not attempt as will cause too much upheaval and not that worried about issue to attempt this.<br />
<br />
Please advise as this is getting quite irritating and taking way too much time for something that I am still not sure is that important.<br />
Thnx for your help.<br />

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>The problem could be because of an outdated Windows Installer version. To check the version of Windows installer on your system:</p>
<p>Click on Start &gt; Run</p>
<p>Type "msiexec" and hit Enter</p>
<p>If you have Version 3.01xxxx then it's time you upgraded it.</p>
<p>Download version 4.5 from the following link&nbsp;and install:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8483</a></p>
<p>Reboot and try installing the updates. Good luck</p>

Installed version 4.5 and retried other installs and still got same results as above. Should I now go back and retry the other methods that I did before now that I have a newer updater installed? Thnx.<br />

            Tried method 2 and deleted all .NET Frameworks and reinstalled. Then did updates again. This time .NET 3.5 SP update worked, but the other 2 are still not working. Visual C++ 2005 is acting as if loading and then shows up again when I check for updates
 again. Visual C++ 2008 is still prompting for a CD which does not exist. Should I just tell update to not show these two again or is there a fix? Thnx.<br />

            <p>You could try removing and reinstalling the Visual C++ redistributable packages, in case they're corrupted as well.</p>
<p>If you do not notice any application or performance issues, you could simply hide those updates, if they're not worth the trouble. I am not aware of generic sureshot fix for those updates.</p>

Any suggestions to go along with other questions of how to deal w/ Visual 2005 and Visual 2008 issues in other queries? Thnx.<br />

            Hi gabe44life 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. Bluetooth pairing will happen like any other device but you would need iTunes before you can actually transfer files between the two.
<br />
<br />Install iTunes from - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PB2MZ1ZMB1S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PB2M...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Gabe,
<br />
<br />To connect your iphone to your laptop,  you would need to install itunes from 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apple.com/itunes/</a>
<br />
<br />It will then install all the necessary drivers &amp; software needed.
<br />
<br />Connect using a Lightning to USB cable
<br />The first way to connect your iPhone to your laptop or PC is to use the Lightning to USB cable that came with your iPhone. If you need a spare or a replacement, then it’s easy enough to find an official or third-party lightning cable. For example, this branded white Lightning cable works perfectly with the iPhone and costs less than a tenner.
<br />
<br />Plug the Lightning end of the cable into your phone, and the USB end into a USB port on your computer. Then, download and iTunes from Apple’s website. Launch iTunes once it is installed.
<br />
<br />From here, click Devices then select your iPhone. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your iPhone.
<br />
<br />From here, you can copy across music, photos, videos, apps and more. You can also unlock our second option – connecting wirelessly.
<br />
<br />Connect using a wireless network
<br />You can also sync your iPhone with your PC or Mac wirelessly after the initial connection has been made.
<br />
<br />To do this, connect your iPhone to your computer and open iTunes. Select your iPhone, click Summary, then select ‘Sync with this device over Wi-Fi’. Then, disconnect your iPhone from your PC.
<br />
<br />To begin the wireless syncing process, you have three options:
<br />
<br />On your iPhone, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; iTunes Wi-Fi Sync, then tap Sync Now.
<br />In iTunes on your PC, click the Devices button, then click Sync. You can also sync manually by clicking Add To, dragging items to the pane on the right, then clicking Done.
<br />Charge your iPhone 6 using a wall charger. Syncing will begin automatically.
<br />Wireless syncing is slower than wired syncing, but it may be more convenient for you. Also note that you can’t restore your iPhone using wireless sync.
<br />

    <title>Intel USB Host Controller Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> defiantclass1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel USB Host Controller Drivers</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 on an IBM ThinkPad T41 laptop. I realize that this is an older laptop and is not the best choice for Windows 7. However, I first installed the RC release on it (a little while back) and everything (except for Areo, etc) worked just
 fine. Now, with this new fully licensed copy of 7, the drivers for the USB Host Controller are not loading correctly. They appear to be present, but they are not working. In Device Manager, there is a yellow ! next to each entry under USB, and inserting a
 USB drive produces nothing.<br />
<br />
I first asked Intel about it. They said it is a Microsoft issue. They said they manufacture the Host Controller, but Microsoft makes the drivers. This is an Intel 82801DB/DBM Enhanced USB Host Controller and there are 4 or 5 similar entries for it under USB
 in Device Manager. <br />
<br />
I don't know why it would work without issue when using the RC and not this new installation. I have disabled, and completely removed the device/drivers from within Device Manager and rebooted to allow Windows to reload the device(s)/driver(s) but that didn't
 help. I have tried downloading driver installations from Intel and that also did nothing for me. I have checked Windows Update several times manually, and using the Update Driver button tells me "Windows has determined I have the most current drivers".<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas, I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />

<p>Might not be your situation but this is the kind of problem you can get if the motherboard chipset drivers are not correct. You can do a quick check in Device manager to see if the various system devices have chipset specific named drivers or are just generic
 MS drivers. Intel might not have an INF utility update for your legacy chipset, in which case you'd be dependant on MS to supply legacy drivers for it. That was the case with my Intel 915/82801 chipset (more than 6 years old), but they are not obliged to.
 Uninstall the usb device drivers again (note how they are identified first). Try manually running&nbsp;update on each of the hardware&nbsp;device drivers listed under System devices (esp. if&nbsp;identified by PCI, firmware, controller). If the system device drivers are
 changed when you do this&nbsp;Windows should redetect the integral hardware and install new drivers for those devices also.</p>
<p>If nothing else works you could still try reinstalling the RC as a dual boot in its own partition and then note exactly which drivers it is installing. Assuming the USB in the RC is still functional now. It isn't a tidy solution but you might be able to
 use the RC installation to copy/install drivers from if those driver versions&nbsp;don't exist in the retail Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Display Scaling issues with IE11 &#40;Not Edge&#41; &#38; Skype for Business</h2>
                    <p>I'm using my SP4 with two external monitors via a Plugable USB 3.0 dock. The monitors in question are not UHD and are 1920x1080. I want my SP4 to remain my main monitor with the external ones extended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with this is whilst most apps - Chrome, Skype, Edge etc all work fine in that the 100% scaling option means they look ok on the external monitors - Skype for Business &amp; Internet Explorer do not scale! Therefore the fonts are massive and it is extremely
 annoying to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must be a bug - i don't want to make one of my external monitors my main monitor as this means my window sizes are knackered when I return to just my SP4 display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas folks?</p>

            <p>I am experience a very similar problem using my Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. I am using the following set up with works, but it does not provide the best, crisp display on my SP4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a custom display using the Intel drivers to display 1800 x 1200 on my SP4 screen, set at 100% scaling. When I sign out/sign in, then connect to my external monitor it displays correctly. My SP4 screen is still manageable, but again it is not
 as crisp as I would like -- after all, I have paid over $1,000 for a "premium" device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope they fix this display scaling issue very soon. </p>

            <p>I had this same problem with my brand new Surface Pro 4 when docked to multiple monitors.&nbsp; Outlook, Excel, Word&nbsp;and Skype worked well; but PowerPoint, Internet Explorer and Skype for Business apps had poor resolution (the header / ribbon font size was enormous).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rectified this today by uninstalling the DisplayLink drivers, then rebooting the Surface and reinstalling the DisplayLink drivers.&nbsp; Now all of my applications appear correctly when docked with multiple monitors.&nbsp;

            I just wanted to add to the discussion that I am having this same issue with my SP4 with multiple external monitors at 1080p. The programs which are not scaling properly for me are Word 2016 and sometimes PowerPoint. I can't function with this happening
 to Word since I do a lot of document writing and editing. Very expensive machine and expensive software. Should not be experiencing these issues with products at this price point. This should be receiving more attention and support than it is.

<h2>            Touchpad cursor disappears and is unresponsive. &#40;Lenovo Yoga 13, Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    This is a problem that happened very recently. My touchpad was working fine. I opened my laptop up to the lock screen, saw that the keyboard had frozen, and restarted the laptop. The cursor disappeared, and I could not use the touchpad to even click it.
 The keyboard is working though.<br />
<br />
I tried doing a system restore and reinstalling the Synaptics Driver. I also tried looking at the mouse settings and changing them. These did not bring the cursor back. I looked up the shortcut for enabling and disabling the touchpad. These also did not fix
 the problem.<br />
<br />
Plugging in a USB mouse instantly caused the cursor to appear. I can use the USB mouse normally. While the mouse is plugged in, though, I still cannot click or move the cursor using the touchpad.
<br />
<br />
It seems like the computer does not recognize the touchpad at all. <br />

            <p>Xbox 1 already has a Windows 10-like OS. Xbox 1 officially has up to 3 operating systems (1) Windows kernel (2) Xbox OS (3) Hypervisor to combine the two. All product platforms need their own special operating system. You can't just dump an operating system from one device platform and expect it to work on another. Geniune Xbox 360 and Xbox 1 consoles also don't get viruses and genuine Xbox 360/1 consoles which genuinely have has got a virus using the official Xbox Live service, reports of those are negligible and since bad people may not find it feasible to write a virus since PC has a much higher base of users. At Launch, Xbox 1's OS was more like Windows 8, but it launched with several problems. It was too slow, the UI wasn't user friendly. Now with a Windows 10-like UI, the UI on Xbox 1 is much more faster and user friendly. And for those who say there isn't any difference between 8 and 10 lack attention to detail, because there are differences and performance enhancements between Windows 8

            <p>I would like to see this too a full Version of Windows 10 on the Xbox One. I bet the would be quite many who would use it. A friend of mine has a old notebook wich was used to play LoL but it&nbsp;died. Now he would need to buy a new Pc that's capable of playing LoL without FPS drops. This would cost about 400€ if its a cheap one. Almost the same price as the ONE X and it wouldn't even be capable of playing high end Games. From Consumer perspective it would be the best value for performance to get a one X with WIn 10 even if you cant crank up the details in LoL all the way. And then there is space if you got a small apartment you maybe wont have the space for a extra pc desk and&nbsp;the One x needs almost no space. I am pretty sure if you could boot into a full Win10 and use it like a normal pc with mouse and keyboard and all that stuff there would be many who would buy one only because of that. Even if you cant use the full potential of the one x in win 10 it should be enough.&nbsp;</p><p><

            Okay, I set it to 1280 x 768 (1280 x 800 wasn't an option).&nbsp; It is better, but I still feel like things are slightly blurrier than they used to be (like the letters have a slight shadow to them).&nbsp; Thanks for your help with this!

<h2>            Skype doesn&#39;t have a manual volume option</h2>
                    So skype does not have any kind of volume options ? I think that this should be fixed, my system and native sounds are all the way up and problem is i used an older version of skype on my old laptop, before i got a new laptop with windows 10 on it. Making
 me ONLY to install the latest version of skype. problem here is that it has adapted the previous settings of my other laptop's skype, so when i make a call i cant't volume (Up/Down). Please do consider to fix this problem, because Im forced to use Discord
 because of this issue (And i hate Discord) .

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/52603b86-a54e-4c35-b8f6-9996df2db747" title="IDunCarry :3">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype for Windows 10 app is fully dependent on the Windows 10 system volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no separate volume&nbsp;control for Skype in Windows 10. It is also not possible that the settings from your old laptop was adapted by the new pc since settings for Skype is saved locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try resetting the Skype app to reset the preference as well to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>Logout </strong>from the Skype app<br />
2. Restart your computer<br />
3. Open the Start menu and click <strong>Settings</strong><br />
4. Click <strong>Apps</strong><br />
5. Locate and click on the Skype icon from the Applications list<br />
6. Click <strong>Advanced Option</strong><br />
7. Select <strong>Reset</strong><br />
8. Re-launch Skype and login using your Skype account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Bluetooth problem on Surface Pro 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hikingstick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Bluetooth problem on Surface Pro 1</h2>
                    <p>There seem to be numerous threads out here pointing to Windows 10 having problems with Bluetooth connectivity. My issue is specific to a first generation Surface Pro, but presents much like others that have been reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to my Win10 upgrade, Bluetooth connections to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge) and&nbsp;keyboard (GE Bluetooth Universal Keyboard, 98617) worked perfectly. As soon as the upgrade completed, the tablet behaved as if all was good, but neither device worked
 with it. At first, I thought it was just a keyboard battery issue. I replaced those, but no change. I unpaired from the keyboard, but then it would not recognize it again. I checked and restarted services. I tried updating drivers directly from the manufacturer
 and from the bundle of Surface Pro drivers for Windows 10 that was linked on other threads here, but with no luck. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the device through Device Manager multiple times--no luck. I've tried the generic Bluetooth driver that shipped
 with the OS--no luck. After one recent uninstall and a manual install, I got the tablet to connect to my phone after around 13 failed attempts, though, once connected, I could not see anything on either device from the other. I did manage to transfer a PDF
 file from the tablet to the phone, however, by running the Bluetooth transfer executable from the System32 folder. Yet, still, no keyboard connectivity. At times, the Bluetooth controls don't respond properly, either. If I try to switch it off, it just chugs
 away and never completes the process. Sometimes, after successfully switching it off, I can't get it to switch back on (it slides to the on position, briefly shows any paired devices it last had, and then switches off again). During one set of attempts to
 manually reinstall the driver, I received errors that the device could not be configured (referencing "code 1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to toss out the keyboard, thinking it went bad, but I was able to pair with a different machine running Windows 8.1! After updating my brand new ASUS G20AJ gaming system to Windows 10, however, it stopped recognizing my keyboard, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options? I'm about ready to ditch Windows 10 in favor of Windows 8.1 (which I liked quite much, by the way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>GIVEN THE NUMBER OF POSTS HERE ABOUT BLUETOOTH ISSUES, AND THE NUMBER I FOUND REPORTED ON THE COMMUNITY SITE FOR PRE-RTM RELEASES, you (Microsoft) had to know you were about to release a product that had some serious issues. Shame on you!&nbsp;</p>

            Today I tried to connect my Samsung Galaxy s6 via bluetooth(as i had before the update)and had same issue. Was easy and fine with windows 8.1, and now it says connected, and I can't make or receive any calls or listen to my Pandora app. All happened after
 the update. Unfortunate. Anyone fix this yet?

            <p>I have tried all the fix solutions I could find. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers several times, and now have the on/off button. However although I can send over bluetooth, when I receive the devices connect then disconnect straight away before
 file transfer can take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now given up and am using a USB cable for now, will try again in a few weeks.</p>
<p>

            <p>After you have re-installed your bluetooth driver several times until the GUI bluetooth ON/OFF switch appears in the device widow. Microsoft in their wisdom have left incoming FTP of by default. You need the go to bluetooth advance settings then go to the
 tab and check the box that allows incoming ftp and if you ever hope to synchronise your PIM enable that also on the next tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had a problem with Outlook and fixed that by opening a command admin widow running msconfig to boot in safe mode then rebooting opening a command admin widow and running sfc / scannow to fix the system filing system it takes about 20 minutes.</p>

<h2>            COROU DUAS VEZES A ASSINATURA</h2>
                    
<p>Eu preciso conseguir falar com alguem do suporte xbox live. Fiz a assinatura no valor de R$89,90 e para minha surpresa no meu cartão está cobrando duas vezes de R$96.00, eu já tentei falar por telefone, já deixei mensagem para receber ligação mas não estou
 conseguindo falar com ninguem.</p>

<p>Estranho isso....sempre comprei gold pela live e nunca veio errado o valor. </p>
<p>Voce esta pagando 96 pq mudaram as politicas voce esta pagando a live em dolar portanto esta sujeito a IOF e a taxa de conversao do seu banco. Agora cobrar duas vezes.....muito estranho</p>

<p>Verifique quando será renovada a sua assinatura Xbox Live Gold. Se cobrou 2 vezes, você tem que ter 2 anos de Live Gold válidos. Caso contrário, você deve mesmo entrar em contato com o suporte.
