<h2>            2016 Word Free Trial Expired, Need Documents Off of it</h2>
                    My 2016 Word free trial has expired and I important documents like my resume and school assignments on there. All the options to copy it are locked and I really need them. I've also tried to do ctrl + c and ctrl + v and that won't work either. Does anyone
 know how I can get them off and/or copy them?

            Are you trying to copy the text from a running copy of Word? If so, don't do that. Use the File Explorer to copy the document files (*.docx) from the Documents folder to a USB drive or other removable media, or send them over a network or to a cloud storage
 server (Dropbox, etc.). Then you can open them in someone else's copy of Word.

            First, What is the Recordsource of your form? Do you have the navigation bar at the bottom of the form? If so you can just press the New Record button (the one with a yellow asterisk). This will save the current record and open a new blank record on the
 form.
<div><br />
<div>Note, that Access always works with live data. So there is no need to specifically Save a record. As soon as that record loses focus, but switching to a new record or a new form, the record is committed.</div>

            Hi Scott,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response. Right now I created everything on a blank form without any source for the form. Only the drop down inside the form are connect to tables for fetching the values to drop down.<br />
<br />
And the form navigation bar is greyed out other than previous and next navigation bars. Which I think are of no use unless and until I can save them.

            There are two types of forms; bound and unbound. With bound forms. Access handles all the input/output between the tables and the forms. With unbound forms (which&nbsp;is what you have) the developer needs to use VBA code to do all the I/O. Since you are new
 to Access I would recommend you use bound forms, at least until you are more comfortable with coding using VBA.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This means selecting a table as the Recordsource of your form. and assigning the fields in the table as Controlsources for the controls. In fact, I would recommend you&nbsp;first&nbsp;create all your forms, using the Form Wizard. Let the wizards do the heavy lifting
 for you. Then you can customize as needed.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks Scott. But there are too many forms that I will have to create. I think doing it through bound forms seems to be a lot of work as I will have to readjust everything in the design view again on each and every form I created.<br />
<br />
Please give me a good vba code just for having the navigation bar working and have its functionalists working.<br />

            <p>You may be making a fairly common mistake: trying to store data in Forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data is stored in Tables, and ONLY IN TABLES. A Form is not a data repository; it's just a tool, a window that lets you manage data stored in a Table. Bound forms are universal and routine, and Access provides good tools to build them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using unbound forms and writing elaborate code to move data to and from tables is certainly possible, and once in a great while may be necessary, but it is certainly "the hard way to do it"! Professional databases usually have LOTS of forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you explain why you feel that you would need too many forms? What differs between them?</p>

            I'm with John. Unbound forms IS the hard way. For each unbound form, you have write the code to handle the I/O. There is no generic code to do it. Its different for each form, since the controls and data on the forms are different.
<div><br />
<div>I also question why you think you will need a lot of forms? How many tables do you have? Or have you made a typical newbie mistake and started designing your forms before you designed your tables?&nbsp;</div>

            Thank you John and Scott. We have 6 branch offices and one Head Quarters. So what I thought on implementing was have a Menu on the front page and have all the Offices listed and then by selecting each office we should have the information of all the inventory.
<br />
<br />
Now that you both insisting me on working with Bound forms rather than unbound forms. I will start working on the bound approach. My only concern is making 7 tables with all the contents and then converting each table into forms and arranging each field inside
 the form is just very time consuming. <br />
<br />
Also please suggest me a simple method of working on the tables and forms.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all your help.<br />

            <p>I'm not sure I follow. Are these offices at different geographic locations, or more to the point, connected only by Wide Area Network (WAN) - Internet - connections? Or are they just different rooms in a building connected by a fast, stable LAN? Access is
 best suited to a LAN: it really isn't designed to work over a (much slower and less reliable) Internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do these seven tables differ? Do they contain different KINDS of data - different number of fields, different datatypes? Or are they all of the same "shape", just reflecting different departments' data? In other words, do you really need seven different
 forms, all of which (if I understand) are doing the same job just with different sets of inventory data? Maybe you just need ONE form, and you can change the Recordsource to point to different tables.</p>

            First, let me point out something. You started with the statement that you are "very new to Access". &nbsp;By extension and the nature of the questions you have asked, you are also new to database design. So you come here to get assistance from people who are
 experienced with both Access and database design. Yet instead of asking us HOW to do what you need to do, you are telling us what you think you should do, even despite our advice to the contrary.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>So the next mistake you make is in thinking you need separate tables for each of your offices and by extension separate forms. But the&nbsp;reality&nbsp;is that you probably don't. But before we can advise what the best design is we need more information about your
 situation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>John asks you several questions that we need answers to. In addition it would be helpful to know just what you are tracking in terms of inventory. &nbsp;Are you just tracking supplies that are provided to each office? Or are you tracking sales/purchases of
 product? What is the nature of the items you carry in inventory? What type of info do you need to capture about these items?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Proper database design is an art. And properly&nbsp;designing&nbsp;your database will pay dividends down the road in efficiency and ease of use. If you were expecting to just launch Access build a form and you would be done, then you were laboring under a misconception.</div>

            I will be using the database to store PC Inventory information which will include Software Information, Serial number, Product Number, Vendor, Date of Purchase and many more.
<br />
<br />
John I will be the only one who is gonna manage all the information from different offices at our HQ.<br />
<br />
I think I understood what I should do in terms of creating Tables and designing forms.

Scott, I am trying to make a good access DB for which I need so cool tips and tricks that might not make sense now but will in the near future. If you need more information please let me know.<br />

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If someone knows your Skype ID and Password, they could sign into your account on another device and create fake conversation.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you try securing your account by enabling two factor authentication (2fa) and also monitoring your account activity:

            The ovi suite updater has always been a bit flaky for me. Instead you should try the standard nokia software updater.<br />

            Hi, I've failed with both software updaters, and also over-the-air shows no update beyond 20.115 When I've been to Nokia website and put in my phone's code, it says software update not available for my phone, even though website says update should be available
 for N86. Now maps won't run at all, and I'm going away in a few weeks and use it as my sat nav. Please help

<p>When I've been to Nokia website and put in my phone's code, it says software update not available for my phone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple their is no update for your product code three different checks have told you that&nbsp; .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product code defines update path&nbsp; Nokia release firmware&nbsp; it then waits on local country regulations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed by&nbsp; wait for operator to pass or change with own add ons .</p>

<h2>            Migration - Object reference not set to an instance of an object</h2>
                    I'm attempting to migrate a single user over to O365 from our Zimbra mail server (on-premises). I have in the past successfully migrated over about a dozen people (one at a time). However, this particular user, when I start the migration like I did before
 (O365 Admin&gt;Users&gt;Data Migration&gt;Other email sources), the migration appears to start, but then will later say "<span>Object reference not set to an instance of an object."</span>&nbsp;Going to the Exchange Admin Center, the migration
 says it is Syncing (like it usually does), but after some time, the item count remains at 0. The Skipped Items count increases every once in a while with a blank "MissingItem". I've tried stopping and restarting the migration, but cannot seem to get it to
 start. The user in the meantime is receiving new emails to their new O365 account, but is stuck with all of their old email in the old mail system.

<h2>            Word for Mac 2011 text boxes not printing</h2>
                    I am using Snow Leopard and Office:mac 2011. I have the latest upgrade14.1.2.<br />
<br />
In Word, I use text-boxes to caption my images, but they do not print (I don't like Word's own captioning method)<br />
<br />
Someone on another site suggested grouping the textbox and the image box.<br />
<br />
Tried this, and it worked. It also corrupted my file! I have spent today getting it back (554 MB)<br />
<br />
Any fix possible?<br />

<h2>            Dynamic text in drop-down list</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2010, I would like to create a dropdown list who's content depends on a free text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've manage to create the text box and the dropdown list by going to the developer options, but then I'm a bit stuck. Here is an example of what I want:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the developer tab, I activate Design Mode and I click on Rich Text Content Control to create a free text box. Then I click on Properties, and I enter name as title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I create my dropdown. I select the Drop-Down List Content Control button, and I go to the properties. I enter 'select' in title, and I add the following items in the list:</p>
<p>-Hello ${name}</p>
<p>-Goodbye</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, ${name} is just a placeholder for whatever was entered in the free text box 'name'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I have the list display update itself with the content of the free text box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen examples on Google where people used Legacy dropdowns and macros. I don't mind using Macros, but if possible I would like to use the "modern" dropdown, and not the legacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>You will need a macro, which requires you to save the document (or the template, if that's where you put the content controls and the code) as a "macro-enabled" document or template (*.docm or *.dotm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, a couple of suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't need the name to be formatted (bold, italic, etc.), use a Plain Text content control instead of a Rich Text one. The Rich Text kind prevents users from tabbing out of the control (it just inserts a tab character). Since the dropdown content
 control can't show the formatting, that will always show the name in plain text.</li><li>You don't have to turn on Design Mode for any of this setup.</li><li>The code below assumes that the titles of the two content controls are all-lower-case. The places where the titles appear in the code must have the same capitalization (if any) as that in the Properties dialogs.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the macro editor (Alt+F11), locate the icon of your document or template in the Project box, expand it and expand the Microsoft Word Objects icon below it, and double-click the ThisDocument icon below that. Copy/paste the following code into the large
 empty area on the right, and save.</p>

<p>We reviewed your domain account (hostedcda.com) and determined that MX Record of your domain is still invalid. It is possible that the MX Record of your domain is not properly configured. We highly recommend that you set it up by following the instructions
 provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I. Get the MX record from your Windows Live Admin Center</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Go to <a href="http://domains.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://domains.live.com</a> and sign in with your administrator account.</p>
<p>b. Click on the <strong>domain</strong> you would like to manage. </p>
<p>c. Click on the “<strong>Domain Settings</strong>” link at the left side of the page.</p>
<p>d. Under MX Record, copy the MX Server values. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II. Change the MX Record configured in your domain</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have copied the MX Record, you then need to edit the MX Record configured in your domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Go to the <strong>registrar</strong> where you have purchased your domain. </p>
<p>b. You may contact the technical support of the registrar where you have purchased your domain for assistance in changing the MX Record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’ve already configured your domain settings but suddenly encountered an error, please refresh your Windows Live Admin Center account by following the instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Go to <a href="http://domains.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://domains.live.com</a> and sign in to your account.
</p>
<p>b. Click on the <strong>domain</strong> you would like to manage.</p>
<p>c. Click on the “<strong>Domain Settings</strong>” link at the left side of the page.
</p>
<p>d. Click on the “<strong>Refresh</strong>” button. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re still getting the same issue, we suggest changing the administrator account that you use to manage your domain.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to update this thread if you have further questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi PhilWarburton,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for geting back to me. If you want to sync contacts in your Mac/iOS, as a workaround, you need to upload your contacts into iCloud and add your iCloud account to Outlook client, and then Outlook will sync the contacts from your iCloud account.

<h2>            N79 Multimedia Menu only &#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I got this phone for xmas, from the stanby mode i press the menu button, which then displays the multimedia menu with the tile view on, Is there anyway for me to access the normal menu, so i can access the tools/settings option? this is very frustrating.
 I cannot even edit profiles, all i can do is select shortcuts from standby and enter the multimedia menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. If you know the file type you can change the extension to the appropriate type by editing the filename.</p>
<p>2. There are some filetype that use numeric extension, or at least partially numeric extensions, the following link takes you to&nbsp;a list of many extentions and what programs use thow extensions:</p>

<p>Sounds like you have a spreadsheet file from Apple's Numbers program:</p>
<p><a href="http://filext.com/file-extension/NUMBERS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filext.com/file-extension/NUMBERS</a></p>
<p>As far as I know, no Windows apps can open these, but the author of the file can probably save it in a format that you can open in Excel.&nbsp;</p>

            If you save and then rename the file extension to .zip, you can Extract the files. &nbsp;However, you will only get "preview" pictures of the content and not an actual sheet.

Using Google Drive is not necessary for the conversion. Visit cloudconvert.com, upload your file, convert. Supports "numbers". Worked for me.

<p>Hi Devon Rey Gilig,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option to achieve your intention in Outlook for Mac 2016. While I totally understand your concern to have this feature included. I suggest you submit your ideas via the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many features of current programs have been designed and upgraded based on customers’ feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

<p>Hello James,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before anything else, I would like to clarify if you're getting any error messages when trying to set up Gmail on your Outlook. Noting that you've enabled IMAP and SMTP setting between gmail and Outlook, let's try to add your Gmail using this advanced set
 up to double check if were configuring it accurately:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Outlook app and click on <strong>File</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Click <strong>Add Account</strong>.</li><li>Enter your email address &gt; Select<strong> Advanced options</strong> &gt; Check the box for&nbsp;<strong>Let me set up my account manually</strong> and select
<strong>Connect</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>IMAP</strong>.</li><li>The Account settings screen should be pre-populated with most of the account settings you need.</li><li>Enter your incoming and outgoing server settings and then select Next.
<ul>
<li><strong>IMAP incoming server:&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; imap.gmail.com</li><li><strong>IMAP port:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;993</li><li><strong>IMAP SSL:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes</li><li><strong>SMTP outgoing server:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; smtp.gmail.com</li><li><strong>SMTP port:&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; 587</li><li><strong>SMTP SSL or TLS:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; TLS</li><li><strong>POP incoming server:&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp; pop.gmail.com</li><li><strong>POP port:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 995</li><li><strong>POP SSL:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes</li></ul>
</li><li>Enter your password and then select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            Hi thanks. I have done both of these (2 step and internet password) once already and it worked. I’m now unable to send or receive emails and the internet email pop up does not seem to recognize the username or password. Both of which i have verified are
 correct. Do I need to do the 2way and internet password again?

<h2>            Opening meeting response &#34;invite.ics&#34; attachments removes attendees.</h2>
                    <p>On Outlook 2011 for Mac if someone creates a meeting and includes external invitees (in this case Google recipients). The external user accepts the invite and the originator receives the notification email with the "invite.ics" attachment. The attachment
 is read and the appointment is updated with the attendees status as normal. However if the Outlook 2011 user the created the meeting actually opens the attachment in the response email it breaks the meeting, basically converts it to an appointment and removes
 all the invitees.</p>
<p>I am able to reproduce this and it does not happen in Outlook for Windows.</p>

<h2>            New version of PC Suite - 6.85</h2>
                    Just downloaded and installed v. 6.85.12.0 (Norwegian).<br />
<br />
I cannot see my phone in the left pane (tried both USB &amp; Bluetooth connections).<br />
<br />
If I go into the settings menu, selecting one of the ComboBoxes (e.g. sound format), the result shows in upper left of my screen (outside of the application window).<br />

Anyone have experiences / tips / solutions ???<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Some questions:<br />
What is your phone and windows?<br />
Does other PC Suite applications working OK?<br />
<br />
And could you also send screen shot (where I can see what is outside of window)?

            My previous version was 6.84 and this worked fine.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled v. 6.85 and installed it again. Now I can connect - both via USB &amp; Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
So miksu - answer to your questions;<br />
- My phone is Nokia N95 (not the 8Gb)<br />
- Running on HP Compaq 6910p with Windows XP SP2<br />
- Other Nokia Applications are working fine (Map Loader &amp; Video Manager).<br />
- Screenshot - see attachment. The file has extension 'log', rename this to jpg.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I have downloaded PC Suite 6.85 and the install times out 40% through the installation. If I cancel and try reinstalling it tells me to complete the previous installation.<br />
<br />
I am running win xp professional with service pack 2 installed on an intel quad core pc.<br />
<br />
My phone model which I am not sure is relevant at this stage is a 5200

I downloaded it from the Nokia Europe site.<br />
<br />
This software appears to have corrupted my Visual Studio 2005 installation which is very frustrating. If the software has known issues it shouldn't have been released.

I am afraid 6.85 is still there for me based in the UK. I would be interested in getting 6.84 if that is stable.

            6.85 is totally official and works fine with me at least.<br />
<br />
Although have to admit it was a bit overwhelming:<br />
- got a pop-up that new version of PC Suite is available<br />
- installed it<br />
- got a pop-up that new verison of Video Manager is available, OK installed that too<br />
- got a notice tha there is new version of software to my N95, so took a backup with new PC Suite of my phone and then upgraded my N95 to new sw version ( I now have 20.0.015 dated 13th Nov 07)

it seems as the 6.85 has a problem with my<br />
DCV-14 Connectivity Stand.<br />
The hardwarebutton doesn't sync, when i push it<br />
<br />
When i fall back to the 6.84, there is the same now:(<br />
<br />
cable etc is correct, i can sync via software. The hardwarebutton only beeps, but do nothing.<br />

<h2>            Any fix for screeches when playing mp3&#39;s via bluetooth audio&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 920 and I have paired this phone with my car's bluetooth audio (Infiniti BT audio), a Jambox, and a Creative D200... all for the purpose of playing music back. When I play mp3's back from my phone, there are constant screech/scratch/pop
 noises at various points in the songs that do not occur when I play it back over the phone's speaker or headphone jack. My Lumia 900 or any other device paired via bluetooth does not have this problem with my BT audio devices.<br />
<br />
On a related note, these pops/hisses/screeches do not appear to occur when I play media back that I sync'd from Xbox music.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />

            DonLavu,
<div><br />
<div>I am experiencing similar issues when I am connected to bluetooth for calls. There is a persistent popping/crackling every few seconds that causes me to have the person I am talking to repeat what they said. It has become so bad that on many occasions
 I had to pull the phone off bluetooth and use the speakerphone while I am driving. When I do this - thecall quality is excellent, so there is definitely something wrong with the bluetooth connection.</div>

            Im also experiencing bluetooth audio playback issues - random popping sounds and a constant high pitched whine on my Lumia 920.
<div><br />
<div>The popping sounds seem to only be related to mp3 playback. Songs that ive ripped using windows media player (regardless of compression) will play random pops / crackles with a constant high pitched whine / hum over any bluetooth device. These same mp3s
 play fine through the speakers and through the headphone jack.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WMA audio (the same song as the mp3 tested above) only has the high pitched whine / hum...no popping or crackling over bluetooth...plays fine through speakers and headphone jack.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Netflix and other streaming media also only exhibits the high pitched whine / hum...no popping or crackling over bluetooth. Again, these play fine through the speakers and headphone jack.</div>

<h2>            N8 &#61; 480 euros worth of fail</h2>
                    
<p>Long time Nokia user. Started in 1996 with their banana phone, used 9200/9300i/E70/72/75/90 and now I bought a Nokia N8. Since I've had it, i had nothing but problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Wifi on the phone is mediocre. There is no simple off button and it takes 20 million menus to turn everything off but wait ... the phone still reconnects without me wanting it. Then you start configuring each widget and untick days on your e-mail accounts.
 You say you succeeded but wait ... the Nokia N8 phone reconnects yet again to your wifi network. Then you go back in the menu and sub menus and options and advanced settings and you turn everything off again and you disconnect manually from your hotspot ...
 but wait the phone reconnects again to your router. Now, the only option you have is ... delete destination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. You take your brand new toy to work and want to hook up to your corporate wifi network. You swipe to the second screen, tap your wifi widget to enable scanning, select your network, configure, open the nokia browser and the phone freezes. You look at
 it and give it a few seconds. Then you push the menu button and load the task manager. You click X on the browser, nothing. You click close all nothing. You press the menu button again and ... the phone is not&nbsp;responding. You are left with the power button.
 You push the power button, hold of 8 seconds and wait for the phone to switch off. Phone switches off, you give it a minute, turn it back on but it gets stuck on the Nokia logo. You wait 2 minutes and what happens? The screen saver kicks in. You unlock the
 phone, its the nokia logo. You lock the phone, its the screen saver. You reset the phone again. This time it works like a charm but reconnects to wifi whenever it wants not whenever you want. None of the solutions here on the board worked. Having it hog my
 service provided contract is not an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Theme effects are better viewed off. Putting them on simply ruins the UI experience on this phone. Use the phone a bit with theme effects on and at one point you have 2-3 menus in overlay mode and you cannot make heads or tails. Swiping with theme effects
 is poor and you are better off with the button to change home screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Favourite contact carousel. Good idea, poorly done. I have 4 main contacts, Superman, Batman, Julia and Bruce. I want to call John who is number 6, i swipe with my finger and call John. Afterwards, I want to return the carousel to the 4 contacts I call
 more often: Superman, Bartman, Julia and Bruce. I use my finger to swipe these 4 contacts into place, release the finger, the carousel moves on its own and shows other contacts. I try again with my finger, position these 4 contacts to the&nbsp;millimetre, release
 finger and the carousel moves again. After I manage to put my 4 contacts, I reboot the phone and the carousel shows other contacts not the 4 I left before I rebooted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Image gallery. I have 100 pictures. Swiping from pic 1 to pic 2 pic 3 is all good. Swiping from pic 100 to pic 99 to pic 98 is good. Swiping from pic 1 backwards to pic 100 shows a double jump in transition. &nbsp;People on other boards have said this is the
 Nokia way of showing that you are at the end of the gallery. If this is true, Nokia engineers ran out of ideas. Jumping like that between the first and last picture makes you cringe. The animation seems broken!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Light sensor. A mind of its own really. You set it one way, it ends up in another. You hold the phone in your hand without having changes in light conditions and the phone changes its brightness on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Nokia N8 and OVI Suite. A lethal duo. Crash after crash after crash. OVI crashes 2-3 times a day and formatiing doesn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Camera. &nbsp;Impressive, fast, accurate, interface is 10 years old. I made the mistake of enabling "save location". My phone drove me crazy with the GPS. Every 2 seconds " Define access point, define access point, define access point?" I kept saying NO but
 the phone ignored me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. E-MAIL Client. Back to the drawing board guys. Not efficient and badly done. I would use the web interface but the browser is not good either. Try writing in landscape mode an e-mail on an outlook web access account. The layout is so bad you cannot even
 arrange the text in a decent manner. That landscape keyboard has got to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Ovi Store App on the phone. Slow and often fails to sign in eventhough you have proper internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Third party apps. Gravity is the only app worth praising, the Nokia social needs to go too. I bought quick office full and look at the attachments what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can say one thing. If the coming updates do not make this phone work the way it is intended and for the price I paid, I will sell it on eBay and jump ship like most of the symbian users. Now I understand why Nokia's market share is in tatters. My blind
 loyalty for this company kept me with this N8 and I should not compromise so much for the money I paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S: I have the latest updates on it, including the one that came out yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything is off and the only way for it to stop reconnecting is to remove the e-mail widgets from my home screen and delete the e-mail accounts. This is a must eventhough I made sure that in every WIFI and E-MAIL setting menu, there is nothing that makes
 the phone reconnect on its own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The swipe transition between the first and last photo and vice versa is broken. There is this double jump between pictures. If you swipe forward from pic one to pic two everything is normal. If you swipe backward from pic 2 to pic 1, everything is normal.
 If you swipe backward from pic 1 to pic 50 (which is my last image, for example, in the gallery) you get a jumpy broken swipe movement between these two pictures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I previously mentioned, I do not have a memory card ... yet. I wanted to buy a 16GB class 6 when I bought the phone but luckily I did not spend the money. This phone has a lot of features which in my opinion cannot detract from the larger picture : the

<p>In a very long-winded way of saying that there ought to be a simple switch to switch of all WLAN activity in online mode. Whilst you won't get much argument, this is hardly the end of the world. The N8 is a computer, and comes filled with software that runs
 on internet access. It is easy enough to set it to WLAN only, so it won't cost you anything.</p>

<p>Assuming from the description that you are talking about the contacts widget in the home screen (which is not actually called favourites, 'Favourits' is a separate feature in the contacts app itself which simply lists selected contacts ahead of the rest
 of the list irrespective of alpha-numeric order), like other respondants in this thread, I have not experienced any poor performance of the scrolling. The order they are shown in is, as far as I can tell, the order in which you add the to the widget. I also
 find that when the phone starts up, it is displaying the end of the list.</p>

<p>I have used Ovi Suite 2.2 under Vista with no crashes. When I reformatted the PC and installed 7, I got the new Ovi Suite 3 - and I still have no crashes. The new version seems quicker, especially to start up, performance with N8 and N96 has been fine. Some
 people have more issues with Ovi Suite than others, which would appear to suggest a local issue or conflict on the machines that are crashing which you would be better trying to troubleshoot in the Ovi Suite board - if you post in there, thre is a chance that
 Nokia Employee members will see your issue and try to help you.</p>

<p>If the phone has no GPS fix and you have things like A-GPS and WLAN-based positioning switched on in the positioning settings, the phone will need to connect in order to fix the position. It isus the phone's standard positioning settings, so that's where
 you need to be looking. Again, sorry to say, I have not been able to reproduce this issue on my N8.</p>

<p>I've used Quickoffice 5 on N82 and N96 and now Quickoffice 6 on the N8. I'm not that impressed with the way the Quickoffice people have adapted the UI of their app for touch screen, but I have no issue with corrupted display that you show here. Be aware
 that Quickoffice readers are installed on the N8 (as with other Nokia models) under licence from the producers, it is not a Nokia app, the issues that you are experiencing may be an issue with either the app or the phone - you'd need to troubleshoot it more
 to deterine that.</p>

<p>I for one am sorry for anybody who feels that way, but at the end of the day for millions of us around the world, the N8 is working at least more-or-less the way it is intended to. From some of what you describe, I suspect that you lay have one of the early
 problem batch and you should at least get it properly checked with Nokia for the freezing. Also, check any apps - there have been numerous people saying that some third party apps designed for S60 work fine on S^3 whilst others cause problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of your complaints seem to be simply things that are working fine but you do not like the way they are executed. No company can design for everybody's taste, but you not liking something doesn't make it wrong.</p>

<p>I clearly explained in my posts that my N8 has huge issues with WLAN but you simply ignored me. I told you that the constant reconnection to the network makes the phone freeze and I end with a reset. I don't want it to reconnect on its own, especially knowing
 it has problems. Furthermore, I don't want it to connect via 3.5G without me wanting it. The Nokia N8 does what it wants. I have used Symbian for more than 6 years now and I've owned the e-series devices I mentioned in my first post. I have never had any of
 these issues! &nbsp;I want to use my N8 to my corporate network and the phone crashes. The E70/72/75 and E90 I own on the side have no issues with the wifi network. They work spot on! I tell these damn phones not to connect on wifi they will not connect. They simply
 work without a hassle, whereas the N8 is a major headache. I end up deleting homescreens, removing widgets and e-mail accounts in order for the phone to stop connecting "behind my back" and drain my battery?</p>

<p>The phone works flawlessly on WEP and on open networks. It has huge problems with WPA2 settings and other security methods. Every network I use secured and the phone crashes. I won't change my whole gear just for the N8. I won't ask our IT manager to set
 up a special AP just for my N8. It is ridiculous. The iPhone in my institution work, the drois and WP7 have no issues. My E-series devices work, the N8 does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home, I had to run a second router just for the N8 because it would fail to keep the connection on my usual WPA2 router? I have 10 devices connected to that one and the N8 needs a special one with WEP?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a few questions for you ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do the following devices I own work with wifi?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. E70</p>
<p>2. E72</p>
<p>3. E75</p>
<p>4. E90</p>
<p>5. iPhone 4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a few questions to you as well...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are you trying to do here? i mean are you expecting any help to solve your problem or Just want to prove that N8 is bad? There are many happy N8 users here, who have rather never&nbsp;observed&nbsp;the problems you stated or found a work around to overcome it.
 Let me tell you one thing. The devices you have listed are from E series, If they didn't work with wifi it is a sin. iPhone is the one ultimate device from apple, it should work. N8 is a multimedia computer, It is not designed to work with your&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;email,
 Wifi but it does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you,</p>
<p>Why No other phones make a still image that is as true and&nbsp;clear&nbsp;as N8?</p>
<p>Why Doesn't the phones you mentioned replace my home media player as N8 does?</p>
<p>It may give you an idea that N8's&nbsp;territory&nbsp;is deferent. Even if you wanted some of those and wanted a device that supports the&nbsp;corporate stuffs, you should have waited for E7. N8 does what it intended to Do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to understand the problems you are facing with and need to overcome them just do some research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection settings of N8 works way different from iPhone/Droid likes and Old&nbsp;Symbian&nbsp;likes. it has a hybrid&nbsp;approach, and ya there are problems, hopefully they will be solved soon,&nbsp;Even though I have never encountered the problem you say when i connect
 my N8 to my university networks and National lad networks, it work like a charm. A little tweak in the email settings totally got rid of the auto connection issue. A-GPS needs data network access (The main reason for all&nbsp;&nbsp;those "connection failed, access denied"
 messages or the&nbsp;occasional&nbsp;data network connection). Check the apps you use, it is well reported that whatsapp app&nbsp;causes&nbsp;a 3G data connection or incase you don't have it causes a connection through MMS settings, and there are work around for it (Even though
 it is not an N8 problem). consistent reconnection is not an issue of N8's WiFi handling, its a bug on mail app, where it gains the priority over system settings (issue of the hybrid system&nbsp;implementation, either all the apps should be re written or System
 should be given ultimate priority)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You &nbsp;said you need to go through 10s&nbsp;menus&nbsp;to reach WiFi settings, may I ask you have you ever&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to tap on the WiFi icon that comes up on the Notification bar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still Don't like N8, you are always welcome to switch the board. "Nokia never say N8 is the one we offer, you have to buy only that" there are plenty of alternative inside Nokia and as well as outside. &nbsp;I'm sure you are gonna miss a lot when you switch
 the board.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A bit of research on your part and you will see that there are many unhappy N8 users too. They are all reporting issues that are vital to the N8s functionality. Look around other boards and you will see that apart from not connecting and "invalid server
 name" the N8 also has a tendency of crashing wireless networks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You are telling me to find a work around to overcome basic functionality problems? What are we, the 90s where the end user had to put a tin foil on his head and pray to god that it works? Wifi is like SMS nowadays and what Nokia has done with the N8
 and Symbian^3 is unacceptable. S603rd edition works better on wifi than Symbian^3. &nbsp;Regarding your E series point, should I understand that if I want proper wifi connectivity I should stay away from the N series and only buy the &nbsp;e-series? Get real bro, the
 N8 is Nokia's flagship phone and truth be told it does not walk the walk. The spec sheet says wifi, I expect for 480 euros to not lose wifi connection, to not give invalid server name, to not crash my network and to work when I browse the web.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Let me ask you,</p>
<p>Why No other phones make a still image that is as true and&nbsp;clear&nbsp;as N8?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mate, I am a professional photographer and I use 2.8 lenses on my Nikon D3s cameras. &nbsp;I've got images at iso 12000 better than some images captured indoors with the N8. This cameraphone point on the N8 is moot because I did not buy the phone just for the
 camera. Let's assume for the sake of argument that I agree with you, what about the issues i've mentioned. I want to use this device for other things than taking pictures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not wait for the E7 because it is a not a pure communicator device. I learned my lesson with the E90. The only pure communicator was the 9300i, the rest were not worth the communicator name. You are saying that the N8 does what it is supposed to do.
 What is that? Playing games, taking pictures, filming, HDMI and listening to music? These are the only things that the N8 does right. If by your definition, the phone is defined by these major features then you are not doing this board justice. I was expecting
 some professionalism and serious attitude.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You &nbsp;said you need to go through 10s&nbsp;menus&nbsp;to reach WiFi settings, may I ask you have you ever&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to tap on the WiFi icon that comes up on the Notification bar?'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another point showing that you do not read what people say. This is not my first BBQ and just because Symbian^3 is ... "new" it took me exactly 5 minutes to feel at home with it. It is not different, interface wise, than what I've used for the past 5-7 years.
 I know my way around symbian phones and the N8 is no different. &nbsp;Let me tell you a story ... I click on the home screen wifi icon, I go in the wifi menu, I then click on the network, disconnect, then back, settings, connectivity, destinations, select the wifi
 network so I can delete it ... error message with cannot delete network whilst connected. I go back to the wifi menu and disconnect again, now faster and quicker like FLASH i go back to the destination menu and click on the network delete. Bang, another error
 cos the N8 reconnected to the network. &nbsp;I repeat the process until I am fast enough to actually delete the destination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this how a 2010 Nokia flagship device behaves?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you still Don't like N8, you are always welcome to switch the board. "Nokia never say N8 is the one we offer, you have to buy only that" there are plenty of alternative inside Nokia and as well as outside. &nbsp;I'm sure you are gonna miss a lot when you
 switch the board."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No doubt, I will think twice before spending money on another Nokia product. If I wasn't a guy who compromised and waited and did not jump to the competition, I don't know who did. I am willing to forego the audio quality for a more balanced product in the
 future. &nbsp;If PR1.1 and PR 2.0 do not fix this device, its on ebay and I am done with it. I've reset the phone 5 times and reinstalled the FW with the latest updates twice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Nokia or whoever reads this,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hardware does what software says and not the other way around. Having the best hardware on the market and coupling it with an unpolished OS is worse than actually not taking out a phone and allowing the men in white coats to bring out a working product.
 &nbsp;Nokia dear, you are stuck in your past and you do not realise that today's world wants simplicity and efficiency. Sure, hardcore symbian users like me will accept your menu sub menu, left right, up down, approach but new clients will not be so forgiving.
 &nbsp;Your market share is going down and the majority has lost confidence. &nbsp;Meego here, meego there, but until that moment comes, you are digging yourself into a bigger hole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok dude, I understand your frustration. Thats why i said you are always welcome to switch the board. I have no gain in defending N8 or Nokia. It is not my point. I read your post and I saw your phone history, it was fully comprised of E series devices and
 iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, If you are not aware, N8 is not a flagship device from Nokia, It is Nokia's Imaging Flagship and there is no denial in the fact that N8 is the best camera phone available to date, I bought N8 only for its imaging capabilities and i never expect a DSLR
 quality in it, I just want it to replace a point and shoot, so that i can carry my camera with me always. It Does what i wanted. I know there are Number of Unhappy N8 users too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some users report that their Nokia N8 would crash when connected to a Wi-Fi network secured with WPA2 (that didn’t happen with our unit though). They suggested switching off Power saving to remedy the problem.........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>....Performance near the router improved for both N modes – it went from about -8% to 10% on the positive side....</p>
<p>That’s still not a huge improvement over Wireless G, but it answers why the Nokia N8 was the only phone losing speed near the router when using Wireless N. Performance away from the router remained the same though"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"However further away from the router, it was the Nokia N8 that came on top. Although it didn't show much benefit from the Wireless N mode, the N8 had the most consistent throughput (between 10 and 14 Mbps) that kept its pace from all locations and in all
 test modes"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GSM ARENA: Its a nice article comparing the WiFi modes of all phones with N band (including iPhone) it tels you about the router settings and the functionality of WiFi n- band (<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/wireless_n_bluetooth_3_speed_test-review-551.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gsmarena.com/wireless_n_bluetooth_3_speed_test-review-551.php</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope it will give you some insight of the problem or&nbsp;at least&nbsp;the impression that I'm aware of the problem. I have read so many &nbsp;forums, and i know a bit about the frustrations too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using an HTC desire and i bought <strong>N8</strong> &nbsp;for its camera, I'm pretty happy with it. I was aware that N8 is not gonna give me the better browser, or the seamless social networking integration before i bought the phone, I was ready to sacrifice
 it because of the camera. I know its not the same for all users, And&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;Nokia knows it, thats why they have C6-01, C7 and E7 (Not released yet though) all running in S^3 to address the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You are telling me to find a work around to overcome basic functionality problems? What are we, the 90s where the end user had to put a tin foil on his head and pray to god that it works? Wifi is like SMS nowadays"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How are you using your iPhone, without the bumper or with the bumper? Do you really need a Bumper to use a phone? - I'm not trying to put the iPhone down here, What i say is people do compromises and workarounds to use even the expected phone function of
 a phone. So why can't you find a workaround to use it for sometime. In N8's case the problem can be sorted out with a firmware update (Hopefully it will), but in the other case, it will never be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>mate, you got me wrong, My smartphone adoption started with 6600 (Symbian first edition), I was really tired off with the&nbsp;Symbian&nbsp;after some time (playing with 6630, SE P900, 7610), then i purposefully chose a series 40 (to stay away from smart phone). I
 switched to WinMO 6.1 then after annoyed with the UI, came to Symbian^1 aka V5 (5800). It was full of double tap single tap&nbsp;nonsenses&nbsp;(I loved the phone though and I'm still using it), i was frustrated more than you and i switched to android. Used HTC desire,
 wildfire (for about 2 months only) then I came back to S^3. i didn't try iPhone only because i don't like the icon centric design of iOS. Before to jump into S^3 my serious consideration was WP7 (i didn't coz WM6.1 really spoiled me, only alternative to the
 functionality of WM6.1 is Symbian, you will never get what you want in Android or WP7 after using WM6.1). I say this because to let you know that i have a little background in Smartphone OS too. I know whats wrong with S^3. I will say S^3 is the first touchscreen
 OS from Symbian (Not the UI) Because S^1 is not at all a touch OS, the OS itself. It was just a translation from D-Pad. I consider S^3 equal to android cupcake in 2009. So I'm giving it a fair chance to prove itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S^3 is not ready yet. For example, In call log, it miss the feature "filter by this number", Just because S^3 cant select something, Press and hold popup menu should have it, but the filter is there in the option, you cant select so you don't have filter
 by selected. There are so many glitches, including the WiFi auto connect. S^1 or any other&nbsp;Symbian&nbsp;controls&nbsp;the connection from within app, S^3 has kind of a universal connection, (its not closed as S^1 or open as iOS or Android, its a hybrid&nbsp;approach, But
 S^3 didn't get it correct, it gives the priority to some apps (especially email app) than the system settings). S^3 is Complete as a multimedia OS (thats why Nokia released it in N series). its not yet ready for the&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;computing (thats why they pushed
 the E7 release - E series was never my boat, Because i don't need what they offer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want More understanding about N-Series and E-Series&nbsp;Wikipedia&nbsp;is a nice place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Nokia Eseries</strong>&nbsp;consists of business-oriented smartphones, with emphasis on enhanced connectivity and support for corporate e-mail push services. All devices have advanced office features. Phones equipped with&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wireless
 LAN</a>&nbsp;also provide a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VoIP</a>&nbsp;client (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SIP</a>&nbsp;Protocol).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia</a>&nbsp;Nseries</strong>&nbsp;is a product family that includes&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">multimedia</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">smartphones</a>.
 These are mobile devices supporting digital multimedia services such as music playback, video capture, photography, mobile gaming and Internet services. Some Nseries devices support high-speed wireless technology, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">3G</a>,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little more in to it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The numbers describe the traits of the phone -N7x - 7 series are the balanced phones. they have balanced features and are the cheapest Nseries phones -N8x - 8 series are the camera phones (except N90 and N93) -N9x - 9 series are the high end part of the
 Nseries</p>

<p>"Playing games, taking pictures, filming, HDMI and listening to music? These are the only things that the N8 does right. If by your definition, the phone is defined by these major features then you are not doing this board justice"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately that is what turns out to be the focus of N8 as per the branding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what i bought, and I have no complain, If some one don't know what he bought and complain (Like my grinder doesn't play video) it is&nbsp;totally&nbsp;insane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I sounded harsh, but that is the truth. otherwise there are no point in branding, Numbering and so on. Nokia can also have a one ultimate product, a superpower almighty and Keep on investing only in that. That is not the goal, You can find a
 device that is suitable for you in&nbsp;Nokia's&nbsp;product line, if you don't like it, you have other options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally I give&nbsp;Damian&nbsp;Dinning&nbsp;(if you don't know, he is one of the man behind the superb camera of N8) words here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What may not be right for you doesn't mean it's rubbish. That would be like me saying that a 2-seater sports car is useless and therefore rubbish because I can't get four people in it. What was the manufacturer thinking of!? Probably that there are some
 people who that's all they want. For me (as much as I would like a sports car) it's simply not practical (due to two young children), but I don't go around telling others it’s bad. It wasn’t designed with me in mind, that’s all"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>".....But if you’re not one of them, that's OK. I hope in our portfolio of products there will be one which suits your needs better. ........."</p>
<p>".....If we still don’t have a product that fits your needs, on to point 5…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry pal, I don't wanna undermine you, What you say are problems, for sure, I too Hope they will get fixed soon, I too Frustrated in times, But lets first understand these things and try to adopt them. We are frustrated because we don't understand what
 Nokia are aiming at, We all think that N8 is a "Flag ship" from Nokia so it should be an iPhone killer, No it is not, It is not the ultimate (N9 may sometimes, or it may also turn out to be a geek's phone - more unlikely)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rodney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be noted that Office 365 Public Folder (PF) won't be shown automatically but it needs to be manually checked. For example, if the user is using the Outlook client, he needs to go to Outlook client's "Folders view". You can refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1b60443-6622-42ce-ab2b-bb11e336dd04?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1b60443-6622-42ce-ab2b-bb11e336dd04?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, we can check if the PF exists, we (as an admin) can directly go to the
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange Admin Center (EAC)</a>&gt; public folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

            I don't understand at all. I'm trying to see why a person can't see the public folder on a regular basis, why would I remove permissions? can someone tell me if public folders are being discontinued?&nbsp; I'm about ready to use a Google calendar and I hate
 google

<p><span>Hi Rodney,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Office 365 PF is still in use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>For your situation, please make sure the PF exists in EAC (Exchange Admin Center) while the user can't view the PF in Outlook client. That is to say, if the PF doesn't exist in EAC, the user will be not able to see it in the Outlook client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it exists in EAC but the user can't view it in the Outlook client, please upload a video recording the whole process (including the existing PF in EAC but the user can't view in in Outlook client) so that we can view what is happening here and move forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Copy&#47;paste shape, Powerpoint to Word&#58; Windows Metafile missing from Paste Special</h2>
                    I'm testing the transferability of files between networks.&nbsp; One issue we had was blocking of files containing Windows Metafile (WMF) images.&nbsp; Now I'm testing whether that is now fixed.&nbsp; However, I can't seem to create a test Word file containing a WMF
 image.&nbsp; If I copy a shape from Powerpoint and try to paste it into Word using Paste-&gt;Special, the only vector format is Enhanced Metafile.&nbsp; There is no option for WMF.&nbsp; Has support for that been dropped?

            If an Enhanced Windows Metafile will do, open the image in the free IrfanView and then save it in that format.

            I'm not sure how that addresses the problem.&nbsp; I am seeking to create a WMF image so that I can test whether it can successfully be emailed.&nbsp; I normally don't use WMF, but this is for test purposes.&nbsp; As well, I have limited ability to install any apps,
 so I'm more focused on why Word's native Paste-Special feature doesn't offer the option of pasting as WMF.&nbsp; Has support for that (or at least for the creation of WMF images) been dropped?<br />

            I appreciate the explanation.&nbsp; However, I'm not trying to prepare an actual document.&nbsp; I'm just testing whether files with WMF images will be blocked.&nbsp; I don't always control whether files have EMF or WMF, so knowing whether WMF is blocked or not lets
 me know what kind of difficulties I may run into in the future.<br />

<p>Unfortunately, this is occurring on a work computer, and I have extremely limited abilities to change it in any way, including installing apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to bring the subject back to the original question, which was whether support for pasting of WMF has been dropped.&nbsp; Can anyone else do a simple test to check?&nbsp; All I did was place a rectangle with rounded corners on a Powerpoint slide, than attempt
 a copy/paste into Word.</p>
<p>
