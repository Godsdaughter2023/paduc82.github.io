<h2>            Tablet Mode in Windows 10 Makes Tablets Unusable</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to get to grips with Windows 10 on a 10" Yoga 2 tablet I bought recently but the touch experience is so bad that the device is all but unusable with the Windows 10 Preview on it. To try and get my head around this I have been looking at
 a lot of forums, in the hope of getting some insights into what on Earth Microsoft might be thinking in doing this to (presumably) millions of happy Windows 8 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the course of the past few weeks I have looked at it every which way and come to the conclusion that Tablet Mode is the main thing making my tablet unusable. That's right, the mode that is supposed to be there to make my tablet experience better is
 actually making it worse. To be fair, it isn't making it a whole lot worse, it is still terrible even when you are not in Tablet Mode, but the thing is that Tablet Mode takes a few handy features away and doesn't add anything to compensate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give a few examples. Firstly, we have all these great new window snapping features on the Desktop but they don't work in Tablet Mode, so we are stuck with a limit of two windows side-by-side, which is worse than the four apps we could show side-by-side
 in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there is the Start Menu. Tablet Mode hides all the elements they have shoehorned in to make it look a little bit like W7 but it doesn't give us back that space for Live Tiles or anything else. It is just a big, blank, dead zone. You can't even use it
 to scroll, even though it is the most obvious place to try. Unfortunately, that is where they have chosen to place the power button, so touch users are now expected to go to more effort than other users in order to shut down their devices. Thanks, we really
 appreciate being treated as second class citizens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest thing with Tablet Mode, though, is that it makes every window, every dialog box even, open full screen. Microsoft, I can tell you for a fact that nobody has ever had a need for Notepad to be open full screen on a full HD screen and making&nbsp;a tabbed
 dialog, e.g. "Sound" from Control Panel, full screen is completely pointless if it is simply going to draw the same tiny UI in the top-left corner and leave 95% of the screen blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one and only thing I can see Tablet Mode doing that actually aids touch use is spacing out the items in the System Tray. Well, I suppose that's something but I'd still rather have no Taskbar and all those things accessible from the Charms Bar. (I'll
 admit, too, that it took me a while to warm to the Charms Bar but now I find it very handy.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I didn't know better, I'd think Microsoft had decided that the best way to get desktop users back on-side was to deliberately break the tablet experience and make those who supported what Microsoft were doing with Windows 8 as deeply unhappy as they possibly
 could. i.e. "You know all those crazy&nbsp;guys who loved Windows 8? Well, those guys all hate Windows 10 so you're gonna love it!" That's how it feels like I am being treated by Microsoft right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not just on my tablet, either. I use the Modern UI version of IE11 on my PCs&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong> the time. It is far and away my favourite browser and once you get used to seeing the Image of the Day full-screen with minimal clutter, every other browser
 seems to offer a second-rate experience. In fact, overall I like to use a mix of old and new on my PCs, so forcing me to choose one way or the other in Windows 10 feels like you are taking away too many options. And I have to tell you, forcing me to go through
 endless lists of on/off switches to set it up to do things this way&nbsp;or that is extremely tedious and a&nbsp;poor substitute for the seamless&nbsp;way Windows 8 allows me to decide the best way of doing each individual task, depending on the circumstances.</p>

            As of now the actual 10 update didn't fix any of this. I am seriously thinking of going back to 8.1 before my 1 month is up. The sad part is, as was mentioned,&nbsp;that my non-touch screen&nbsp;PC is a better tablet then my use to be wonderful ASUS tablet. :'-(

<h2>            Difference between Office 365 for Personal and Office 365 ProPlus &#40;Jan 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I would like ask question about Office 365 Plan. </p>
<ol>
<li>Other than OneDrive for Business, what are the differences between Office 365 Personal and ProPlus?</li><li>I am aware that both plans are based on subscription system, it means that Microsoft Office&nbsp;applications&nbsp;(Word, Excel, PowerPoint) in both plans always receive the newest feature update. So, can I conclude that Office 365 Personal and ProPlus are the same
 in term of Microsoft Office applications?</li></ol>

<p>To help you solve your problem, if you are an individual user buying for personal use, then O365 Personal should more than fit your needs. On top of that, because its a bundle, you also get extra stuff like larger One Driver Personal, Skype Personal Credits
 and enhance Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft offers various productivity tools in 3 office365 families. Personal, Business and Enterprise. Within these 3 families is email, storage, communication MS-Office, and various other apps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Personal is the MS-Office component of Office365 Personal family (as I gave you a summary earlier)<br />
</p>
<p>Office Pro Plus is the MS-Office component of the Office365 Enterprise family, and is avaliable standalone USD12/user/month, or part of E3, E4 and E5 bundled plans. Due to it being the MS-Office bundle of the Enterprise family, it includes certain specific
 features that is required to work with the Enterprise family products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS-Office Pro Plus includes Skype for Business Full client, to provide enhanced features to work with Skype for Business Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS-Office Pro Plus also includes InfoPath, a E-Form App that works with SharePoint&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS-Office Pro Plus allows installs on a shared computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS-Office Pro Plus works with Azure Information Protection, a document usage control feature included in E3 , E4 and E5</p>

<p>
</p><p>What you are trying to do is to compare a personal bundled plan that includes a &nbsp;personal version of MS-Office, vs a standalone MS-Office product that is part of a commercial family of Office365 apps offered to large enterprises.</p>

    <title>Some questions about Windows 10 Insider Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limer324  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some questions about Windows 10 Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>I joined the Insider Program way back in August 2015, but since then, I reinstalled Windows 10. I used a command-line based app which lited the system at the end of the Setup. Everything except essential components and services are removed. Everything is
 working flawlessly, and performance on my 1GB RAM computer is just fine. So, I have some questions about Insider Previews:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Will errored updates delete all data on/format&nbsp;<strong>all</strong> 3 partitions accidentially, or just corrupt the C: partition's system files?</li><li>Will updates and new builds screw up the liting (so they'll add all the bloatware back, and screw the performance and usability altogether)?</li><li>How it'll affect <strong>performance</strong>? Will it eat up all memory and CPU like in Windows 7?&nbsp;<em>I really hope it won't.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I think rejoining should be a great idea, and I feel sometimes great when installing Windows from complete scratch. Just a Win 10 installer on my USB, and okay. Thanks for the helpful answers a lot. ;)</p>

</p><p>1GB of ram devices are only supported on Windows 10 Insider Slow Ring now.&nbsp; This change in Windows 10 minimum requirements has changed and is now 2GB.&nbsp; Windows 10 Creators Update and Fall Creators Update cannot be updated to on a

            <p>Hi, Raymond </p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked today to make sure I have the latest app version - I do.&nbsp; I also (again) reset all email addresses. It's still not syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we get to terminology&nbsp; - what I call an app is what I installed on my mobile devices (has a widget on cell phone &amp; notebook). I refer to my desktop &amp; laptop as stationary devices. On these, i access outlook.live (I subscribe to OFFICE 365 HOME). So ...
 it's these two that don't seem to communicate (app versus outlook.live). If I try to access outlook.live from a mobile device, I usually (but not always) get an error message "Something went wrong. We could not complete your request. " (or something along
 that line).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the MS update in early October, I accessed outlook.COM (not .live) on all devices &amp; everything synced. I never had the app &amp; only got that because one of the MS employees told me it was the only way to access Outlook from mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had probably 30 phone calls and 6 case #'s with various MS departments &amp; have heard every "explanation " under the sun: 1) it's my isp&nbsp; (sure, at&amp;t - it's not them); 2) 365 Home doesn't sync with the app. (Why not? Everything synced before the early
 October MS update.); 3) I have to get an Exchange account (from what I've seen online, this type account is only for a school or business ), but if I do need that, no one can tell me how to get it; 4) "Ma'am, it seems you're confused". (Tell me that one more
 time &amp; I'll find out where you live.) Hey, customer service reps, if I'm so confused, clear it up for me. I'sn't that your job?; 5) There's more, so much more, but I'm reeling from 3-1/2 months of dealing with all this. (Really - I PAY for this?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current rant over.</p>

<p>I have an Office 365 HOME account (HOME makes a difference from what I've been told). And it was one MS rep who told me that I had to use the app with mobile devices (never did that before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm told that there is nothing wrong with the app - that it's either my MS account or ISP (AT&amp;T). So - I'm going to call AT&amp;T for the 5th time &amp; talk w/ someone in IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have any other cell phone? No, only one. I have desktop, laptop, cell phone &amp; notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the domain of my account Outlook.com? If you're asking me what email address I login with, the answer is no. I log in using *******@***U.net. I do not have an email address ending outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In re: errors,&nbsp;I have a snapshot of the page where I'm getting the error message on outlook.live. The pic isn't on my desktop (where I am now), but on my notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd greatly appreciate being told what I need to do, where I need to login, so that all devices sync - as they did before early October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Exporting Outlook Emails to .CSV file, when trying import onto a new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tamknudsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exporting Outlook Emails to .CSV file, when trying import onto a new system only one recipent on CC is imported, not all if multiple recipients on CC</h2>
                    <p>Hello 2 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. when exporting Outlook Emails to .CSV file import onto a new PC with Outlook2013, only one recipent on CC is imported, not all the recipients in CC if there are multipe recipients. Can see in the .CSV file that the export was correct and can see all the
 recipients in the raw file. But importing the same .CSV into outlook, only the first recipient is shown in the CC in the imported folder. Why does this happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why are the date and times of the emails not exported into a .csv file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<p>Hi Rafa-M-C,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally understand your feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be noted that Office 365 account (you are using, right?) is not supported to add as another Office 365 account's connected account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I know you want to view the emails sent to the 2 accounts simutaneously (something like that). As a rsult, I suggest you grant the "full access" role of one of the Office 365 account to the other one. For example, if you grant the full access role
 of name@domain.com to info@domain.com. info@domain.com can open name@domain.com mailbox via "open another mailbox". This works for the web mail. If you have the Outlook client, you can even view name@domain.com mailbox with info@domain.com mailbox in the same
 Outlook profile. For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10048/accessing-other-people-s-mailboxes-in-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10048/accessing-other-people-s-mailboxes-in-office-365</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely, this is a workaround. If you still have further concern, I suggest you submit feedback to our related team via&nbsp;<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general</a>.

            I'm sure that I tried this first go around and then had to resort to internet searches for the proper EAS settings for Outlook.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give this one more try but if anyone has the current EAS server settings that work I'd appreciate it.

            This seems to have resolved itself for the most part.&nbsp; Set up the account on blackberry with m.hotmail.com as the server and when the device does its test it changes that to blu-m.hotmail.com.&nbsp; Eventually the entries synch to the Blackberry however it
 is not foolproof and I've found too many instances of items missing that are shown either online at outlook.com or on my desktop (Outlook 2013).

<br />
Thank you for posting back. From what I understand, you have items that are in your Outlook.com account and Outlook client but they&nbsp;don't show up or&nbsp;synch&nbsp;to&nbsp;your Blackberry. If so, then there could be a synchronization probem. I request that you remove then
 re-add your account on your phone to resync it. Use the settings found under <strong>
Apps that support Exchange ActiveSync </strong>section as guide in the article below:<br />

<p>Thanks Robert for the quick response.</p>
<p>1. Do you want to create the filter based on the recipients as you mentioned the To field?</p>
<p>Yes! &nbsp;Actually the lack of recipients. &nbsp;I want to identify emails that have no recipients, nothing in the To: field.</p>
<p>2. If not, can you please tell us the detailed steps of how you want to create the filter?</p>
<p>If recipients = NULL then maximize the SCL of the email.</p>
<p>3. Here is an example from OWA "View Message Details".</p>
<p>Message-ID: &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>

<p>hi gbrehm,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>now i understand you want to filter the emails with no recipient in the to filed.</p>
<p>in office 365, there is no such transport rule or filter like “if recipients = null then maximize the scl of the email.”. thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>after checking the header, i found it has the words “undisclosed recipients” in it. as a workaround, i suggest you create a transport rule based on the message header to filter the emails.</p>
<p>here are the steps:</p>
<p>sign into exchange admin center (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/ecp/</a>) with your office 365 admin account, go to<strong> mail flow – rules</strong> and click + to create a new rule, click
<b>more options</b>. set <b>apply the rule if …--a message header…—includes any of these words
</b>and enter the words “undisclosed recipients”, set <b>modify the message properties…-- set the spam confidence level
</b>to 9. click <b>save</b> at last. a screenshot for your reference:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do have another question to this.&nbsp; While this rule is working great for me it is not for another mailbox that I monitor.&nbsp; Does it have to be configured for use for each mailbox?&nbsp; IT Helpdesk is the other mailbox I monitor.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(44, 52, 68, 1)">We have editable PDF documents stored in our SharePoint documents page. When a user saves that document from that space to their OneDrive space
 the document permissions are stripped away and the PDF is no longer editable/fillable. Very odd, but take my word for it, we've tested it every which way. There seems to be something happening when moving/saving/transferring the document out of the SharePoint
 to another storage spot. If you were to simply email the same file, an editable PDF, the user can save that file to OneDrive and editable PDF permissions remain the same and the document is editable/fillable. We are doing this on our iPads with all the Office
 365 apps, Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, and the proper Adobe program. Again...it works when emailed and saved, but not if simply downloaded from SharePoint.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Syvilay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that you can edit PDF files in site libraries in SharePoint Online. When the users
 download the PDF files from the site libraries and upload them in their OneDrive for Business libraries, they can’t be editable and fillable.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, the PDF files can’t be editable in the site libraries in SharePoint Online and the OneDrive for Business
 library.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So for troubleshooting, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. About that the PDF files are editable and fillable, how do you make them editable? Could you list the steps?
 How do you fill them? Do you add some custom columns on them and then fill them?</span></p>
<p><span>2. List the detailed reproducing steps of the issue you are experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hi LjbCSU,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, my understanding is that you want to change the calendar color of your calendar, if so, you can choose the shared calendar, then go to View&nbsp;tab, click&nbsp;Color to change it
 like following image.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3b740ff-bce0-4076-a5ff-49cb3ea12574?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3b740ff-bce0-4076-a5ff-49cb3ea12574?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Please feel free to correct me and clarify more details if I misunderstand anything, to better understand your situation, it will be better if you can provide a screenshot about how your opened shared
 calendar shows. We will help you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>Sorry - as I came up with the screenshot I realized I described the problem in reverse. The issue being reported by one of our users is that some shared calendars the user see show all hours in grey while others (the desired behavior) show working hours
 in white and non-working hours/weekends in grey. In short, is there any rhyme or reason you can point us to as to why the 2 circled calendars below show all hours in grey?</p>

<p><span>Hi LjbCSU,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am the colleague of Bryan and I am here to follow up on this thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'd like to make a clarification (that is given via my test) that your statement "shared calendar working hours shown in white, while the non-working hours (as well as the weekend) shown in grey" is correct. And, this
 is more likely to be workable for Outlook Web App (OWA). I mean, I checked this in OWA and found that your statement is right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, for your situation, please re-confirm whether the "2 circled shared calendars" original owner are exhibiting the correct color (</span><span>orking hours shown in white, while the
 non-working hours (as well as the weekend) shown in grey) in OWA. The following screenshot is my test shared calendar (working time is from 8:00am to 5:00pm, Monday to Friday).&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cf9b9c4-a4c4-42c6-8ce1-5412b8091f99?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7cf9b9c4-a4c4-42c6-8ce1-5412b8091f99?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the shared calendars' original owner in OWA are exhibiting the correct color, I suggest you contact that user to re-add the shared calendar to see whether it can work as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

                    <p>So far the Win 10 TP runs surprisingly well, all day-to-day apps seems to run, my USB devices (some custom some not) all run. This is within a Virtual machine, but I do not envision anything to run better there than on my (supported) hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that I cannot locate though is the Map network drive. I can right-click the folder when manually browsing the file server and select map drive, but normally there's a menu option that let me manually choose a share (potentially "hidden" like the
 ones with a $ suffix). Is this gone or I'm just not looking in the right place??</p>

            Hi LouiseRMS,<br />
<br />
If you are using Outlook for Windows/Mac desktop client, you can directly drag/drop the email to the desktop to save it to local as a .pst/.eml file.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While if you are using Outlook Web App, there is no direct option to save an email to local in the web-based client. Thanks for your understanding. In this case, you may need to turn to your admin, request to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd298021(EXCHG.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
run an In-Place eDiscovery</a> to find the specific email and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn440164(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
export eDiscovery search results to a PST file</a> to do the trick.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            how can editing annotations be removed from email drafts in Outlook 2007&#63;</h2>
                    I copied and pasted&nbsp;a table&nbsp;in pdf format with hyperlinks into the email I was drafting&nbsp;using MS Outlook 2007.&nbsp;After working on it for about an hour, editing the text in the pasted table, all of a sudden there were Paragraph notations ("P") on each line
 and dots wherever there was a space. Then I saw that these "P" and "dot"&nbsp;annotations were&nbsp;saved into my Outlook so that they now appear on any New email draft. However, these do not appear on the email&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;the recipient as evidenced by a test email sent
 to myself. How can I change the setting so that these notations do not appear on my draft emails?

These are the correct settings for outlook.com POP.&nbsp; Please double check yours<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>If you’d like to manage your Outlook account using an email app, you’ll need to set up your POP3 or SMTP server and port settings
 in your email app. You’ll need the following info:</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POP3 server: pop3.live.com (port 995)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMTP server: smtp.live.com (port 25)<br />
<br />
<br />
<div><em>Choose the Secure Sockets L</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ing).</span><br />
<em>ayer (SSL) option for both POP3 and SMTP connections.</em><br />
<em>Choose the SMTP authentication for SMTP connections.<br />
&nbsp;Choose the outgoing server requires authentication option. (In most email apps, this option isn't checked by default.)</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User name: Enter your full email address.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: Enter your Microsoft account password.<br />
&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><b><u>If you don’t want email messages to be permanently deleted from your inbox after you download them to your mail program,
 select the Leave a copy of messages on the server option.</u></b></em><br />
<br />
<strong>Prevent losing email in Outlook.com when you've set up POP3</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook.com
 has a feature that prevents losing email messages if you accidentally set up POP3 to delete them after reading them on the server. Here’s how it works:</span></em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Outlook.com receives a POP3 instruction to delete email messages after reading from an email app, Outlook.com won't delete the messages. Instead, Outlook.com moves the email messages that were successfully downloaded by the email app
 into a POP folder and out of the inbox. The POP folder is available in the Folders list.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook.com keeps the email messages in the POP folder until you sign in to your Outlook.com account and verify whether Outlook.com should respect or ignore the POP3 delete command.<br />
<b><br />
To verify your POP3 settings:</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the upper-right of the Outlook.com window, click Options, and then click More options.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Managing Your Account, click Pop and deleting downloaded messages, and then select one of the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Don’t let another program delete messages from&nbsp;Outlook.com. (If your other program is set to delete messages from the server, we’ll simply move them to a special POP folder. They won’t be deleted.)<br />
<br />
Do what my other program says—if it says to delete messages, then delete them.</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Save.</div>

    <title>Word 2013 Crashes When Closing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlc45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 Crashes When Closing</h2>
                    <p>I have Word 2013 installed as part of Office 2013 Professional Plus running on Windows 7 Professional 64bit with SP1. The issue&nbsp;described below&nbsp;happens on both the 32 bit&nbsp;and 64 bit versions with the latest updates and Service Packs installed. I spent several
 hours with Microsoft technicians the last two days&nbsp;who ran local and online repairs,&nbsp;and performed&nbsp;a complete manual uninstall/reinstall of the Office 2013 Professional Plus Suite.&nbsp;They also updated my video drivers and disabled various applications and services
 to see if there was any interaction. All to no avail. So here's the process and description of&nbsp;what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start Word and load a document or create a new one.</p>
<p>2) Use one of the apps from the Microsoft Store to define or look up a Word (I've demonstrated this with the&nbsp;Wikipedia, Miriam Webster Dictionary, and the Bing Dictionary apps).</p>
<p>3) Close out the app.</p>
<p>4) Save your document.</p>
<p>5) Close Word...it will crash. It stops responding before it closes and sometimes restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;If you don't close the app in step 3 Word will exit normally.</p>
<p>2) If you do close the app but don't save the document before trying to close Word you will get a dialog asking if you want to save your document or not (this happens even if you have made no changes to the document). Select either choice and Word continues
 to close normally. If you select 'save' it appears the document is truly saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many hours of trouble shooting, the Microsoft technician working with me concluded this behavior is likely a bug of some sort. He said he had not seen anything like it until now. He also offered that if it is&nbsp;it might be addressed in a future update.
 In the meantime has anyone else seen this behavior? I have a work around of sorts but I do worry about loosing a lot of work by accident.</p>

            <p>Rather than usingan app from the MS Store that ties directly into Word, have you tried using a browser/web based site/app to do your dictionary lookups OUTSIDE of Word.&nbsp; It may be a little inconvenient, but faster (and safer) in the long run. At least until
 the problem is fixed.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 taskbar will not retain customized settings. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolebrownstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 taskbar will not retain customized settings.</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed this behavior on several of the Window 10 releases so I do not believe it is particular to just one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just completed performing a cold install from a DVD created from the newly released .iso file.&nbsp; Install went as expected and the software installed without issue.&nbsp; When I began setting up the desktop and taskbar to my liking is when I again encountered
 my problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I normally work with a large number of icons pinned to my taskbar so that I can make use of the single click activation method.&nbsp; To allow me to have all of my icons visible, I normally increase the height of the taskbar to be 2 rows high.&nbsp; I have been doing
 this on all of my previous versions of Windows ( 7, XP, ETC) without difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since beginning working with Windows 10, I have noticed a condition to exist where the taskbar resets to its original single row configuration every time I reboot the machine.&nbsp; This condition also exists whenever I apply updates which required a reboot,
 or when I restart the machine from hibernation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also make use of the auto hide feature associated with the taskbar and it retains its active setting at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something or is this a problem which needs to be resolved and corrected?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Nokia Lumia 735 - pictures disappear from Camera Roll</h2>
                    <p>My most recent pictures are disappearing from the Camera Roll after about a day.&nbsp; I have previously been able to view the pictures and even sent one via WhatsApp.&nbsp; My phone and SD card&nbsp;were quite low on storage but the pictures did initially save and I could
 view them.&nbsp; I have connected my phone and&nbsp;SD card to my PC to check and the pictures are not there.&nbsp; Can anyone advise as to whether the pictures have permanently gone or is there a way of recovering them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

KL100</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Does it happen regardless if you are using the built-in&nbsp;or Lumia Camera app?&nbsp;Are the phone system apps up to date? You can check by going to
<strong>Store</strong>&gt;<strong>...</strong>&gt;<strong>check for updates</strong>. BTW, do you have the latest software version installed on your phone? Go to

If you do not have these alternatives, you have too old PC Suite, update from <a href="http://www.nokia.com/PCsuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hmmm i did that but it still pops up the Nokia File Manager on startup - Where does it create the entry for this and i'll get rid of the offending key manually from whatever file it is in..<br />
<br />
I de-installed and re-installed and that was when this happened. What si the registry key this uses to make it start?<br />

            You have some java stuff that activates on start up and that get's PC Suite confused, because Application Installer reacts to java.
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you use this forum search, you will find answers like:<br />
<br />
I found the problem. The installer has registered itself as the default app for .jar files. I had a java app in my startup, and it was running the app installer instead of launching my app using the Java runtime.<br />
<br />
So, smurph, have you got a java .jar file, or something similar, in your startup? I guess it is not starting any more.<br />
<br />
To fix it, open windows explorer, and go Tools-&gt;folder options...-&gt;File Types, scroll down to JAR. It will show "opens with" as the app installer. Click Change..., and set it to Java 2 Standard Edition binary, or similar.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, take the .jar out of your startup, or start it explicitly with the java executable.

            Great stuff this fixed it.. Surely though Nokia shouldn't set the app up to install itself this way though?

            The default settings in PC Suite are that it invokes itself on start up and it listenes to available connections (Irda, Bluetooth or USB) just in case PC user attaches a phone into his/her PC.<br />
I am sure this is done to ease up the usage of PC Suite for such users who would have difficulties in "setting COM ports", enabling Bluetooth etc.<br />
<br />
For more experienced user it appears as a bit intrusive software, I agree. Put luckily there is the option to stop it now, earlier versions were lacking that option, so it has kind of improved.

                    <p>Before the new VBA IDE was added to Excel for Mac, I had a macro that was working fine.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

<p style="margin-left: 30px">reportwbk.SaveAs invoiceDataDir &amp; "Invoice.xlsx", 52</p>

</p><p>With the new IDE, this was throwing a 424 Err.&nbsp; I adjusted to the more Windows like format as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">reportwbk.SaveCopyAs FileName:=rwbkFileName, FileFormat:=52</p>

</p><p>Now I am getting a 1004 Err</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried multiple adjustments to the SaveAs or SaveCopyAs and cannot get anything to save the file.&nbsp; The original file is a CSV so this is requiring a format conversion to .xlsx.</p>

<h2>            Table of Contents - Words</h2>
                    <p>When I create a word 2007 document from a template that has Heading 1 for an Article and&nbsp;Heading 2 for Sections, the word document looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><span><span>Article I</span></span>&nbsp;

<p>And then when I create a Table of Contents. the words in the table of contents with respect Section 1.1, shows the addtitional words, not just the word Title and the Article Title does not show up&nbsp;&nbsp; And it shows up like this:</p>

            <blockquote>And the TC field shows up as { TC "<b>Section Title</b>" \f C \1 "2"}.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I update the full Table of Contents and it shows up as the following with the page numbers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARTICLE I Article Title</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section Title</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the point is, the words Article I and Article Title, show up perfectly.</p>
<p>But the words of Section 1.1,&nbsp;show the words Section Title, and not the begniing words from the header names Section 1.1.
<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
I was testing a lone heading style and forgot about the regular text after the heading.&nbsp; Yeah, you could copy the whole paragraph as a way to&nbsp; ensure copying the multilevel list number, but then you have to delete all the regular text.&nbsp; So, instead just type
 "Section 1.1" (with the appropriate number) before the section title in your TC code.<br />
<br />
I only use TC codes when I have to and have never tried them with multilevel list numbers.&nbsp; Had I known about the number problem, I'd have suggested my favorite method right off. So here it is for next time.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Type the headings and regular text&nbsp; in seperate paragraphs. Apply the heading style to the first paragraph and your body text style (usually normal) to the second. Make sure that the paragraph space after and the text&nbsp; alignment (left or justified) match in
 the two styles. This avoids funny spacing in the joined paragraphs.&nbsp; Then put the cursor anywhere in the heading paragraph and press Crtl+Alt+Enter &nbsp;to apply&nbsp;the&nbsp;style&nbsp;separator formatting to the paragraph mark (¶) after the heading.&nbsp; The&nbsp; paragraphs will
 appear to be joined but will retain their own formatting, and the TOC will be able to collect the heading.&nbsp; There are no TC fields to input and probably no changes necessary to the TOC field.<br />

                    Windows 10 Pro Insider on the Slow Ring is failing to Activate after a motherboard and CPU upgrade. I am receiving activation error code: 0xC004C003. I originally upgraded to Windows 10 Pro when it launched and have been an Insider ever since. Have tried
 Troubleshooting and selecting the 'changed hardware recently' but when I select the correct device I am trying to activate it says 'Unable to activate Windows' but provides no additional information or error codes.

            New Motherboard means a new activation key. only time a change in MB will get reactivated if you replace with the same version/model of MB.

<p>This is by design and is expected.&nbsp; Windows 10 is activated by the device.&nbsp; If the device is a registered Windows 10 device for the edition of Windows you install then it will activate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product key is only needed to register the device.&nbsp; A product key does not activate it, it just registers it.&nbsp; Since the device registration also requires the unique hardware IDs of the device, changing the mobo changes the IDs and the new IDs must be
 registered.&nbsp; That requires a new Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have replaced the old parts with the manufacturer's recommended replacement parts you can use the Activation Troubleshooter to avoid buying a new license.&nbsp; If you have upgraded the old parts with retail upgrade replacements then you are required to
 purchase the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to Settings/Update and Security/Activation and click the link to Go to Store to purchase a license.&nbsp; Be sure it matches the edition you have installed.</p>

<p>Thank you for the responses. Actually, after a failed first attempt at resolution with MS Support, my second attempt resolved this issue. MS Support reset the W7 Product Key that was originally used to upgrade to 10Pro and I was able to reactivate the new
 motherboard with the same original product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is good again...</p>

<h2>            problems printing landscape size on portrait document</h2>
                    In word 2010, i want to print a 3"H x 7"W card sized document in Portrait. this is to feed a dot matrix printer.
<div>However, when i create a document with this size, Word automatically changes the orientation to Landscape. i don't want this.</div>
<div>If i try to change that setting back to Portrait, it will change the size of the document i'm working on to 7Hx3W.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</div>
<div>thank you!</div>

            <p>FWIW, this does work in Word 2003 but not in Word 2010. It appears to (when you switch back from the Paper tab to the Margins tab, Portrait is still selected), but if you return to the Page Setup dialog, it has switched to Landscape again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may, however, be possible to set this up as a custom label definition in the Label Options dialog. If you start by selecting "Dot matrix" or "Continuous feed printers" for the printer option, then you should be able to set up the desired label size. From
 later posts it appears that you're using continuous fanfold labels, so this is the best approach.</p>
