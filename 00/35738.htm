<p>When did this start? Perhaps with a new monitor?</p>
<p>If yes, your video adapter probably does not support the native resolution of the new monitor. Check the monitor's documentation to determine what its native resolution is.</p>
<p>Then check your video adapter manufacturer's web site to see if there is a newer Windows 7 driver for your adapter that supports the monitor's native resolution. If there is one available, you'll need to download and install it; also check for the proper
 procedure for updating the driver (some require the old one to be uninstalled first, others will simply overwrite the old one).</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: If a new driver is available, be sure to get the correct one for your operating system, i.e., Windows 7 64-bit or Win 7 x86 (32-bit).</p>

<p><strong><em>I have a problem,maybe others have had this happen........Well,I'm playing co-op on hardcore and we play from prologue to chapter 7.We save it after we gain control of of characters on chapter 8.A few hours later we go back to the game,he sends
 me a invite and it says ("failed to connect"),it says I did not complete chapter 7,well I went back and completed it again on single player and went to my progress and unlocks and it still says 0.0% for chapter 7.</em>

<p>Sorry you have to go through that, perhaps you are going to have to go a lot farther into chapter 8 to autosave and hope it saves your progress then. Make sure to save and quit and then when you go back to playing choose "continue from last save."</p>
<p>I experienced an annoying glitch in chapter 14 where if I choose "continue story" it takes me back to chapter 11. &nbsp;Sure hope that gets fixed in an update.</p>
<p>At least the game is plenty fun.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">I also experienced the same problem when I got to chapter 14. It set me back to chapter 11 also on hardcore. It is very frustrating to work so hard to get to that chapter and not be able to return to where you
 left off. When I select my last safe it selects chapter 11 but my current save displays a completion of 67% but starts me back to chapter 11. I have all the pieces collected for "Rosetta" but and now I'm on a side mission but can't continue it. I'm going to
 salvage the game now. I'm not going back to complete all that stuff again.</span></p>

    <title>How to access system image for windows 7 restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blakey43  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to access system image for windows 7 restore</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to restore a PC using a System Image backup that was taken a few years ago, shortly after the PC was bought. The PC doesn't have a DVD burner, so the system image and initial backup were created on a USB disk. They were then taken off the USB
 disk and copied to a network share. It's a Dell Optiplex 980 by the way, with OEM Win7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC doesn't have a Windows installation on it anymore, so just now I've booted from a Windows 7 disk, gone to Repair My Computer, but the PC could't see the image on the network, I got an error 0x800704CF after entering the network location and credentials.
 So I copied the backup files/folders back onto a USB disk. But the PC still can't see the system images, even after restarting and rebooting from the Windows disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to get the PC to see the old system image that I want to restore from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

<p>It turned out that it was simply a network driver problem. Finding and installing the correct network driver allowed me to connect to the network share, find the image and complete the restore.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 How to remove password from Start screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clscribe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 How to remove password from Start screen</h2>
                    <p>After signing in to Microsoft to give feedback I now have to keep signing in with my Microsoft password in order to use my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the name for my Admin account is changed and now shows my entire email account address on the start-up screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading a few post I went to Windows +R, entered -&gt; control userpasswords2 -&gt; OK.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>But notice the box is unchecked, that requires a password for users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do so that only my Name shows as Administrator, and I do not want to have to continually enter a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: This all happened after I was asked to sign in with an Outlook Account, which I initially did not have.
</p>
<p>I can not see myself using outlook but created one as I thought it was part of the feedback process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p><span>Re: <span>&nbsp;</span>“Windows 10 How to remove password from Start screen”</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/windows-10-how-to-remove-password-from-start/b8dee9e9-cac7-4558-a421-2c963c5e115b</span></p>
<p><span>After having posted the above questions I received an email from Microsoft titled:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">“Welcome to Windows&nbsp;10 Getting Started Series,
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Learn about the&nbsp;Get Started app, navigating your device, and&nbsp;support.”</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, I do not want to know anymore about Windows 10.<span>&nbsp; </span>In my estimation, and after reading endless complaints in the feedback page, the product was launched with many flaws in hopes that end users test-drive it—while providing feedback
</p>
<p>that will, no doubt, help Microsoft with a new Windows product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The download may have been free but the time it has taken many end users to fix issues, related to Windows 10, is not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have to ask again the following...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>#1. In Windows 10 “Windows Credentials” is it possible to Edit or Remove the log-in password so that one is not obligated to enter a password every time one opens a computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2. If I revert to Windows 8.1, will the system revert to how it started up before i.e. I did not need to enter a password in order to get onto the start windows screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate a response that is going to work and not further me any more lose of time</p>

Also&nbsp;you probably want to change these :<br />
<br />
In Cortana or the Search box type --&gt;&nbsp; Control Panel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then "Power Options"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start - Settings - System - Power &amp; Sleep - Upper Right "Additional power settings "
<p><br />
"Choose what the power buttons do" OR "Choose what closing the lid does" - Change settings that are currently unavailable - tick Don't require a password.</p>

<br />
Alternative login with a pin :<br />
<br />
If you are using a Microsoft Account&nbsp;then you have to have a password though<br />
you can use a PIN. (Removing the login also dramatically reduces your Microsoft <br />
account security).<br />
<br />
Start - Settings - Accounts - Sign-in options - PIN<br />
<br />
Or you can change your account type :<br />

            <p>This is a reply to all who have attempted to assist me in this matter.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>#1</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not know whether or not I am using a Microsoft Account, all I know is that in signing into Outlook for the first time, ever, I entered my yahoo email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This action caused two things to happen.</span></p>
<p><strong>Issue #1a)</strong> I now have an App that is titled “People” which when I click on it I see ALL of my contacts that are kept on my Windows phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span> I do not like this because I would think that if my laptop is stolen, anyone who gets access to this app will see my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Question#1a</span>: I need to know if deleting this app will solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue #1b)</strong> When I turn on the computer the first screen I see has my Name &amp; complete Yahoo email address.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note</em>: Initial technical support from the company I purchased the computer were able to make it that upon first opening a log-in password was not necessary, however, this has changed and ‘now’ everyone who uses the computer has to enter a password.
 I don't know what they did but it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following do not have “require a password” box clicked</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Panel - Power Options - Require a password on wake-up<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Start button - Settings - Personalization - Lock Screen - Scroll down to Screen Saver Settings</li><li>Start button - Settings - Accounts -Sign-in Options - Require Sign-in</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue #2)</strong> I have searched my computer to find where my yahoo email is stored and have found it AND a listed password code in Control Panel -&gt; Credential Manager -&gt; Windows Credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Question #2</span>: I see an option to Edit or Remove it —but I need to know what is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Summary</strong></span>: Having to log-in with a password makes me feel that Microsoft is controlling how I use the computer “I” purchased, and “I” do not like this.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>As soon as I iron out this issue with the password I intend on turning back the clock, to the former Windows that came installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I will only reconsider Windows 10 upgrade as July 2016 nears closer. </p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be informed the new thread which you created was deleted because the issue was same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you don’t want to enter password every time you start your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you switch the User account from local to Microsoft account when you upgraded to Windows 10?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not edit or remove any options in the Windows Credentials.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to remove the contacts from the people app, you may follow the below link and check.</span></p>

<p><span>(The above link also applies to Windows 10)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be informed that yahoo address can also be associated with Microsoft account, you cannot rollback to Windows 8.1 if it has been more than a
 30days since you upgraded to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also follow the below steps to check if you are using Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>1. In the search option type “Settings” and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Now select Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Your Email and Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the Right side, if you see “manage my Microsoft Account”, then you are using a Microsoft account and you can’t set automatic login.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However if it is a local account, you may please follow the suggestion given by Billion Debbarma and SpiritX MS MVP to setup automatic login.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</span></p>

    <title>Metro apps causes my PC to restart. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean francis nierva ballais  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metro apps causes my PC to restart.</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 RTM into my PC. Everything is great. No BSODs, Halo: Combat Evolved is working seamlessly and other stuff but whenever I click on a Mondern UI app in the Start Screen, it opens up as usual but after a few moments of waiting,
 no text or images that usually appear in a Metro app shows up and the screen turns black. Then, a little later, a cursor appeared and I can move the cursor. But a few moments later, the screen turns black and suddenly I see that my PC just suddenly restarted
 amd rebooted again. So, fellow Windows 8 users or experts or etc., please help me fix the problem. The problem is really annoying and disappointing. Thanks you in advance. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks. :D</p>

            Hi Sean,
<div>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums. If I understand you correctly, Metro App crashes and restarts the computer. I understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help fix your issue and guide you
 in the right direction.</div>
<div>Do you get any error messages?</div>
<div>Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Let's start by running the Modern UI App troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the first method didn't fix the issue set the computer in ‘Clean boot’ state to check software conflicts. Refer the following steps:<br />
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + R’ </strong>key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘<strong>Run’ </strong>windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) Click the ‘<strong>Boot’ </strong>tab and uncheck ‘<strong>Safe Boot’ </strong>
option.<br />
d) On the ‘<strong>General’ </strong>tab, click to select the option ‘<strong>Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘<strong>Services’ </strong>tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’
</strong>check box, and then click ‘<strong>Disable a</strong>ll’.<br />
f) On the ‘<strong>StartUp’ </strong>tab, click ‘<strong>Open Task Manager’</strong>. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
<strong>right click </strong>on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’</strong>.<br />
f) Click ‘<strong>OK’</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services:</strong><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab, and then click to <strong>select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
</strong>c. Click to <strong>select half of the check boxes </strong>in the Service list.<br />
d. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns:</strong><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items:</strong><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns:</strong><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem:</strong><br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
<div><strong>Step 7:</strong><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + R’ </strong>key on the <strong>keyboard</strong>.<br />
b) In the ‘<strong>Run’ </strong>windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’ </strong>and click ‘<strong>Ok’</strong>.<br />
c) On the ‘<strong>General’ tab</strong>, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) Restart the computer and check with the issue, if the issue persists follow the next method.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If the issue persists you may check if you are using any Proxy connection. If yes, try disabling the proxy connection and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Follow the steps to disable proxy:</strong><br />
a. Click the Gearbox at the top right corner in Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.<br />
c. Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.<br />

            Hi S.B.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            <pre>Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space in addition to improving overall system performace. 
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 8/8.1/10 &gt; Windows key + S &gt; type disk cleanup &gt; hit Enter on your keyboard
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from Windows Vista or clean install, Windows 7/8 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 7/8 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 7/8. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<h2>            &#34;Project to a wireless display&#34; option missing on windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've recently bought a samsung 4500 classe Smart TV. I have a Lenovo g500 running windows 8.1, but previously ran windows 8 before an update. I attempted to connect to the TV wireless, and failed. did some research and found that the project to a wireless
 display option was missing with no idea how to solve the problem. most people had a vpn issue which I don't seem to have. So I'm wondering if there is a way to a) make the above option possible? b) a work-around to make it work wireless without that option
 or c) give up trying and stick to a HDMI??</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I tried the intel widi thing. came up with nothing, and neither did the smartview 2.0 both with my laptop and iphone. HELP PLS!!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Black Screen after critical update.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, i'm not utterly sure where to post this, but I'm quite convinced it is caused by some update. After restarting PC i always get the same problem. After Starting Windows animation with the four lights, i get just a black screen, nothing more. It's not
 like the monitor lost the signal or something - it's just a black screen. I can wait hours but it's useless. The only "solution" is to restart the computer the hard way and then boot to safe mode and restore the PC to the last recovery point which always seems
 to appear there. It is labeled as critical update, but strange thing is, that there was no updates available before the crash. When the recovery process is done, it always boots up properly and gives me the message, that recovery was successfuly finished.
 At this point, no updates are availlable as well. From now on it works until I reboot again(shut down, restart...). And the whole process starts from the beginning.</p>
<p>One more thing(maybe not linked at all): Once (just once) i got a message after restart saying my Windows is not genuine(which is - of course - not true). Anyway it didn't restrain me in any way - not even the black desktop or whatever. In comp. properities
 it said that the system was activated, so it didn't really affect anything...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank for any kind of help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows7 Professional 64bit (All important updates included - last one was KB982214)</p>
<p>ASUS Crosshair</p>
<p>Athlon X2 3800+</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>first of all - there are no updates available, so how can I install them manually?</p>
<p>Anyway, I looked at this topic : http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/thread/47401e0a-b256-462e-93c2-e845852b4885</p>
<p>and tried to update my BIOS too. No result though, it's still the same.</p>
<p>Ad Step2. clean boot doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>Step 3. The update which I suspect of being the source of all troubles(and the one I don't see in Windows Update window) is this one:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>_________________</p>
<p>Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.89.207.0)<br />
<br />
Installation date: ‎25.‎8.‎2010 14:06<br />
<br />
Installation status: Successful<br />
<br />
Update type: Important<br />
<br />
Install this update to revise the definition files used to detect spyware and other potentially unwanted software. Once you have installed this item, it cannot be removed.<br />

<p>_________________</p>
<p>However, when i try to search for it, as you advise me in step 3, I get no results...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. This is extremely frustrating. USB mouse doesn't work in safe mod. That itself wasn't as bad, because i was always able to navigate to System restore tool using tab, arrow keys and enter, but now then it came up with some recommended point and tab key
 for some reason skips the option to choose a restore point by myself. So I had to borrow a PS/2 mouse. When I connected it, the system froze completely...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>//edit: Two more things... Even though there's the black screen, the system appears to respond in some way. I have the feeling it lets me sign in my profile, by typing the password and pressing enter. I'm not sure, becuase i don't have sounf drivers installed
 at this point. But judging from the harddrives reaction, it is possible. What I know for sure is that i can shut it down by pressing the power button(I'm not holding it. It takes a while but the computer shuts down properly).Second thing. When I install or
 uninstall some drivers, and click restart now the system boots fine(once), next restart is the same as always...</p>

<p><span>Hi Aros_Prince,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the delayed reply.</span></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any antivirus program installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Since the problem is occurring with
 one of the Windows Defender updates, let`s first check if it shows up in the update history.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help then try performing
 a system file scan (SFC) scan to check for any system file corruptions.</span><span>To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click

<p>Hi, of course it does show in update history, how else would I be able to post the info I did. Anyway what I did was to disable Windows Defender. It really seemed to work because it let me reboot the computer for at least 3 times with no error. Then in started
 again. This is kind of hopeless. I would really like to reinstall the system for good, but that gives me the " A required CD/DVD device driver is missing. If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVDm or USB flash drive, please insert it now. Note. If the windows
 installation media is in the drive, you can safely remove it for this step." error. It is said to be a problem of bad burning but I burned it 3 times, then downloaded the iso again and then burned again. It's always the same. Even when I create a bootable
 flash drive, it says the same - that it needs DVD drivers. Even when I unplug any optical drive - it's still the same.</p>
<p>Anyway I'll try system file scan as you advise me. Thanks.</p>
<p>//edit: this is what i got:</p>
<p><br />
Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.<br />
<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of th<br />
em.<br />

<h2>            Upgrading from Windows Vista to Windows 7 on a 32 Bit operating system</h2>
                    I have tried in so many different ways on how to up grade from Windows Vista to Windows 7 on a 32 Bit operating system&nbsp; with no luck at all, I already know that Windows Vista is not supported any more but wouldn't think that Microsoft would have done more
 to help it seems people who have a 64 bit operating system are having more luck in upgrading/updating but people like myself are stuck with a on going issue with not beenable to move forward and freely with Microsoft like people who have a 64 Bit operating
 system as those people are getting speacial treatment from Microsoft as they are able to upgrade and move freely to the next stage of Windows it's like Microsoft are "playing Favorties" I'm also annoyed<em>

1. Did you make any changes to your computer after which the issue started?<br />
2. Is your security software updated?<br />
3. What is the exact error message you get?<br />

<h2>            USB 3.0 Ports Not working - Unknown Device without anything plugged in. Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have tried all previous 'solutions' to similar issues and nothing has helped. I have ran the hardware troubleshooter, uninstalled and reintalled the usb roots/buses under the device manager, updated my BIOS and updated all driver software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My usb 2.0 port works just fine, and I have tried a HHD, Xbox controller, two different memory sticks and a mouse which all work through this port but not the usb 3.0. The problem started around a month ago, but I had somehow managed to temporarily fix it
 (I no longer remember how). The problem however is now back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have an unknown device registering as being connected to Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 0100 (Microsoft). Power is clearly going to the usb devices, but they are not being recognised at all by my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All intel chipset downloads state that I don't have the required specifications. The hotfix that has been suggested will also not install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo G510, Intel i7, Windows 8.1 fully updated.</p>

            <p>Hello Katherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your valuable response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below methods to see if it helps,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you follow the below steps to check if you are able to see the unknown device in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> is a diagnostic mode of a computer <strong>
Operating System</strong>. An Operating System in safe mode will have reduced functionality, but the task of isolating problems is easier because many non-core components are disabled. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer
 in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> appears in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an existing problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If you don't know the cause of the problem, you can use the process of elimination to help you find the
 problem. Try starting all of the programs you commonly use, including the programs in your Startup folder, one by one to see if a program might be the cause of the problem. Safe mode is intended to fix most, if not all problems within an operating system.
 Follow the below steps to boot the computer to safe mode,<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the ‘<strong>Windows + C</strong>’ key to get the <strong>charms bar</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Settings </strong><span>-&gt;</span> <strong>Change PC settings</strong>
<span>-&gt; <strong>General</strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>Scroll down to <strong>Advanced Startup</strong>, click <strong>Restart Now</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot </strong><span>-&gt;</span> <strong>Advanced Options
</strong><span>-&gt;</span> <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Restart</strong>, select <strong>Safe Mode with Networking
</strong>and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now your computer would restart in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Restart the computer to start in
<strong>Normal Mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>If you are unable to see the unknown device in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>, then proceed with <strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong><span>: To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<strong>Clean Boot</strong>." A clean

                    Hi, I am trying to open an avi. file on windows media player. I've already upgraded to Media Player 11. It still won't open my file. I am wondering if it is a codec issue or a file issue. I am getting an error message saying Win media player cannot support
 the file type or the codec used to compress the file. I need help on this issue and thanks for the support.

<p>I keep my profile on a USB stick to easily play at friend's houses, so the profile isn't actually on my xbox. Either way, the xbox.com site itself still says that I'm a free member. Thanks for the suggestion though!</p>

<p>You'll want to contact phone support if you've waited ~24 hours and you're still not seeing your membership. I do know that there was a service alert up last night that had something to do with this situation you're in but it doesn't look like it fixed for
 you.<br />
<br />

<p>OK so I just got finished chatting with Microsoft support, apparently system maintenance is to blame for this issue. The most the agent could do for me was cancel the subscription and refund my payment, and then I'll have to repurchase gold later. The agent
 said to wait about ~12 hours to make sure the system is up and running again before repurchasing.

<p>As a final followup on this, I didn't have time to call xbox support but it appears that my gold membership was activated as of this morning, so I guess there was some kind of delay in the system.</p>

            If I understand what you're asking about, go to Control Panel, go to the Network and Sharing Center, and click on the link in the left pane to "Change adapter settings."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
That ends up in the same place (Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections) that you get to by clicking the link in the Help file.<br />

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
It's not possible to remove a payment method that's attached to an active Xbox LIVE Gold subscription. If you wish to remove the card on file and not add another payment method, then you would need to
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support directly</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You would lose the remaining Xbox LIVE Gold time you have left on your account if you don't wish to add another payment method to your account. This is the only way that phone support can remove the card on file without you having to
 add another.<br />
<br />
<strong>Translation:<br />
<br />
</strong>Hola,<br />
<br />
No es posible eliminar un método de pago que se une a una suscripción a Xbox LIVE Oro activo. Si desea quitar la tarjeta en el archivo y no añadir otra forma de pago, entonces usted tendría que ponerse en
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacto con la asistencia telefónica directa</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nota:</strong> Se podría perder el resto de Xbox LIVE tiempo de oro le queda en su cuenta si usted no desea agregar otro método de pago en su cuenta. Esta es la única manera de que la ayuda del teléfono se puede quitar la tarjeta en el archivo sin tener
 que añadir otro.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store - Code&#58; 0x80242022 &#40;Reconnect the drive you download to&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've recently been experimenting with some stuff on my PC to see if I could transfer 3D Builder too my laptop as it was having issues downloading it. I found a way to move Microsoft Store apps to a flash drive and it just went down hill from then. I found that
 all the 3D Builder files were locked and that there was nothing I could do about unlocking them and so I couldn't use them on my laptop only my desktop. To make matters worse, I accidentally reformatted the USB with the files on it because of a miss click...
 I've gone back to the Microsoft Store in hopes of reinstalling 3D Builder but I just keep getting error code: 0x80242022 (Reconnect the drive you download to we can’t find it.) I've checked other apps and they download perfectly fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've found this very confusing and I don't know what to do now... I found 3D Builder to be a really simple and easy to use program, something I could use to quickly edit some STLs or OBJs on then when I have time use a "fancier" program.<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help.<br />

<h2>            Skype commands not working</h2>
                    <p>Using Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 I am no longer able to issue Skype chat commans, as listed here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10042/what-cloud-based-chat-commands-and-roles-are-available-in-skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically I would like to assign admin roles with the /setrole command. Skype returns a list of "Available commands" instead, which is very short and limited, and does not include setrole etc. All I get is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Available commands: &nbsp;/add [skypename] &nbsp;/giphy [expression] - sends random GIF for given expression (optional) &nbsp;/alerts off | on [keywords] &nbsp;/alertsoff &nbsp;/alertson [keywords] &nbsp;/help &nbsp;/me [message] - sends special message prepended by your name</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I assign admins in my group chats?&nbsp;</p>

            this is because Skype are retiring stable version 4.3 long long before the replacement skeleton version 5.3 is a viable mainstream application. &nbsp;This is not from lack of feedback from Linux users, just Microsoft failing to listen as they claim they do
 on many threads

<p>Thanks Peter, that's irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, can I still use the old 4.3 version to assign roles? Or Webskype? Any other way?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Irritating is quite a polite description of most Linux users response to this coming weekend I guess? &nbsp;You have maybe 70 or 80 hours more on version 4.3 unless sense dawns at Microsoft... &nbsp;The skeleton version you have tried is just a wrapper for webskype,
 no harm in trying as that requires no installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment it looks here as though Linux users will be having great difficulty using Skype for the foreseeable future. &nbsp;Although Microsoft did produce quite a few versions of their replacement for stable version 4.3 during development, the process does
 not seem 'quick footed'. &nbsp;Perhaps, as suggested by quite a few, Microsoft team here (still stuck in the Ballimer view that Linux is a cancer?) are thinking that if they can make Skype a pain on Linux, then Linux users will go out and buy a new computer with
 a different operating system to get a good Skype experience? &nbsp;With most computers in the shops as Windows... &nbsp;My view is that a used Mac on eBay is far better value than a new Windows computer for most of the computer price range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, at the moment can not see any solution unless any developers have any ideas? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Haha, yes, I understand your frustration! I started grumbling about awful Linux Skype support about a decade ago but have long since given up. Skype has never been and I don't think will ever be a priority for whoever happens to own Skype at the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily it's not really that relevant anymore either. We have over 100 Linux-based desktops at our offices, but we have moved to more useful chat applications over the years like HipChat, Hangouts, Slack etc. and also dedicated conferencing solutions. Some
 of our clients still use Skype though, so we have to continue to use / support it at a basic level. And at this point, that's all it really is; basic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I think they should just build one big web client that works on all platforms (which is a reasonable approach given rich browser support) and stop trying to build native clients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which may be what Microsoft are doing, having seen the crappy pared down video call app Hangouts compared to the rich desktop versions of Skype, Microsoft are deleting the really useful facilities in desktop Skype to compete with a product used by a totally
 different user group. &nbsp;Surely Skype can offer both the crappy pared down basic web app, and the richer and much more useful desktop application without ruining them both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely the rape of the desktop application to compete for a different user group is unwise, sure they both offer video calls, but then a BMW car &amp; a bicycle both offer transport, but a bicycle would ... ... perhaps not be the first choice to get to that
 important business meeting a hundred miles away!</p>

            Hi Philip, 
<br />
<br />I found this on the Turbo Tax website - <a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899922-error-1305-error-reading-from-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1899922-error...</a> 
<br />
<br />Error 1305: Error reading from file (followed by the filename) occurs when updating TurboTax.
<br />
<br />Possible Causes
<br />You're not logged in as an administrator.
<br />
<br />An anti-virus, anti-malware, firewall, desktop search or backup program is interfering with Windows Installer.
<br />
<br />One or more program files have been corrupted or otherwise modified, and the original installation package or media is not readable.
<br />
<br />Solution
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Log in as a computer administrator.
<br />
<br />Exit all running programs, including virus-protection and firewall programs.
<br />Remember to re-enable your security software after you've successfully installed or updated TurboTax.
<br />
<br />
<br />Looks like you're either, not the admin(not likely) or a security application is blocking it. 
<br />
<br />Can you temporarily disable your AV and try again? 
<br />

<p><span>Hey ladshan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SVB game pad doesn’t supply driver for its device. Since it has USB interface, windows default driver should work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, since the gamepad isn’t working, check in another USB port to make sure that the port isn’t faulty and also verify if
 the driver is faulty.</span></p>
