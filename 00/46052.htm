<h2>            Cannot change email due to hotmail blocking the old one</h2>
                    
<p>The email associated with my gamertag was recently blocked by hotmail, I don't mind not having the email, and as you can see I already have another live ID for this account. &nbsp;The problem lies in the fact that I cannot transfer my purchases and calling the
 hotline bounced me back to hotmail support who recommended that I just abandon the email because apparently providing all the info they want doesn't prove that I'm me. &nbsp;I also have to worry about my Games for Windows Live games, I do not know if I'll be able
 to play those if I change gamertag's. &nbsp;I'm up against a wall here, and at this point I'll be more than happy to abandon my old gamer tag as long as everything I bought comes to the new one. &nbsp;Please help me, I can only go back and fourth between sources so
 many times before I'm driven up a wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for you time</p>

            Looks like the hardware may not be compatible with new version of Windows 10.
<br />You can either wait till HP or MS addresses this with a new update so not have it work or you can rollback the update if you require it.
<br />Very sorry, getting a few issues with hardware and application compatibility with Spring update.
<br />
<br />I would recommend either way that you give MS feedback about this issue.

    <title>BSOD after wakeup from sleep with &#34;inernal_power_error&#34; after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmasuch  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD after wakeup from sleep with &#34;inernal_power_error&#34; after update to Win 10 1809</h2>
                    <p>Problem occurs on Dell Precision 7510 Notebook with integrated Intel HD 530 and Nvidia Quadro Mobile M2000M graphics card.
</p>
<p>The bluescreen with "internal_power_error" appears every time you wake up from standby. Only if I deactivate the option "switchable graphics" in Bios and thus only the Nvidia graphic card is active, the error does not occur anymore. Same if I disable the
 Nvidia-Card and only Intel HD 530 is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For both the Intel HD 530 and the Nvidia Quadro I installed the latest drivers from the Windows update, the drivers from Dell and the latest drivers directly from the Intel/Nvidia homepage. Always the same error occurred. Before the update from 1803 to 1809
 there were no problems with the power saving mode or the graphics cards.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Clarification: Only the "Sleep" mode is active. I don't use "Hibernate". I'm having a Samsung NVMe, but using the latest and patch driver version (3.0.0.1802).&nbsp;

<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. To know if a driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

            Hi,
<br />No Nvidia driver was named.
<br />As no drivers were named, 
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.       
        </p>

<p>Thank you Sumit and Vijay Verma for your fast response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I engaged the driver verifier and on the first reboot Windows was stuck in a boot loop. Had to return to the restore point I set before.</p>
<p>I cannot find a dumpfile, will there be any?</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Consider updating the Intel storage driver as BSODs have been reported with certain versions of this driver - the following may be the latest driver available for the chipset:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27442/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-User-Interface-and-Driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27442...</a>
<br />
<br />As a general precaution create a System Restore Point beforehand.
<br />
<br />One of the fixes listed is "System encounters BSOD with Bugcheck error - INTERNAL_POWER_ERROR(0xA0)"       
        </p>

<p>Thanks auggy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the new driver. But systems keeps crashing. Can't tell anymore if it crashes when going in sleep-mode or waking-up.</p>
<p>BSOD does not show up anymore, system just goes direktly into reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the even newer Intel RST diver. Same result.</p>

            Thats odd. Assuming the Intel Rapd technology driver hasn't helped,<br /> <br />To better understand the issue, Please see the article below on how to share System logs.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/12/how-to-share-event-logs-in-case-of.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/12/how-to-...</a><br /><br />Content on the above blog is written by a Microsoft MVP so it is safe.

<h2>            Xbox wont turn on after unplugging power cord while Xbox light was flashing</h2>
                    
<p>So I downloaded the new update for preview members, and have been experiencing slight problems. Today it was freezing up on my little brother and tried to turn it off using his controller, tried turning it off, that didn't work either. So he turned off the
 xbox by pushing the power button and the screen changed so he thought it worked. Apparently it the power light was still flashing grey and white for 5 minutes before he decided to unplug the power cord from the Xbox. Now we can turn it on but the screen says
 no signal as if it can't connect even though my hdmi cable is intact and securely in place. Please Help!</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello, i would just like to inquire something about my windows7 update, it automatically downloaded 18 updates for my pc but once i restarted it and the updates started to configure, the process stops at 61%, right into the start up screen.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Ive tried resetting in the middle of the configuration, of which was obviously a bad move since windows tells me to not turn off the power while configuring, but when i arrived into a point that windows prompted that
 updating has failed and reverting changes, the process stops as well.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>luckily, ive found a way around it and used system restore, my pc seems fine now but i wonder if anyone could give me a reason for this if it does ever happen again.</p>
<p>is there a problem on the updates downloaded or is there something uncompatible with my system with the updates. Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi - another update from me...... despite seeming to hang at 61% updated for quite literally 3 hours the PC did finally reboot itself and restarted successfully. Its never taken this time before, but all except one of the updates do appear to have loaded
 successfully. So perhaps the message is, if it happens to you, be very patient and keep the faith in Windows 7's amazing power of recovery!!

<h2>            Kick People In Party Chat</h2>
                    
<p>I think I speak for 99% of people here, let us kick people out of parties. &nbsp;If someone joins and everyone hates them and/or they are annoying by playing music, screaming, etc., we shouldn't have to all mute them or ALL leave and join make another party.
 &nbsp;Just add a kicking feature for annoying people.</p>

 the 'Join match' function as most of the time, it makes other people join them instead of me/us. And we can't kick out that one person who isn't in our match, messing up other people from joining so we have to create a new Party.</p>

<p>I have to say . It is really important that you can remove from a party people again . especially if several players are in a party and you are in a game looks the one inviting you someone. One knows that person is not , but what do you do if that person
 is more than uncomfortable? Do you really want 5 or more for a party leave just because of a single ?</p>
<p>We really do not trust new people to invite . because we always meet people on could prevent ( music, etc.) or are insulting and condescending. Unfortunately, you can no longer see the region from which they originate. So it happens that you just inviting
 you someone you can not communicate because he does not speak the same language . Unfortunately, the person makes of it a fun and stays because he knows no one can do anything .</p>
<p>We, my friends and me. are certainly not willing to take the risk to constantly open a new party , so you can meet new people, not really . This really needs to be created remedy .</p>
<p>and the statement that I read here . the host of this function exploits , well that comes but still very much rarer than people who come to the lobby and be insulting there. why they like even always do !</p>
<p>I for my part need the certainty that people who do not know how to behave can be removed from the party again. In addition, a calendar identifier is really desirable in order to escape the fear for a language barrier</p>

<p>Make it invite only.</p>
<p>If all else fails, you can MAKE them leave. If someone, who isn't supposed to be in my party, were to somehow make their way into my party, I make the party very unpleasant for them. I've never had anyone stay longer than 5 minutes.</p>

There's no way to know, for sure, until someone makes the purchase <br />
and tries to activate it. Based on the absurdly low prices, however, <br />
I'd be very, very surprised if those were legitimate licenses.<br />
<br />
One should be very careful buying any software on eBay, as eBay makes <br />
no prior effort to ensure that such sales are legitimate. The problems <br />
stem from two different sources, but have the same results: the buyer <br />
gets ripped off. A great many people don't fully understand the terms <br />
of the license they own, and don't understand that they cannot <br />
legitimately resell it, and - worse still - there are a great many <br />
sellers who do know that they're selling bogus licenses. eBay reacts <br />
only when someone files a complaint, and then all that really happens, <br />
especially in the case of the many deliberate fraudsters, is the seller <br />
of the pirated software returns using a different alias, to continue <br />
selling illegitimate licenses.<br />

<p>Linney, A million thanks again for trying to help. &nbsp;Before my posted question, I had tried all recovery points that were available to me. &nbsp;Each couldn't restore nor repair whatever the problem(s) turned into, so no changes were made. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Aggravating me was that no other software or hardware installation caused me problems (had this pc ? nearly 2 yrs) since I bought it with Window 7 Home Premium preinstalled on it. &nbsp;Only Adobe Acrobat X caused this error, wasted time, still no resolution.
 &nbsp;I tried for the heck of it, to download Acrobat X Pro 30 day trial from Adobe site (instead of cd) and resulted same error code &amp; rollback. Adobe's own troubleshooting notes this 1935 error occurred with X and prior versions. A fix solution isn't noted but
 their site states that Windows installer is problem among other possible "fatal" issues that would cause their Acrobat to not complete install and rollback. &nbsp;Back to Adobe for refund.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Carole</p>

    <title>How to create a partition to install windows 8.1 on a harddrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to create a partition to install windows 8.1 on a harddrive without overwriting the data already on said drive when the drive is in a computer with no OS</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To explain the situation I'll need to give some background: my family was running a computer using windows 7 with two hard-drives: a 500GB drive (the C:\Drive)&nbsp;containing the OS and all of the program files and user documents, and then an additional 3TB
 drive which we bought because the original drive was beginning to get full; and is largely empty and contains only steam, all of my younger brothers steam games, and a few other documents. (the S:\Drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, the computer began to fail: it would often fail to start, apps wouldn't launch, everything was incredibly slow, many times the error message: 0xc0000185 would appear, for a whole variety of different programs (including Adobe ARM, Avast, Wacom
 Tablet exe, Spotify, Windows Explorer - many many times, ITunes, etc.). I took a look at it, and did some research, and I believe the cause is the Cdrive is failing. My dad also took it to our local computer technician who also had that opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is despite my frequent reminders, my parents have not kept up with backing their data up, and as such have no other copy of the photos and documents they had stored on the computer.&nbsp; They have already decided to get a data recovery company to
 attempt to recover as much data as possible from the drive, and the C drive has already been removed from the computer, parcelled up, and dispatched; in the mean time, I would like to install windows 8.1&nbsp;onto the S drive, as the rest of the computer is still
 fully functional. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is two-fold: How can I create a partition on the S drive so as not to overwrite the data on it already when I install the OS? Can I use a crossover cable to connect this laptop to the computer and create a partition from here? Because obviously
 currently there is not OS on the computer, so I cannot boot the computer to partition the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, will steam and the games already installed on the S drive still work without being re-installed? Obviously the computer OS will change from Win7 to Win8.1, I don't know if this will have an impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, according to my little brother (I was away at the time) the problems started after he downloaded and ran the Prepare for Windows 10 utility thing. I don't know if this could somehow be causing the issues - the symptoms are certainly of a failing
 hard drive, not of a software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be very welcome :)</p>

            Hi Rosalia, the safest and quickest thing to do when passing a Windows 10 PC on is to Reset Windows, that will remove all traces of your account and data . . .
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            Hi Rosalia.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you don't want to reset the PC then you can create a new Admin Local (not Microsoft) account named "Owner" to sign into and delete your old Account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/delete-user-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onmsft.com/news/delete-user-accounts</a>
<br />
<br />Then check through C drive to make sure none of your file remain that are outside of the User folder which you've deleted.  Also any programs that you own and want to keep should be uninstalled in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Did you add another Admin account, since there must be at least one?
<br />
<br />If so then sign into the new acount, go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People, find and highlight the old account to delete it as shown here:  <a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/delete-user-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onmsft.com/news/delete-user-accounts</a>

<h2>            HP Deskjet 3050A will not print after Windows Update</h2>
                    I have successfully used HP Deskjet 3050A for approx. 2 years&nbsp; on my Toshiba Satellite Lap top. Suddenly I&nbsp; got dialogue "Printer Unavailable". I can only guess this happened following a Windows 10 Update. Printer works fine on my daughters Windows 7 machine
 and it still prints from my Windows 10 Desktop computer. Of course I have downloaded and tried to install all the latest software from the HP site. When I try to install the new software I get a message asking for: The File Sercscan.sys which is located in
 C:\Windows\INF.&nbsp; of course this file cannot be located so the software&nbsp; installatrion completes but the printer wont print. In task manager it says there is no driver for the printer and offers to search for one&nbsp; but of course it cant find one even though
 I have excellent internet access. So the printer seems doomed not to print from the laptop.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how I can get&nbsp; "Sercscan.sys" ?&nbsp; it must be hidden in Windows 10 somewhere. I

            Thanks for trying to help but your solution did not work. In the end I searched for the missing driver (which was a hidden file in Windows) when located I copied it to an easily accessible location then reinstalled the HP software. When the installer requested
 the missing file I directed it to where I had it saved. After that everything installed ok and now the printer works.

<h2>            How do I remove remnants of programs whose functionality is lost to &#34;Restore&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    How do I remove remnants of programs whose functionality is lost to "Restore"? In the most recent occurrence, the uninstall function hangs? Is there a behind the scenes issue in the registry that can be cured w/o buying a Registry Repair program ?&nbsp; Past
 experience w/ registry repair programs hasn't been good. I've had to restore Win 8 twice in the 2 months I've been running it. I do know that I have to create a restore point each time I install a new program. Just forgot this time.&nbsp; The reasons for restores
 are mysterious loss of functionality ie. Ethernet connection to shared computers; WiFi connection to HP printer and connection to the internet. Please help me with the lead issue (Uninstalling crippled program).&nbsp; Thanks Phil

<h2>            Windows 10 cannot boot - can&#39;t reset, can&#39;t boot in safe mode either</h2>
                    <p>Hi I tried moving my computer into a different case and ran into an issue. After I put it together inside the new case, it no longer boots. I found a log file that says the root cause is that a Boot critical file is corrupt - bugcheck c000021a. It also says
 the following:<br />
<br />
Repair action: File repair</p>
<p>Result: Failed. Error code = 0x2 Repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action: System files integrity check and repair</p>
<p>Result: Failed. Error code = 0x570</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not restore Windows 10, because there is not enough space on the drive. I also do not have any backup images. I could not boot in safe mode so I only have access to a command line. Are there any steps I can take to resolve this?</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The common cause of this error is due to a hard drive failure. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. In the
<strong>Windows Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. If the step provided didn't resolve the error, check the hardware component or the hard drive of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this turns out for you.</p>

            F8 is to disable the Malware startup check correct? I tried and it still would not boot up. I then tried to restore to a previous version of Windows but it said no previous version could be found, try resetting the PC. When I try to reset, it says I don't
 have enough space. The hard drive is very full so maybe that's why it can't do it. It seems unlikely the hard drive is bad since I can browse to it in the command line and it was working fine before moving cases. Also, it's an SSD so it's unlikely that moving
 it broke anything. I'm pretty sure some file just got corrupted and it can't fix itself for some reason. What are my other options?

<p>With that being said, it's most likely that the SSD is the reason why your computer doesn't boot up. In the case, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer of the Solid Stated Drive and have it checked.

            If I need to get a new hard drive, how can I install Windows 10? Would I need to buy it again? I just purchased a new copy for my new computer. Can I use it in my old computer as well?
