<h2>            Booting and repair issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to boot to my Windows 10 desktop since yesterday. I outline when/how it happened as well most of the things I've tried below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put my computer to sleep, all was normal, and when I tried to wake it up the system got stuck on startup at the Windows logo, with the spinning circle of dots. This has happened before, but is usually fixed by unplugging my USB devices, no such luck this
 time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are supposed to be able to boot to "Advanced boot options" by I performing several hard resets, but this has not worked for me at all. Instead it sometimes boots to "Preparing Automatic Repair." It stays at that screen (with the logo,
 the spinning circle of dots, and the "Preparing Automatic Repair) for some number of seconds before flashing a black screen with a large white rectangular frame, and then going black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used my laptop and the MediaCreationTool to create installation media on a flash drive&nbsp; (the flash drive was slightly below the requested 8 GB, at about 7.5 GB, though the creation tool stated it was successful). I have successfully used this drive to
 access the advanced boot options on the desktop but seemingly none of them work. I've outline what happens when I attempted each, below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>------ Startup Repair -------</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC</p>
<p>Press "Advanced options" to try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC.</p>
<p>Log file:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>------ Go back to previous version ------</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous version of Windows. Try resetting your PC instead (Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth noting that "Reset this PC" is not actually listed as one of my options in "Troubleshoot"</p>
<p>
</p><p>------System Restore ------</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To use System Restore, you must specify which windows installation to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart this computer, select and operating system, and then select System Restore."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not really sure what to make of this, I only have one version of Windows installed on this computer and the only thing I've been able to boot to are the BIOS and the Advanced boot options using the installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>------ Command prompt -------</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first text that appears on the command prompt is</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.112]</p>
<p>Not enough memory resources are available to process this command</p>
<p>
</p><p>X:\Source&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then using the command</p>
<p>
</p><p>"sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=c:\windows"</p>
<p>
</p><p>yields</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service"</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, "System Image Recovery" and "UEFI Firmware Settings" are the only other two other options available to me in "Troubleshoot" but I don't have a System Image and I don't know what Firmware settings to change that might fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, my most important files are backed up, so I would be OK to do a full reinstall, but I'd really rather save myself the headache of reinstalling all my drivers and programs, so if anyone has any advice on how I might proceed I would really appreciated
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi GE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for your reply. As I stated in my initial post, I already attempted several of these methods and the results were unsuccessful. However, some of these I have no tried, which I'll do now and let you know how it goes.</p>

            I'm having this exact same problem trying to fix my dad's PC after a windows update broke it in May of this year. Please let me know if any of those solutions worked! I also tried booting from a flash drive that I put the Windows 10 Media creation tool
 onto, and I'm getting the same responses. If I try to refresh/restart it says it ran into an error and can't do it. If I try to troubleshoot it says it can't repair my computer, won't let me go back to previous build etc. The same problems you described above
 right down to the not being able to open command prompt because lack of memory. I'm going to keep sleuthing I guess.. Unfortunately his files are not backed up so I don't want to hard reset because all of his social media passwords and everything are on there
 and he doesn't know how to recover them without being able to use his PC which had a password manager on it. I'm so annoyed with Microsoft Update right now. I need a way to fix this bloody thing.

            None of those solutions worked, unfortunately. My computer *is* back up and running like normal, though I couldn't properly tell you why. What I can tell you is that, when I performed the reset that actually got it to boot to the desktop, I went and took
 out and RAM sticks as well as my video card (as it has had display issues in the past, seemingly from not making proper contact). Once they were seated back in, my machine booted just fine, though again, I have no idea if that is what worked (as I was just
 trying random things at that point) or if magically that was the reboot that it needed. Good luck!

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Hi Guys,&nbsp; Please here me out, spent a few days on this one.&nbsp; X techie from years back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had this issue,&nbsp; and the system went down&nbsp; within an hour of doing</p>
<p>a couple of</p>
<p>sfc /scannow commands,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it made the system worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not recover from a restore ISO Image either, following the same commands as you did, and download the ISO Image, kept blue screening with in 10 to 15 minutes, a couple of different messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system has been up for over three years prior to this, with no issues. but couldnt save it.&nbsp; Data on other drive wasnt to worried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont want to recreate the wheel, of commands that you have so professionally put together, which I was just in the process of doing myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you might want to add a hasher step to your system commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the same procedures as your steps, over the last week that you have presented and links, but I still didnt get through the full install of software, and if I did it would crash again after fresh install with blue screen errors. with only Win 10 Pro
 64 bit on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you might want to add into your steps is I had to wipe my hard drive clean with diskpart and clean all.&nbsp; As well as taken all unnecessary hardware</p>
<p>out of my system, noted someone suggest minimum memory but didnt get</p>
<p>to that one.&nbsp; I did all bios hardware intensive test as well, to make sure, due</p>
<p>to blue screen memory error and stack overflow errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was the following brief instructions I had to do to make my system reliable again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following was done prior to install.</p>
<p>Took all the irelevant HW out including battery.</p>
<p>Held down power button to drain system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot of ISO image</p>
<p>diskpart</p>
<p>list disks</p>
<p>select disk 0</p>
<p>list volumes</p>
<p>select volume 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- obviously depending</p>
<p>clean all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp; wiped the partitions totally clean, didnt work otherwise</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>rebooted of ISO Image</p>
<p>Stepped through the fresh install creating new partitions through install process, not necessary could of done using diskpart but didnt.</p>
<p>Depending on installation successful.&nbsp; Most times not. I had to do the following, but make sure system shutdown at all times by itself</p>
<p>
</p><p>reboot of iso Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>fsck /R d:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; windows partition</p>
<p>d:</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>rebooted of Iso image</p>
<p>ran through fresh Install again, and normally would work this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once up and running of hard drive ran again at administration prompt</p>
<p>or advanced option command prompt</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave in test environment for a few hours due to it previously crashing after</p>
<p>a few hours back in the same state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Forgot to turn of updates and made be ctfmon had a little to do with it, but notice when the "HI: screen came up"" it would crash the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From then on I set up a local user only</p>
<p>from a fresh install so it gave me enough time so I could turn some </p>
<p>more options of the system so I could control the environment&nbsp;</p>
<p>and load drivers and updates that I needed as well as eventually applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wished it was as easy as your technical information, but I am no technical note writer, but in the last week, I have had to install the system many times.</p>
<p>and just about to put my pen to paper for myself until I saw your posts an hour ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My original notes are nowhere as good as yours, but maybe you can update</p>
<p>your notes with the commands I had to use to get my system going in a stable environment with a bigger hammer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish&nbsp; I had both of your notes together over a week ago.&nbsp; so it didnt have to do as much research as I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure people will thank you for it and with these extra bit of steps. I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Never have contribute prior to this reply, hopefully you will understand my</p>
<p>instructions, Im sure you will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hey there Quinn3, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not look like there is any other version available other than "<a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/overwatch#purchaseoptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overwatch: Legendary Edition</a>" through the Microsoft Store online. This is the only
 edition of the game that you will be able to gift through the Microsoft store. If you would like to gift a different edition to&nbsp;a friend then I would advise that you purchased a prepaid code through one of our

    <title>Devcon not able to enable&#47;disable devices in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamzl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Devcon not able to enable&#47;disable devices in windows 7</h2>
                    My original problem is that on boot, the my device is enabled by non-functional. If I disable then enable it in device manager, it works again. My device is USB RF remote (Firefly remote). I'm running Windows 7 (x64) Home Premium on an i5 processor.<br />
<br />
To work around the original problem, I want to run a script using devcon. After getting the correct version of devcon.exe from the latest Windows DDK, I can query the device, but I can't enable/disable it. I've tried a bunch of things, but I must be missing
 something with how to use devcon. Here is the output from devcon...<br />
<br />
E:\dev\WinDDK\Tools\devcon\amd64&gt;devcon status "*VID_0BC7*"<br />
USB\VID_0BC7&amp;PID_0008\6&amp;688A3B8&amp;0&amp;6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name: X10 USB Wireless Transceiver (ACPI-compliant)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driver is running.<br />
1 matching device(s) found.<br />
<br />
E:\dev\WinDDK\Tools\devcon\amd64&gt;devcon disable "*VID_0BC7*"<br />
USB\VID_0BC7&amp;PID_0008\6&amp;688A3B8&amp;0&amp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Disable failed<br />
No matching devices found.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why devcon isn't working? Or do you know another way to disable/enable devices without device manager?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

</p><p>Right click the Start button and select Control Panel , Language. You should find English (United Kingdom) as the only option. While you are there check the other settings from that screen are correct.</p>

If you are experiencing problems with the <strong>WMI</strong> service you might need to<br />
manually stop and restart the service. Before doing so you should enable<br />
<strong>WMI’s</strong> verbose logging option. This provides additional information in the WMI<br />
error logs that might be useful in diagnosing the problem. To enable verbose<br />
logging using the WMI control, do the following:<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Open the Computer Management <strong>MMC</strong> snap-in and expand Services and<br />
Applications.<br />
<strong>2</strong> .Right-click<strong> WMI</strong> Control and click Properties.<br />
<strong>3</strong> .In the WMI Control Properties dialogue box, on the Logging tab, select<br />
Verbose (includes extra information for Microsoft troubleshooting) and then<br />
click OK.<br />
Alternatively, you can modify the following registry values:<br />
<strong>•Set HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\Logging to 2.<br />
•Set HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\Logging File Max Size<br />
to 4000000.</strong> <br />
After enabling verbose logging try stopping the <strong>WMI service</strong> by typing the<br />
following<br />
Open a run command prompt:<br />
<strong>net stop winmgmt</strong> <br />
<br />
If the net stop command fails you can force the service to stop by typing<br />
this:<br />
<strong>winmgmt /kill</strong> <br />
<br />
Important. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 the WMI<br />
service runs inside a process named Svchost; this process contains other<br />
services as well as WMI. Because of that, you should not try to stop<br />
Svchost;<br />
if you succeed, you’ll stop all the other services running in that process<br />
as<br />
well. Instead, use net stop winmgmt or winmgmt /kill in order to stop just<br />
the WMI service.<br />
<br />
You can then restart the service by typing the following command:<br />
net start winmgmt<br />
<br />
If the service does not restart try rebooting the computer to see if that<br />
corrects the problem.<br />
If it does not, then continue reading. <br />

</blockquote>
<p>Hi Bob</p>
<p>The file system in Windows 7 is much more complex than previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p>There are many files/folders that if they are removed could render the system inoperable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be completely irresponsible to automatically assume that any user is an advanced expert and understands the&nbsp;consequences of removing a critical file or folder. This is why we need to know the name and location of the files/folders that are involved
 before posting&nbsp;any information about removing them.<br />
</p>
<blockquote>With W7, I can't install IE9 on a friend's laptop because there are IE8 files in the system that I can't "Uninstall" for some reason; it doesn't show up on the Control Panel list of Programs and Features to uninstall.&nbsp;
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your problem with IE8, please post your question in the following forum.</p>

    <title>Is there a ms-settings&#58;network-wifi call that will open the View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vaughn sayre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a ms-settings&#58;network-wifi call that will open the View Available Networks screen</h2>
                    <p>Three questions:</p>
<p>?-1 Is there a ms-settings:network-wifi call that will open the View Available Networks screen that is launched in the lower right corner of the Windows 10 screen?
</p>
<p>?-2 If not, is there any other call-start-RUN-etc method that will call the same screen or some previous Windows version to a screen still supported in Win10?</p>
<p>I'm trying to create a shortcut that will give access to the Available Networks screen so a user can select the network he/she need to do their job without going through any Settings screens which could open up a really enormous ball of satanic worms if
 these users could muddle around and change settings available from the present calls such as ms-settings:network-wifi.
</p>
<p>?-3 If there is no sub call of ms-settings:network-wifi,&nbsp; or any other call-start-RUN-etc, method to launch the Access Networks "dialog ?box?" could Microsoft create new a call such as ms-settings:network-wifi-VAN? I know such a call would be easy to implement
 since the Access Networks screen can be accessed from so many varieties of system settings screens. To recode the call anew for each use would violate even the original C++ Object Oriented language as well as ADA and other languages concepts, so I suspect
 the internal code of those system settings screens could be used easily to make my desired ms-settings:network-wifi-VAN call.</p>

            Did you read the word "call" in the first question, or the "call-start-run-etc" in the second question, or the request to program such a "call" in the third question? Each and every of those above phrases clearly indicate a desire to programmably launch
 that graphical interface without mouse-wand-touch access by a user "clicking-tapping-feeling" that quarter circles icon or any other route from via settings&nbsp;&nbsp;"clicking-tapping-feeling" paths. The idea is that a batch file or any other system coded operation-program-app
 to 1. Prompt the user via some dialog screen to select the appropriate wifi connection needed and then to have the "Available Network Connections" "dialog" pop up automatically for the user selection and then, when that is competed, to continue programmically
 to accomplish the operation that required the correct WiFi connection. As the right connection can vary between users the user must select his or her connection for the program-app to work. Work, NOT touchy-feely Ap

            <p>What do you mean "call"</p>
<p>I touch the Wi-Fi icon on the taskbar and it shows available networks and connects as I have it set to autoconnect.</p>

            <p>The best way to explain what I mean by "call" is for you to experience it.<br />
So do the following:<br />
1. Over your desktop Right Click your mouse and select NEW-Shortcut. OR the Window Ke<br />
2. In the location box enter the call: ms-settings:network-wifisettings<br />
4: Click NEXT<br />
5. In the name box enter: MKN<br />
6. Click Finish<br />
A new shortcut will appear on your desktop. Doubleclick it.<br />
OR <br />
1. Press the Window Key + R to bring up the "Run" "dialog box". <br />
2. Put "ms-settings:network-wifisettings" (no quotes) in the Open: box.<br />
3. Click OK<br />
In both cases of these instructions Windows 10's Manage Known Networks "dialog box" will popup.
<br />
It has the same type of&nbsp;view but not the same form or function as the Available Known Networks "dialog box" clicking the three arcs icon you refer to brings up.<br />
What I want is a command like "ms-settings:network-wifisettings" that will bring up ONLY the three arcs icon's "dialog box" with a call such as you've used above such as "ms-settings:network-AvailableKnownNetworks" for an example.</p>

            Since your reply was to go to the Microsoft TechNet Forum, which I immediately did but haven't recieved any responst, and since no reply from this Forum has solved my question, and this was and is my first use of this Forum and since I've now recieved
 an email from this Forum asking me to reply "solved" or "no so add more" and that there was no listed means to contact this Forum's administration and finally since you are listed as "Microsoft Sysyrm Moderator" can you turn off the email nags and close this

            <p>When I entered your "ms-settings:network-wifisettings" in Run it brought up Manage known networks.</p>
<p>This screen can be arrived at through Settings, Network &amp; Internet, WiFi, Manage known networks.</p>
<p>To me this is straight forward and does not cause me any problems.</p>
<p>I also found that if you right click the start windows on the taskbar there is Network connections in the menu list.</p>
<p>In the Insider preview build 15058 this now takes you to Network Status.&nbsp; There you can pick Wi-Fi and Manage known networks.&nbsp; This is a change that will be released to the public in the next major update.</p>

<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4e2abe8-4861-45f0-89bb-0ad2d5b1360d" /></a>which is a different screen than this screen:

<p>which is the screen I want to launch with a call like the other screen has. As of now I haven't found or have been told of a Run command to launch this second screen. I do not want a solution to launching the second screen that requires a user to navigate&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mouse
 Click or touch or scream some curse or whatever to get the second screen. What I want is&nbsp;a call that will launch the second screen so the user only has to look at it and select (with a mouse click or a touch) the desired network. I've searched a lot of web
 sites that provide a bunch of similar commands, but none I've accessed have the call I'm looking for, so that's why I came here and asked. PLEASE don't confuse a navigate and click/touch action by the user with an app-Program-Run command that launches the
 screen with no User action required. When the User navigates to and activates the icon that launches the second screen the icon uses some code command to launch the screen. The code inside the icon does the launching and I'm trying to find that Program Call
 to launch the second screen from within an app-Program I'm writing to do all the navigating for&nbsp;a computer-illiterate&nbsp;user's use and thus avoid such a user mucking up any other settings. How can I be clearer: 1. No user navigation to launch the second screen.
 2&nbsp;Only user response making a selection within the second screen. Period.</p>

            <p>The easiest way to get the second screen is to click on the network icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p>There are two different icons. one is the Wi-Fi icon of quarter circles. The other is a monitor with a cable down the left side.&nbsp; This is the Ethernet icon.&nbsp; Using this you are not mucking around with Settings.</p>
<p>If the user is going to have to navigate to the proper network on the screen why can not they click on an icon on the taskbar.&nbsp; If you are trying to write an app-program will they not have to navigate to it and muck around.&nbsp;

            <p>1. The goal is for the user to select between WiFi networks. A WiFi network is a Radio Frequency connection that has no wire-cable, period. So the monitor with a cable icon cannot apply.</p>
<p>2. The whole point is to not click on the three quarter circles at all! NO CLICKING! Only click-touch when selecting the desired WiFi connection to switch between independent WiFi networks where one or more have no link to the World Wide Web and the "user"
 refuses to do any "mucking around with all that computer &amp;$^$@$&amp;*. Of course that doesn't prevent the need to do the WiFi net changes or some "mucking around" that could mess up other settings in the computer which would be adverse to the working system.</p>
<p>So, please, no more "easiest by clicking on the taskbar icon" solutions.</p>

            It sort of depends.&nbsp; See "the temp folder" may refer to many different places.&nbsp; Lots of different programs use different places for temporary file storage needs.&nbsp; Do you know which temp folder it is referring to, or which program is throwing up this message?

<h2>            Hibernation too soon after sleep</h2>
                    <p>I've recently encountered this strange problem for which I found no solution over the internet. My Laptop ( Windows 10 Pro Ver: 1607 Build : 14393.0 )<strong> hibernates within 5-10 minutes after going to sleep mode</strong> ,
<strong>although I've set it to hibernate after 180 minutes on battery and 300 minutes when plugged in</strong>. I've changed the settings and tried, but still no change. The only way to stop it has been disabling hibernate in Windows 10.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, when I'm sure that I won't be around for even half an hour, I usually shut it down. The problem is that the system hibernates within 5 minutes after going to sleep. When I know that I would be back within 10-15 minutes , I usually put the system to
 sleep and leave, so that I can resume my work when I come back. I've already found a temporary solution to this problem ( I've disabled hibernate ).This works for me pretty well, but I'd like to find it's cause and a permanent solution.</p>

                    I have read the one answer to the question of XP games in Windows 7,&nbsp;answered by Mike-Microsoft Answers Support Engineer.&nbsp; However, I have already upgraded (possibly an upgrade) to Windows 7 and now I do not have a seperate computer that is running the
 XP software in order to extract the games from using a USB stick or CD.&nbsp; So, my question is this.&nbsp; How do I get these games on my computer.&nbsp; I sure do miss them.&nbsp; I do have my original XP upgrade disk (upgraded from Windows 98 to XP).&nbsp; What is the solution?&nbsp;
 And, why aren't these or any other games on Windows7 Professional?

<h2>            Windows NETGEAR WNDA4100 Driver issues. &#34;The system cannot find the file specified&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to upgrade the driver on my wnda4100, I go to Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Let me pick from a list of devices drivers on my computer, and then gives me 2 options. The Microsoft driver and the netgear driver. Whenever I try to click
 either, it tells me the driver update has failed due to "The system cannot find the file specified". This happens for both. Any ideas?</p>

    <title>BSOD on recent Win XP update. Stop&#58; C0000221 &#40;bad image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xh10010  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD on recent Win XP update. Stop&#58; C0000221 &#40;bad image checksum&#41;.  The image rpcrt4.dll is possibly corrupt.  The header checksum does not match the computed checksum.</h2>
                    Recently received automatic updates for the Win XP. This caused a crash on reboot after the updates were installed and completed. The message is "Stop: C0000221 (bad image checksum).&nbsp; The image rpcrt4.dll is possibly corrupt.&nbsp; The header checksum does
 not match the computed checksum."<br />
<br />
I was able to run a repair for the OS (Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004) and was able to use my computer. I tried to identify the most likely update(s) that caused the error, but no luck so far. I was able to update some files and I lost internet connectivity
 and some other issues. However, a system restore fixed that issue.<br />
<br />
I tried to use puppy linux to "fix/repair" the rpcrt4.dll but again failure occurred. Any assistance would be great.

            What is so funny about that first link is the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" replies that have been marked as the "Answer" are impossible to work.<br />
<br />
Then even funnier is that the impossible to work reply was marked as the "Answer" by another Microsoft engaged "expert".<br />
<br />
Obviously, neither "expert" has seen the problem before, never fixed it, made any effort to reproduce it so they could actually see it and then seen if any of their things to "try" work or not.<br />
<br />
What kind of expertise is that?&nbsp; It is sad expertise.<br />
<br />
Let me assure you with 100% certainty that if the rpcrt4.dll file is missing or corrupt, you will not be booting in any mode.<br />
<br />
Let ms assure you with 100% certainty that Last Known Good Configuration will not replace missing or corrupt files.&nbsp; That is not what LKGC does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for.<br />
<br />
Let me assure you with 100% certainty that you will not be running sfc /scannow in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Yet somehow, the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" and another MS "expert" think that is the correct solutions.<br />
<br />
The solution is to replace the suspicious file with a known good file and if the system then boots, work on figuring out how the file got corrupted in the first place.<br />
<br />
However after receiving 129 MS updates, I am not totally surprised the system will not boot, but replacing a suspicious rpcrt4.dll (or any suspicious file) even on a machine that will not boot is not that difficult...&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can boot on a CD or flash drive and simply replace the file with a known good file and see how that works out.<br />

</p>
<p>Please be aware that each time you make a post the OP and anyone that has registered to the thread will receive email notification about activity on the thread. Making a thread your own chat room would therefore be very un-polite and would waste peoples'
 time as they check back. Also, please do not bring back old threads that have not been active for a long time unless you have something useful to add.</p>

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined to the Microsoft Office CD?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><u><span>Issue with CD/DVD drive not getting detected</span></u></i></b></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps provided in the link below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><u><span>Issue with Error code 39</span></u></i></b></p>
<p><span>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</span></p>
<p><b><span>Cause</span></b></p>
<p><span>There are several causes of Code 39 errors: </span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>A required device driver is missing. </span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>A required binary file is corrupted. </span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>There is a problem with the file I/O process. </span>
</p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>A driver that is referencing an entry point in another binary file is unable to load.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Recommended resolution</span></b><span><br />
<br />
Reinstall the drivers for this device.<br />
<br />
<b>Uninstall and reinstall the driver</b><br />
<br />
Uninstall the driver from Device Manager, and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again.
<br />
<br />
You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for
 the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.

<b>Driver</b> tab, and then click <b>Uninstall</b>. Follow the instructions.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox App, DVR</h2>
                    
<p>I tied to disable the game DVR from the Xbox app after it lagged my games, but got an error. So I decided to delete the Xbox app all round which did nothing to I installed it back on. The only problem is, my game still lags... Does anyone has any idea on
 why? or how to remove the DVR again?</p>
<p>I get this:&nbsp;"Something went wrong. Try again later." when trying to access the DVR settings.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I can print 8.5 x 11, but can't print 11x17 with current driver installed.&nbsp; Does anybody know if HP has drivers for windows 7, 64 bit OS.&nbsp; I did download the drivers for Vista, but when I try to install them, I get an error message that says I need Microsoft
 Explorer 5 or better.&nbsp; It won't recoginize that fact that I have explorer 8 running and I used it to download&nbsp;those drivers.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>False advertising for Halo Wars 2 season pass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoidburged  say:</h3>
<h2>            False advertising for Halo Wars 2 season pass</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought the Halo Wars 2 season pass under the pretense&nbsp;that the latest campaign&nbsp;DLC would be included. The description of the&nbsp;season pass on the Xbox store&nbsp;can be quoted confirming that it does indeed include"new campaign missions that expand the halo wars 2 story" . However, a grave injustice has been done to all those who have purchased the $50 season pass as the first campaign DLC &nbsp;<em>Awaking the Nightmare&nbsp;</em>will not be included!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Please address this issues and Stop lying to your fans Microsoft!</p><p><br /></p><p>cheers</p><p>Zoid</p>

<h2>            XBox One Shuts Down My Home Theater Receiver</h2>
                    
<p><span>here is a description of my issue. </span></p>
<p><span>I have my xbox one connected to a home theatre receiver. My home theater receiver is equipped with an internal amp protection circuit. the amp protection circuit protects the receiver from power surges and it will shut off the

<p><span><span>the xbox one remains on however. &nbsp;</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone have a similar issue and know what the fix is?</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently got suspended for a reason that I know to be false.</p>
<p>I have tried sorting this out on "14 -&nbsp;My LIVE account was suspended" but was told that isn't the correct place.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>The reason for the suspension is falsely accused and now lost XNA membership which I require for my University course in which I can not complete without the membership.</p>

<p>It's about a different profile.</p>
<p>Apparently I am banned until "31/12/9999" for apparently "accessing DLC from illegitimate means" when I haven't.</p>
<p>I have asked for what DLC it supposedly is but they just say nothing.</p>
<p>The only thing that has happened recently is my friend came over for a week and transferred his licenses to my xbox so we could play zombies on black ops (he is a good friend of mine) and now I can play them on my name.</p>
<p>Is this what caused the suspension and if so how can that be fair?</p>
<p>I can't lose this profile because it is my life (I am studying Games Tech and need XNA to complete my course).</p>
<p>Loss of profile = loss of my 3 years at University (I am on my final year now).</p>

<p>To access DLC illegally means I'll be ripping off what I wish to go into.</p>

<p>All I use my xbox for tbh is casual gaming with friends / family and game development.</p>

<h2>            How can I change the profile picture of my contacts in the people app &#40;contact list&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, how can I change the profile picture of my contacts in the people app (contact list). The photo that it appears is the one they have on Hotmail, live, etc(accounts associated) but I can't edit this picture or assign a picture I have in my local drive.
 Also want to add a photo to contacts which don't have any. I hate the default gray picture.</p>

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8. As I understand, you need to change the profile picture attached to any profile in your contacts list using people app. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand your concern.&nbsp;This feature is by design and you are not allowed to change the profile picture of other contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to send a feedback tab attached to the people app. <br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.<br />
<br />

            <div>this is fairly complicated, but the People app apparently pulls the contact</div>
<div>images from all the enabled and connected online sources (which are ALL enabled</div>
<div>by default). go to the charm bar, settings option in the People App and</div>
<div>experiment with the list of providers that are used. The App seems to prefer</div>
<div>Facebook contact images over say outlook.com or Exchange or any other source. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>so if you turn off everything EXCEPT what you can control, such as images</div>
<div>attached to an Outlook 2010/2013 contact card where you can specify an image,</div>
<div>you will get the images you want. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>then, of course, after you make changes like this, it is unknown how long it</div>
<div>will take for the cache for the People App to refresh. </div>

            Hi Steve,  <br /><br />Give this a shot for me. <br /><br />Manually Purge the Update Cache<br /><br />First, you need to temporarily turn off the Windows Update service (to stop background downloads). Open the Command Prompt (click start and type “cmd”) the type<br />“net stop wuauserv” command, and press Enter. <br /><br />Open File Explorer, and go to View &gt; Folder Options. Select the Show hidden files, folder, and drives radio button, and click Apply to enable the display of hidden files on your computer. <br /><br />Once done, navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and delete the content of the Download folder. <br /><br />Open a new Command prompt window, and run the “net start wuauser” command to restart the Windows Update service. <br /><br />After this, reboot and then try to run Windows updates again. Let me know!<br /><br />- C

            0xc00000005 is a very general error and this happens during install recovery image phase. 
<br />
<br />Rather than getting into technicalities and analyzing log files, you should upgrade this manually.
<br />
<br />1. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<p>Update:&nbsp; I have found the references to two recent updates (KB2553332 and KB4461614), have disabled both and all seems to be working again.</p>

I followed the update removal on more than above updates including 4462's and 4461's and it still did not work for my XP/Office 2010. Uninstalled/reinstalled still same issue. &nbsp;Eventually uninstalled and carefully reinstalled removing everything but Word and
 Excel then started on updates. Stage 1 all up to Nov 2018 using link for date and checked Office worked, so saved a restore point, &nbsp;note&nbsp;6 updates refused to install of ones selected. &nbsp;Then rebooted to restored Nov/Dec updated which appeared&nbsp;different to ones
 I was expecting from last update list. &nbsp;So I think the issue is actually with the MS Auto-Updater not specifying correctly as some of the updates mentioned in stage 2 did not appear. &nbsp;As now down to 5 did them separately in stage 3/4 which again displayed
 different updates from previous list. But eventually I have all installed and Office still working, so either issue is not with Word or Office and somewhere else in Office or the update is mismatching its updates, NB: I did not get any 2019 updates, which
 is interesting in itself.
