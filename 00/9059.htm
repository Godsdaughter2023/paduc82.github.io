    <title>LDAP Filter in SharePoint Online User Profiles - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LDAP Filter in SharePoint Online User Profiles</h2>
                    <p>I have spent a good hour on Google and Bing trying to find the answer to this, but can only find answers that speak to SharePoint on-premises (2010, 2013, and 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to set up an LDAP filter in our SharePoint Online User Profiles. In our on-premises SharePoint 2016 environment, we have an LDAP filter that only gets user accounts, and only accounts that are active. We have approximately 17000 user profiles in our
 UPS in SharePoint 2016, which is expected, since have 17000 team members. The filter also excludes secondary accounts (e.g. a separate administrator account many team members have for systems they support).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our SharePoint Online tenant, we have over 37000 user profiles -- more than 20000 profiles than we have team members. This leads to team members finding erroneous results in People searches (e.g. team members who are no longer with the company are still
 returned in search results).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I configure the User Profiles in SharePoint online so I can set an LDAP filter that filters out unwanted items? I only have administrative permissions to the SharePoint Admin Center and OneDrive Admin Center. I do NOT have perms to manage the entire
 tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to set a tenant LDAP filter because that could impact how the Azure AD syncs to our corporate AD. I just want to get rid of the 20000 unwanted User Profiles, but don't see a way to set a filter. And searching online isn't bearing any fruit.</p>

            There is no such functionality in SPO. User profiles are synced directly from Azure AD, without any filters applied to them, so whatever is visible in Azure AD will be visible in SPO. The only method you can use is to filter them out of dirsync/Azure AD.

    <title>Wrong contacts count - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanowm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong contacts count</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
On my phone I have 25 contacts, but on web it shows that I have 40 "<span>Contacts</span>
<span>(40)", but it list 25.<br />
<span>(40)", but it list 25.<br />
I've tried solve this by moving all-all contacts into archive and then restore them one page at a time (didn't use all-all), that restored only 20 contacts and after that I couldn't access archive page at all, it gives me "service temporary unavailable" error.
 If I move one contact back to archive, then I can access archive, yet it shows that I have 21 contact in there...<br />
<br />
The count mess up I think happened after I've used "find duplicates" feature.<br />
<br />
I think I can fix this by making a backup on the phone (with PIM Backup), removing all contacts from the phone and MSMP, then restore contacts with PIM and sync with MSMP<br />
Hopefully it worked, but this issue should be looked at<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
[EDIT]<br />
Yes, my method fixed the problem.<br />

            <p>Try running Repair Permissions and check if this helps:</p>
<p>To use Repair Permissions:</p>
<p>1. Open Disk Utility in your Applications/Utility folder.</p>
<p>2. Click on the First Aid tab and select Repair Permissions</p>
<p>3. Click on the icon for your boot volume.</p>
<p>4. Click the repair permissions button.</p>
<p>If this fails, try testing in a new Identity.</p>
<p>To create a new identity, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Exit all applications.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Hold down the Option key on the keyboard, and then click the Outlook icon in the dock. The Microsoft Database Utility will open.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: You can also access the Microsoft Database Utility by opening the Application folder and then the Microsoft Office 2011 folder. Open the Office folder, and then double-click Microsoft Database
 Utility.app. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click the plus [+] sign to add a new identity, and then type a name for the new identity. For example, type, “New Identity”.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Set the newly create identity as the default. To do this, select the newly created identity, click the Action button, and then select Set as Default.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Exit the Microsoft Database Utility, and then restart Outlook, create the rule and see whether the problem is resolved. If this works with the new identity, export the old data as .OLM file
 and import it into the new Identity.</p>

<p>I am trying to sort a sheet's column names, which should be possible with Sort &amp; Filter&gt;Options&gt;Sort Left to right. However, the option is greyed out, and only sort top to bottom is available. The sheet does have headers setup to allow visibility and data
 entry in bottom rows. When I remove this header setting, all column titles are removed, and the option to sort left to right is still grey.

<h2>            Forgot security code, couldn&#39;t on phone at all.</h2>
                    Hello. I'm using Nokia 5610 Express Music, and I couldn't on my phone at all as I forgot the security code.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for me to reset the security code by myself so that I can use my phone again? I couldn't view my security code, as I couldn't on my phone at all.<br />

            Unfortunately it is not possible to reset the security code yourself. Have you tried the default code (12345)?<br />
<br />
The only way to get it reset is at a nokia care point. They may charge for the service and you may lose all of your data. They will also need to see proof of ownership before they will do it.<br />

<h2>            Exceeded the login limit for a 15 minute period &#40;outlook.com&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p><br />
I originally posted this issue to the outlook.com forum; however the&nbsp;experts there recommended that I post the question to&nbsp;this forum instead.&nbsp; I primarily use Outlook 2010 to read my mail via POP3/SMTP. I have always set&nbsp;Outlook to check for new messages every
 two minutes, checking multiple account. When I enable my outlook.com account in Outlook 2010 with a two minute check, I receive the following message:</p>
<p><em>Task 'Outlook.com - Receiving' reported error (0x800CCC90) : 'Your incoming (POP3) e-mail server has reported an internal error. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP). The server
 responded: -ERR Exceeded the login limit for a 15 minute period. Reduce the frequency of requests to the POP3 server.'<br />
<br />
</em>I then tried increasing the time between automatic send/receives in Outlook 2010; however if I add a few manual send/receives to pull in a message I am waiting for or my phone notified me is sitting out there that causes the frequency to increase and I
 again receive the above error message.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the limit is for how frequently you can check for new mail via POP3? Is this temporary as part of the "preview" or likely the way it will be? Could there be some "premium" paid upgrade to outlook.com in the future to remove this restriction?
 I am aware of the IMAP option; however I have a lot of mail and like the ability to have it organized the way I want and not have it all sitting on a mail server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to be able to check my mail as frequently as I need, I find myself replying on my phone as the message has not yet been delivered to my Outlook.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you understand my issue correctly.&nbsp; Outlook.com is configured as a POP3 account, I do not wish to use the Outlook Connector as I had described in my original post.&nbsp; It sounds like this only way to avoid this error is to change my send/receive interval.&nbsp;
 I feel this is poor, none of my other email account have restrictions like this, including Gmail.</p>

            I get this also Mike. It's apparently a "feature" of outlook.com. It's certainly not disclosed up front anywhere that I saw when signing up for the account. I didn't see (or maybe understand) this "feature" when I switched from using gmail. Part of the
 reason for the switch was that the client interface on outlook.com (to me) was just simpler than gmail. I believe that I set the initial value at 5 minutes but backed off to 10 minutes now and still see this sometimes. It's a real PITA. It may not be helped
 in my case by using Mailwasher in front of the Outlook client on the PC. So, Mailwasher also checks the email, automatically sets some emails for deletion etc and the Outlook (2013 in my case) then gets what is left to be downloaded. Once I ran into sending
 too many emails in a day for Outlook.com liking (never saw that on gmail either).<br />
<br />
I asked what the daily limit was for the "paid" service was on outlook.com. The answer was something like "it depends on how we evaluate you as a user and that change". I read this to be part of Microsoft attempt at spam prevention.<br />
<br />
Having said all of this....if I had known these things before I sent out emails everywhere telling people of my new email address...I probably would never gone ahead with the outlook.com account. I may still switch back in the future.<br />

            Every two minutes for a send/receive interval is really too short. &nbsp;Ten minutes is the recommended minimum. &nbsp;Email is not an instant messaging medium.
<div><br />
<div>On top of that, Outlook 2010 can employ the Outlook Hotmail connector to access your Outlook.com mailbox to provide a two-way sync for not only your mailbox, but your contacts and calendar as well. You will never suffer from accessing your mailbox too
 often and your mail will appear nearly as soon as it arrives.</div>

I imagine that 2 minutes is too short. Mine IS set at 10 minutes. But, with me being in one state&nbsp; and my wife in another (at the moment)...sometimes we trade emails back and forth and still run into the&nbsp; "too many email checks per a 15 minute period" error.
 Regardless of "why" Microsoft does this, it is not mentioned when opening a new account (anywhere that I saw....if that is not true then Microsoft should be really up front with this). Microsoft should be well aware that gmail doesn't do this.<br />

            OBVIOUSLY. Sounds like typical Microsoft. Our way or the highway (and I use and like a lot of Microsoft software). Just look at the three shades of gray current version of Office etc as another example.<br />
<br />
But, as usual, the initial comment at the start of my last post was ignored. Nobody ever explains the email limit per day other than vague terms like "low" and "high" (whatever those mean). Likewise, nobody ever explains how often you can check email withing
 the "magical" 15 minute time limit.<br />

            I know. More people sign up for accounts because they don't see these restrictions.<br />
<br />
I tell you that I would not have signed up for Outlook accounts if I had realized this. I may still switch back to gmail. Now, I had some problems with gmail. Personally, I prefer the Outlook "look and feel" to the the gmail threaded conversation look. However,
 gmail does NOT have these restrictions and for the most part my interface is using Outlook 2013 and Mailwasher Pro ahead of Outlook 2013. It could be (in my case) that outlook.com interpret Mailwasher as part of my "limit".<br />
<br />
On top of that nobody can give what the daily limits are other than "low" and "high". They also can't give how many times during a 15 minute period trips the "too many times" limit. It's all just annoying.<br />
<br />
I tell you I thought my employer was secretive at times (well, OK pretty much all the time)....but Microsoft take the cake here.<br />

            Excuse me.&nbsp; Where and who decided how long I must wait before I check my mail?&nbsp;&nbsp; As you see, I strongly disagree with your statement.
<br />
<br />
Not stated here or anywhere, that email replaces an instant messaging system.&nbsp; However, it should be responsive to the users requirements---and having such a restriction in Outlook is ludicrous.&nbsp; I have used many email systems and currently am on 3 large systems,
 Google being one of them.&nbsp; They understand a user may like to get email faster than "snail mail"------they have no restrictions such as are on Outlook.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When Outlook first came out I set up some accounts planning to migrate from the other accounts.&nbsp; But, as the initial offering was so limited I could not make the change.&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently looked and said "They finally have made it usable," and decided to trial again.&nbsp;
 I was in the process of testing and ran into this restriction.&nbsp; Needless to say I stopped.&nbsp; Again, Outlook is not ready for prime time.<br />
<br />
You have stated that the <i>Outlook Hotmail Connector </i>is the save all for everything,&nbsp; I don't think that you actually read the complete problem before responding.&nbsp; BTW, have they fixed the connector so it supports the HTTPS protocol yet?<br />
<br />
I agree with others, if MS goes to the trouble of defining the system requirements as well as other details, why not state this restriction?&nbsp; This is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
See:&nbsp; http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24677 <br />
<br />
I and others are waiting for MS to officially state that they have this restriction in Outlook, the duration, as well as other "features" that we may have not discovered yet.<br />

            <p>If you buy a new PC with no OS, you can install Windows 10 Preview &amp; use it as an Insider, even after July, 29. Windows 10 will remain active as long as you are an Insider &amp; the Insider program continues even after July, 29. In case you leave the program
 or Microsoft cancels the program, your Windows 10 installation will expire after a period of time (unless you buy a license). You can reinstall as many times as you want.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>1. After July, 29 the Insider program continues, so you can use it to install/reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>2. If you are not Insider or you (or Microsoft) decide to cancel the program, you will have to buy a license. In other words you will not get Windows 10 for free, unless you previously owned a valid Windows 7/8/8.1-excluding Enterprise editions-those are
 excluded from the free upgrade offer.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for your response. </span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your effort &amp; patience that you have put to resolve this issue
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the error message you have given. The message that you are trying to send is too large or exceeds your recipient's mailbox limit.&nbsp; This usually happens when the host of your recipient has a limit on the size of messages
 that they can receive. Reduce the size of your message. If you are trying to send a file, you may need to compress it using a file compression program, like WinZip.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To understand this issue better, I would like to know the following information:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1.&nbsp;What is the exact <strong>error </strong>message?<br />
2.&nbsp;Is your computer connected to any <strong>network </strong>or <strong>domain</strong>?<br />
3.&nbsp;Is there any restrictions on the computer?<br />
4.&nbsp;Any similar issue with other users who is using Outlook?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this behavior, verify the availability of your Internet Mail server and resend the message. To do this:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Open the Undeliverable message in your <strong>
Inbox</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong>Tools menu</strong>, click <strong>Send Again</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;When the original message appears, click <strong>Send </strong>on the <strong>
Tools menu</strong>.</span></p>

    <title>Turn off Windows Defender notifications that only apply to chosen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ld474  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off Windows Defender notifications that only apply to chosen settings after Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>I have intentionally chosen my Defender settings to disable "Cloud-based protection" and "Automatic sample submission". However, ever since the Windows 10 Creators Update (1703), I receive constant notifications of "Threats found. Windows Defender Antivirus
 Found Threats. Get details." When I click on the notification, it brings me to a page that shows "Scan history: no threats found" which is exactly the opposite of the notification suggests.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The section "Virus &amp; threat protection settings" has the summary "You are using the settings that Microsoft recommends." Which also is the opposite of what is suggested by the nagging 'threats found' notification. If I click on that section, I see the red
 x for "Cloud-based protection is turned off. Your device may be vulnerable." and "Automatic sample submission is off. Your device may be vulnerable." I find these notifications disingenuous as I don't use Microsoft's cloud services, and these are only ways
 for Microsoft to collect data to make Windows Defender better, not anything related to my actual device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter the reason, I do not want to turn these settings on and it is not a "threat" however it seems to be the only thing causing the popups just about every time I'm not moving my mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am NOT looking for instructions to turn off the Windows Defender Notification Icon in the sys-tray (I've already done that, to no avail). I am also not looking to disable Windows Defender. I just want to stop the constant notification for something that
 is a conscious choice, not a "threat". I have already turned off "Receive recent activity and scan results" which doesn't seem to change anything. I have also turned off
<br />
"Get notifications from apps and other senders" in the general Windows settings "Notifications &amp; actions" area.</p>

<p>Chances are (99.99%) your HP computer came with a Norton free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here. Downloading/running the
<strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> (followed by a reboot) may resolve the behavior (if you're lucky).</p>
<p>
</p><p>FULL DISCLOSURE =&gt; Over the years we've learned that sometimes it's too late for the Norton and/or McAfee removal tools to "come to the rescue." This may be another one of those times - especially if you upgraded from Win8.1 to Win10 manually and/or installed
 Creators Update manually.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Bhimavarapu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, Skype for Business contacts list is different from Outlook contacts list. They won't sync with each other. It is an expected behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To schedule a Skype for Business meeting, you should make sure you have added your Office 365 account to Outlook for Mac. Also make sure the account in Outlook is the same as Skype for Business account. Then you can follow the link below and set up your
 meeting:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-a-skype-for-business-meeting-in-outlook-b8305620-d16e-4667-989d-4a977aad6556#OS_Type=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-a-skype-for-business-meeting-in-outlook-b8305620-d16e-4667-989d-4a977aad6556#OS_Type=Mac</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you encounter an issue when you follow the procedure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>

<h2>            Nothing shows up in Recent on Save As page in Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed Office 2016 on 2 separate computers and experience the same issue on both.&nbsp; In Excel, when I go to File &gt; Save As &gt; Recent, nothing shows up even though I have&nbsp; been recently saving spreadsheets. And YES, "Show this number of unpinned
 recent folders" is set to 50.&nbsp; I have tried repairing Office and have went through all the settings.&nbsp; Seems like it is a bug specific to Excel. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Recent folder works just fine in Word and Powerpoint.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Microsoft is ZERO help on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of users on O365 that no longer have any functionality in Excel with the Recent Folders list. In Word, the feature works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent a couple of hours with MS support with no results. They claim every thing works fine, but I can show them directly that the behavior is not the same between Excel and Word within the same O365 install, it is simply maddening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using both 32 bit and 64 bit installs, as well as standard release and insiders release.... No matter what, the function in Excel is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my users that I have tested this with so far, I have found a difference in behavior with the versions below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>16.0.7766.2060 This one works.</p>
<p>

    <title>create list of page hyperlinks onenote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel379  say:</h3>
<h2>            create list of page hyperlinks onenote</h2>
                    Is there a way to create a list of hyperlinks to a page? I'm a lawyer trying to create a trial notebook in onenote. I have two sections: documents and witnesses. I want to create hyperlinks to represent connections between specific documents (pages) and
 specific witnesses (pages). One document can have links to multiple witnesses and vice versa. First, I go through each document and create hyperlinks to each witness. When I finish, I wish there was a way to go to each witness page and create a list of the
 previously-created hyperlinks showing all documents that have a hyperlink for that witness. Ideally, the list would also be hyperlinks to those documents. Right now, I have to go through and manually do both. Very time-consuming. Is there a way to do this?

</p><p>If you are referring to <em>account deletion</em> and you did mark the account to be closed within the past 30 days, simply sign back in and the account is ready for use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you closed and marked the account to be deleted more than 30 days ago, then the account is definitely deleted, and there is no way to recover it.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer rare visual glitches - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer rare visual glitches</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I've run into this issue with Windows Explorer for a few times already, but sadly couldn't figure out what exactly triggers the issue.</p>
<p>When it occurs, some of the icons on taskbar are not displayed anymore (unless there's cursor over it), Start menu visual scheme gets screwed up, along with most "metro" icons and exactly the same happens to folder windows opened in Win Explorer (sorry,
 forgot to take a screenshot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pay attention to taskbar</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0be474b-69ac-47fe-96ff-8b9c52b40e3c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pay attention to Start menu button - there's a cursor over it (sadly, not displayed)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0451d640-a0ba-45f2-9b6d-9a12d7358e12" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Start menu appearance with the bug. Apps are still being launched if you click the icon. There are no options (sleep / turn off / restart) when you click the Power button.</p>
<p>If you open a folder, all items within the folder will appear in incorrect visual scheme (like items in "classic" part of Start menu) and all control options won't be rendered correctly (like icons in "metro" part of the Start menu). Once again sorry for
 not taking a picture of it.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6edb0e2-bc66-4db9-b7ba-c7930174630f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what my Start menu looks like in NORMAL state.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49e53d25-fffa-48ae-a031-489694ed602f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is fixed if you restart explorer.exe process / restart the PC. I did not notice any abnormal behavior of the process during time when bug was "active".</p>
<p>Sadly, I cannot connect the bug's appearance with any kind of my activity: the only idea I have that it might be connected to video playback because last 2 times I noticed it after finishing watching a video played via MPC-HC, but then again, I clearly recall
 another case when it occurred during just internet surfing.</p>
<p>I have not touched video card drivers after installing the system, and although I play with GPU settings time to time, the bug occurred in both cases, when "normal" GPU settings were used and when I played with them a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, this affects only anything related to explorer.exe. Apps running are unaffected by the bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screens were taken on 9879 version. It happened on previous versions aswell. I'll be glad to provide any other details required.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue.</p>
<p>It's happening across all "Taskbars" + "Start Menu" and "File Explorer"</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have no idea, what triggers this behaviour.</p>

<p>Thank you, but I've already figured that and used the solution (&gt;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue is fixed if you restart explorer.exe process / restart the PC)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The thread you linked, however, contains a reply from support Engineer; I'm already on the build he mentioned and cannot really 'test' it as he offers in second paragraph since I don't know how to reproduce the bug, but suggestion from #3 of his reply is
 something I'm gonna try and see if it happens; thanks for sharing.</p>

            <p>No, I did not. I've always updated via Windows Update since original OS installation.</p>
<p>And anyway, this affects stuff related to windows explorer ONLY. If there was an issue with drivers, the bug would affect other applications aswell, wouldn't it?</p>

            <p>Well the reasoning behind my thoughts on it are it appears as a struggle for memory.&nbsp; And if your Video Card is using shared memory it might not know "how to talk to it".&nbsp; And that might be cause by an upgrade passing the old drivers on to the new install
 and then not needing any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you understand how menus work they are the last opened items and subject to the last amount of Physical OR Virtual Memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found is at college in AutoCAD this occurs in the Menus are suffering for memory due to Hardware Accelerations not being turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would seek Fresh Windows 8.1 Drivers for your Video Card which can't hurt anything.&nbsp; And hope they replace any lingering ones Windows found to be OK for the purpose.</p>

            One of the variables in your code is not an object or not initialized, I can only guess which one:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(ThisWorkbook.Path &amp; "\" &amp; ComboCox1.Value &amp; ".jpg")
Image1.Picture = LoadPicture(ThisWorkbook.Path &amp; "\" &amp; ComboBox1.Value &amp; ".jpg")</code></pre>
<br />
<br />I suggest that you add the line
<br /><pre><code>Option Explicit</code></pre>
<br />at the top of the module, then click Debug\Compile and you'll get an error which variable is not declared in your code.
<br />
<br />After you fixed all compile errors execute the code again. If you get the same error means one of the object variables is not initialized.
<br />

<h2>            How can I import my Outlook 365 for Mac Profile from a Time Machine backup file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently moved Macs and all I have from the original is an external drive that houses all my Time Machine backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed MS Outlook 365 on my new MacBook but I would like to use all my emails and email address information from my original Mac and Outlook 365. I have tried to locate the database in the Library folder in my most recent Time Machine backup file,
 but the "Library" folder is not present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched all over online for a solution to unhiding it but all I've found are solutions for your revealing the main Library folder, not one from
<strong><em>within</em></strong> a TM backup file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! How can I access and import all my Outlook data from my original Mac?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, I know you have backed up the data into the Time Machine now and you want to import the data file into Outlook for Mac.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is the case, you can firstly restore the data from the Time Machine. For more information, you can refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Automatically-archive-or-back-up-Outlook-for-Mac-items-441fcce5-2262-4b64-ac8c-fa949df989f5?omkt=en-US&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Office does not show OneDrive files in Recent list</h2>
                    Many of the files I work on are saved on OneDrive. No matter how many times I open and save these, if I am in Word or Excel and go to file&gt;open recent, they are not there. I have OneDrive installed and synced (because Office 365 for Mac refused to stay
 signed in so this was the only way to access them without signing in each time). How do I change this?&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi RKM,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yes, you need to back up them before taking the step. I know that it may be inconvenient to do that in your environment. I first suggest you close all Office 2016 for Mac applications, remove
 the keychain values by following the steps below, unlink the sync folder via <span>
clicking the OneDrive icon on the top bar&gt;Preferences&gt;Account&gt;Unlink This Mac, remove the local sync folder, sync the OneDrive for Business library again, open the Word 2016 for Mac application and log into it with your account to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Close all Office 2016 for Mac applications.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Open Spotlight by selecting the magnifying glass at the top right of your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Search for and open Keychain.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the search field, enter adal.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Select all items whose type is&nbsp;MicrosoftOffice15_2_Data:ADAL:&lt;GUID&gt;, and then press&nbsp;Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the search field, enter&nbsp;office.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Select the items that are named&nbsp;Microsoft Office Identities Cache 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Office Identities Settings 2, and then press&nbsp;Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Quit Keychain Access.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile,&nbsp; right-click the OneDrive sync client for Mac’s icon&gt;More&gt;Preferences&gt;About and upload a screenshot showing the version of the OneDrive sync client
 for Mac you are using.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please back up the email data via the steps in
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-items-to-an-archive-file-in-outlook-for-mac-281a62bf-cc42-46b1-9ad5-6bda80ca3106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>the article</span></a><span> and then take the steps to
 fully activate the Word 2016 for Mac application to check and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I also am having this issue, but specifically around Seagate Dashboard, Steam GAmes (Only certain ones) and Adobe Reader. &nbsp;I am running windows 10 and I have run the SFC and it found no errors. &nbsp;Have also tried installing the VC redistributed version 2010,
 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. &nbsp; Please help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get the steam game fixed by finding the vcredist x86 program and running it...not sure why I had to run it within the app folder, but it worked. &nbsp;Gonna do the same thing for the other apps and see fi that works.</p>

            sfc/scannow didn't help. Says everything is ok. So my next question is about x86 C++ as opposed to the x64. Am stuck in x64 and every time I try to find the fix all I get is the "buy this" options. How about the "fix this" option from Microsoft? Windows
 10 and Windows ME seeming very similarly bugged. It is very aesthetically pleasing, just wish it was more functionally pleasing. &nbsp;
