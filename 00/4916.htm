<h2>            Micorsoft project, milestone not appearing in gantt</h2>
                    <p>In my project file, I have a number of milestones. Recently I have noticed that the start date reverts back to the project start date and if i try to edit the information on that task the milestone disappears from the gantt. If I click scroll to task, it
 does take me to the finish date in the gantt but the milestone is not visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hp108,
<div>Unfortunately I don't think the answers forum allows attachments to posted messages, however if your screen shots can be posted to a URL address, you can use the link icon to "attach" that. It's a little interesting because&nbsp;the main Project forum at,&nbsp;http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/projectprofessional2010general/threads,
 does allow users two attachments per post.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nonetheless, just seeing the problem is not likely to help find out why. The best way to determine a cause it to either actually look at the file (i.e. send it to me), or dig deeper into things that lead up to the problem, settings, etc. If you want to
 send me the file so I can review it, see my address below. I will ask some questions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And yes, it could be a matter of file corruption. Try saving the file as XML and then re-opening in Project. Note: you will lose custom formatting.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 1809 and Office 2013&#58; The operating system is not presently configured to run this application.</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting the error on three completely different systems now, with different versions of Office 2013. The only thing the same between all three PC's is they are on 1809, and have Office 2013. Computers with 1803 and Office 2013 are not affected, nor computers
 with 1809 and Office 2010. I run a computer repair shop and the problems were first reported to me on Thursday the 13th. I've tried quick repair, online repair, using the Office 2013 removal tool fixit from Microsoft, using Revo uninstaller to uninstall Office,
 running the programs as an administrator. None of these computers with the issue have ever had a earlier version of Office installed. One machine has Outlook and that still works fine, just not Access, Excel, PowerPoint and Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also tried CHKSDSK /F, SFC /scannow, and Tweaking.com Windows Repair Tool. I've been using LibreOffice on those machines as a workaround for now.</p>

<h2>            Clicking hyperlink in Word 2010 does not work until you move the mouse</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7, Office 2010. When I click a hyperlink in Word (in this case, one which links down to a bookmark later in the document), nothing happens unless I move my mouse slightly. Is there a cure for this?

            I suspect this is a result of having the TOC in a content control. Do you see the same result if you insert a TOC using References | Table of Contents | Table of Contents | Insert Table of Contents... instead of choosing one of the "Automatic Table" building
 blocks?

<h2>            Outlook Mobile App - Contacts Cannot be Added</h2>
                    <p>I have the Outlook app on both my iPad Air and iPhone 6 Plus. I just noticed there is no way to add a contact. Am I missing something. My email is Hotmail, but want to believe that does not make a difference. When using the Apple Contacts app or the Boxer
 app, they allowed me to add contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance appreciated.</p>

            That is really weird since mail can be composed and calendar events input, but contacts cannot be added or edited. Especially since every other mail app I tried allows this. I decided on the Outlook app figuring there would be common usability. Sounds
 like someone at Microsoft needs to get off their butt and get to work.

<h2>            Bugs in Outlook 2016 on Windows 10 Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Outlook 2016 (Office 2016) on Windows 10 desktop, all 64-bit. There are a number of bugs, some serious:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Sometimes when I read a new message in an inbox by clicking on it and reading it in the reading pane, and then move on to another message (e.g., by clicking on it), the first message stays bold in the message list, indicating that it is still unread.
 The inbox in question still shows a (1) indicating there is 1 unread message, even after all of the messages have been read. The Outlook icon in the system tray thingy down the bottom indicates that there is unread/new mail. Note, this is different from the
 case where you click on the message momentarily and it doesn't fully download/render in the reading pane, or you simply don't look at the message for long enough prior to moving onto another message. I understand that under those circumstances the message
 is considered "unread" and that this is the way Outlook works, for understandable reasons - i.e., the workflow insists that you stay on a message for a second or so prior to it being considered read. No, for the issue being reported here, the message is definitely
 fully downloaded and rendered in the reading pane for quite a long time (e.g., I can leave it selected and in the reading pane for 20 seconds or longer), so it definitely should be considered "read". It is definitely a bug. It happens at random. It happens
 with new messages (i.e., not part of any tracked conversation, etc.). The message can be simple. I.e., no attachments or anything, and it can be a small message like a paragraph or two.&nbsp;In such cases, sometimes I can click around on other messages for a bit
 and come back to the "unread" one, and then it goes to "read", but some stay stubbornly "unread". In such cases, the problem can be fixed by clicking on another inbox or folder and then returning to the inbox in question, and then I can change the problem
 message to "read". Other times I may have to quit and restart Outlook completely in order to get the message to go to "read". This is a bit annoying. I've seen this kind of problem with previous versions of Outlook under Windows 7, but in my latest setup (Outlook
 2016/Windows 10), it is much more common. I.e., it happens quite a lot, so more annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There is a quite serious bug whereby, randomly, it is not possible to move certain messages, e.g., from an inbox into a folder. This is described in</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-outlook/outlook-2016-cannot-move-message-because-message/42394f6e-9a24-4fda-9d7c-07a52118970e</p>
<p>(Also, as mentioned in the above discussion, it is sometimes not possible to flag messages that have been, e.g., replied to. This is a serious bug that impacts productivity. Not being able to move messages leaves them dangling and clogging up the inbox,
 and it's possible to lose track of them. Not being able to flag is a real problem, as it is possible then to forget that you were meant to do something with the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Not being able to select multiple addressees in one of the address fields when composing a new mail, reply or forward. This is really painful and "new" to Outlook 2016 I believe. If you have a bunch of addressees in an email that you are composing, it
 is not possible to use the shift or control keys along with the left mouse button to select more than one of them at a time, e.g., if you want to delete them or copy them to another mail. This is very annoying. One thing that makes it so annoying is that Outlook's
 contact management is so bad. See (4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) This isn't a bug per se, but it's a major deficiency in Outlook 2016. Contract management and autocomplete. Outlook doesn't autocomplete from the full&nbsp;list of&nbsp;your contacts&nbsp;when you type email addresses into a message that you are composing. That is retarded.
 It builds up a list of suggested contacts over time. Trouble is, it forgets the suggested contacts all the time. Under previous Outlook setups when Outlook decided to forget all of the suggested contacts, i.e., I'm typing an email and all of a sudden I can't
 autocomplete on some contact that I always email to, I would open up contacts and cc or bcc everyone in my contacts list and then select all of the cc'd contacts and delete them from the cc or bcc&nbsp;list (so that I don't send the mail to everyone!). That action
 would repopulate all (well, most with Outlook 2010, and I seem to be seeing cases in Outlook 2016 where stubborn contacts don't make it to autosuggest this way...) of my contacts into the autosuggest list, and then autocomplete of contacts would work for a
 while again. With problem (3) above introduced into Outlook 2016, this is made more cumbersome. I now have to open a new message and stick all my contacts into the address field and then delete the message to achieve the same workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) The other thing about contacts in Outlook (in general, including 2016) is searching them. When you go to the contacts list (e.g., to search for a contact that didn't make it to autosuggest by means of the workaround in (4)), the search is really dumb.
 You have to search on the first name in the contact in terms of how it is filed. So, a contact may be filed as "John Bellamy" or "Bellamy, John". In the first case you have to type "jo..." to find him, in the second case typing "jo" won't find him&nbsp;- you have
 to type "be...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that on my iPhone mail/contacts app, it always can autosuggest from all of my contacts and it can suggest from either the first or the second name corresponding to what you are typing. Outlook's contact management has been rubbish for years. It's
 a really basic and simple thing. Dare I say it Outlook is starting to look like Lotus...</p>

            <p>1) You can adjust your Reading Pane settings and when a message gets marked as read via; View-&gt; Reading Pane-&gt; Options. I haven't come across an issue with items not wanting to get marked as read but you can always mark it as read manually either via the
 Unread/Read button on the Home tab of the Ribbon or by pressing CTRL+ENTER or CTRL+Q or by right clicking on it and choosing Mark as Read or by clicking on the blue bar in front of the message. Plenty of options ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Hard to say without knowing which account type you are using and which mail server is behind it. There are some known issues with IMAP hosted on a SmarterEmail mail server due to not being fully RFC compliant. Microsoft has escalated this to SmarterEmail
 and they will fix that in a future update. It is then of course still up to the administrators hosting that mail server to apply the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I can't repro that here. If you mean that you can't select multiple individual contacts by holding CTRL like you can for instance select files in Explorer, that has never been a feature in Outlook. It is a basically a single line of text and you can't
 select multiple individual words in Word either. Selecting the entire line of contacts, selecting adjacent contacts and selecting individual contacts isn't a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) AutoSuggest has always worked as a cache of up to 1000 people that you have previously emailed. This is a design choice but you are free to make a feature request by contacting Microsoft Support or use UserVoice (in the near future). Lotus Notes tries
 to do a real-time query against the entire Address Book but that is painfully slow in a company with &gt;10,000 people and it always tries to resolve to people I don't know and increases the risk that a message is being sent to the wrong person. Of course there
 are various&nbsp;other solutions to the issue as well&nbsp;but those would be feature requests.&nbsp;Note that you can have Outlook try to resolve your (partially) typed name to a contact by pressing CTRL+K. The AutoSuggest cache is being written when Outlook closes. When
 Outlook isn't properly closed, this write process will fail and the AUtoSuggest cache can indeed be lost. Additionally see:

<p>
</p><p>5) No you don't. You can search on either name and&nbsp;even search on the Company name, email address or telephone number and many other fields you have filled out for a contact. Are you actually typing in the Search field of the Contacts folder?</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks very much for the replies Roady.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1) I haven't tried all of the options that you mention for stubborn messages that won't go to "read". I have tried
 right-clicking and selecting "Mark as read", and that doesn't work on them - they stay "unread". Next time I get one of these, I can try the other options that you mention, but I suspect that nothing will work and the best I can do is shut down Outlook and
 restart it, as that often allows me to then mark the offending message as read just be selecting the message and reading it. I suspect this is part of the wider problem discussed in (2) and the discussion referenced therein, namely, a general problem of not
 being able to process certain messages which occurs at random: flagging, marking as read, moving to a folder, etc.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2) I can collect data on the account types and servers that are afflicted by the issue for me. In the related thread,
 somebody has given MS what they say is a reliable way of reproducing the problem, but that doesn't appear to have been followed up by MS.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3) Sorry, I needed to be more precise here. Due to the crazy problem of losing the autosuggest&nbsp;list&nbsp;every time Outlook
 crashes. which it does from time to time, or at other times, for no apparent reason; I needed a way of repopulating it with my few hundred contacts. I would do this as follows: I would compose a new mail/reply/forward/etc., and when I tried to put addressees
 into the To or Cc field, I would find that the autosuggest has stopped working. I would then click on the&nbsp;To or Cc&nbsp;button which would take me to contacts. I would grab them all (which I can do easily by pulling the scroller down to the bottom of the list and
 shift-left-select-ing them all) and then hit, e.g., the Bcc button, which pastes them all in as addressees. This has the effect of adding them to the autosuggest list. That's great, but I'd better get rid of all of my contacts from the Bcc field. So, how do
 I do that? Under Outlook 2010, I could select the first addressee, pull the scroller down to the bottom and shift-select the last addressee, and that would select the whole lot. Hit delete and they're gone. However, under Outlook 2016 the shift select process
 doesn't work. You can click next to an addressee and then pull through/down the list to scroll down to the bottom and select them all that way, but with a few hundred contacts that is slow and cumbersome. So, getting the shift-select thing to work would be
 a help. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4) On my iPhone 5 all of my contacts are in the autosuggest, on first and last name, all of the time, and it works
 flawlessly and fast. The Outlook system only builds up suggestions one at a time, which is cumbersome. Hence the trick of throwing them all into the address field of an email, which I picked up from forums and work colleagues who had the same problem. The
 problem is compounded by Outlook losing them all fairly often, either due to an Outlook crash or on other occasions for no apparent reason. This amounts to a major usability issue and Outlook lags other systems in this area as a result. Giving users the option
 to (re-)populate autosuggest with all of their contacts every time Outlook starts would be a huge improvement. Then the small percentage of uses who have thousands of contacts can elect not to enact that option. Even better would be the ability to maintain
 a permanent list of definite autosuggest contacts. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5) Ok, I need to clarify and retract a little here... If I go into the specialist Contacts area of Outlook (by selecting
 the people icon down bottom left), then indeed I can search first and last names at the same time. So, if I have a contact called Louise Taylor, then I can type either "Lou" or "Ta", say, into the search box and Louise Taylor will appear, along with any others
 that match the search string on first or last name. However, if I am composing a mail/reply, and I want to add a contact as an addressee, this is where the searching is poor. If Louise Taylor is in my autosuggest list, I can type "Lou" into the To field and
 autosuggest will offer *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. However, if I type "Tay" into the same To field, it can't find Louise. So, it only seems to be able to search on the start of the name or email address. On the iPhone, it will autosuggest on both first name
 and surname of the contact. This is important, as sometimes you remember the first name of the person, sometimes only the surname.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I thought that it got worse if&nbsp;you can’t work out the addresses from autosuggest. If you click on the To or Cc button,
 it takes you to a contacts dialogue. This is searchable, but only on the first name filed! That is, say I am searching for John Smith. If I have filed him as Smith, John, then searching on “Jo” won’t find him. So, if you only remember one of the names of the
 contact, and the contact isn’t filed with that name first, I have to navigate to the main contacts area where I can search on first and last names. However, I note that checking the&nbsp;"More columns" check circle (unintuitavely) extends the search so that first
 and last name are searched. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7) The other annoyance about this contacts dialogue that you get when you hit the To or Cc button is that it mostly&nbsp;only
 shows contacts associated with one of my accounts, and doesn't show my Outlook Contacts, which is my preferred repository of contacts. (I don't want to have contacts tied up with an email account, as I will probably lose them if I switch to another email account/server.)
 In fact, when adding a new contact, it always defaults to this particular, damned account to add them to, and I have to go into the contacts area and manually move them across to Outlook contacts, which is what syncs with iPhone, etc.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To wit, it would be great to have a catch-all option that says: Just give me one set of contacts, one set of notes,
 on set of To-dos, one calendar, and call it "Outlook". Put everything in there and don't bother me with specific sets for each email address, etc. The way it works at the moment is really confusing. I expect that a lot of people would be happy with that, and
 those that don't can always try their luck navigating the multiple contacts/calendars zoo.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>1) I've had a chance to test out the various options suggested by Roady for forcing messages to be in the "read" status:<br />
a) If I select the message and allow it to completely render in the reading pane, and wait a long time (e.g., 30 seconds), then I click on another message, the original problematic message will remain in the "unread" state, with subject in blue bold. The corresponding
 mail folder will display a blue [1] in the title to indicate that there is an unread message in the folder/mailbox (assuming that all other messsages are "read").<br />
b) If I right-click on the message and select "Mark As Read", it doesn't work on the problematic message. I can use this to toggle the read/unread status of other, non-problematic messages.<br />
c) Clicking on the blue bar at the start of the message has the same effect as b) - it works for non-problematic messages, but not for the problem one(s)<br />
d) Selecting Mark As Read from the Home tab in the ribbon: This is the same as b)<br />
e) Selecting the message and typing ctrl-Q or ctrl-Enter: This will mark an unproblematic message as "read", but doesn't work with the problematic one(s)<br />
As mentioned, quitting Outlook and restarting can often "release" the offending message so that it can be marked as read. Sometimes, I can come back to the offending message later in the Outlook session and it can be marked "read". I never had this issue with
 Outlook 2010 on Windows 7 with the exact same mail accounts. I see the issue roughly every other day.</p>
<p>I have noticed a variant on this problem, whereby if I have a group of "unread" messages, I can select one to render and it will change to "read". However, when I select another and change it to "read", the first one changes itself back to "unread". This
 becomes like playing Whack a Mole.</p>
<p>2) For the general problem of not being able to do things with certain messages (most commonly moving to a particular folder or flagging/unflagging), the account that I mainly notice this with is an IMAP account. The details are:<br />
Incoming mail server: imap.secureserver.net<br />
Outgoing mail server: smtpout.secureserver.net<br />
Using SSL encryption for incoming and outgoing servers.<br />
Incoming Server: 993<br />
Outgoing Server: 465<br />
Though this is the account that most commonly displays the behaviour, I use my other accounts so rarely that it may just be to do with the relative amount of time I spend with this account. Also, with the other accounts I don't do a lot of moving or flagging.<br />
This is a serious bug in Outlook. It is being widely reported in various forums and threads, e.g., as mentioned:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-outlook/outlook-2016-cannot-move-message-because-message/42394f6e-9a24-4fda-9d7c-07a52118970e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-outlook/outlook-2016-cannot-move-message-because-message/42394f6e-9a24-4fda-9d7c-07a52118970e</a><br />
More people have been adding to this, and Microsoft has been given a lead on reproduction of the bug which they haven't followed up, according to one poster.<br />
Note that I didn't get the problem when using Outlook 2010 under Windows 7.<br />
I neglected to mention that probably the most serious form of this problem (as reported by a number of people in other threads) is when I reply/follow up to a message and after I type out the reply, I click "Send" and I get an error something like "Action cannot
 be performed as the message has changed" or some such. That is extremely annoying. The only way around it is to create a new message, copy all the right recipients, and send the new message. That's problematic as Outlook then loses track of the conversation
 (previous associated messages).<br />
There is a variant on this general problem of not being able to flag, move, etc., a message. Mostly, I get an error message saying that the action cannot be completed as the message has been change or some such. However, I have also noticed just complete non-response.
 That is, I attempt to flag a message and absolutely nothing happens. I.e., it just stays unflagged. Similarly when trying to copy or move one of these problematic messages, I perform the drag and drop copy or move action, but the message doesn't get copied
 or moved, but I get no error message either. This is particularly dangerous with copying, as I might think I've copied the message when in fact it hasn't been.<br />
In some cases (as with the read/unread problem) it is possible to get around the problem by quitting and restarting Outlook. Not always though. I have a whole Outlook Inbox folder from when I used Outlook 2010 with messages that I can't move or copy. That is
 really bad for productivity as I have to look in that Inbox for a lot of the messages from the particular period concerned.<br />
I have found another workaround that works on the moving and flagging problem quite a lot of the time. If there is a message that refuses to be moved or flagged, I select the message just before it in the inbox, and I select "Forward". That brings up a dialogue
 for the forwarding. I immediately close that dialogue, which kills the forwarding process without saving a draft or anything. I then go back to the problematic message and often find I can flag or move it. Sometimes it takes a couple of iterations of selecting
 and half-forwarding other messages to make the original message move/flag-able. It is as though Outlook put a lock on the message and by focussing on another message, Outlook releases the lock and I can then do things with the previously locked message. I
 think that the locking usually occurs when I forward or reply to the original message. Note that this is random. It doesn't happen all the time, but I see the problem daily, I'd say. This workaround may give Microsoft a clue as to how they may fix the bug.
 I HOPE THEY DO!!!</p>
<p>8) Another issue with Outlook 2016 is that it is no longer possible to flag multiple messages. It used to be possible to select a bunch of messages (in a contiguous group, for example) by selecting the bottom one and then shift-selecting the top one. Hitting
 the Flag symbol on one of the selected messages would flag all of the messages in the group. However, in Outlook 2016 only the particular message whose flag symbol I selected gets flagged.</p>

<h2>            Ctrl C Ctrl V problems</h2>
                    Hi, I have made some searches on this and found out almost exactly when this happens..<br />
When I create new word pad it works normaly, I can copy paste with the shortkeys ctrl C and V..&nbsp;<br />
But when I open up an old document (also 2010 docx), which already has texts inside, I can't use the shortkeys function.. It just won't respond,<br />
I still can right click with mouse and do that, but the keyboard shortcut are broken..<br />
<br />
In other programs as Notepad or Internet browsers I don't have that problem.<br />
Its really annoying, I have this since I had windows 7 (I switched to windows 8 customer preview, and switched again to release preview), and its been bugging me since then..<br />
fixes as reinstall driver for keyboard don't help my case.<br />
I'm not sure it matters but I'll point it anyway, I have shortkeys for some softwares on windows such as "Google Chrome" got Ctrl+Shift+C, "NotePad" - Ctrl+Alt+N,<br />
Word - Ctrl+Alt+W, and so on.<br />
The Ctrl C and Ctrl V (and Ctrl A and Ctrl S) are free ofcourse (I wouldn't put something else on them..)<br />
<br />
I believe the fix is somewhere in the Word properties options, but I can't find it my own.<br />
Can you please help me solve this problem once for good?<br />
<br />
I'm using Office 2010 (all my documents on my PC are 2010 created)<br />
<br />
Thanks alot,<br />
Yarden.

<h2>            Windows 10 PC build 15048 rs2 shows a second recovery partition of 831MB</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to build to 15048, I have 2 recovery partitions 450MB and 831MB. Will there be a problem? Any way to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59c8263f-533b-4de9-bba7-658f2e06ab6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59c8263f-533b-4de9-bba7-658f2e06ab6a" /></a></p>

            <p>Not a problem, the initial 450MB partition is too small for the new recovery medium, so the update created a new (larger) one behind the boot partition.</p>
<p>If you really want to recover the lost 450 MB space you will have to wipe the disk a perform a clean install.</p>

            Well, this is an easy one. There are no Scripting or file system objects in the Macintosh operating system. So, the error you are getting is correct. You will need to use applescript to copy the files(s).You can use VB to execute a compiled script, or
 use the macscript VB command to execute a short script. Ron deBruin has some stuff on his web site that may help.<br />

<h3> gm_w  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia x6 default music player -- how do i add a folder to playlist&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a giant library of music files, mostly mp3s. I am trying to play them using the default music player, which I belive is the only player that can show up on the home screen. I can create my own playlist, but it looks like I have to add songs one by
 one to the playlist, which is a huge pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use "all songs", then some of the garbage ringtones and mp3s that came with the phone also get included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I add a large amount of songs to a playlist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, the default music player doesn't support OGG files. How do I enable OGG support on default music player?</p>

            You can mark off which songs you want to go into the playlist. And get them into it at the same go. Or you could try to make the playlist on ovi suite.

<p>yep that's how you can do it. don't be lazy, take your time and get it done, and you know what? i like it that way too... like that i can make sure that only the songs i want get into the playlist even if i have to deal with 500mp3 songs, also nokia doesn't
 give us many choices with this issues on our said flagship smartphones</p>

<p>As I said there are other ways</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You can make playlists on Ovi Suite and sync</p>
<p>2. Make Playlists on WinAmp, and sync</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the phone, when you make a playlist, you dont really add them one by one. You make a playlist, select the option to add songs, then select the songs you want to go in and press done.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Visio 2007 using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a registered copy of Visio 2007. I was able to install it on a computer running Windows 8.1 last week but I returned that computer for one running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing on the new computer a dialogue box comes up&nbsp;asking me to enter my Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is - there is no field to enter it in on in the part of the dialog box that appears (it's clearly not the whole thing). It says to click the Help button if I don't know where the Product Key is located, and the Help button doesn't show either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other text there says, "Although you are not required to enter your Product Key now, we recommend you do so for ease of validating your Microsoft Office License."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to proceed from here. I can't enlarge the dialog box, I cant select anything in it and scroll within it. I can only move it or close it, which ends the installation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how I can install my software???</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Please quit out all Office suits, and then try the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Type <strong>regedit</strong> in RUN dialog box and press Enter. Now go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Registration</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Under "<strong>Registration</strong>" key, you'll see one or more GUID (Globally Unique IDentifiers) containing a combination of alphanumeric characters in following format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Select each key and look at "<strong>ProductName</strong>" key in right-side pane. One GUID key will contain the version number of Office installed in your system "Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2007".</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Select that GUID key and delete following 2 registry entries from right-side pane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DigitalProductID</strong><br />
<strong>ProductID</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Close registry editor and run any Office application e.g. word, excel, etc. It should prompt you to enter a new product key.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Enter the desired product key and click on OK. That's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>There's no such folder in the registry.</p>
<p>
What seems to work to install is to skip entering the product key for now, since you cannot. Just tab once, when the incomplete little window is up on the screen. Then hit enter. Fumble your way through an install without providing the product key.
</p><p>
</p><p>Then, at least you can run the program a few times. You can go to Help, Activate Product to enter your key. You'll still get the too-small window where you can't see the product key entry area, but pretend you can and enter it (no spaces or dashes), and
 then hit enter. You'll get an install button - click it and you should be activated.</p>

 certain number of times so seemed to have worked.&nbsp;</p>

            I expect that it will recognize your device as a new device and that you will have to add it as a new device.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can always delete the current phone and after the upgrade, connect it to MyPhone and add the device.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will then be able to&nbsp;sync the contacts, calendar etc.

            Here is another option to use BEFORE you upgrade the OS on the phone.&nbsp; Although I have not used this feature yet,&nbsp;Archiving is a way to make sure you have all your information safely stored.<br />
<br />
Here is a FAQ on Archiving with MyPhone:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Archiving is a way to free up space on your phone. An “archived” item remains in the archive section of your My Phone account, but is removed from the phone.
<br />
<br />
To restore an archived item to the phone, sign in to your My Phone account, select the Archive view from the left panel, click or tap the item, then click Restore. The item will be transferred to your phone the next time that you sync.
<br />
<br />
Previously synced items that are deleted from your phone are automatically moved to the Archive folder in your My Phone account. Items deleted from the Archive are permanently deleted.</strong></em>

    <title>auto-filling data using data validation drop down list - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            auto-filling data using data validation drop down list</h2>
                    <p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help here with auto-filling data from one sheet to another using data validation drop down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to export data from Quickbooks to an excel sheet and auto fill it on a self made JV template by creating links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some work on it (CREDIT GOES TO JEEDPED for helping me out on a previous assignment almost similar to this, Thx man).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided a dropbox link for the excel file i created. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qn2dizvvavcwe5/ghvjg%20-%20Copy.xlsx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a drop down list on the JV template using daat validation. the problem is i cannot get the proper values in account code, title, debit and credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly resolve this issue for me as i don't know where i am going wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drop down list is set on Txn No: in the JV template. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use columns of your choice from the data table to link it with the cells of the JV template. it is just a test file so no worries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** Most Important:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly tell me a way through which if i update the existing sheet containing the data (will be exported from quickbooks) with new and more data, all the links, formulas must stay in place. Normally when i do everything is cleaned and need to reapply the
 formulas all over again to take effect. I want the new data to join the existing data and the drop down list to show the existing txns as well the new ones without having to reenter the formulas.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a snap of the 2 worksheets is as under:</p>

            <p>hello.</p>
<p>I can put in the validation drop down list and everything seems to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its just that i don't know the formula or procedure for setting a/c title, debits and credits columns right. they display only the information contained within the 1st row but not for those single transactions that contain more than 1 row.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg. say journal entry is </p>
<p>
</p><p>Dr customer x </p>
<p>Dr customer y</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr income </p>
<p>
</p><p>the first row containing customer x is displayed while the other information does not. same goes for A/C title.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of now, we cannot confirm on the availability of the shortcut key combination for OneNote’s screen capture in Windows 10 yet as it is in development stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to post your feedback in feedback app provided in Windows 10.</p>

            I think that the fact is Microsoft did not consider if users already had a common use for Win+S, therefore did not think it important if they hard coded in a Bing search tool for that command.

<p>To join the Insiders simply go to Settings, Update &amp; Security, Windows Insider Program, click to join and follow the instructions.
</p>

<p>There is high possibility that an Insider build will compromise or negatively impact your programs or data. You would be better to install a second copy of Windows 10 to a small partition on your hard disk (for testing Windows 10 Insider Preview). Leave
 your daily use Windows 10 on the public build 15063.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Disk Management to shrink drive C: to leave room for another copy of Windows 10 for use with Insider builds. 64GB may be enough space for this.</p>

            Do not use a preview of any flavor on a device that you use for day to day computing.&nbsp; Even using a preview on a separate partition from your primary partition does not guarantee that a serious bug does not render the device unusable until you completely
 start over.&nbsp; Such risk is small but small is not zero and Microsoft does not support multi-boot scenarios.

<h2>            New Lumia 710 stuck in Flight &#40;Airplane&#41; Mode</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just recieved my new Lumia 710 from T-mobile, after waiting 5 long business days...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I open up my new phone, put the new micro sim in, and battery. &nbsp;Start up the 710.. smooth and fast. &nbsp;Input all my starting login.. and notice my phone is in Flight mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think, oh yeah, I have a new sim. So I call up T-mobile and give them the new sim info. &nbsp;Of course i'm calling from my current t-mobile phone (HD7) and we disconnect automatically. &nbsp;(I figured its because he started the new sim.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, I still notice my 710 in Flight (Airplane) mode. &nbsp;So I go and try to turn it off in the settings. &nbsp;It toggles to off, but when i back out into my settings menu, I notice it still says On. &nbsp;So i go back into the Flgiht mode, and its On. &nbsp;So I turn
 it off again... same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I call up T-mobiel, from my home phone, since my HD7 is givning me "no sim" message now, and they try to troubleshoot the problem. &nbsp;I do a factory reset... battery pull, still same issue. &nbsp;No cellular network, just Flight mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, now i'm again, waiting for my 2nd New phone to arrive... not scheduled till Monday. &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought i'd ask here and see if anyone else has an idea about this or if this is an issue....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe i'm missing a step to try... I even tried without the sim in it at all. &nbsp;Flight mode stays on no matter what. &nbsp;I tried this with my HD7, and with the sim out, it doesn't automatically go into Flight mode.. I can still toggle it off and on (HD7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have experience with Windows Phone.. and this is a first for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also to add... on the 710, when I go to turn off the Flight Mode, it automatically turns on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and of course Flight Mode stays on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just got a Nokia Lumia 710 from Rogers here in Canada....I am faced with the same thing, the airplane mode does not seem to wanna turn off, I've done everything, reset the phone both soft and hard (using the multiple hold key method), removed the battery
 checked the SIM is inserted correctly, same thing is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now...when I remove the SIM card and boot the phone, go into the settings, I can toggle airplane mode switch to OFF but the status still reads ON...hence same thing is happening, it does not want to toggle like it should!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should mention when the phone is booting without any SIM card inside, it'll bring up a message to notify me the user that there's no SIM in the phone so the hardware reports and the software reports the same message as in there's no SIM, which is good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also...if I turn of the wi-fi (which world great), then go to airplane mode (which reads ON permanently) and slide it to the off position, wi-fi turns right back on...so this means the software turns on just the wi-fi radio and not the cellular antenna...so
 there's definately a fault some where, not sure if it's the OS or the phone but since I have another windows phone 7 device (Dell Venue Pro), I think this is a Nokia issue....gonna try to seek warranty replalcement / repair now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grrrr, sucks I cannot move to Lumia 710 at this time, weird bug happening on day 1 with the device!!</p>

            sorry to hear... I wasn't able to resolve it on my phone, so t-mobile sent me a replacement which is working fine.<br />
<br />
If possible, see if you can switch it out. I'm really enjoying the 710!

<p>So I sent the phone in to Nokia Canada for repair since Rogers would not take it back....Waited literally 3 days and then Fedex brought in a package....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia had replaced the device...brand spanking new just like the one I sent in....only thing I did again was to unlock again $16 dollars not bad..this time 710 lives, its working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh the techician notes from the dead one (stuck in flight mode) came back saying...that particulalr 710 had an electrical problem hence the replacement phone I got....so if anyone out there is having that issue....send the phone in to Nokia (check locations
 on their site)....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Woooooooooooo</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Email Archive freezing on Network Drive</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Archive folder located on my work network. outlook locks up when trying to access it. I had to make it a local file to access it. We have a Exchange for the main email. but to save stuff in archives we have a windows 2008 server.</p>
<p>Any idea why it freezes when trying to access the archive when it's on the network instead of the local PC?</p>

            I was able to fix this by removing Internet Explorer (permanently), then moving the files to another folder and back to the original folder. Internet Explorer was causing the behavior. While I like being able to organize favorites as URL shortcuts, other
 browsers do not use this method, so I will organize them this way one more time and import them into another browser. I am giving up on Internet Explorer.<br />

            <p>TechTony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems too late to help you as you have already removed IE but to avoid the security warning you copy/cut and paste instead of moving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you did not waste any time following that&nbsp;inappropriate "advice" from a "support" "engineer".&nbsp; The behaviour that has been annoying you is not a fault symptom; it is&nbsp;the way the system is designed to operate.</p>

            That is not a solution because copy/cut/paste is not drag-n-drop. The convenience of organizing favorites via drag-n-drop (without annoying warnings) was a selling point, and without that, and the fact that IE would not run without crashing on earlier
 versions of Win 10 preview, is enough to cause me to abandon IE. <br />

    <title>Combining two peoples first and last names - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianentz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combining two peoples first and last names</h2>
                    <p>I have a situation where I have one column with one persons first and last name or the name of the company. And a second column that may or may not have the first and last name of the second person. I would like the proposed column to have the first name
 and "and" connecting to the second name where there is one. I don't want 'and' after the first name if there isn't a second name.
</p>
<p><em>It would be great if there was a way of dealing with situations where the first and second name are the same as in spouses with same names. (EX: John and Mary Smith instead of John Smith and Mary Smith) - but that isn't critical as it doesn't happen
 that often and isn't critical.</em></p>

<h2>            Onedrive merge same file name deleted my most recent file updates</h2>
                    I had a version of an Excel document that was in a OneDrive folder and had not uploaded for the last 4 days (not sure why this was the case as I had had high-speed internet access in this time). It came up as an upload error tonight - OneDrive asked if
 I would like to merge the two versions of the file with the same name (the online and my current laptop version), to which I said yes as it said I would get to choose what I wanted to keep. But then it just merged and overwrote everything I had done in the
 file for the last 4 days, with what had been there 4 days ago! I can't work out how to get back everything I've just done - it's not in recovered files and now the last file update being show is from today (the merge itself) or 4 days ago. How do I get back
 everything I had done and/or undo the merge??

<p>Hi Madison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, I save one document into my OneDrive sync folder and then open to editing it. During my editing, I disable the Internet&nbsp;adapter. I enabled the Internet adapter again after finish editing. All changes synced normally. And I can find the
 different versions in OneDrive online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the previous edition of your file, I'd like to suggest you move to OneDrive online and then select your file click the three points behind his name then&nbsp;click version history to check if you can find it. Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find all your changes during the 4 days, it may not feasible to recover it. This issue may be related to some Interner connection during your editing and that makes your file not sync timely. To avoid this kind of scenario, I'd like to suggest
 you check your file sync status when you finish your editing to make sure your changes have been synced successfully. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo</p>
