<h2>            5g network is not &#34;seen&#34; by iWindows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have run all network options including troubleshooters that came with Windows.
</p>
<p>Network adapter sees 2g but not my 5g cable&nbsp; network.</p>
<p>All other devices in house read my 5g.&nbsp; BIG difference between 2 and 5. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So if there is a problem with the WiFi device or the computer it is HP's to resolve. Added the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement.<br />
<br />
Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues with that model. Update the WiFi driver if available at HP and also check the actual device maker's site for even newer versions.<br />
<br />
Distant and obstacles can cause the 5Mhz to not connect.<br />

Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version -
<strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong> <strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong>
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

            <p>Thank you to Mr. Brown and others that replied.</p>
<p>The solution is in OEM as he stated. My brand new HP Notebook does NOT have 5g capability.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>I have ordered a Wi-FI dual band USB adapter which should fix problem.</p>
<p>I was very surprised to hear from HP that the WI-Fi card only accepted 2g. I will check next time.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Community.</p>

<h2>            Brand New SP4 - &#34;Surface&#34; keeps flashing on the screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just received my SP4 in the post &amp; am quite distressed because it isn't working. This is the sequence of events -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I took the SP4 &amp; keyboard out of the box, flipped out the kickstand &amp; attached the keyboard.</li><li>I plugged in the power supply after checking that all power connections were secure &amp; checked that the power connector LED light is on.</li><li>I tapped the power button, after which the "Surface" logo appeared on the screen &amp; keeps blinking/flashing with two second intervals.
</li></ol>
<p>It has been in this state for the past 40 minutes &amp; nothing else has happened. I have tried to shut down (holding down the power button for 30 seconds) after disconnecting the type cover, with &amp; without power cable connected, but nothing happens. It refuses
 to shut down &amp; seems to be stuck with the "Surface" logo perpetually blinking on the screen &amp; I can't do anything to stop it. I even disconnected the power cable &amp; let the battery drain &amp; turned it back on but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't call Microsoft support because it is out of hours for them &amp; am really upset by this, especially considering that it is brand new &amp; it is the first time I am taking it out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ducky</p>

            Also tried numerous times. Battery has drained now so at least it's off. Don't think there's anything I can do to get it back so will just hope the replacement works fine.

<p>Since Microsoft no longer host older versions of Windows 10, you will need to depend on a third party website to get the ISO version of Windows 10 you originally had installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version
 of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b</span></a></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choose the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows Final</p>
<p>- Windows 10, version 1703</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Pro + Home</p>
<p>- English</p>
<p>- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: create a bootable copy</p>
<p><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d</span></a></span>

<h2>            Pinned items in the task bar does not exists</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am having a problem with the "Pin to task bar". I can put my Favorited files or icons to task bar. But suddenly is vanish from the task bar.</p>
<p>For example, I tagged 4 MS word file to the Icon under MS Word in Task bar. It works fine. but suddenly the tagged 4 files are vanishes from the Icon of MS word.&nbsp; The MS word icon remains on the task bar but the tagged 4 files does not remains there.</p>
<p>Could you please suggest me how to solve the problem?</p>
<p>As a solution I tried:</p>
<p>I unchecked the "Lock the task bar". Then pinned all the programs under existing icon in the task bar and then again locked the task bar again.</p>
<p>Actually all the icons in the task bar remains but pinned items under specific program does not remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Sohul,</p>
<p>To resolve this, I'd recommend resetting all jump lists. &nbsp;Here's how:</p>
<p>1 - Copy this entire line: &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations</strong></p>
<p>2 - Paste it into the search box at the bottom of your Start menu, then press Enter to open that path.</p>
<p>3 - Delete <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all files</span>&nbsp;you see there. &nbsp;They should have names like "89a4f5aadc408c0e".</p>
<p>4 - Try pinning an item again to your Word jump list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    Could somebody please give me a definite answer on whether I should check YES to automatically download manufacturer's apps and custom icons available for my devices or should I keep it checked at NO. I have looked everywhere for the proper way to do this
 and cannot find a definite solution. I am using Win 10 Version 1803 so there is no expanded choices if I check NO. It is either Yes or No and nothing else.&nbsp; I understand the YES choice is recommended but I am concerned about having no control about what is
 downloaded and I have read people were having problems.

<h2>            Xbox One - Credit Card Problem With State&#47;Province &#40;solutions for those still having this problem&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I read many posts, which didn't really help (or the answers were so far apart that it is impossible for people to figure things out - I being one of them... for 3 days).</p>
<p>I know many people have not yet bought an XBOX ONE, or recently bought one - I being one of them, as I was and still am enjoying my PS3 alongside my new XBOX ONE. This thread are for people who will encounter this problem.</p>
<p><br />
I was trying to "purchase" the XBOX ONE Live Gold free trial. But, like many&nbsp; I couldn't fathom why I could not input my Canadian residency for payment. Here are all the solutions:<br />
<br />
<strong>1</strong> - I would check out this one to make sure you have the right locale. This part is taken from Microsoft itself:</p>
<ol>
<li>"On your console, sign in using your Xbox Live-enabled gamertag. </li><li>Go to <b>Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>System</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Language &amp; location</b>. </li><li>Select your new location from the list, and then select <b>Restart now"<br />
</b><b><br />
</b></li></ol>
<p><strong>2</strong> - Create a billing account to make matters easier. Under this url, choose the option to add a billing payment, which should be the third option below your giant avatar:</p>
<p>https://account.microsoft.com</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> - Visit this link (or if the link becomes obsolete, then simply look at the very bottom of this page that you are currently browsing. There is an earth icon with (most likely) the American locale. Click on that, and it will take you to
 a new page. Basically, it should be the same one as in the link below if it hasn't changed in the future). Choose your locale:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/Shell/ChangeLocale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/Shell/ChangeLocale</a></p>

<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If you cannot see your country</span></em>, click on "<span>View the full list</span>"</p>

<p>Once you follow these steps, it should do the trick! Hope it helps anyone who gave up long ago, OR who will purchase an XBOX ONE soon.</p>

<h2>            Maximize goes past the taskbar and prevents mouse wheel scroll.</h2>
                    When using the IE supplied with Win8 and a few other programs, if the program is maximized the scroll function either stops working all together or does not work only for the mouse. Which condition occurs is not dependent on the particular program or the
 alignment of the stars. Sometimes it works and at other times one of the two conditions occur. This makes me want to use much stronger language as I usually must reboot the program and pray that it works but I will withhold that for the sake of the community.
 Thankfully it is working for me now so that I may scroll down to the part of the page that is hidden by the taskbar and post this question.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once troubleshooting is done please follow "Step 3 :Reset the computer to<br />
start as usual" on the article to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong>Uninstall the mouse drivers.<br />
a)Press the "Windows key + R" and type and "devmgmt.msc" and hit enter.<br />
b)Expand "Mouse and other pointing devices" and right click and uninstall the mouse drivers<br />

            Although I did mark your answer as helpful, I cannot in good&nbsp;conscience&nbsp;mark it as the answer. I have attempted to reproduce the error and have been unable to do so. I believe the reason for this is due to 26 updates that were installed since the posting
 of this question. I have attempted this in various programs from MS and third parties and all of them seem to be working correctly now including the ones that I reported as giving me problems. Should these problems arise again I will revisit this thread and
 attempt to trouble shoot the problem with screen shots.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t Open Microsoft Photo App with &#34;Built in Administrator&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've had my present Windows 10 computer for six months, and I've only used one account the whole time.
<strong>I HAVE NEVER ONCE IN THAT TIME HAD A SINGLE ISSUE LOADING THIS APP, OR VIEWING MY PERSONAL PHOTOS.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why ON EARTH am I getting an error message telling me that I "Can't open this App with the built-in administrator" now, completely out of the blue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I actually have to do anything so completely asinine as making a new account, and transfering all of my games and data to it (of which I have several hundred GB) just to view a few JPGs and PNGs that worked
<strong>ABSOLUTELY FINE</strong> as of yesterday evening, I am going to be furious.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on Earth is this nonsense? This just plain seems like bad programming and design. I mean... ****! I apparently can't even uninstall the damn thing.</p>

    <title>Store Display Models - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhyza99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Store Display Models</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p><br />
I'm curious about something that seems a little fishy to me.</p>
<p>Through a chain of people I heard about the possibility of store merchandisers getting a hold on used store models of XBOX 1 consoles, and keeping them for themselves.</p>
<p>I'm unsure if this is legal, and I know someone who is interested in getting one of these display models from a merchandiser. My concern is that these systems are/could be considered stolen. I don't want someone who isn't aware of the legality to get into
 trouble for buying/using one of these models.</p>
<p>Any assistance that could be provided to me would be helpful. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Rhyza-</p>

<p>It's a floor model.... who is stealing it? If the store is selling it, it all legit. Why are we getting into legality?

<p>I get the impression that the store isn't selling it, and that the merchandiser is taking the old models. The reality is that the person who is able to get the console isn't the most upstanding person in the world, and I tend to question a lot of what this
 person does when it's a "great deal" like this.</p>

<p>Any display model of any product can be sold by the manufacturer. They usually don't sell them while they have the item in stock, but it's usually an option if they are sold out and the display model is the only thing left.
</p>
<p>The store model, if not part of a PR compaign that outsiders have provided, is basically just one of the stocks they have taken in, and that they have decided to use in hopes to sell more when people can see/try it.</p>
<p>Whether the store wants to sell these or not, is up to the store, as they have bought them like all the other items from a supplier.
</p>
<p>Also, if they are out of stock and this is the last item, AND they offer you the option to buy it, you should make sure it is at a reduced price, as it is now used. Many times by alot of people.
</p>
<p>At least make them throw in something more to even the price.</p>
<p>I don't know if i fully understood your question, so apologize if my answer is not valid in this context.</p>
<p>As for people working in the store getting a chance to grab this for themselves, it is really up to the store owner.</p>

<p>After the retailer purchases the console (or any product, for that matter)&nbsp;from the manufacturer, 'store policy' determines what happens to display models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having worked for and dealt with several major retailers myself, I can tell you that pretty much every retail establishment has a policy for display merchandise and very few, if any of these policies allow employees 'special access' or perks of any kind
 when it comes to displays. </p>
<p>Most policies are very clear and are typically similar to the last place I worked for; Any merchandise designated as "display" must remain on display until the&nbsp;product is either discontinued, or replaced by a newer model&nbsp;and may not be used for any other
 purpose.&nbsp;Display models may not be sold unless the product&nbsp;has been&nbsp;discontinued and all other store inventory has first been depleted. Management determines the amount of discount for said display product. Any display products that are damaged,&nbsp;missing parts,
 or worn out are to be processed as a return. </p>
<p>Generally, if something 'iffy' is going on, management would&nbsp;eventually find out... or be involved... especially with something as expensive as a gaming console, since inventory would be closely tracked and serial numbers would be logged. Not saying something
 iffy can't, or doesn't happen. Just saying that with more costly items like consoles, if management isn't involved or aware... it's a very high probability they will be eventually. Of course what, if anything,&nbsp;happens if something iffy is going on would be
 up to management and how good the 'story' they're told is.</p>

            <p>Hello Don</p>
<p>After some searching I have since found that the McAfee app/icons &nbsp;will not work on the desktop&nbsp;with Windows 10, which&nbsp;makes me wonder&nbsp;why McAfee&nbsp;has not updated its software, after all Windows 10 has been out a long time now&nbsp;and it makes it pointless to
 give a desktop icon/app with its software&nbsp;download&nbsp;that's going to be useless&nbsp;.</p>
<p>that said I&nbsp;still don't know what 'PLATUI' means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. The software download puts a icon on the right hand side of the task bar which does work !?.</p>

    <title>I know my online microsoft password, but my local admin password does - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akilmiki  say:</h3>
<h2>            I know my online microsoft password, but my local admin password does not correlate with it</h2>
                    I created an admin user and made my original user a local one. As of recent, I could not download any programs, nor could I access my user accounts. So what I did was I "changed my password" on the login page of my computer, and I thought that was that.
 However, each time I changed my passwords and tried to log into the admin account, it said that it was incorrect (and to change the password on the microsoft&nbsp;site), even though I had just changed the password. I'm not sure if the password for my local user
 is the same for my online microsoft&nbsp;account. A bit of background info: I was able to "<em>change"&nbsp;</em>the passcode of this account because I made the username a phone number.

            There is some discrepancy between your Microsoft Account sign in credentials and those used to log into Microsoft Services such as outlook.com. If you update your Microsoft Account password, it is not reflected in the sign in account, you will have manually change it.

            Remove your MS account until you get your local account working.
<br />Go into Settings - Accounts - Email and other accounts.
<br />Select to use Local account instead.

            Ok so you are using just local account.
<br />And you are correct in stating that the windows local account password is different than the Microsoft account password.
<br />Microsoft account is a cloud account.
<br />
<br />So when you change your Microsoft Account it will NOT change your local account.
<br />But what you can do is add your Microsoft Account to your windows machine and then just login with your Microsoft Account.

<br />
<br />Does this make sense?

            Yep, I already tried adding my admin microsoft&nbsp;account, but it has no effect on my admin passcode. The problem is that I don't know my admin password, and adding my online cloud account will not work.

            Yes adding the MS account won't fix that, you are correct.
<br />If you can not remember the local admin password you have to reset your PC.
<br />Backup before you do this.
<br />
<br />From windows go to Settings - Update and Security - Recovery - Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />

<br />
<br />Once you have your machine backup and running create a reset password disk just in case this happens again that way you don't have reset your PC.
<br />Works the same in Windows 10

            Just had a thought... before you do this extreme measure see if you can create another account.
<br />Settings - Accounts - Other People.
<br />Select to add someone else to this PC.
<br />Select 'I don't have the users sign-in information'
<br />Select 'Add a user without a Microsoft Account'
<br />Create the user.
<br />Then from settings select to Change account type and then select admin.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe there is an option in windows 10 settings for other people, but I'll try to look into resetting my pc. What exactly does the reset do, and where should I backup my files?</p>

<h2>            Audio not plugged in</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently update to the newest version of windows 10, and ever since my audio hasn't worked. Whenever i hover over the audio button at the bottom right and it states that "No speakers or headphones are plugged in," although the audio works with headphones.
 Also for some reason this has been affecting the games i have on my computer. I don't know why it's like this, I've basically tried everything to try and fix it. I have a PC that is connected to a monitor. Before this update my monitor would in a way "emulate
 the audio".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Help.</p>

<p>In Windows 10 this is easy, there's an entire touchpad section in the Settings app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately you marked that you are using Windows Vista.&nbsp; That means it's more than 15 years old, and doesn't have easy settings for these things.&nbsp; In fact Windows Vista (and even later, Windows 7) have no touchpad settings built-in at all.&nbsp; You only get
 options if your computer builder pre-installed them with your touchpad driver.&nbsp; If this is the case, it's typically made easy to access direct from the Mouse control panel.&nbsp; So to check, try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Hold down Windows logo and type R to show the Run box</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Type (or copy and paste) the command&nbsp;<strong>main.cpl</strong> and click OK</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Look for a touchpad or hardware tab on the dialog, and for a way to access touchpad settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Still, some laptop makers weren't so great a decade or more ago, so back in the Windows Vista days there were many laptops that could only adjust the touchpad options by using a special extra program that only the laptop builder could provide. Lenovo and
 Toshiba are very popular among those that did this.</p>

<p>Firstly, thank you for responding and trying to fix this ridiculous problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure where you got information about me not having Windows 10, because I do.&nbsp; I installed it myself.&nbsp; So, of course, my hope sank as I initially read your suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I decided to get into the area you suggested, which, of course, didn't work.&nbsp; But I got to the mouse/pad place and went into the tab showing ELAN, which I knew was the pad from searching before I wrote my query.&nbsp; I didn't open it at that time because
 I wasn't sure what it was and what my options were.&nbsp; I always think I will make it MUCH worse.&nbsp; &nbsp;But this time I did, found all the areas I was concerned about and managed to "undo" all of them.&nbsp; I just left tapping and I was hoping for the best.&nbsp; AND IT WORKED!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes, you helped.&nbsp; Maybe simply giving me courage to try, maybe reading through your suggestion and knowing where I had to go and what I should do when there.&nbsp; Whatever it was, had you not answered, I would still be yelling at my computer when my screen
 started moving all around.&nbsp; Now . . . it isn't.&nbsp; Now I'm relaxed and confident I can do what I need to.&nbsp; And I have you to thank - one way or the other, you are my hero!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading my plea and understanding my problem.&nbsp; I remember a time when computers were more "user friendly."&nbsp; So all I can say is I'm grateful YOU still are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>

    <title>Microphone Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theanteater20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p>Posting this as a last resort; looking for any help regarding my mic.&nbsp;My stock&nbsp;microphone randomly stopped working a few weeks back while I was in the middle of a chat&nbsp;and I couldn't seem to fix it. I assumed it was broken and I&nbsp;went and bought a brand new one, but when I&nbsp;plugged it in I noticed that it too was not working. After calling Microsoft and getting taken&nbsp;through a slough&nbsp;of troubleshooting techniques, it seemed as if nothing could fix my problem. I don't know if anyone else is having this problem, but any help would be much appreciated.</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Unable to &#91;re&#93; Install Dropbox App</h2>
                    <p>Dropbox App failed to Open (after months of working flawlessly); Dropbox Error pop-up suggested "permissions"<strong>*
</strong>issue .... ARGGGGH!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A) Verified Full Permissions for all computer <em>Users</em>&nbsp; (<em>System</em>,
<em>Administrator</em>, me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) Per <strong>Dropbox</strong> troubleshooting suggestion, I Uninstalled <strong>
Dropbox</strong> <strong>App</strong> (using Windows '<em>Uninstall A Program</em>')</p>
<p>
</p><p>C) Per Fix recommendation, also removed <strong>Dropbox</strong> Data folder which (of course) was left behind</p>
<p>
</p><p>D) Restarted Windows, Opened Windows App Store &amp; went to <strong>Dropbox</strong>
<strong>App</strong> page, where I was informed "<em>you already own this App</em>"&nbsp; [well, Duh!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>E) Attempted to Download/Install <strong>Dropbox App</strong>, only to be told "<em>this App is installed</em>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh?? .... WTH??</p>
<p>
</p><p>F) Verified that <strong>Dropbox App</strong> is, in fact, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not installed</span> (no longer shows in '<em>Uninstall A Program</em>' list)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - This followed repeated Failures of <strong>Dropbox App</strong> to Update successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights/suggestions ... anyone??</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------</p>
<p>Neither pleased - nor surprised - that unlike <strong>Google</strong> [App]<strong> Store</strong>, Micro$oft has apparently decided
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not to provide any actual support</span> for Store issues, presumably on assumption that
<em>any</em> App problem - including inability to Download/Install/Upgrade Apps from Store - must be responsibility of App creators!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------</p>
<p><strong>*</strong> "<strong>Permissions</strong>" yet another system configuration process which Micro$oft has managed to make nearly totally obscure to an average [non-IT] user, with its arcane, non-intuitive terminology &amp; "policies"</p>

            <p>You state Windows Store still states it's installed. &nbsp;How did you uninstall it? &nbsp;Since it was the Windows 8 app you were uninstalling, you need to uninstall it from the app s</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the best way I found:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Windows Key + C to bring up Charms Bar</li><li>Click Settings</li><li>Click Change PC Settings</li><li>Click Search and Apps</li><li>Click App Sizes</li><li>Click Dropbox App</li><li>Click Uninstall</li><li>Click Uninstall again in the box that pops up</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After this see if you can re-install the app from the Store.</p>

    <title>&#42;&#42;Solved - Windows 10 bluetooth Stereo no sound after playing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaker2s5  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;&#42;Solved - Windows 10 bluetooth Stereo no sound after playing video in full screen.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong>This problem has been solved, but I live it here in case anyone else would have similar issue.&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Find the solution on the&nbsp;<em>bottom</em>.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect my bluetooth headphones to the PC using my bluetooth dongle. It is connected, there is sound everything works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The issue</strong></span></p>
<p>However, every time when I click on play video in full screen immediately or after a few seconds the sound stops completely in the whole system and even if I exit the full screen it won't make any sound whatsoever. This is the Stereo device that does it.
 If I swap to Hands-free everything makes sound fine, but then I swap back to Stereo nothing will make sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Workaround</strong></span></p>
<p>To reset the sound in the Stereo device, I can go into bluetooth settings, disconnect from my headphones, then reconnect. After that there is still no sound, so I have to swap to the Hands-free device and then back to the Stereo device. Now it makes sound
 properly, of course until I open a video in full screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Additional Information</span></strong></p>
<p>It has worked before, I am just after a clean install of Windows 10. Since then it worked fine for 1-2 days. I have installed Unity, Blender, Visual Studio, Steam and Origin since then. Also a couple of games from Steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My headphones:&nbsp;</strong>JBL E55BT</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things I have tried:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows troubleshoot sound</li><li>Disable and re-enable headphones in device manager</li><li>Uninstall, then re-install headphone drivers</li><li>Using other browser to watch video</li><li>Using another website to watch video</li><li>Playing downloaded video in full screen (it works fine)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it has anything to do with the bluetooth dongle or the headphones, since they do work in Hands-free mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>EDIT:&nbsp;</strong></span>I have also noticed that using the volume buttons on my headphones no longer adjusts the volume in Windows, it rather acts as it has its own volume control. Before if I increased the volume using the button found on the
 headphones, it increased the volume in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution:</span></strong> I have an AMD graphics card that comes with Radeon ReLive which is a screen recording software. Whenever I entered full screen it turned on. For some reason it caused trouble with
 my bluetooth headphones stereo. I just disabled the feature and then everything worked fine.</p>
