<h2>            Brother 7360N on wireless&#58; Printer Ok, not scanner</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have PC windows 7-64</div>
<div>I installed Brother 7360N on wireless network with print server Linksys WPS 54G.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The printer works, I added port LP1 with print server IP address, checked Raw.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have problem with the scanner: impossible to "connect"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I find the device Brother MFC-7360N LAN in the device manager &nbsp;in DESKTOP (that's the name of my PC) in "Imaging devices". &nbsp;There if I click properties, the only thing I notice is Location: unknown</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Devices and printers,&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother MFC-7360N LAN&nbsp; doesn't show up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I use windows Fax and Scan, Scanner is&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother MFC-7360N LAN&nbsp;, but then nothing....</div>
<div>My "intuition" is that I have to set up the location manually, but I don't know what and where.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot if you have any idea!</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your question
 in the TechNet Windows 7 Networking forum. </span></p>

<h2>            Recent updates for NET framework causing loss of internet connectivity</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Win 7 on a computer that had run XP.&nbsp; Everything was going well untill a set of 7-8 NET framework updates were installed.&nbsp; After that I lost the ability to connect to the internet.&nbsp; My status now showed two unrecognized networks instead
 of one working connection.&nbsp; I rolled back my computer to a time when everything worked, but each time I shut down, windows installs the undates and I'm back to no connectivity.&nbsp; I've changed my settings so I now must check which updates to install.&nbsp; What is
 my next step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the updates causing the problem.&nbsp; I have not yet discovered if it is one particular update or a combination.</p>

<p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=238656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

<h2>            Newly upgraded Windows 10 pro, problems with internet connectivity.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello. I just installed Windows 10 on my laptop, it was an upgrade from Windows 7 pro x64. I'm&nbsp;writing to you on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>When I installed Windows 10 pro on my laptop, there was at first no internet and I was using only wifi. The wifi connected and listed it was&nbsp;on the internet, but no programs were connected to the internet and essential windows services failed.&nbsp;I checked
 2 different wifi adapters and neither worked. When I looked for an error report, it said
<strong>"Windows Sockets Registry Entries Required For Network Connectivity Are Missing"</strong></div>
<div>I connected my LAN cable to the computer and then MS Edge started connecting to the internet, but there are four main problems so far, aside from the wifi not working.</div>
<div><strong>1)</strong> I cannot sign into my Microsoft account (the one that is an email address) instead of my local account. It doesn't give me an error, but it over and over again says "Something went wrong - Try again or select Cancel to set up your device
 later."</div>
<div><strong>2)</strong> I cannot get any Windows Updates. The error code was: 0x8024402f</div>
<div><strong>3)</strong> Under Activate Windows, it gives me an error code 0xD0000272</div>
<div>
<p><strong>4) </strong>I have Windows Firewall turned off, but only some programs can connect to the internet. I'd say about half of them so far can connect. It probably depends on what processes they're using to connect.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I think the problem is related to the "Windows socket registry entries" or other parts of the Windows 10 upgrade that failed. More importantly, I tried to the fix to this problem listed on a tech website and I was told that "Could not add the requested feature.
 The error is: This program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system administrator." This was when 1) The LAN is disconnected, I'm only using Wifi and 2) I followed the precise instructions to reinstall the WinSocks and WinSocks2
 registry entries and TCP IP Tunnel drivers.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I think I need to do 3 things: 1) Uninstall a program that may be interfering with the internet connection, 2) Reinstall certain parts of the Windows 10 internet connectivity, and<strong> 3) Use a microsoft fixit tool or diagnostic tool to determine what
 exactly the problem is.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please help!</strong> I think this should be relatively simple to fix with the right tool.</p>
<p>Thank you community,</p>
</div>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community and providing us with the detailed description about the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per the description, I understand that you are experiencing multiple issues on the system.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Regarding Internet connectivity:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>There can be a number of reasons for no internet connection in Windows, some common reasons that can cause these problems are:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Corrupted or incompatible drivers.</span></li><li><span>Missing updates.</span></li><li><span>Network connection settings.</span></li><li><span>Hardware or software problems.</span></li><li><span>Inappropriate distance from the router or obstruction.</span></li><li><span>Interference&nbsp;with other devices.</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let’s try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To diagnose whether this issue occurs in “Safe Mode”, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some
 third party programs conflict. The word Safe mode appear in the concern of your monitor to identify which windows mode you are using.</span></span></p>

            <div>When I start my computer in Safe Mode, and login to the only account I have (an administrator) I get this message popping up:<br />
<em>"This app can't open" "Get started can't be opened using the built-in Administrator Account. Sign in with a different account and try again."</em></div>
<div>When I click on MS Edge:<br />
<em>"This app can't open" "Microsoft Edge can't be opened using the built-in Administrator Account. Sign in with a different account and try again."</em></div>
<div>I can't do Activation under Safe Mode.<br />
When I click on windows Update, the window closes (I think it crashes).</div>
<div><br />
<strong>However, 1 important thing:</strong><br />
In Safe Mode, there are programs which could not connect to the internet in normal mode now can connect in Safe Mode. It appears there was an improvement.</div>
<div>
<p>So I determined that Safe Mode was good, and that there was an improvement, however I was unable to accomplish what I wished because it wasn't available in Safe Mode. By the way, I was using "Safe Mode with networking" because I knew that was important.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><strong>I think the next step is to uninstall certain drivers or applications until my normal startup is closer to the Safe Mode settings.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I tried the automated diagnostics: all of them. None of them fixed anything or gave me any detailed instructions on what the problem might be. It was a waste of time.</li></ul>
<div>
<p>As far as the drivers go, I checked my device manager and all the drivers are updated and there's nothing missing. I used a software called "Advanced Driver Updater" and it updated all my drivers to Windows 10 and to current. Neither of the two wifi adapters
 I've used say "limited connectivity" though, so I don't think I need to reinstall those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have done a Clean Boot, but it didn't fix the problem. Surprisingly, a couple programs started up even though ALL entries were on disable in the task-bar startup menu. I think this means there are multiple startup menus and I've only found 1 of them.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So then, what steps do I go through to make my computer more similar to safe-mode?</span><br />
How do I determine what software is preventing the internet from working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My primary problem remains that I cannot activate Windows, I cannot login to my Microsoft account, and Windows Updates don't work. All of these revolve around the internet, and probably the windows files as they interact with my drivers.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 update boot-loop malfunction - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregorysmith6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 update boot-loop malfunction</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a serious Windows 10 update reboot-loop issue with a Microsoft Surface Pro 2. The update began automatically yesterday on an up to date system (yesterday, 5/16/18) suggesting that it isn't the reboot loop problem suggested by the support virtual
 agent (an error with KB3081424). My system is only 64 GB in size, requiring me to use an external 64 GB microSDXC card to supplement the required space for the update (I'm making due with 21 GB of system storage and 25 GB of programs; tiny by today's standards).
 The system attempted to run the update and apparently failed and has attempted to roll back to the previous Windows, giving a screen that says "Restoring your previous version of Windows..." The computer then reboots itself and returns to this screen, over
 and over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found other mentions of problems like this on-line and have attempted to find a way to a Safe mode boot-up in order to perform Startup repair, but am having problems making this work. The Surface Pro 2 that I have contains a UEFI firmware instead of BIOS
 (accessible by power button and Volume Up, F8 and Shift-F8 do nothing) and within this firmware has effectively only two switchable options, "Trusted Platform Module" and "Secure Boot Control." Supposedly, if the "Secure boot control" is disabled, the computer
 should search for bootable media in the USB (if it is FAT32). I created a bootable USB drive with an FAT32 system on another computer. With the "Secure boot control" disabled (Boot screen switched to red background from black) and this USB drive inserted,
 the system still fails to boot and continues to run this reboot-loop. I reasoned that maybe the microSDXC card is somehow hijacking the search order initiated by the firmware when it looks for drives (exceptionally stupid that this cannot be controlled in
 the UEFI screen... please just give me a real BIOS type system) so I ejected the microSDXC card and restarted the computer. In this case, the reboot-loop is disrupted with an error asking me to "please insert the external storage media and press ok." The boot
 loop is restored when I reinsert the microSDXC card, suggesting the card is involved in the loop. Unfortunately, I've found no other outs available to me here to reach Safe Mode. I hope somebody out there smarter than me can recommend a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer was perfectly functional prior to the update, is there some way I can get around the conclusion that this update hasn't completely killed it? Moreover, is there some way to get Microsoft to fix the problem they caused even though the computer
 is out of warranty? Coming along and bricking somebody's perfectly good computer should be a felony offense.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should consider reimaging. Take the microSD card out of the slot before</div>
<div>starting and follow this process:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (with a</div>
<div>different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; and download a</div>
<div>recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying back so quickly, I suggest checking the video fidelity settings on the Xbox one X to verify that it's set to HDMI and not autodetect. You can then choose the specific resolution to display it at. Once done please check your TV video settings
 to make sure it's set for 4k. Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycle</a> hasn't resolved this issue, you may want to try a full <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
factory reset while keeping games &amp;&nbsp;apps</a>&nbsp;to see if that helps resolve the issue. Additionally, are your controllers wired or wirelessly connected? Test both to see if your console will recognize the buttons being pressed.&nbsp;If either suggestions don't work, unfortunately you'll want to consider reaching out to the <a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online Service Center</a>&nbsp;to explore having your console repaired or replaced.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Getting harassed yet I get suspended&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sow unique  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting harassed yet I get suspended&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, I have been suspended from Xbox live for 2 weeks after being harassed
 by someone online . I previously had a week ban which was fair because I said some bad things. The guy who I said stuff to messaged me after he knew my ban was up still harassing me. He proceeded to keep sending me messages and reporting my messages from when
 the first suspension happened which has got me suspended for 2 weeks this time! It's not fair because I had a week suspension and go along with it, I didn't message him after my ban or on another account, he decided to message me telling me he wants to get
 me banned for longer and he's making my life hell.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>He's been reporting messages that were involved with the Incident that I got
 suspended for a week for. How is this fair? I've not retaliated. I've reported him for harassment yet nothing has been done! I tried appealing the ban but the enforcement team doesn't see the whole picture, messages from one incident shouldn't transfer over
 and become a 2nd incident.</span></p>

<p>Since you've already reported him, the enforcement team will investigate him and take appropriate actions. Investigations can take time so not all suspensions are issued immediately. You'll also want to block communications with him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because investigations can take time, your 2 suspensions would not be from the same incident. Both suspensions could be for actions that took place days or weeks prior to your 1st suspension.</p>

<p>Hello SOW Unique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear this, if you believe that you have been suspended wrongly, then I suggest visiting
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Enforcement</a> and see if you can appeal the decision.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also visit https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-0 to find out more information on the general procedures of Enforcement. It is also best to have a look at this as to avoid future suspensions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when you can it's best to block and mute this individual that is consistent on messaging and filing reports against you - and to perhaps file a complaint on this individual too so that a review can be looked into about this person(if you haven't done
 this already). Action may be taken against the person, but for the interest of your own account, be safe and follow the Code of Conduct.

<p>Hello SOW Unique,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with suspensions. Unfortunately due to the swearing it does go against the
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/Legal/CodeOfConduct?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
code of conduct</a>. The best thing to do in future when someone does this is just to ignore them, block them and report them. This way you wont reply or say something that will get you a suspension.</p>

<p>Yeah but surely getting suspended 2 times for the same incident is just added punishment. He even messaged me saying he's going to get me banned again from the same thing after he waited till I was not suspended any more, I've reported for harassment yet
 nothing has been done to rectify this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels as if I'm getting punished for being harassed. I sent 2 different messages in the same incident that contained swearing, he reported the one message then waited till I was not suspended to get me suspended again, How is the enforcement team not
 recognising it's from the same incident and he's blatantly harassing me with the 4 messages in a row he has said, trying to provoke me??</p>

<p>Hello SOW Unique,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally understand your frustration in this matter. Only thing we can do here at the forums is direct you to where to go and what you can do. If the suspensions are longer than one day you can fill out a case review and explain what has happened. At this
 point I would block the one who did this and not have any contact with him at all. Only suggesting this to help you in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Hope this helped and again sorry for the issue you are in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            The Winfast TV2000XP&nbsp;is an analogue card without hardware MPEG encoding so will not work with Windows Media Center.<br />
<br />
Withthe drivers from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leadtek.com/eng/support/download.asp?downlineid=190&amp;downline=WinFast+TV2000XP+Global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.leadtek.com/eng/support/download.asp?downlineid=190&amp;downline=WinFast+TV2000XP+Global</a> it should work with the Leadtek

<h3> jordan richardson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help with xbox live gold subscription</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I currently have a probably with my xbox live gold subscription. It has been past it due date for over a week now and I need some help with it. So, since I never payed my $59.99 xbox live gold subscription. It keeps saying that in order to change
 my subscription, I have to pay the $59.99 one. And since there isn't any other way for me to change the pay or pay it right now because since I'm only 15 and I don't have a credit card or any other payment method. But now that's happening, I can't buy the
 $1 1 month xbox live gold because I have to pay $59.99 on my other subscription. I was wanting to know a way on how I can reset or if anyone in microsoft can reset my current subscription because I don't have any money for that and I want to play online with
 other friends. I hope everyone can understand and help me get this fix as soon as possibly.</p>

            That is not possible, because you didnt deactivated the auto renew option, when the subscription ended you had been charged with the same amount that you bought or put the code. You can always try to chat with the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support

<p>Hi Juan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There several reasons which can cause the keyboard to stop working, one is due to a possible driver issue. To effectively assist you with your concern, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which <strong><em>Windows</em></strong> build version is running on your device? Type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search box and press <strong>Enter</strong> to help you identify.</li><li>Have you made any changes on your device prior to your concern?</li><li>Are there keys on your keyboard that are not working/malfunctioning? If not, is it not working at all?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps that you've performed to resolve your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<h2>            Mouse Lag Problem</h2>
                    I have been experiencing problems with my mouse. It lags at any given time and tends to freeze up. I have tried updating the drivers (There were updates but that didn't help), I have tried all of the USB Ports on my PC including USB 3.0. I had even done
 a clean boot but that didn't work. The mouse I use is A Logitech Anywhere MX mouse if that helps.

<h3> jonathanh556  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 very unreliable particularly after receiving updates&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many hours spent now troubleshooting many random issues with Windows 10 I felt a discussion might be the way to (1) ease my frustration and (2) if there are enough replies perhaps someone will take notice? (I am not holding out much hope on point 2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding Windows 10 generally unstable and as mentioned in the subject an update for me now is becoming more about discovering what stops working than new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some background I have 2 Windows 10 devices in my house right now. An HP Spectre x360 for my wife and a PC for my son. Neither were particularly cheap. Both are kept up to date, never logged on as an administrator and with the exception of Minecraft
 (which I think is Microsoft anyway) have very little installed outside of Microsoft products (Office 2016 being the main thing).... All very boring really :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to the problem. I am finding frequently on both computers "things" randomly stop working and this is becoming a very regular occurrence. I really don't have time to wade through and troubleshoot these random issues at the rate at which they occur. Appreciate
 examples are required so here are a couple over the last 48 hours:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop - Several occasions recently we have been unable to logon. Specifically, yesterday we got an error "Group Policy service failed to login etc etc..... RPC Server unavailable" (seen many hits on Google for this). Solutions include recreating your profile,
 deleting registry keys etc etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The question though is... WHY??? why do so many people have this problem and what causes it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case yesterday, a hard reboot fixed, but this has happened several times recently and in addition to this we have experienced lots of freezes as well as random black screens and several times updates have got stuck and never completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC - This is actually what wound me up this evening and prompted me to post. My son tried to use this today and mentioned when starting up he is waiting for it to do updates (which is quite common before the type of issue described in this post). Following
 this then the main issue for me was the screen time settings we have configured stopped working completely! He is supposed to get no more than an hour a day and also kicked off by 7pm at the latest. Granted a responsible parent should be keeping an eye on
 this but you do at least HOPE the technology works, kind of like having a backup if you do forget!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this, when we did eventually tell him to shut down, he mentioned clicking on the start button now does nothing so couldn't shut down (he is 9). I inspected this and confirmed this is the case, Click Start and Nothing!! I am sure someone will
 tell me killing explorer would of helped here but again... </p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY????? </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this, I happened to notice the pinned icons for his games and browsers (only IE and EDGE) had disappeared. Hovering where they should be revealed there is "something" there but not visible and indeed when I clicked on one of the empty spaces
 the Edge Browser opened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I half expect things will have settled down by tomorrow so no big deal right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, kind of, but I am posting anyway as this "Noddy" experience is becoming the norm now and I was wondering if anyone else is having these kinds of issues? I can cope with my son not being able to play Minecraft but when my wife has work to do and she
 start up her laptop in front of a room full of people to present for example its just not good enough.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't want to pin this post down to a single question as the experience is so random, it may well be something else tomorrow. My problem then is all of these types of issues added up, and the rate at which they occur prompts a more general question or
 comment on why is Windows 10 so flakey and do MS have any plans to understand and fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand things rarely work perfectly but I can honestly say Windows 7 and even 8 and 8.1 just see, better. Was Windows 10 released to soon - are you still building it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Jon</p>

            <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 in December and was pleased that most of the software and tweaks on my computer were relatively unaffected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However in mid-January and again in early February, my computer went off into 'La-La' land. In the first case, Microsoft Edge literally disappeared, the tablet area was no longer accessible, internet access slowed and then eventually stopped and I couldn't
 shut off the computer. This latter problem I managed to fix by going into the Task Manager and deleting what looked like six different internet sessions that had not been canceled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With some difficulty, I managed to navigate to the Control Panel and use the 'Recovery' option to go back to a previous restore point which seemed to restore the computer back to the way it was, though I got a message about "Files no longer being indexed".
 However, that doesn't seem to have affected things too much. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The second occurrence was less severe. But I solved it in the same manner. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a guess, but what I think may have happened is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of times&nbsp;when I started my computer, it seemed to start up and then do nothing for 5 - 10 minutes (i.e. Not even display the initial "start up" picture).&nbsp;As I've done in the past, I assumed the start up process had gotten hung up on something and
 re-booted the computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What may have been happening, however, is that one of those sneaky&nbsp;Windows 10 Updates was going on and by re-booting, I aborted the update process, leaving&nbsp;my computer in a jumbled state. Windows 10 does warn you that an update is going to happen when you
 shut down or when you start up. However for non-Microsoft&nbsp;software, I wonder if that happens all the time, or if&nbsp;the update just starts up with no warning?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm concerned these forced updates are a rather dangerous feature unless Windows 10 always lets you know they are taking place. And I have my doubts if that really is the case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: If I turn my computer on and it seems to be taking forever to start up, I am going to leave it alone and wait for the computer to boot or die of it's own accord, rather than risk interrupting an unannounced update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OMG, I HATE being an unpaid tester for Microsoft!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it would be nice if someone from Microsoft would comment on this.</p>

            <p>Agreed you have hit the nail on the head here.. We are basically unpaid testers. My honest opinion of the experience is things are generally less stable now than they used to be. My personal experience dates back to around Windows 95. Of course we all used
 to leave our front doors unlocked back then as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok I might be overdoing it a bit here, who could forget the good old BSOD, they seem to be largely a thing of the past. At least they were more predictable though, like you plug something in you shouldn't have or you install some really poor software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The kit I mention above is all Microsoft, all recommended settings, recommended updates are installed at the recommended times yet still clicking Save in Word 2016 is like rolling a dice sometimes, will it save or will word crash!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate being this negative but I guess I am unlikely to post if everything worked as expected all of the time. My point here is this is a paid for service and should be better in my opinion. Windows 10 is great, has some great features, great connectivity
 and collaboration tools all out of the box. If it was just more stable there really would be nothing to complain about. My Linux devices on the other hand seem to pull this one trick off pretty well?</p>

            <p>Even microsoft &nbsp;does not seem to be keeping up with Win 10. &nbsp;Their site quotes directories that don't exist.</p>
<p>I cannot even install my printer because &nbsp;Win 10 &nbsp;does not recognise it even though HP says it is Built In!</p>
<p>Cannot get vbs scripts to work due to missing ocx files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My compiler does only compile my software if I change the spelling of colour. &nbsp;This is because MS has used a compiler keyword in the latest &nbsp;version of 10.</p>
<p>What a mess.</p>

            <p>Remember - It's NOT your computer hardware that is at-fault; it's the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 20+ years of experience with Windows is that when a new version comes out, the old version becomes unreliable. It's happened with win95--&gt;XP, then XP--&gt;Vista, then Vista/win7 --&gt; Win8, and now that I have the free upgrade of win10 from win 8.1, it's getting
 flaky.</p>

</p><p>Latest problem as of April 2017 is that networking services randomly fail, and the only fix is to reboot. Sometimes it will work for a few minutes; sometimes several days. So once again, I'm bought a new computer; this time it was an Apple.&nbsp; Microsoft support
 was unable to diagnose or&nbsp;solve the problem; when I mentioned the widespread reports of problems with the recent security update, they did not acknowledge it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as far as the retired windows systems, I put Linux on them and they run great. I have a 15 year old PC that's still running Linux just fine. For those of you unfamiliar with Linux, it's available for free and is far, far more reliable than windows.
 Doesn't it seem odd that an OS available for free will run on old systems, but products that cost money conk-out&nbsp;when the next version is available ?&nbsp;I'm not going to actually
<strong><em>say&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;windows is being sabotaged to force people to buy an new release,&nbsp;but you know what I mean.</p>

<p>I have been in IT ever since 1963 so I can make a huge number of comments on what is going on. Having built a large number of applications with a Microsoft front end to a full mainframe backend, in most cases to a critical company backend, I have a pretty
 good idea what is going on. In some ways it is very difficult for Microsoft to keep Windows going because of the miriad of complex systems it interfaces with. There are two major requirements now and they are ( heavily simplified) a business requirement where
 you have local highly technical support to fix problems, and a very simple I want to do a bit of wordprocessing, surf the net, order materials etc. The two requirements are being serviced by one operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of reasons why this is difficult. Microsoft have to keep trained staff to deal with legacy and more&nbsp; complex interfaces and hardware, they need to keep these staff busy and productive otherwise they leave.&nbsp; The temptation is to keep them
 busy making changes nobody really wants. Most systems do what you want at present and don't need to be updated or more stupidly changed just for the sake of it. These are just a few of the reasons why Microsoft finds it difficult to keep going.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they could, I would have thought they would want to built a totally different version of Windows that is heavily simplfied and designed for Domestic use. They can keep on supporting the old Windows system for business users and not feel they have to keep
 on changing it to suit the current fashion or whim. Doing this would solve all sorts of problems like the number of Window Policy errors. I have suffered them on many occasions. (I suspect this is mainly because of the number of different versions of Windows
 i.e. Professional, Home, Server etc ) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 had a lot of errors at the beginning which is pretty much expected of a complex upgrade but I expected them to be fixed quicker than they were. Again probably because of the complex logic in Windows. The number of errors seemed to go down so I
 stayed with Microsoft. Nearly ditched them. Errors seem to be creeping in again and my wife has had a lot of issues lately. Latest one being not able to set the default browser. You could try and set it in Microsofts default activity to application window
 but it would not activate the changes. Coul be a third party problem but it would not happen if there was just a simple option to change app to match activity ( e.g. browsing) . This is just a case of over complication of a simple process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alternatives are MAC/UNIX etc. They have their problems as well. Mac is expensive, UNIX is not for the non IT literate. I know these facts having used all of them. All I can say is the skill to solve a problem mostly depends on your skills in finding
 a solution on the Internet. It is a matter of searching through the rubbish, getting information on the correct version of Windows, understanding a little about the problem you are dealing with before you try to fix it.

<p>One thing I did was to buy some 'clean-up' software from my virus-protection vendor (Avast) which 'fixed' a lot of the stupid things Microsoft embedded into the 'free' downloaded version of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer had it pre-installed, chances are the vendor may have fixed some of the very obviously stupid 'features', such as giving priority to background tasks, letting Microsoft use your computer to upload its system updates from your computer to
 other people's computers and allowing all sorts of applications (even ones you don't use) to communicate with the internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note also, I was dealing with an internet connection issue at the same time that resulted in me getting &lt; 1 MBS speed rather than the 7 MBS I was supposed to get, which greatly complicated figuring out what was going on!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect a lot of stuff Microsoft configured into Windows 10 was because they vaguely assumed everyone would be on an ultra-fast computer with an ultra-fast internet connection. For those people, all these inefficiencies probably wouldn't make much difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'd have a lot more tolerance for Windows 10 (And yes, when it is running, it is a nice operating system) if they'd put in a couple of scripts that allowed you to configure your computer to run on a less-powerful computer/internet connection, use
 to play computer games, etc. I'm sure there are people @ Microsoft who could have&nbsp;written these scripts without too much&nbsp;trouble. But--Alas!--that doesn't seem to have been their focus here. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sharing Computer internet with mobile phones on ad-hoc network</h2>
                    <p>Original title: <em>ad hoc network with internet sharing</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have 1 laptop at home and 2 mobile phones. My wireless router stopped working so&nbsp;I can only get internet access thru a wired connection to my laptop. I wanted to share the internet access from my laptop to the 2 mobile devices but I'm not sure how
 to do it. I tried creating an ad hoc network by following instructional videos online but they don't seem to work for me. I have a Samsung laptop running Windows 7 Professional. Any thoughts?

            <p>Hello Mann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manual ad hoc network configuration steps didn't really worked for me. I'm not really sure which part I missed. To my curiosity, I tried opening the link provided by Ramesh above and found some interesting stuff. I downloaded a software which is called
 the Virtual Router&nbsp;from this site - <a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/.</a> It actually worked for me and made my life so much easier. I just have one concern though, is this software totally harmless&nbsp;for my computer? I didn't get any refusal from Microsoft Security Essentials of any kind anyway.
 :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>
