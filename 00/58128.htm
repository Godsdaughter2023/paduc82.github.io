    <title>Windows 8.1 Laptop Unable to Detect Windows Wireless Display Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Laptop Unable to Detect Windows Wireless Display Adapter &#40;Miracast Dongle&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought the new Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-display-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-display-adapter</a>) to be able to project wirelessly my laptop
 to my TV. My laptop is very new -- it came with Windows 8.1 which is Miracast supported/enabled and runs Intel HD Graphics 4600 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970M with all the most recent drivers installed. When I try to connect to my TV with the adapter plugged
 in, I get the option to "Connect to a Wireless Display" which the official guide tells me is proof that my computer is Miracast supported (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/project-wireless-screen-miracast</a>)
 but when I try to find the display, it doesn't appear. I have tried restarting the computer after all the most recent drivers and Windows Updates have completed and plugging and unplugging the adapter but I am still unable to find the display. My Android phone,
 however, is able to find it instantly. My laptop and the display are currently within 5 meters of each other inside the same room so distance is definitely not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me figure out what the problem is??? I know that the Adapter is working and I know for sure that my laptop is meant to work with Miracast and the wireless adapter but it just can't find it. If it doesn't work, I may have to return the adapter
 and try something else.</p>

<h2>            Fresh paint app &#34;bing inspire me&#34; won&#39;t upload photo to canvas.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Everyone,</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance to anyone that may have answers for this. I have not seen any other posts with this exact problem, but I do see others having problems with photo apps. I have been trying to get fixes for fresh paint, but maybe I should be looking for updates
 in all my photo apps instead</p>
<p>I used to be able to just click on photo I wanted and Wha-La it went right to canvas. Have updated everything available but still not working. Is Microsoft even&nbsp;aware of this problem in Bing Inspire Me photos located inside of the fresh paint app&nbsp;? if so
 is anyone from Microsoft working on a fix? Everything else in fresh paint seems to be working just fine for me but the inspire me powered by bing&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have a program called <strong>Chromium</strong> on your PC and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
did not purposely install it</span>, then your computer is most likely infected with a browser hijacker.</p>
<p><strong>Chromium is a legitimate and open-source web browser</strong> project started by Google, to provide the source code for the proprietary Google Chrome browser. Unfortunately some browser hijackers will install it’s own customized Chromium browser
 to change the start page and search engine.</p>
<p>Browser hijackers are a type of malware created for the purpose of modifying Internet browser settings without the user’s knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Hi Slam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons why you've experienced data loss after the sudden PC reset. If you were able to choose Keep my files when your computer performed PC reset, you should still have your files saved on your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the your computer performed a complete reset, you might not be able to recover your files, however you can try the data recovery methods in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/835840/data-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.

<h3> dj.purity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unspecified error code 766f6c756d652e63 3f1 given after a check disk drive scan</h2>
                    
<p>After running Startup Repair successfully once, which took about 36 hours to complete, it said the problem had been repaired and Windows 7 (home 64-bit) should load normally after reboot. It did not and did another Startup Repair. This one took almost as
 long, around 28 hours. This also said that all problems were repaired and system should load normally.</p>
<p>I tried loading into safe mode. I tried other options. I tried debugging load. This is how I got to this error finally, which was after a failed chchdsk /f (I believe), with the error on my hard drive being unspecified with the error 766f6c756d652e63 3f1
 listed as whatever that means.</p>
<p>Could anyone tell me what the means?</p>
<p>I have also downloaded Ubuntu, loaded the image to a DVD, and have been able to boot into it and use my computer. This has scanned my hard drive and found that a disk failure is imminent (it states), but this could be either a hardware failure or a problem
 with the master boot record (I believe). I have NOT installed Ubuntu, and have kept my partitions and Windows 7 installation as is. The drive is unmountable. I am sure if I could get it to mount, I could access all my data and back it up before doing any further
 drastic fixes for my computer.</p>
<p>I just wonder, is there a surefire way to tell if an issue is hardware failure or software? I have been running Ubuntu all day and have had no crashes, errors, problems, or issues, period. Therefore I am not sure if because it isn't installed on the hard
 drive if that would even be a good indicator that my computer hardware is working and it's a problem with the MBR or partitions or something on that level in Windows.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to proceed?</p>

<p><span>Hi Dj.purity,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run chkdsk with the following switches /r /f from</span><span><span>Windows
 recovery enviornment (WINRE) and check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to boot the computer in WINRE mode and run chkdsk utility.</span></p>
<p><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Insert the Windows 7 installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer.
 You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<p><span>D.<span>&nbsp;</span>Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>E.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>F.<span>&nbsp;</span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>G.<span>&nbsp;</span>On the System Recovery Options menu, Select command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>H.<span>&nbsp;</span>Type the command<span>chkdsk /r /f C:&nbsp;and press enter</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows recovery enviornment (WINRE) is preinstalled option on your computer:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span>• If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need
 to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>• If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to
 repair, and then press and hold F8.</span></p>
<p><span>C.<span>&nbsp;</span>On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press
 ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>D.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select a keyboard layout, and then click next.</span></p>
<p><span>E.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select a user name and enter the password, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>F.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the System Recovery Options menu, Select command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>G.<span>&nbsp;</span>Type the command<span>chkdsk&nbsp;/r /f&nbsp; C: and press enter</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Once the check disk is complete, check if the issue is
 resolved</span></span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about Windows recovery options in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>strange bug- cant purchase unrated games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            strange bug- cant purchase unrated games</h2>
                    
<p>hello</p>
<p>i am having an issue wherby i cannot purchase any games that have not yet been rated such as forza horizon 3 and gears of war pre-orders. I keep getting the error "You need a parents permission" "you can purchase this game but youll need a parents approval
 to run or play it". I have held an adult account for 9 years never had issues with any purchasing from the store. I can buy, download and play any 18 rated games or any ither games for that matter that are "rated". I have been onto support several times and
 they keep saying that at there end it says i NO next to can view unrated content... i have tried all the steps to tey and resolve this wasting countless hours of time. content is set to unrestricted. all privacy setting are allowed/everybody etc. deleted and
 restored profile several times, factory reset xbox several times. no use. apparently theyv logged me a ticket for higher support but how can this just suddenly change in the first place? has anyone experienced anything similar? im at my wits end here just
 going round in circles trying to pre order forza 3 ultimate. I get the same error online xbox.com too and tells me to have a parent change my settings!! i am the parent with of 31 years of age with an adult account. I dont have family set up although i did
 have in the past but kids were removed as they never played much. any help or advice appreciated while i wait on the outcome of this raised ticket. cheers</p>

<p>To buy this, an adult needs to change your family settings at account.microsoft.com/family.</p>

            <p>Heya Mr Craigy D!</p>
<p>To check, when you set up your account did you ever have a second account that you may have directed as your parent account? If that's the case you may need to reach out to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us#4:0:4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone/Chat support</a> to take a peek into your account's current status. Let us know :)</p>

<p>I'm getting the same challenge, a few weeks ago I bought both Destiny Rise of Iron and BF1 Early Enlister Edition with no issues. Today I've tried to but the BF1 Premium Pass and:</p>

<p>I had also just purchased WWE 2K17 Pre-Order just days before this started happening.</p>
<p>It seems like a bug involving family settings or some sort, i dont have a family setup myself but i did have in the past maybe 6 months ago or so. It had 2 adults and 1 child.
</p>
<p>I just hope they sort it before 23rd september otherwise i will be missing out on the Forza Horizon 3 Ultimate Edition benefit of playing early.</p>

<h2>            Error in installation of both KB4025339 and KB4022715</h2>
                    <p>Dear all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been encountering with error in installation of all cumulative security updates since march, whose last ones are KB4025339 and KB4022715. I have also been continuously reading through other people's troubles and recognized that this is a common issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I complied with Microsoft advise in running Trouble Shooter Program as well as manual installation of updates from Microsoft website. However, neither of mentioned solutions were helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recognized that this is a common issue for windows user and so it is totally ridiculous that Microsoft is not able to solve this problem for the majority of windows users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During all unsuccessful automatic installations of aforementioned updates, CPU usage and fan's voice is intensively high, whose noise prevents me from focusing on my job while I am using my laptop. This has been chronically continuing for more than 4 months.
 Hence, I would appreciate if someone could help me with this issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>One of my first responses suggested running the update troubleshooter, and that solved my problem. The update is now installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to control panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>find troubleshooter and click on it</p>
<p>
</p><p>scroll down and find update troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>it probably won't find anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>run it again as administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>let it fix the things it finds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after I did this, mine installed just fine.</p>

            I have searched my control panel from top to bottom and can't find anything that suggests a "troubleshooter".....is this something I would have to install?&nbsp; If so, where do I find it and how hard is it to install?&nbsp; Seems we are going through lots of trouble
 just to "live with" all of Microsoft's shortcomings.&nbsp; I've used a windows product since 1995, but the problems everyone is having now is getting greater with each new system they "rush out".&nbsp; I'm about ready to try an Apple...thanks for trying to help me...I
 do appreciate YOUR efforts to correct Microsoft's shortcomings.

</p><p>Seems that not only none of the replies to this issue are for solving this problem but also an overwhelming majority of them are on confirming to have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, since the failure in installation of&nbsp;KB4025339 update is a common issue all around the world, I would appreciate whether Microsoft could issue a new update to solve this problem</p>

<h2>            Win7 32-bit to Win7 64-bit</h2>
                    Hello, I recently upgraded my computer from win xp 32-bit to win7. Now when I wanted to upgrade I wanted to go to Win7 64-bit, but when I went through the installation process I was not given the option to choose 32bit or 64bit. I checked and my computer
 is compatible with 64bit. I bought my win7 upgrade through the student discount, and I'm wondering if that did not come with the 64bit installation option? Is there a way to upgrade my 32bit win7 to win7 64bit using the upgrade I was given through the student
 upgrade?

<p>What you downloaded only has one bit type.</p>
<p>Downloaded Wrong Bit Level:</p>
<p>If you bought Windows from the Microsoft Store you can log back into your account and select the correct bit level to download, then download it.<br />
<br />
If you bought it from Digital River you will need to contact them and ask for the correct bit level - don't get your hopes up though, Digital River is known for very poor service and policies. If possible try not to ever buy anything from Digital River in the
 future.<br />
<br />
Digital River Support:<br />
1-877-244-8653 <br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
You'll need to use the correct bit install disk - 32 and 64bit come on a separate DVD/download. You can not install 64bit with a 32bit disk.<br />
<br />
You must completely reinstall Windows when switching bit types (32/64 bit). You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.<br />
<br />
Upgrading or simply switching between Windows 7 32/64 bit is not possible.<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You will need to first gain access to the&nbsp;<span>parental</span>&nbsp;account in order for you to be able to successfully agree to the terms and conditions. You won't be able to change the parental e-mail without being able to login to the prior e-mail
 that's listed. It's not possible to accept the terms and conditions on a child account without the parental information.<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;<span>parent</span>&nbsp;must agree to the new terms first and then you can login to your own account and accept them. If you don't have access to the&nbsp;<span>parental</span>&nbsp;account you will need to try to reset the password found&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
 If that doesn't work try to&nbsp;fill out the Microsoft Account Recovery form found&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you're unable to either of those things then you may be out of luck. You can try to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support</a></strong>&nbsp;and see if they are able to assist you in
 some way.<br />

</p><p>Everything is running fine with Skype and there is no current issues with accounts. If you are logged in with the correct account then your subscriptions must be showing on your
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account profile</a>. I must say that the account is still connected with your old email address, thus when you sign using your new email, you were routed to a different account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to recover your old account, I suggest you to open this <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
diagnostic link</a> and put your old&nbsp;email address (internet provider's email)&nbsp;on the box, then select
<strong>continue</strong>. It will show you the accounts connected with your email. If you will experience error on the diagnostic link, kindly refresh the page.</p>

                    I am attempting to install a driver for a device, however the driver is unsigned and I cannot get windows 8.1 to install it. I have attempted to restart and disable driver signature enforcement via the restart recovery settings, I have even gone so far
 as to run windows in test mode and still have not gotten a positive result. <br />
<br />
There are several devices I have that use unsigned drivers, I understand the risks involved however I need to use these devices.<br />

<h2>            Xbox live limitation does not allow you to use this feature - Madden</h2>
                    Hello - I am the adult xbox live gold member with a family account. I have attempted to provide my son with the ability to play MUT and online madden games but continue to receive the xbox live limitation error message. I believe I have set his privacy
 limitations to unrestricted. If he logs in under my account, he can play MUT and online games, but still can't from his own account. I appreciate any help. I have a paid xbox live gold family account (at least I think I do from about 14 months ago). He could
 play online via his xbox 360, but when we upgraded to the xbox one, the error messages re: limitations started. We are connected to no internet or connection issues. Any help would be greatly appreciated, especially from a 10y.o. That wants to play Madden
 with his buddies. Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>I don't how to explain this but i'll start with this. I got a problem with windows 10, or something else. Few months ago I thought my PC was infected with some sort virus that spams windows explorer.exe &amp; command prompt, turns out it was some sort program
 bug I think. I solved it by using the recovery setting &amp; debugging my PC. dag ago, plus present it happen again. only this time it happens when I click "yes" when a user access control pops up. The program bug spam is the same I had to deal with months ago,
 now almost every time when I click "yes" on user access control it trigger the spam somehow.<br />
</p>
<p>I need help please. I've search almost every site about this program bug spam situation but no one has posted about this problem that is happening to me!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Pardon my grammar, I never studied English grammar<br />

<br />
<br />First off, don’t apologize at all. Your grammar is just fine. 
<br />
<br />Secondly, I’ve never seen this issue before. Is there any chance you could send me a screenshot of the spam pop up that happens so I can try to diagnose what’s happening? 
<br />
<br />Thanks, and let me know!

            I honestly don’t know what could be causing it, but I would like to try a clean boot, and then go over a list of things we can do to clean up the system and see if it could help. 
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot. 
<br /> Click Start and type: msconfig - Select System Configuration;
<br />
<br />Click Services on System Configuration - Click and select Hide all Microsoft services  - Click Disable all
<br />
<br />Click Startup on System Configuration - Click Open Task Manager
<br />
<br />Select each startup item on Startup and click Disable - Close Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click OK on Startup tab of System Configuration - Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If this fixes your issue, you can then enable the services one(or a couple) at time, reboot, and see who the offender is.
<br />
<br />
<br />If not, let’s move on. 
<br />Navigate to the locations below. 
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\Temp - ctrl + a and delete the contents. 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\YOURACCOUNT\App Data\Local\Temp (If AppData doesn’t display, go into control panel, file explorer options, and make sure show hidden files / folders is checked off” 
<br />
<br />After this, Download and install Ccleaner - <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download</a>

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. 
<br />
<br />After installing, run the registry tool. Run the registry tool until there are no more fixes to be made. Once done, and no more fixes are there, reboot. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin, then type: 
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth (note the space before each "/") - and hit enter 
<br />
<br />Wait for that to finish, and move onto the next command. Type: 
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow (note the space between "sfc" and "/") - and hit enter 
<br />
<br />Let me know if any of these help!

            Hello,
<br />Looks like some corruption.
<br />Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.

<br />The best and the easiest way is to use first method in the first article.

<p>I'm afraid almost nothing that would work. I'v tried every repair program I thought off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the cmd was still corrupted, all attempts of trying repairing &amp; even way to use cmd without causing spam yet none worked.</p>
<p>So I think my only option is to boot, reinstall everything &amp; reconfigure windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully no one would experience this nightmare.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update changed user accounts and now I cannot log into my administrator account.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just completed the upgrade to Windows 10 and, despite the initially positive impression, was horrified to find that my administrator account had been deleted (I later found it) and replaced with a secondary account. I can only access my main account
 through a troublesome path - it does not even come up as an option when logging in - and want to change this.&nbsp; I have tried in the Settings to Add or Change Acounts, but that option is also unavailable. Finally, I tried to log in through my Microsoft/Outlook
 account, but was told that my password was wrong. What the hell is going on? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to: </p>
<p>1. Reactive my now hidden administrator account and use it to replace the one that has been made default by the upgrade?
</p>
<p>2. Why my Microsoft/Outlook password, which is unchanged, does not permit me to log in that way?
</p>
<p>3. How can I add an account - preferably an existing one (Does, and why would, Windows 10 only allow three users?) - even though that option is unavailable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the Microsoft Account FAQ is completely useless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CJBSavage</p>

            <p>Dear Vanessa:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your quick and helpful reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, to answer your questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I have tried to log onto my account (the previous admin that is now only available via another account) through Microsoft (Outlook to be exact), but have been unsuccessful. I will try to log in on the Welcome screen, but not being able to select the account
 I want might make it...hard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have tried everything that I can, but as the Windows 10 Update arbitrarily selected another secondary account as the new admin, I am having trouble accessing it. I don't know why they would do this - remove my past admin account (which was the one that
 I was logged into when the update started) and select another to be admin without a choice - but I am trying everything that I can think of, including trying to access through Microsoft Accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish me luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, as for the sign in problems with Microsoft Account, I will see what I can do through the diagnostic tool, but the names and passwords are not the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            System Machanic 6 detected that a file Advpack.dll was spyware on its Optimising Start Up deep procedure. However, Windows replaced it after it was deleted and I ran SM6 Pro again. This time it ignored the file.<br />
<br />
CONLUSION: Maybe there is a program that replaces the genuine Advpack.dll with a spyware dummy Trojan. Maybe in one of the free SP2 packs off the internet or through another program. There again it maybe a fault with Spyware detectors.<br />
<br />
As long as the file is replaced with Windows automatically then there's no real problem and we can thank God for great Spyware removal programs.
