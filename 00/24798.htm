<h2>            Outlook can&#39;t change default line spacing</h2>
                    Using Outlook 2010 Pro. &nbsp;I am trying to change the default line spacing in a new email. &nbsp;I go to format, change the line spacing after a paragraph to 0 px, then click set as default. &nbsp;It doesn't take effect in new emails! &nbsp;I have also tried changing styles
 to Outlook 2003 and set as default. &nbsp;I even changed my stationery and set as default. &nbsp;Nothing changes the default setting and the 14 px is back with each new email.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help! &nbsp;Thanks in advance!</div>

                    <p>My Lumia 730 has been facing charging slow issues ever since I have upgraded it to WM10. Before upgrade it had great battery backup of around 1.5 day of active usage. Now charges very slowly and discharges even quickly in couple of hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried hard reset but problem still persists.</p>

<p>Hi, did you just copy them over to the memory card? In that case, switch back message memory to C (phonememory) and delete all messages. Then switch back the message memory to memory card. This should do the trick!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can probably also gain a few megs back by clearing the browser cache and perhaps uninstall some third party apps from the phone memory and install them again on the memory card.</p>

<h2>            Omnia i910 - new samsung rom - Activesync 4.5 no longer accepts</h2>
                    I installed the new Rom CF03 from Verizon/Samsung.<br />
After which ActiveSync will no longer connect to the phone.<br />
<br />
I have un-installed/re-installed ActiveSync 4.5 on the pc (xp pro)<br />
<br />
I have deleted the pc from active sync on the phone.<br />
It will still not connect.<br />
<br />
Prior to the Rom update, it connected fine.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me with this?&nbsp; I need my calendar and contacts synchronized.<br />

            Well, I think I may have answered my own question.. took some finagling, but I removed the pc connection from Sync Menu on the phone.<br />
<br />
Renamed my device.<br />
<br />
Made sure enhanced services was unchecked.<br />
<br />
plugged into the cable and forced ActiveSync to recognize it as a whole new device.<br />
It took a while to re-sync every thing back over, but it seems to be connecting now when I disconnect, add appointments and reconnect.&nbsp; (knock on wood it continues)<br />
<br />
I imagine I will have to do the same steps on my home pc as well.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say Office 365 documents, are you referring to the Office 365 desktop program or the new office universal preview apps in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Office 365 desktop version (if you have an Office 365 subscription), I suggest you to post your queries in the Office 365 forums as given below.</p>

</p><p>In Skype for Windows 10, you will be automatically signed in if you will not sign out of your account before closing the application. If you don't want to be automatically signed in when opening Skype, you need to sign out&nbsp;always before closing the application.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I some time ago managed to turn the sound off for games on my Nokia E71&nbsp; - because it was really loud and there does not seem to be a volume button accessible during play that allows you to modify the volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How do I turn it back on? I have tried tones settings / personalisation etc etc, but can't find setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How can I change the sound level in game once I have got this back on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help ! !</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And shouldn't your game ask you if you want to enable sounds when you launch it? that should overide your tone settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the volume, doesn't the volume buttons on the side of the e71 work during the game. if not try fn + dpad up.</p>

<h3> nielshuneker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wacom tablet functions differently</h2>
                    <p>Since the latest update from Windows my Wacom tablet&nbsp;functions differently in WORD and Excel. It's now seems to be a drawing tool. I can draw, erase en highlight. Very nice, if this would have been a tablet computer or a laptop... but I have a desktop computer
 and I used the Wacom pen to select text and replace the cursor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My normal mouse does not have this new function. But I never use my mouse.&nbsp;I'm a designer and photographer. I did everything with my pen on my Wacom tablet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this new features, but I want the old functions back. I'm sure it's very usefull on tablets and laptops, but if I want to draw something on my desktop I use Adobe Illustrator ( no offense ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help me to reset the old functions. Or to switch the functions with my mouse, so that I can use my Wacom pen and tablet the old way. That could work for me too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            powerpoint 2016 says destination location is no longer available</h2>
                    <p>when selecting create video it has you save it and it is in the folder with 0 bytes I guess cuz it's processing as it takes time for that media. Also I learned to save as .wmv but it does the same thing. I keep looking for answers around and have narrowed
 it down to exporting to create a video and HELP explains all that, and then saving as a .wmv.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the long process of creating video or either saving as .wmv ERROR MESSAGE: could not be uploaded because destination location is no longer available. Do you want to save in another location. Then I say yes it takes me to a save window where I retype
 the filename and choose extension. Then ERROR MESSAGE: an error occured while PowerPoint was saving the file. Then the only option is OK then it's over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't figure out what happened to the first location it had me save in first. I haven't found anyone with this problem exactly so maybe something in my system isn't enabled.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d21285e-be21-4631-9e94-ac5d52b86a85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d21285e-be21-4631-9e94-ac5d52b86a85" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a5a2ee3-0b43-437e-ae93-f9db4afeae04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a5a2ee3-0b43-437e-ae93-f9db4afeae04" /></a></p>

<h3> fat kitty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2007 activation code ok, but conversion loops</h2>
                    
<p>I have successfully converted trial versions of some Microsoft Office 2007 products (Word, Powerpoint, OneNote and Excel) using the activation key, however when I go to use this key on Outlook it accepts the key initially and downloads something - but then
 says to restart the computer - when I do this and try to access the program again it hasn't activated the product and just loops back through the whole process again.</p>
<p>I looked at the Microsoft website and tried one of their download solutions, however it didn't work and inactivated one of my other products which i had to then reactivate.</p>
<p>I don't understand why it is happening to Outlook (also happens to Access - though I don't need to use this). I do wish to use Outlook if I can... I'm also not sure if it is possible to have purchased a key for certain products only...?</p>
<p>Any suggestions appreciated :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1511 10586 Windows Defender Full Scan is Very Slow</h2>
                    I am running Windows Defender Full Scan for the first time on my laptop.&nbsp; I have 88GB of files on a 136GB C: Drive.&nbsp; There are 228,997 files in 119,530 directories.&nbsp; When the laptop was Windows 7, there were only 146,000 files.&nbsp; Perhaps Windows 10 has
 more system files?&nbsp; Anyway, the scan has been running for 45 hours and it has scanned 568,000 items.&nbsp; The status bar is about 25% complete.&nbsp; There are no peripheral disks attached.&nbsp; At this pace I'm estimating another 1,704,000 items and another 135 hours
 to complete the scan.&nbsp; Is this normal?

            <p>Yes - cause it depends on what you are scanning.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Full Scan runs a scan across the entire files on each drive.&nbsp; So if you have any ISO's or large ZIP/CABs it will go into each one and scan those too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running a full scan isn't a bad idea, but you may just want to run a custom scan cross just the system drive (this is usually c:\) to build up the Windows Defender cache.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is the first time you are running a full scan on the system, you are building your cache, so each file gets a check before added to the cache.&nbsp; On the next scan (same goes for Quick Scan) it will be faster since it will know which files to rescan
 vs trust since its in the cache. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Some array concepts...<br />
<br />
ShtArray1(3, 50) is an array with <strong>4</strong> rows and <strong>51</strong> columns.<br />
Arrays are zero based unless you specify otherwise.&nbsp; <br />
So you are actually sizing the arrary as ShtArray1( 0 to 3, 0 to 50)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,<br />
Range ("A1:C50) has <strong>50</strong> rows and <strong>3</strong> columns. and will not fit in your array.<br />
Using a Variant variable to contain a set of range values is usually a better option...<br />
&nbsp; Dim arrSht as Variant</p>
<p>&nbsp; arrSht = Range ("A1:C50).Value<br />
&nbsp;'the above creates a 2 dimensional array (1 to 50, 1 to 3) containing the range values.<br />
&nbsp; So arrSht(3, 2) contains the value in cell B3 <br />
<br />
In addition,<br />
A 3 (or more) dimensional array (2, 3, 50) is a difficult concept for most (it is not whatever you think it is), and is usually not needed.<br />

            I do use Option Base 1 for the variant arrays. I want to use a single loop to populate the 2 2-dimensional arrays. Currently I have to use an 'If' statement to identify which of the 2-dimensial arrays to populate. If I can incorporate the 2 2-dimensional
 arrays into a single 3-dimensional array, the code can become faster and more compact...

Re:&nbsp; "If I can incorporate the 2 2-dimensional arrays into a single 3-dimensional array"<br />
<br />
You can change the size of the last dimension (only) of an array.&nbsp; Perhaps that is what you are referring to...<br />
'Setup array size...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim arr() as Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ReDim arr(1 to 100, 1 to 3)<br />
</p>
<p>'Resize/change array by adding 2 columns...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ReDim Preserve arr(1 to 100, 1 to 5)<br />
'The above requires a 'dynamic' array - one created using the ReDim statement.<br />
'An array established using a fixed size - "Dim arr(1 to 100, 1 to 3)" - cannot be changed.<br />
'---&nbsp; <br />
<br />
'There are other limitations involved, check the Excel help file under "Declaring Arrays" and "Using Arrays".<br />
'Obviously, one can just create a large array, to start with, that is big enough to contain all of the data.<br />
'---<br />
<br />
'FWIW, an individual row or column of an array can be returned using the Excel Worksheet Function "Index".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim arr1 as Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; arr1 = Application.Index(Arr, 0, 1) 'returns 1st column of arr.<br />
'---<br />
<br />
Posting your code and before/after examples will be necessary if you want me to stop guessing.<br />

            <p>I realize that I don't need a 2-dimensional array to gather data from a range. However, the total application that I have written is comparing the data in each column in each row of the 2 worksheets to see if rows are missing so I need to use in-memory arrays
 to compare the data instead of comparing cells directly in the worksheets to save enormous amounts of time on extremely large worksheets. I simply want to know if it is possible to move a worksheet to a 3-dimensional array, where the 1st dimension is the worksheet
 number, with a single statement instead of stepping through each row/column, as I can do with a 2-dimensional array as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Option Base 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim&nbsp;ShtArray(1000,20) as Variant</p>

                    <div>
<div>
<p>My company has shifted from a POP to an exchange account. I telecommute, working out of my home studio. When I attempted to set up the exchange account on my Mac (OSX 10.8.5) I repeatedly got "account can't be added. Outlook 2011 requires exchange server
 2007 spi update rollup 4 or later." I am running the 14.3.8 version of Outlook for Mac 2011.</p>
<p>None of my colleagues have experienced this issue in the workplace. I have tried setting it up with VPN open and with it closed. I am considering waving a chicken over my head or howling at the moon if that would help. I am entering all of the information
 correctly as evidenced by my success with setting up the account on my i-phone and webmail.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            The message is referring to the version of email server you’re using.
<div><br />
<div>I suspect your server is Exchange 2003 (unsupported by Outlook for Mac) and that your colleagues are not using Outlook for Mac but rather Outlook for Windows or a different application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you log in to your account using webmail (Outlook Web Access) you should be able to view Options or Help and determine what version of Exchange you’re using.</div>

<p>Hi UIrich,</p>
<p>Could you follow the steps in the article below to troubleshoot OneDrive for Business sync issues?<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-problems-E12C6A8B-4BBE-4391-9C23-1A52B55A1967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix OneDrive for Business sync problems</a></p>
<p>If the issue persists, you may try to use the Fix it tool in the following KB to remove the OneDrive for Business cache to see the outcome. This tool requires you to resync all data that you synced previously to OneDrive for Business.<br />

<h3> gw reeves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Home &#38; Student 2013 reinstall after uninstall</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have problem with Office Home &amp; Student 2013, purchased and installed via a Product Key, on a PC with Windows 8.1 OS, in end July.</p>
<p>Everything was OK until about a week ago, when suddenly I could not print anything from Excel or Word, to any external printer or any program like Cute pdf Writer. Troubleshoots and fixes did nothing so finally I did a restore to OS setup about 2 weeks earlier.
 Fixed the printing problem however Excel and Word were not displaying and working correctly so I did repair to Office via troubleshooter and Control Panel "change " option. Excel&nbsp;and Word (and Powerpoint) then worked fine except kept insisting needed to be
 validated before 6 Oct and kept throwing up a validation menu asking me to validate via Microsoft Account. However MA kept saying my account was not linked to Office. I tried to validate via Product Key and got same message. This happened every time I opened
 program or file. As of 7 Oct Word and Excel opened as unlicensed programs, with many functions not accessible. After trying every troubleshoot and repair option and another restore to about 1 or 2 weeks earlier OS setup, and no change to Excel or Word, I uninstalled
 Office H&amp;S 2013 on the promise on the Product Key package that if I needed to download again I could visit www.office.com/myaccount.</p>
<p>My Account again says Office is not associated with this account. I've tried with Product Key and everything I can think of, with no success. I now have no Office at all, only reading Word files via WordPad.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can restore my $169 Office H&amp;S 2013 without having to purchase again and start completely again with a new Product Key?</p>
<p>Gary</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I purchased MS Office Home &amp; Student 2013 from a office goods retailer as a gift card to be activated by going to
<a href="http://www.office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/setup</a> and entering the Product Key. Definitely not an Office trial. Office worked fine for 7-8 weeks before the problems as outlined.</p>
<p>Yes I read instructions that say if have already activated Office to logout and login again with Microsoft Account used to&nbsp;activate Office. I only have one Microsoft Account. However I had changed my email address since installing Office and opening Microsoft
 Account. Not changed my cell phone number for the account. When I log on to Microsoft Account with current email address or with cell phone number Microsoft Account opens however says Office is not associated with account. I tried logging in with old email
 address however cannot log in as get message that there is no Microsoft Account. Tried every combination of current and previous email addresses and current and previous passwords without success.</p>
<p>I have retailer receipt for the MS Office gift card. On receipt is usual info plus a 10 digit "Touch ID".</p>
<p>I can't remember if I received phone SMS message or email from MS during Office installation. In any case I don't have copy on file (in either my old email address mail or my new email address mail).</p>

    <title>Word 2016 Mac 16.13 spontaneously and randomly seems to delete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradfordsherman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 Mac 16.13 spontaneously and randomly seems to delete MathType 7 equations</h2>
                    <p>I have been tasked with ensuring equations in a document comply with an existing (from 12 years ago) format. I must use MathType equations using Times New Roman and Symbol fonts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied Eq Editor 3 equations to a new document and then used MathType 7 to convert them to MathType with the correct fonts. I did this originally in Word 2011 using MathType 6.9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the new MT equations into the clipboard and then pasted them in over the old equations. So far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I update Word to Word 2016. Big mistake. Unfamiliar interface for no productivity benefit and my equations have started to delete themselves - seemingly at random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade the eqs intially looked fine on screen. I saved and closed the document. When I reopened the document many of the equations deleted themselves (as shown in the track changes information). Generally I can reject the change and the equation
 reappears in the correct place. But next time I open the document it has deleted itself again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening? I have a tight deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to preserve comments while accepting all changes so that the entire change history can be forgotten? I've got a feeling the problem is tied up with field codes for Eq numbering (all equations have to appear in frames as 'display' equations)
 and the change history apparatus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only I could rip out all the track changes nonsense and get back to the absolute most basic document plus some important review comments, I have a feeling things would work again.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>MathType is currently at version 7.1.0 for the Mac and Word 2016 appears to be supported. This was released last month by WIRIS. I'm not sure what the deal is regarding Design Science MathType 6.7 and WIRIS MathType 7 other than the fact that v 7 is an annual
 subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I experienced (auto deleting equations) seemed to have been fixed by deleting all of the changes and comments that had been tracked and then saving this 'clean' version of the document. So I'm going to call it a Word problem more than a MathType
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, it seems to work OK with Word 2016 16.13.</p>

    <title>Sorting in Linked Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewwilliams_783  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting in Linked Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting to grips with (and liking) 7.5. Having now linked three of my email accounts into one inbox, I have an issue that when looking at "all" emails, they seem to sort by email account and then by date. This means that newer emails arriving at different
 accounts appear well down the list, and effectively can only be found by searching for them, which is very counter-intuitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd much rather see these in pure chronological order, but can't see any way to do this, or any references to it on the help pages. I'm on the brink of having to unlink my inboxes, so that my&nbsp;recent mails don't get "lost" offscreen. Naturally, when they
 first come in the unread tab is a little easier to work with, but it still isn't ideal - and also once read, the emails then get relegated down the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or tips much appreciated!</p>

            I'm having this exact problem. I have three inboxes linked together. Two have never integrated -as the original poster said, all the emails from a given day show up at the top of the list (regardless of whether they have been read), then all the emails
 from the other account are below them.<br />
<br />
Weirdly, I added a third account today, and emails from that are interspersed just fine with those from what used to be the "top" account. I have tried unlinking and re-linking my inboxes, but it doesn't help. It makes life difficult because these are my three
 work accounts, and I need to see all of my latest emails at the top of the list. At the moment, I have to flick to "Unread" to achieve this, which is just weird.<br />
<br />

            Update: mine seems to be behaving better now, though I'm not quite sure how or why. My best guess is that once some time had passed and my old emails had dropped out of the back end, and the ones in my linked inbox had all arrived after linking, then they
 seemed to work. i.e. at the point of linking the boxes, it somehow assumed that "old" hotmail mails were newer than they actually were. However, all newly arriving mails are treated correctly (hence the unread working).
<div><br />
<div>So, I could be completely wrong, but try a combination of being patient and cleansing your history. Unfortunately, as I can't replicate the problem, I can't test the solution. But I'm sure Microsoft and others would be interested if someone confirmed my
 suspicions.&nbsp;</div>

            This is an odd problem, because my linked inbox shows email in chronological order, regardless of account. If your mailbox is set to not sync email older than a certain date, let that date pass. Link and unlink the boxes.

            <p>I have exactly the same problem. I have two accounts linked, one is Hotmail account (through in usmej.se domain), one is IMAP account. Messages from IMAP account are all listed below the messages from Hotmail account (even the new incomming ones). This only
 afects "all" tab, "unread" tab has correct order. I have OS version 7.10.8107.79.</p>
<p>I was able to find the cause of this problem. It was message in my IMAP account (the one ordered wrong at the end of the list). I found this by moving messages in my IMAP account to different folder and back using Outlook. The message causing this problem
 contains 49 images (50kB each) with long subject (subject contains names of all images, so cca 700 characters long).</p>
<p>This message is NOT listed in the list of messages in the linked inbox. It does not show up.</p>
<p>When I move this message out of my inbox folder in Outlook and sync my WP7, messages in linked inbox are ordered correctly. When I move the message back to inbox folder&nbsp;and sync WP7, messages in linked inbox are ordered incorrectly.</p>
<p>So if you have this problem, try to find message with many attachments&nbsp;or long subject&nbsp;in the account, which is ordered incorrectly. You must find this message using web or Outlook, becouse it will not show up in your WP7. Then delete it.</p>

<div><br />
<div>I checked my IMAP account for any emails with especially long headers as suggested, but I couldn't find any. I don't think that's the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did, however, have several emails with multiple images and/or attachments. I simply searched my Gmail account for all "Read" messages that had attachments, and archived them all (i.e. moved them to another folder). I then resynced the linked inbox, and
 voila, messages sort in the "All" tab as they should.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea which message was causing the problem, other than that it was one (or more) with the characteristics I have outlined here. I simply had too many emails with attachments in my inbox to go through them all individually. It looks like there
 is some bug with large and/or multiple attachments that is causing the sorting issue. I will gladly share any and all information with the Windows Phone devs if it helps sort out this annoying (and weird) issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again, Martin. Nice find! This has been bugging me for a year!</div>

            <p>Unfortunately, this did not work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually thought that my Hotmail was not showing up in this inbox at all, but you were correct; it was simply being sent to the bottom.&nbsp; However, my Yahoo! email and Gmail accounts were both showing up at the top, combined and sorted by date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried removing all the emails with larger attachments or long subjects out of my inbox, but it didn't work.&nbsp; Then I tried removing all of the emails with attachments.&nbsp; Then I tried marking all emails as unread.&nbsp; Finally, I moved all of the files in my
 Inbox into a temporary folder so that my inbox was completely empty.&nbsp; Guess what... Still not working!&nbsp; I tried unlinking just the Yahoo email account and then just the Gmail account, but still pushing the Hotmail emails to the bottom of the list.&nbsp; I archived
 all of my Gmail emails and moved all of my Yahoo emails into a temporary folder, but again, no success.&nbsp; So, all three inboxes were empty except for any new emails I sent to myself as a test.&nbsp; Yahoo! and Gmail accounts are sorting properly, but my Hotmail
 account is still at the bottom, no matter what I do.&nbsp; My only solution at this point is to keep my Hotmail account completely separate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should note that this feature was working just fine on my phone for a very long time.&nbsp; It must have been only a few months ago at most that it suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; I mean suddenly.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary happened that I can recall, it was just
 working and then it wasn't, and hasn't since.&nbsp; If the linked inbox is open when a new email comes in, it will be at the top (but not the rest).&nbsp; But as soon as I close the inbox and open it again, viola - it's moved down with the rest of the Hotmail emails.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using an LG Optimus Quantum (C-900K), with Windows Phone version 7.10.8773.98, and my "Hotmail" account is an @live.ca address.&nbsp; Hope this can get worked out...</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I was hoping for help here but...Here is how I'm&nbsp;working around this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<p>When this happens, the error you reported shows in a rectangle&nbsp;where the image should be.&nbsp; The&nbsp;rectangle has the same name as the Picture.&nbsp; Pictures are shape type 13.&nbsp; Rectangles are shape type 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Find all Shapes of Type 11 and replace with the original picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fix</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how to "Change Picture" through VBA.&nbsp; Research came up empty.&nbsp; But we can delete the shape and reload the Picture.&nbsp; Here is a sample:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp;ActiveSheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .Shapes("Logo").Type = 11 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With .Shapes("Logo")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h = .Height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w = .Width<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t = .Top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l = .Left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With .Pictures.Insert(ThisWorkbook.Path &amp; "\Logo.gif")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Name = "Logo"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Height = h<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Width = w<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Top = t<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Left = l<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, of course, assumes the image is in the same directory as the workbook which may, or may not be your situation and will probably not be the situation when the workbook is emailed (sorry).</p>

<h2>            Why does Outlook indexing take a long time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2010; items that are clearly in my Outlook but when i perform a search it does not find it. &nbsp;Ive already reset indexing by rebuilding my instant search catalog which took quite some time and it started working again but a week later it stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what causes this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook can sometime take a long time to index is this due to the amount of email i have?</p>

            <p>Hello Lorenzo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a big possibility, it's because of the amount of your e-mail. To resolve the slow performance, we suggest resetting your indexing. You may follow the steps on this

 exept ngage, i now have two icons one for the preview and one for the full version, the priview one works fine, the full one does not do anything, have tried to remove it but that fails, have tried to install new full version but handset says file missing,
 the tempory one does not give the option to remove. does anyone know how i can get my ngage working again please<br />
Thanks Paul<br />

            Other than a hard reset this is an odd problem to solve, even after the reset and restore the error could happen again.<br />
<br />
Have you checked the official n-gage forum for a solution? <a href="http://forums.arena.n-gage.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.arena.n-gage.com</a><br />
<br />
It may still be worth trying the reset, everything will be wiped again but the restore may work properly this time.<br />
<br />
Hard reset:<br />
<br />
1. Switch off the phone.<br />
<br />
2. Hold down the following three buttons: Green (the call answer button), * button, and '3' button.<br />
<br />
3. While holding these buttons, press the power button and switch on the phone.<br />
<br />
4. Release when the phone shows the nokia logo or shows other signs of life like the language selection screen.

            I agree with psycho.<br />
<br />
You might also want to consider re-installing the firmware in the phone. It's a long shot but you never know.<br />
<br />
If the hard reset and the firmware re-install don't work, it would lead me to believe that the problem is either with the n-gage software or with the backup that was made originally.

            Solved it, what i done was a firm upgrade again, then installed the full version of ngage then done the restore from content copier on pc suite and all is now working as should be, even my game was savedfrom where i left it, thanks for the suggestions.<br />

<h2>            attachments lost when accept meeting invite</h2>
                    <p>A client sent me a meeting invite with some attachments.</p>
<p>I accepted the invite and the meeting appears in outlook. But the attachments are not there.</p>
<p>Accepting the invite deleted the invitation from the mail server, and there seems to be no way to access the attachments now.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
