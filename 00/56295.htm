<h2>            Snipping Tool and Command Prompt not opening</h2>
                    <p>I tried to open snipping tool and command center, but they won't open. I tried googling but most people's Snipping Tool has an error message whilst mine does not. Also can't open Command Prompt so most people's option about running sfc/scannow is out.
</p>
<p>So far it seems like only 2 those are affected, other externally downloaded apps work just fine.&nbsp;<br />

            I suggest you try performing a repair upgrade to fix it:

    <title>Warmer&#47;Yellow Tint Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendallshowalter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Warmer&#47;Yellow Tint Windows 10</h2>
                    I just started using this brand new Windows 10 Dell laptop, but when I compare it to my previous laptop, it has a warmer/yellowish tint to it. I screenshoted a picture of my screen, sending it to my phone, and the color looked normal, so it's definitely
 a problem with the laptop display. It reminds me of Apple's "nightshift" setting where it removes the blue light from your phone at night. I've played around with some color management settings but nothing seems to fix it. As someone who works with graphic
 design, and photoshop having the precise color is highly important. Any recommendations or tips on how to fix this are highly appreciated! Thank you!

<br />Apparently it is an issue if you don't have IE as your default browser.

<h2>            bluetooth keyboard pairs but doesn&#39;t stay connected</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already wasted two days of my life trying to figure this out alone so am done with scouring forums and trying to decipher answers that don't make sense. I have a Windows 10 tablet and a fairly generic Bluetooth&nbsp;keyboard off the&nbsp;internet. Using the device
 and Windows instructions I can pair the devices fine (inputting a passkey) but it quickly disconnects, not allowing me to type anything. After the last day of hair pulling and attempting to check settings\update the drivers it miraculously started working
 but after 4 days of joy I'm back to square one (it might've been when both devices had a full recharge). Ive tried everything I did before and it won't stay connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard works perfectly with my ancient Mac and my Samsung phone. The tablet connects without interruption to my Bluetooth radio, but they don't seem to like each other very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes I've uninstalled, reinstalled, unpaired, repaired, disconnected, connected&nbsp;and turned everything off and on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be gratefully received, life is far too short for this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Grace</p>

    <title>renaming folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobtrotterripley  say:</h3>
<h2>            renaming folders</h2>
                    <p>I hate that Windows 10 keeps renaming a couple of folders or changes the icons I pick out for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a folder named simply "b", a shorthand name for a certain category of downstream folders and files I have in that top folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every once in awhile, 10 decides to rename the folder to "Documents".&nbsp; If I wanted it named "documents" I would name it so, but I want it named "b", and having to change it after Windows renames it is VERY frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Renaming it to "documents" could cause major problems for me, including freaking me out that the "b" folder has been trashed, which is what I thought the first time it happened.&nbsp; It contains years of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to stop Windows from renaming my folder(s) or changing the icons I pick for my folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your prompt attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not a new folder; it's one I've had way back as far as Windows 98, and perhaps 3.1, but that I cannot remember.&nbsp; And I think I used that under W2K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This folder is on the D: drive, so it's not on the desktop, nor on OneDrive.&nbsp; It is in the "This PC" listing, but only when I navigate to D:/b.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only folder I've noticed which has been changed more than once.&nbsp; I believe another was, but can't recall which one.&nbsp; However, the folder icon problem does happen to more than one folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This had never happened until I got Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't happen every day.&nbsp; Just occasionally, so I cannot track it down to some other event.</p>

<h2>            How can I get the Start Menu to work again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I know this question has been asked a lot but all of the questions and answers have been from earlier this year. &nbsp;I have tried some of the solutions that have been posted and haven't had them work yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the icon for the Start Menu and the key on the keyboard don't work. &nbsp;In addition I am also missing some icons from the bottom taskbar. &nbsp;This problem has started on the morning of December 29th. &nbsp;I should also add that when I went to start the
 computer it was still on and it did not turn off despite the fact that I did click on power off. &nbsp;Not only did I click on Power Off but the screen said powering down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do. &nbsp;It seems like there are a couple of other issues that haven't been mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>added text: &nbsp;The search box doesn't work either.</p>

            I tried the solutions that were listed and they did not work. &nbsp;The link brought me to a site for Windows 8. &nbsp;I went into my Settings and clicked on Check for Updates. &nbsp;It said I was up to date. &nbsp;My account is the only active account on the computer. &nbsp;I
 copy and pasted the words and symbols for Powershell after the prompt. &nbsp;I did open it as an administrator. &nbsp;After I pasted the words and symbols after the C prompt I hit enter. &nbsp;All it did was to bring up another C prompt. &nbsp;No actions of any kind took place.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to restart the computer in safe mode:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Ever since the update my start menu and the Windows key that brings up the Start Menu doesn't work. &nbsp;I can't open the Notification Center and some icons are missing on the bottom bar. &nbsp;I even tried restoring to an earlier restore point and that
 hasn't worked either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access 99 percent of my programs and apps. &nbsp;The only things I can use is whatever shortcuts I have on my desktop or through the file explorer. &nbsp;I'm only able to use that because it is one of the few icons left on the bottom bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is the update to fix the update coming out? &nbsp;I'd rather have a way to uninstall the update and let my anti-virus software take care of Ado</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to create new user account and check if it helps:<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If it is working, then I would&nbsp;suggest you to transfer the files/folders from one account to another account by copying files and pasting. You may follow the steps below for the same.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use Windows Explorer to navigate to C:\Users to the account you want to COPY.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right Click on the Folders (and/or files) and COPY <br />
3.&nbsp;Go to the other account and PASTE where you want to put them.<br />
4.&nbsp;Repeat as needed.<br />

            <p>I'm unable to make a new account. &nbsp;I can get to the settings option because I had made a shortcut to my toolbar for the file explorer last year. &nbsp;It takes minutes for the Settings screen to load. &nbsp;I tried to open the accounts screen per the directions on
 the link. &nbsp;I can get to the page that allows you to add a family member or other uses. &nbsp;When I try to open either option the computer will not respond. &nbsp;Neither option will load, you don't even get an error screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now at a loss on what to do with this problem. &nbsp;No suggestion provided has worked. &nbsp;I can only access the internet and a couple of other things that I have shortcuts for on my desktop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time of this writing I have had this problem for 10 days (since December 29th). &nbsp;Until now I have had no problems with Windows 10 and have liked most of the changes. &nbsp;However, I am now past frustrated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
<span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>What is the Operating System currently installed on your computer?</span></span></span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span><span><span>How exactly are you trying to load the
</span></span><span>'Mass storage controller' drivers?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Here are a couple of things you can try if the
</span></span><span>Stop 0x0000007E error messages occur when you try to install Windows Vista:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Warning: This workaround may make a computer or a network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or
 by malicious software such as viruses. We do not recommend this workaround but are providing this information so that you can implement this workaround at your own discretion. Use this workaround at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Restart the computer</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Use the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor to check for known issues.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Disconnect any external hardware devices that are connected to the
 computer. Additionally, remove or disconnect any hardware that the computer manufacturer does not support. Also, remove any hardware that you recently installed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. If you receive either of these error messages during the first phase
 of the upgrade installation, follow these additional steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In the previous operating system, update any installed antivirus and
 antispyware programs, and then scan the computer for problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: If you find any problems, we recommend that you perform a clean
 installation of Windows Vista.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After you scan the computer for viruses and spyware, in the previous
 operating system, uninstall any antivirus and antispyware programs.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Contact the computer manufacturer for information about any known Windows
 Vista compatibility issues and about how to obtain and to install a BIOS update.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Try to upgrade to Windows Vista again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Method 2: Here is an article that will give you more information about
 this issue: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I have also checked the specification of the ‘</span></span><span>HP

<h2>            Drag and Drop to CMD interface not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have windows 8.1 x64 and I needed Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened it and I needed a file as parameter for a command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, I could just drag and drop the file into cmd interface and</p>
<p>the full path to it would be displayed, saving me time to type it manually</p>
<p>for the main command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it doesn't work. I drag&amp;drop the file and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you help me solve this or give me some directions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>After about 9-months of basically normal operation, Win 7 is suddenly taking 10- to 15- minutes to get up and running. At the same time this happened, Norton Security announced that its virus definitions had become corrupted, and I should download
 them fresh, through the upgrade function; I did that, and Norton is running fine now, but Windows continues to have the slow startup problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I should mention, from the beginning, when I first installed Win 7 (over Vista,) Win 7 has been unable to perform the System Restore function. Several times I have tried to restore the system back a day or two, but
 it has always failed to complete successfully. When this slow startup problem began, I ran the Startuo Repair program; it asked if I would like to restore the system to an earlier time, but it also failed to complete. Startup Repair says simply, it cannot
 automatically do the repair.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>One other thing: occasionally, at startup, I get a notice that says, "You may be using an unauthorized version of Windows- click here to get the authentic version." I've always ignored this message, because first,
 I don't see how I can have a bogus version of Win 7, since I bought it it from a reputable store, and second, I'm concerned this message may be a scam of some sort, possibly malware that got installed on my PC, so I'm reluctant to click on it.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Any ideas? I'm wondering if Win 7 installed properly. If I wanted to reinstall it, do I have to remove Win 7 first? Or can I reinstall it over the old one? All help is appreciated.</span></strong></p>

<div>Save your important data and then do a clean install of Windows 7. After you have done this, do NOT install Norton as it will mess up your system. Instead, use Microsoft Security Essentials which is free and very good..

<h2>            Wireless Instability&#58; Atheros AR9285 disconnects briefly every few minutes</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an ASUS K50ID on Newegg, and attempted to connect it to my Netgear wireless-N via its&nbsp;Atheros AR9285 (which claims to have the most recent drivers installed)</p>
<p>The connections started up without a hitch, but I noticed after a while that the connection would randomly cut out for just a second. &nbsp;It wasn't bad enough to catch my attention just browsing, but when I tried to use Windows Live Messenger, it would sign
 me out every 5 or 10 minutes, then allow me to immediately sign back in. &nbsp;It would also say it had to reconnect the network, so it's not just a software problem with WLM.</p>
<p>I have disabled the option to turn of the wireless card for powersaving (also, it's hilarious that it defaults that option to "on")</p>
<p>I have looked for manual driver updates, but the official Atheros site is confusing and sometimes in French, and doesn't appear to list my card for drivers, only for other misc. information.</p>
<p>I have checked my router settings, etc, and it seems to be fine. &nbsp;It's just that blasted&nbsp;Atheros AR9285 and its unwillingness to stay connected! Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to provide.</p>
<p>P.S. I have also disabled the IP Helper service, someone said that might fix it. It didn't.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Check with ASUS for updated drivers manually as well as possible firmware upgrades for the<br />
Netgear Router. Also check placement of the router - if it is closer than 6 feet or too far away -<br />
is there a lot of metal or electrical interference in the line of sight - or too many walls - different<br />
level floors - or just distance.<br />
<br />
Of course there could be something wrong with the new computer - or the router.<br />
<br />
Check with ASUS support and their forums.<br />

            <p>Hi Hope,</p>
<p>Try resetting the TCP/IP stack. Go to the start menu search box and type cmd and press enter. In the command prompt window, type
<em>netsh int ip reset</em>, and press enter. If that doesn't help, type <em>ipconfig/flushdns</em> and press enter. Then, restart your computer.<br />
Let me know if this helps!</p>

    <title>Chinese Mandarin dictation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> host74  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chinese Mandarin dictation</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Windows 7 Home Premium (English version) computer. &nbsp;Is there a way for me to have it take dictation in Mandarin Chinese and display the resulting Chinese characters in an email program? &nbsp;I searched around the web a bit, and it seems like
 upgrading to the Win 7 Ultimate might do the trick, but I would like that confirmed before spending the money on that.

<h2>            Help With RunDLL Error on Startup</h2>
                    Laptop - Dell Inspiron 1420, Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU&nbsp;&nbsp; T5450&nbsp; @&nbsp; 1.66GHz&nbsp; 1.67 GHz<br />
<br />
Operating System is <strong>Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 1</strong> <br />
<br />
Exact Error Message:&nbsp; <strong>RunDLL&nbsp; Error loading C:\Users\Jill\AppData\Roaming\wmhjhdju.dll</strong> (2 separate windows open with same error upon start up)<br />
<br />
How Long have I been getting this error message?&nbsp; <strong>Just began today, 4/1/09</strong> after I did the following:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Ran Trend-Micro PC-cillin lastnight manually at around 11p because of the virus threat.<br />
2.&nbsp; 2 Found <strong>pshbfapc.dll (C:\Users\Jill\AppData\Local\Temp\)&nbsp; </strong>Quarantined Date 4/1/01 00:11, Status has virus<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apstpldr.dll[1].htm (</strong> <strong>C:\Users\Katiebug\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet...)</strong> Quarantined Date 4/1/01 00:17, Status has virus<br />
3.&nbsp; It didn't pick up any spyware<br />
4.&nbsp; This morning I thought it would be best to run Trend-Micro again but in safe mode so I could set a new restore point and such.&nbsp; Little did I know, it does not run in safe mode.<br />
5.&nbsp; Downloaded AVG free and Windows Defender to run in Safemode<br />
6.&nbsp; Went in to safe mode and started AVG free.&nbsp; It ran for approximately 1 and 1/2 hours which surprised me.<br />
<br />

8.&nbsp; Windows Defender found nothing...<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp; Restarted laptop in normal mode so I could create a restore point and that's when the RunDLL window errors popped up twice<br />
<br />
I have exhausted myself researching on the net and the answer I keep getting is to download Regcleaner to fix the dll errors.&nbsp; I have always been told not to mess with the registry.&nbsp; I'm also not sure what I am paying for if it is ligit or not.
<br />
<br />
Should I run AVG Free, Windows Defender and Trend-Micro all at same time<br />
<br />
Should I just run Trend-Micro and then when I want to run virus scan in safe mode turn on AVG free and Windows Defender?<br />
<br />
As I am sitting here typing this on my unaffected laptop, the Trend-Micro on my infected laptop began a virus/Malware scan on it's own.<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

<p>
<span>Hi Fit4lyf8,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span>First of all thank you for providing so much information in your post.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It really help to troubleshoot the problem when we have all of the info we need!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since AVG found so many trojan horse viruses the likelyhood of other files being damaged seems pretty high.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The runDLL error<span>&nbsp; </span>is also a good indicator.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I believe that the best starting point is to </span><span>try running the System File Checker.
<span>&nbsp;</span>This tool (SFC.EXE) checks the Windows files in use and, if problems are found, restores a good version of the file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While running Windows Vista in Normal Mode or in Safe Mode, you can use these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open a CMD window as an Administrator. (Start orb, All Programs, Accessories, right click on Command Prompt and click Run As Administrator)
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Run this command:<br />
sfc /scannow</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Watch for the results returned by SFC.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Watch carefully for the result SFC shows in the command prompt window. The three possibilities and their conclusions are:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span><span>SFC Found No Problems</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>This means Windows Vista is using the correct system file versions, as far as SFC.exe can determine. If you are still encountering problems in Windows it could be from registry issues (SFC checks files, not the registry), software
 installed on Windows, or hardware. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span><span>SFC Found and Fixed Problems</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>This means that SFC may have resolved your issue. Try to reproduce the problem again. If the problem continues, it may be that there were unrelated system file issues. But the presence of these issues could indicate that corruption</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span><span>SFC Found but Could Not Fix Problems</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>This means that there are more significant issues with Windows system files. It could be that you have corruption in the store SFC uses for recovery. In this situation you may need to reinstall VIsta.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Before you decide to reinstall VIsta let us know the results of the System File Scan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There may be other steps we can take before reinstalling.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I hope that this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download DLC for FM4 </h2>
                    
<p>Okay, hello everyone, i don't even know was here that kind of post or no...<br />
But. I bought an X360 recenly (about a week ago to be accurate), and then bought a disc version of FM4. With the disc there were two codes for DLCs. I've activated it succesfully and went to play the game. Then, after some tyime, i recognised that i want to
 have more cars in game and went to "marketplace" button in menu and then tried to open a dlc list to buy something, but it wasn't shown, there was just a blank list of xbox live with "more info" button, that i couldn't push. After that i understood, that DLCs
 from the disc box were not downloaded. So, how have i recieve my DLCs and how have i buy something?</p>

<p>DLC for that game has been removed from the marketplace. So it would no longer be possible to download them.</p>

<h2>            Tansfering data from old laptop with windows 10, to new laptop with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having issues finding a straight answer for this issue.&nbsp; All I want to do is transfer all data (including programs) from my old laptop (Asus K53SJ - Windows 10: 64 bit) to my new laptop (Toshiba Qosmio X870 - Windows 10: 64 bit).&nbsp; I know how
 to do it from older Windows OS to other Windows OS such as XP, Vista, 7 and 8, but nowhere is giving me any information relevant to transferring 10 to another 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I will need a transfer cable which I can get no issue, however, seeing as Windows 10 does not come with the easy transfer application anymore, and the Laplink PCmover express does not completely transfer everything I want unless I pay $50, what
 can I do?&nbsp; I don't want to have to spend hours manually transferring files from one PC to another because I don't have much time nor will it properly set me up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions will be apreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>- OtherSideGuy</p>

<h2>            New Xbox 360-HELP</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I have had a normal xbox 360 for 3 years now and its starting to play up so I am buying a Slim tomorrow, just a few questions. So me and my brother both have xbox live accounts on the current xbox and when I get my new one I am leaving the old one for him
 to use and will transfer my account to the Slim. Now I have researched the tranfer cable to get all of my data onto my Slim although I dont want to remove the data off the old harddrive because then my borther wouldnt be able to use it. So instead I going
 to use a USB to transfer my account and save games over to the Slim. I will then swap my account licene over to my Slim.
</p>
<p>So, basically I'm wondering if after I do all this will my brother still be able to use his LIVE account on the old xbox even though Ive changed licences.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Josh</p>

<p>You can use a USB device to transfer your date. Also, when you get to the new console, you'll want to do a license transfer so you can play and use your content properly (<a href="http://xbox.com/drm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/drm</a>).
 Once you do this, however, your brother won't be able to play the content you purchased on the other Xbox unless the purchasing GT (you) is logged into LIVE there.

<p>I have the xbox lite 4gig slim version. I'm am able to connect to neighbors wifi, but not my own. I've restarted both the modem and router several times. Again, this all began after the recent update. Once connected to my neighbors low signal, I applied
 the downloaded update thinking that would help. It didn't. I've even gone into the network options and created a new password for my wireless in case that was the problem. The xbox can see my wireless signal at full strength and seems to connect, but once
 I try to sign in, I can't connect. Any help?</p>

<p>Update is causing trouble connecting with both of my consoles. Most of the time it won't connect until I test the connection. Sometimes it connects for a bit, then disconnects. Sometimes it tells me there's a MTU problem, even though I already changed it
 to auto. Never had these problems before this latest update.</p>
