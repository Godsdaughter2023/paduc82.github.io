<h2>            &#42;&#42;Biggest Design Flaws&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Before I get started... I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT GAMEPLAY ISSUES people may have. This is purely design choices that have nothing to do with gameplay.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Now one of the biggest issues I have currently is the design of the Commendations. At first, I loved them. They gave you a little idea of progress and rewards. But, now after a VERY long time of gaming, they are just
 designed far too much for the long term. Once you get to Gold... it's pretty insane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got the Any Spree up to Gold. I checked it and for it to get to Onyx... it freaking QUADRUPLES! I mean really. That's an absolutely enormous jump. I'll most likely never hit that goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the Commendations aren't varied enough. Give some for each gun or something. Give people reasons to use the entire sandbox of weapons and not solely rely on the DMR. Add some Commendations for Objectives as well! This would make people actually go
 for it instead of just farming kills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean I'm not one to need my hand held ala Call of Duty and get rewarded for every little thing I do, but it'd be nice to get some sort of reward every 5-20 matches. Like every 300 kills with a certain gun nets you a small cR bonus or whatever. Just more
 things to achieve and unlock!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in summary, for Commendations they need to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make more varied Commendations. More categories, more levels, etc.</p>
<p>2. Make the Commendations have more "steps" in them. Not just super short to super long term. Make some medium ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.<span> </span>Now, another thing that would be great is to apply Crysis 2's matchmaking/playlist system. They have it set up so you pick Team Slayer (I'll use Halo terms to avoid confusion), but along with that you also get to pick
 from different types. Solo, Fast Rounds, Normal, Classic, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically if you really enjoyed a certain type of game settings (Normal settings or Classic settings) you could pick any playlist and apply those settings to it. Same with Arena. They could have the Arena settings for only certain playlists like Team Snipers,
 Team SWAT, Team MLG and Team Slayer. Or they could go nuts and have it in Action Sack and Grifball, but I would be against that. Some playlists should just be for fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you could pick to have no AA's in the playlists as well. Or Elites only. Basically you have the main playlists, and within those playlists you can apply different settings!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>Obviously, the Armory. This is one thing everyone can agree on. More and varied armor pieces, like gloves and shoes or whatever. Also make the Elites have just as much as the Spartans. Changes to the HUD as well...
 pretty simple stuff there. I'm sure everyone can agree that more is better in this regard!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<span> </span>Finally, another thing everyone can easily agree on is the change of architectures in Forge World. Have more and varied colors and textures. Be able to apply whatever you want to certain pieces (Like a new look, blue
 colored, wartorn/ragged look, etc.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this, another Forge World as DLC would be easily applied. C'mon Bungie, I think they're required to make at least one more DLC pack before all control is passed over to 343i so I would love to see a enormous, amazing Forge World as the perfect send
 off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope Halo 4 makes some of the above mentioned changes. It would really reinvigorate the series for me, and possibly many other players who share my views!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Definitely, Great Ideas! I'd love to have be able to narrow down gametype choices, and get people to use weapons other than the default and power weapons. I gotta say though, These ideas do fit in the thread I made for Ideas for

<p>I definitely agree with some stuff that you posted, however not all of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, commendations. I quite like the way they're set up now. Getting Onyx is SUPPOSED to be hard and take a lot of time. It shows dedication and effort (for most of them). Some of them do seem pretty ridiculous, but Onyx is considered elite. Some of
 them are harder than others, but they're challenges. I'm glad they aren't set up like COD. I mean 2500 kills with a weapon isn't that hard. Those are the ones that put more emphasis on using one weapon than these commendations. Because the commendations aren't
 specific. For example, getting 4000 kills with an automatic weapon. That's not limited to the AR. It could be the Needler, Plasma Repeater, Plasma Rifle, Spiker (some custom maps include Spikers), and anything else I'm forgetting. Precision weapons include
 the DMR, Needle Rifle, Sniper Rifle, and I'm not sure about this, but I think the Focus Rifle too. So there are at least 4 different weapons for each of those commendations. It's all about preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the matchmaking and playlist setup for Reach is great. In the very beginning (I'm not sure how long you've been playing), as in release day, there were a limited amount of playlists. Team Slayer included Slayer, Classic, Pro, and SWAT to the best
 of my memory. But then people complained and wanted SWAT in it's own playlist, to which it was separated and welcomed. They then removed "Classic" games, and came back months later with a legitimate Classic playlist, with similar settings to that of Halo 3.
 A lot of the playlists you see today were part of other playlists originally. They were then separated because they were well enough to do good on their own. We have so many playlists mainly because the community wanted it this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Armory is one of the most in depth customization features any game has ever had. There are millions of combinations of armor. Although, yes, they probably could've added a few more categories, this game is big enough as it is. I think the armory is fine
 as is, and I highly doubt it will be changing anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I completely agree with the Forge World stuff. Looking at plain old gray and silver all the time doesn't make anything look attractive. More textures and categories would be awesome. Everything looks like it's supposed to be Forerunner, with a few props
 from the UNSC and Covenant. We need to be able to make the inside of a Covenant ship. Give us pieces from inside the Covie Corvette on Long Night of Solace or the map Zealot. Although it was a great and revolutionary concept, Forge World needs more. After
 a while it just looks boring and old.</p>

<p>To LOBAGOOBIE, yes there are some ideas for the next Halo and DLC in here, it's mostly about the design flaws of Halo: Reach that I laid out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to Noble, for the Commendations all I meant was to add more medium level ones. Keep Onyx at the extremely long range it is (I mean really, less than 2% of the community will ever reach it anyways) but add more Commendations in between that. And also
 make them more varied instead of having them all based on kills and none on Objective based games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been playing since release and have been involved with the forums well before Halo 3 was released... oh those were the days
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /> I do really enjoy the set up of the playlists, basically what I want to add is picking settings for each playlist. Like Classic rules in Team Objective, or Arena rules in BTB. Oh and the
 Classic settings weren't anything like the Classic playlist we have now. But yeah the point is not to waste entire playlists for solely a change of rulesets and settings. I would love to have Arena in more than just The Arena playlist since I only like Invasion
 and BTB the majority of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ideas for the armory would have to applied to Halo 4, but the Armory in Halo: Reach is pretty limited, especially on the Elite side of things. I didn't think anyone wouldn't agree that more parts for the Armory wouldn't be such a great idea, but hey whatever
 is good to you! And it's definitely not one of the most customizable games ever... Sure if you go for the not so noticeable things like having one of the first 2 wrist attachments or something, but it's not like there are any real massive changes you can make
 to your character. One of the most customizable games would be Mass Effect 2 or Brink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I definitely agree with objective commendations, but you also have to take this into consideration: the more rewards, the more likely team members will try to steal them from you (team killing/etc). Though Bungie has certainly upgraded the system since previous
 games, it still has it's loopholes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Cara, primeira vez que me arrisquei foi pelo eBay, comprei de um cara lá de Hong-Kong, chama DonnyStore, demorou 1 mês pra chegar, mas chegou certinho lacrado, e dentro do prazo... de tanto o pessoal falar do Play-Asia arrisquei e comprei dois jogos, ja
 estão na alfandega de Coritiba, em menos de uma semana deve chegar pra mim, espero que chegue tudo OK. Os preços de eBay e Play-Asia são tentadores demais.</p>

<p>Comprei mais de 5 vezes no Mariio128, já cheguei comprar 3 jogos de um só vez, nunca fui taxado e sempre chegou de 3 semanas pra menos, e ele coloca pessoa física (não sabia, mas pessoa juridica é taxado não importa o valor que for declarado é TAXADO).</p>
<p>1 unica compra no Play-asia, já faz 1 mês e meio e nada de chegar, e segundo o rastreio eu fui taxado, pesquisei e vi que o Play-asia manda como pessoa juridica, o risco de ser taxado é grande (só fui ver isso depois). E lasqueiraaaa.</p>

<p>Esse esquema de colocar como pessoa fisica tb é um risco. Se a encomenda for extraviada dificilmente vc tera seu dinheiro de volta, intao resumindo... IMPORTAR = RISCO. Eu irei fazer um teste no mariio128 mes que vem, mas pelo q acompanho dos forums de importaçao,
 ultimamente mta gente tem reclamado da loja. Embora a playasia esteja com uma encomenda minha indo pra 2 meses e meio kkkkkkkk. Mas a culpa e da receita fazer o q ne?</p>

<h2>            Trouble downloading NHL 14</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having multiple issues downloading NHL 14, they don't seem consistent with others having problems downloading games. The first time i tried to download it I got to 16% and was told "Can't download NHL 14", for the next day I couldn't pass 0%.
 Today I got to 23% and then it just froze there, it has been at 23% for a about an hour now and &nbsp;I'm probably just going to cancel and retry. Any help?</p>

<p>I have and that didn't work. What did work for me was deleting what there was of the game, clearing system cache, resetting my console, beginning the download and then turning the 360 off so it turned into a background download.</p>
<p>Whether or not that was actually the fix I don't know, but I have been trying to download the game for 6 days and it finally works.</p>

                    <p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;have been working in PhotoShop all morning on a presentation for a meeting this afternoon, I went to the bathroom and came back to find my computer rebooted and all my work destroyed.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; This is
<em>my </em>computer, not Microsoft's, isn't it my right to decide when it is or is not okay to reboot?&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I retrieve my lost work?&nbsp; How can I stop this from happening in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Office has a safeguard built in so that if it shuts down for any reason, the next time I open it I am given the option to retrieve any unsaved changes to any documents that had been open at the time.&nbsp; Can't Microsoft do the same thing?&nbsp; Or at least
 leave me a notification telling me I need&nbsp;to re-boot for updates to take effect, instead of commandeering my machine?&nbsp; You've caused me a lot of damage today, Microsoft, and I'm a very unhappy customer.</p>

<p>Retrieve the last saved version of the file that you made.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 you have to do updates. If you do them right away then no issue, but if you put them off then Microsoft will reboot your system for you to finish the update. I'm not a fan of that method either, but no one has come up with a better way to
 get all computers updated out there.</p>

<h3> jadeabbott  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;The attached Bluetooth dongle is not supported&#34; according to Windows 7 64-bit, but the Device Manager says &#34;This device is working properly&#34;. This dongle used to work perfectly. How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>Last year, I was running literally the same system as this year (just on a different computer), and my Bluetooth was functioning perfectly. I got a new pc so I reinstalled the same OS and now it is not working at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>System Details:</div>
<div>-----------------</div>
<div>OS: &nbsp;Windows 7 Enterprise.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Processor: Intel i7</div>
<div>Memory: 12 GP</div>

</div>
<div>Driver Details:</div>
<div>----------------</div>
<div>CSR Bluetooth Device</div>
<div>Driver provider: Motorola, Inc.</div>
<div>Driver Date: 2010/11/22</div>
<div>Driver Version: 3.0.2.285</div>
<div>Digital Signer: Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Steps:</div>
<div>-------</div>
<div>1. Attached my Bluetooth dongle to the USB.</div>
<div>2. Windows update checks for device driver updates, and successfully installs the drivers.</div>
<div>3. I go to "My Bluetooth" and I am provided with the following message:&nbsp;"The attached Bluetooth dongle is not supported".</div>
<div>4. I am unable to access My Bluetooth Settings or Bluetooth neighbourhood etc</div>
<div>5. If I go to my Device manager, to Bluetooth Devices -&gt; CSR Bluetooth Device and look at the properties, the Device Status is "This device is working properly."</div>
<div>6. If I go to "Devices and Printers" and attempt to add a device, it does not pick up any bluetooth devices in the vicinity.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I have already tried:</div>
<div>--------------------------------</div>
<div>1. Restarting</div>
<div>2. Unplugging the device, uninstalling the drivers, restarting,and plugging device back in to reinstall drivers.</div>
<div>Update: 3. Going to Mecer's website, downloading their Bluesoleil 2.3 Drivers for bluetooth and attempting to install. "Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver software" is what Windows tells me. I click "Install this driver software anyway"
 and then a pop up appears telling me that "Windows requires digitally signed driver" appears.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is no point system restoring because this is a newish installation of Windows (January 2012) anyway and it was never working on this specific installation &nbsp;at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is driving me ABSOLUTELY MAD! Hopefully we can sort it out or else I am changing to Linux because this is ridiculous.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>C drive mystery tmp files being created and cannot be deleted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruce bo  say:</h3>
<h2>            C drive mystery tmp files being created and cannot be deleted</h2>
                    <pre><p>
right under the "local disk".. there are several files that are named
'_315421_ ' or similar (4 in total) and further down some MSI prefixed, named with an
extension of 'tmp'

i have an up to date AV provided by ESET

i've tried everything i know.. ran Malwarebytes... no effect.
ran the dos cmmd %temp% to locate and identify and 'delete'.. didn't work</p><p /><p>i am system admin (its my own PC) and tried DISK CLEANUP - no effect.

if i click on any of the files i get the message shown "access denied"
none of the files show anything in them (empty)  .... sometimes before the
'access denied'  i get the 'file in use or disk may be full' message... neither is the case!

i've written to ESET as to what they are and how i might delete them. no
reply i've looked online, but nothing seems to relate to this specific issue.

i'm assuming it has something to do with WinXP security updates, even tho
WinXP is no longer supported - why do i think this? because the amount of files are increasing-in my mind, each time there is an update (the yellow shield that says "updates available" seems to add a file here.
</p><p>i've tried searching the MicroSoft site - but i'm not sure what else to ask about, as the query "deleting tmp files" is what i've tried ~ and only comes up with things i've already attempted.</p><p /><p>any good guesses are appreciated :P

</p></pre>

            <p>All windows OS have "Temp" files,they are used for OS installations</p>
<p>of software/data.Disk cleanup isnt designed to delete them,even though</p>
<p>they are used once...To chk,&amp; delete the many you'll find on the OS,go to</p>
<p>start,run,type: %Temp%&nbsp; In the new window,go to edit,select all,delete all.</p>
<p>If it gets picky about all,make a new folder,drag them to it,delete folder.Once</p>
<p>thru,return to run,type: C:\WINDOWS\Temp&nbsp; Do the same as above,however some</p>
<p>of these are in use,delete what you can,exit when thru,run disk cleanup.</p>
<p>Do this often,youll see what acumilates.</p>

<h3> ericspc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t access &#34;Account Settings&#34; in Windows 10 Mail App</h2>
                    So the built-in Window's mail app is unable to sync new messages. And im currently trying to remove my email accounts from the app. Trying to remove them to re-add them to see if that fixes the issue. But the MAIN problem here is that I can't remove my
 accounts from the app. I can't because I cannot access the account settings at all. When i go to settings and click on "accounts," and try to click on my accounts nothing comes up. Right click, left click, middle click, mouse button 3, nothing does anything.
 Then I right click my account on the left-hand menu and two options come up, "pin to start" and "account settings." So I click on "accounts settings" since that's what i need. And guess what happens... Nothing. I know Microsoft is working to resolve the slow
 sync issues, but I'd rather not wait for the next update. Any ideas I can try to get the "account settings?"<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c12874d-ee24-4db0-8133-32adbba75587" />

            <p>My issues completely parallel those of EricPC, who initiated this thread - Win 10 Mail &amp; Calendar will not sync, moreover; there is no access whatsoever to the existing Accounts in the Mail &amp; Calendar app.&nbsp; The accounts show up under the Mail "Settings"
 function, but clicking, right clicking, middle clicking, double clicking, nor prayer has any affect whatsoever on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all the Powershell processes - run as Administrator, 64bit version -&nbsp;noted in various forums, to included:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ostensibly&nbsp;uninstalling the Mail/Calendar&nbsp;app and reinstalling via this command string:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>"Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –like “*windowscommunicationsapps*”} | remove-appxprovisionedpackage –online"&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Powershell process ran just fine.&nbsp; Rebooted the system.&nbsp; The app was still in the system, launching normally, same non-syncing problem.&nbsp; Here's a screen shot from the Store after the reboot showing it seeing the Mail &amp; Calendar app remains installed:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/011ccfb8-e22e-4149-adf7-f2a28ea8e5ad" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only effect the Powershell string had was to render the "Move" and "Uninstall" functions in&nbsp;"Settings/System/Apps &amp; features" non-functional &amp; grayed out, as shown here:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc56c1ec-c134-4f3f-8dc6-703c6b45cd84" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran as Administrator&nbsp;another Powershell script which (again, ostensibly) was to reinstall and reset ALL the modern apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's that script:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>Get-AppxPackage -allusers | foreach {Add-AppxPackage -register "$($_.InstallLocation)\appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode}</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Zero affect on the problem w/ Mail &amp; Calendar not syncing.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; Zip.&nbsp; Big Goose Egg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran ANOTHER Powershell routine as Administrator which was to 'unpin' any Mail icons in the system, and allow Windows Store to download and reinstall.&nbsp; The script:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>Get-AppXPackage -Name microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" -Verbose}</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The result was useless.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Zero change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the online Store Troubleshooter.&nbsp; It finds nothing wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran WSRESET.EXE.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From SujataMoktan's suggestions, I ran this from the command prompt:&nbsp; <strong>
<em>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth&nbsp; Health reports fine, no problems.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>For the hell of it, I ran the restore version&nbsp; dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth.&nbsp; No change.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You get the idea.&nbsp; I've tried all the above and more from other forums.&nbsp; Zero effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>What are the Registry Edits which will utterly wipe out all trace of the Mail and Calendar apps AND will allow them to re-install???</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time this is taking is costing me far more than the any satisfaction I've gotten from upgrading to Win10.&nbsp; /m</p>

            <p>Agree that this isn't a virus or malware issue. I have the same problem, I spent 20 minutes on the phone with Microsoft and they wanted me to spend $160 to buy support. For an issue with their own app. I'll reinstall Windows 10 first before I spend that
 much to have them fix their own software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't uninstall the mail application either. I can delete the email accounts in the settings/accounts page, but when I open mail again they still show up in that app, even though they are deleted from Windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please allow your default apps to be uninstalled via the normal channel instead of a PowerShell script!

<br />
I'm having the exact same problem as Eric described. My mails won't sync properly for two weeks now and I simply can not click 'account settings' no matter how many times I try. I have tried every single suggested solution I could find online. How is it 2017
 and this problem is still not fixed?

                    hello forums, im always on Skype/Ventrilio and my friends always can hear my music and video game noises even when i lower them as low as possible they can still hear them as if its in their headset. i tried looking through the control panels sound options
 but i have no idea whats causing this. when i unplug the microphone they dont hear it anymore though.could it be my headset? or is there something on the computer thats allowing them to hear the sounds i hear through my headset? thanks for any input/suggestions

<p>Hello,&nbsp; For about&nbsp;9 years I've had&nbsp;a gamer tag and the gamer tag has always been associated with my old college email address.&nbsp; Call it gamer tag xxxx2000 and email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; TO log into my PC I use my everyday standard Gmail account that I've used
 ever since college xxxxx@Gmail and I guess that email address has a gamer tag associated with it BigHogXXXXXX.&nbsp; So My question is, how do I remove the gamer tag BigHogXXXXXX from my xxxxx@Gmail account.&nbsp; Then transfer Gamer tag xxxx2000 away from the email
 address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; Then add&nbsp;Gamer tag xxxx2000 to&nbsp;email address xxxxx@Gmail.<br />
<br />
This would be very helpful to me because I sign into my computer using xxxxx@Gmail but have a groove music account that's associated with xxxx@UFL.&nbsp; Because the Groove account is on xxxx@UFL I can't access it while signed into my PC as xxxxx@Gmail.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>If it helps I have a xbox one and windows 10.</p>

<p>Original title:"Backup and restore "<br />
Mp PC system is Vista 32bit Home Premiun.</p>
<p>This email is from my laptop.</p>
<p>MS Internet Explorer on my PC gave me trouble yesterday. It would not start. &nbsp;Following multiple failures I followed the instruction to delete the IE 9 update. This I did and re-installed. This did not work. &nbsp;I then uninstalled IE 9 &amp; IE 8 and re-installed
 IE 9. It still did not work.</p>
<p>I decided to backup by 24 hours. &nbsp;Since them my PC is going through a cycle of Shutting down, restarting and advising me that it is configuring updates with a status of 0% which never changes, after about 3 minutes it shuts down and recommences the start
 up process again. &nbsp;When the backup process started I was informed that I cannot cancel it. &nbsp;As the restart cycle has now been running for 15 hours what can I do to cancel it?</p>

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the mouse?</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>When did the issue start?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer are causing the mouse cursor to freezes.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Start the computer in “Clean Boot” mode and then try installing the application. Refer to “Step 1” of the below mentioned link:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had a perfectly&nbsp;functioning&nbsp;Yoga 13 with Windows 8 installed (original operating system). &nbsp;This afternoon ran Windows Update and now the pen and input has disappeared from the control panel and I know longer can use my touchscreen interface. &nbsp;The OS is Windows

            What I ended up doing was installing all of the updates and the touch screen started to work again. &nbsp;I then&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;them and it's working fine, so one of my updates must have had a bad&nbsp;initial&nbsp;installation.

    <title>Windows 10 updates are the worst&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kris nongeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 updates are the worst&#33;</h2>
                    I am not a geek, so it doesn't take much to confuse me in the IT world.&nbsp; But I have been through enough versions of Windows now to feel that Windows 10 is the worst one by far that I have been forced to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very slow and the updates drive me nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 They can occur anytime without permission, which&nbsp;caused me to lose hours of work when it started an update&nbsp; while I was in the middle of working on a spreadsheet and it was not saved.&nbsp; I had left my desk for a minute and when I came back, it was installing
 the update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every update appears to undo the defaults that <strong>I set </strong>
as defaults for a reason!&nbsp; &nbsp;My scanner never works after an update and I have to go through all kinds of hoops to get it back.&nbsp; The one back earlier in the summer disabled all my printers at work and it took hours to figure out what had happened and then get
 it fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; My post it notes program, which came with my computer (which had Windows 10 on it to begin with) has been completely messed up - why did they feel they had to fix something that was not broken?&nbsp; I can no longer use them on my computer at home because
 it stacks them, instead of letting me spread them out as I see fit.&nbsp; At work, they enlarged the font to such a degree that I can no longer place the notes on my desktop in a useful manner because they are forced to overlap.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stupid cascade effect in Excel
 just slows it down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to daily restrain myself from slamming something through my screen as I discover yet another app or program that has been disabled or changed by this latest obnoxious update.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to listen to its consumers and&nbsp;less
 to those who write their software, and apparently&nbsp;do not work in the real world where the rest of us have to make their nonsense work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes a tremendous amount of time to reset all my defaults because Windows insists on defaulting so many things back
 to their system defaults.&nbsp; Stop already - have some respect and find a way to work with your consumers that doesn't make them hate you more on a daily basis!

<h2>            explorer.exe keeps crashing - corrupted executable file in ProgramData&#47;Microsoft&#47;Crypto&#47;RSA</h2>
                    Windows explorer has been constantly restarting on my computer making it&nbsp;unusable. The system starts up normally then explorer.exe stops working. It attempts to restart and varies in its&nbsp;success. Even when it does restart it just crashes again. I've tried
 restarting in safe mode w/ command prompt to run a system check but it failed at 10%. I'm currently running an AVG command line anti-virus scan (I'll post the results here later). As of the time I posted this it has found one&nbsp;corrupted&nbsp;exe file. This image
 shows the full file name. Could this have to do with the explorer.exe problem?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Explorer.exe is the program component that provides Windows Shell. Windows Shell or Explorer creates and presents the entire user interface or look and feel of Windows operating system, including task bar, desktop, Windows
 Explorer, notification area (system tray), start menu, dialog boxes and interface controls.</font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>As Windows Explorer constantly start restarting, let us try to kill the Windows Explorer (explorer.exe process) from the task manager.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font><br />
<br />
a. Right click on Taskbar and choose Start Task Manager. <br />
b. Look for Explorer.exe under Processes tab, then right click on it and select End Process.<br />
c. Now, try to create a new explorer.exe from the task manager.<br />
d. Click on File and then click on New Task. Type Explorer.exe and click OK.<br />
<br />
Now you’ll have a new explorer window</font></font></span></p>

<h2>            Surface Dock Updater version 2.12.136.0</h2>
                    <p><span>I have the surface book using the surface dock. I am trying to install the latest Surface Dock updater version 2.12.136.0, and I get an error. I got the same error with the prior surface dock updater version
 2.9.136.0, but gave up and did not follow thru to figure out why. The error is...It starts to install and then pops up Failed to install SurfaceBaseFwUpdateDriver.dll. Aborting installation. Then it backs out the update and says Microsoft Surface Dock Updater
 Setup Wizard ended prematurely. How do I fixed this error?</span></p>
Thanks

<p>Thanks for following up again. I did visit a Microsoft Store 3 days ago. They ran the normal USB stick technical software to make sure my surface book was running the current updates, hardware issues, etc. No luck, nothing found to be incorrect. They could
 not get the update to install. Also, since I have the surface book 1, they do not have another base to try to see if it is the base hardware. I did try to install the updater without the base connected, in tablet mode essentially, and got the same error above.
 That makes me think it is definitely a software/registration issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked him if there was a way to uninstall all traces of the docking station, including all registry entries since many there is a conflicting entry, and he advised no. I did tell him that the Microsoft Store replaced my docking station with a new one maybe
 6-7 months ago. Coincidentally I have not been able to use the updaters for the dock since. I tried to explain to him that maybe there is a entry somewhere that is using the old docking station serial information, etc and won't let it update the firmware since
 the newer docking station does not match it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that could be an issue and if so is there a way to totally uninstall the docking station from the surface book?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Kimberly.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No.  You  can access the BIOS or UEFI setup even if you have no WIndows installed.  It's what your PC starts up with to hand itself over to Windows.  
<br />
<br />But for modern UEFI BIOS' you should use the Boot Menu key to trigger bootable media and not change the order in BIOS.  This is because the WIndows Boot Manager needs to remain set first at all time in the UEFI BIOS.  
<br />
<br />Here are the keys to press for Boot Menu:  
<br /><a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If it bypasses the key when pressed at Startup, then you may need to go into Setup to turn off Fast Boot so it will pause for the Boot Menu key.  You may also need to turn off Fast Startup in Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.    
<br />
<br />To access the BIOS see here:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />For UEFI see also these methods:

            Thanks for your thorough answer; it did help a bit: I disabled fast boot &amp; verified correct key, but screen was still black. Finally decided had to be vid card, and sure enough plugged into vga motherboard slot and the screen appeared. I think HDMI isn't
 supported on mine. thanks again
