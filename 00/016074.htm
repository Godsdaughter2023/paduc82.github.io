<h2>            E71-3 sim problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, recently picked up a 2nd hand E71-3 that was 2 weeks old and not used! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having trouble actually using it but.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I've tried 4 different sim cards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st was my old Telstra sim card that I've had for years, Of course it didn't work :p</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd was my BRAND NEW and I quote "2g and Next G compatible' Teltra starter kit - No workies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd was my mothers sim. It was from her Nokia, had 3g on it so I assumed it would work - No workies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least. 4th was my brothers sim card from HIS E71-1 Vodaphone locked phone, worked perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas at all? Am I just blind and missing something easy?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Also - It was locked to '3' but he 'apparently' locked it. Seems to still be branded 3 as well as the logo pops up when you start it.</p>

<p>The European version (E71-1) will support 3G in the WCDMA 900/2100 bands,</p>
<p>The North American (E71-2) version will support 3G in the WCDMA 850/1900 bands,</p>
<p>The Asian version (E71-3) will support 3G in the WCDMA 850/2100 bands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if this changes anything? I'm trying to get the telstra simcard to work, but only the vodaphone seems to on a 'possibly' 3 locked phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does telstra not use WCDMA 850/2100 bands?</p>

            Hey silvicoast,
<br />
<br />to fix this, try these simply steps:  
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key + R.  
<br />2. Type "winword /safe".  
<br />3. Press Enter.  
<br />4. Check and make sure no error dialog appears.  
<br />5. Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Add-In.  
<br />6. At the very bottom of the settings page, there's a dropdown menu. Select "COM Add-ins".  
<br />7. Press Go... button.  
<br />8. Find any Add-ins that were enabled, and untick the checkmarks next to them.  
<br />9. Press OK.  
<br />10. Close Word 2016.  
<br />11. Reopen Word 2016 normally.  
<br />12. Verify if the error popup did not show up.  
<br />
<br />Let me know, if it helped.  
<br />Regards

<p>Hi Jona,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick response to the issue.&nbsp; Yes, I did exactly as you suggested and WORD opened normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally there were three add-ins which I "unticked": all three had a string of Chinese characters beside them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the timely and accurate assistance to a pressing problem: unable to load MS WORD.</p>

                    <p>I have several word documents that have a few tables in them. I would like to get these tables into excel all in one worksheet at column A. Is there a way to import all of these documents into Excel or would it be better to try to merge all the documents
 and then copy and paste into excel? </p>

<p>So you could use a macro to copy the entire body of each of a set of documents into a single worksheet.&nbsp; It would go something like this:</p>
<p>Sub GetWordDocContents()<br />
&nbsp; Dim oWord As Object<br />
&nbsp; Dim vFiles<br />
&nbsp; Dim iFile As Integer<br />
&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp; vFiles = Application.GetOpenFilename("Word files (*.doc*),*.doc*",Title:="Please select the files you want to copy from", MultiSelect:=True)<br />
&nbsp; If TypeName(vFiles)="Boolean" Then Exit Sub&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Cancelled<br />
&nbsp; Set oWord = CreateObject("Word.Application")<br />
&nbsp; oWord.Visible = True<br />
&nbsp; Set R = Worksheets.Add.Range("A1")<br />
&nbsp; For iFile = LBound(vFIles) To UBound(vFiles)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oWord.Documents.Open vFiles(iFile)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oWord.ActiveDocument.Tables(1).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oWord.Selection.Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activesheet.Paste R<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set R =&nbsp;Cells(ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count+1,1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oWord.ActiveDocument.Close False<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; oWord.Quit<br />
&nbsp; Set oWord = Nothing<br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Columns.Autofit</p>
<p>End Sub<br />

<p>

</p><p>Issues with missing contacts on your phone can be attributed to a lot of factors. For us to better resolve your concern, can you provide us with the following information?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried opening your Microsoft account on a different device to check if the contacts do not show up as well on a different device?</li><li>Have you made any changes/ installed anything on your phone prior to this?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contacts were on my pc in Outlook and on another phone (although not up to date on the phone.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not made any recent changes to the phone nor have there been any recent updates or installations.&nbsp; I simply put it on charge as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have transferred the contact data from another phone and used the contacts in Outlook to fill in any recent contacts that were not included on the other phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever went wrong, it left me with only the people I'm connected with on Skype - a small percentage of my contacts - so I have removed the Skype app from the phone.&nbsp; Pictures were missing from some contacts and I updated them but this morning the original
 picture returned to those profiles.&nbsp; All very odd!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All seems well for now.&nbsp;</p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1. THE FIRST WORDS<br />
OK, as all of the active Nokia people around the internet already know, there<br />
are many reviews in the internet considering about the famous, all-new Nokia<br />
N96 smartphone. It is a new part of the Nokia´s 3rd generation phone series,<br />
the N-Series. The Nokia's N-Series is a quite big group of some really good<br />
phones using much more advanced technology than the previous camera phones<br />
that Nokia, and many other well-known phone companies have made. That is the<br />
Nokia's N-Series in short. But, I am not writing this long review for all you<br />
Nokia-People to just tell you what Nokia N-Series is, you basically did not<br />
come here to read about that. I am writing this because I want to show you<br />
my first feelings about the Nokia N96. I hope you have time to read the whole<br />
review :)<br />
<br />
2. ABOUT THE PHONE'S DESIGN, LOOK ETC. ALL ITS OUTSIDE-SEEING THINGS<br />
So let's start from the usually first things that most people want to know<br />
about a phone before buying it, the phone's ergonomy. The Nokia N96 feels<br />
really, really good in my hand. Althought the phone seems to be quite big,<br />
it fits in almost anybody's hands really well. It is not so thick, comparing<br />
to my good old Nokia N91. And that impressed me pretty much. The phone is<br />
relatively wide, but does not weight much (about 120 grams). The phone's<br />
outlook is something I like, it is somehow much like the Apple's iPhone<br />
within its big screen and black'n'white and grey colours. But, I was very<br />
sad when I actually realized the biggest mistake made in the phone's<br />
design. Its outer casing is actually made from cheap plastics, wich leads<br />
to the very unliked feature... The Nokia N96's cheap plastics are in all<br />
only not good-looking, but also really effective fingerprint magnets! The<br />
phone's outer casing takes fingerprints really easily, and you can see<br />
them very well in a bright sunlight, that is something I really hate. But,<br />
that is luckily the only problem on the phone's design, I think. Just that<br />
the phone's front side is quite widely crowded with many buttons. I really<br />
like the phone's frontside's media button, as it reminds me of my good<br />
old Nokia N91's Musicmenu-key. It is surrounded with the play/pause, stop,<br />
forward and backward keys, and the already-known menu key, C-key (also known<br />
as the backspace key) plus the green &amp; red answering keys and the two<br />
softkeys. All this is has been made to fit around the phone's joystick,<br />
wich also had to include the handy Naviwheel option, but they removed it from<br />
the software, wich is sad in my opinion. They have removed the handy<br />
pen-key, wich formerly worked pretty well as a shortcut for many nice<br />
programs that i used to play around with my old Nokia N91, that is sad but<br />
I guess they had a good enough reason for removing the key.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; To the phone itself, features etc.<br />
<br />
3. PHONE'S USER INTERFACE IN ALL<br />
The Nokia N96 uses the same OS that almost all N-Series devices use, the<br />
Symbian S60 3RD. But this time it is not just that. The Nokia N96 is one<br />
of the first phone's to get the new, famous Feature Pack 2 (FP2). A feature<br />
pack is like the "Microsoft Service Pack" for phones. Just that you cannot<br />
upgrade any NON-FP/FP1 device to FP2 unless you really are an employer of<br />
Nokia, and that the Feature Packs are for phones, not for computers :P<br />
Symbian S60 3RD is the 3rd edition of the famous Symbian OS for phones,<br />
wich has all the features that are required in order to say that a phone<br />
is REALLY a Smartphone. OK, I am now comparing the FP2 Nokia N96 to my old<br />
Pre-FP1/Non-FP1 Nokia N91. The phone's standby screen is pretty much the<br />
same. Just that you can also set the standby screen to be in 3 different<br />
modes. No active standby at all (The old S60 style), the normal already<br />
known active standby row of 6 different program shortcuts and a new<br />
arrangement, the one that is more complicated. It has the icons in the right<br />
side of the phone's standby/idlescreen and you choose the icon and you see<br />
its features at right side. Anyways, I chose the good old S60 3RD arrangement<br />
as it is not too complicated for me. Going to the phone's menu is easy, you<br />
just press the menu-key and that's that. The taskmanager is renewed, this<br />
time it is horizontal and looks better (I guess they have made the idea from<br />
the nice IQ AltTab program wich I used to use with my old Nokia N91. Yeah,<br />
well pretty much nothing has changed. The phone's messages application has<br />
been also renewed... It now has only 2 message types: Text Message and Sound<br />
Message. If you want to send somebody a MMS wich contains a sound clip,<br />
that means you have to choose the Sound Message-option. If you want to send<br />
a normal SMS, or an MMS wich contains picture or video etc, you have to<br />
choose the Text Message-option. Just choose that and write your message.<br />
If you only add text into that, you are sending a normal SMS automatically.<br />
Add any MMS-content in it and it will automatically be an MMS message.<br />
That is a quite nice new feature. The phone also has a new Themes-application<br />
and its icon has been removed from the phone's menu! You can get to it by<br />
setting up an active standby shortcut for it but it will take you straight<br />
to the Active-Standby Themestyle option wich is a part of the Themes<br />
application. The phone still lags pretty much, as it is brand new.<br />
The same problem was with the Nokia N95 when it first came. I guess the<br />
phone does not have so much features that the Nokia N95 does not have.<br />
Well that's all about that.<br />
<br />
4. MEDIA COMPLETION<br />
The Nokia N96 is advertised as a Videoplayer phone. That is true, but that<br />
was not the reason why I bought the phone. The phone can play MP4, 3GP and<br />
surprisingly they are advertising that the phone can also play WMV9 videos.<br />
That is actually true, but the phone did only play the video's sound, not<br />
the video itself :( Well that is OK for me as I do not have a reason for<br />
playing WMV videos with my PHONE. The phone can also of course play music<br />
but supports only a little amount of filetypes. Pictures are (surprise,<br />
surprise) supported too.<br />
<br />
4.1 DVB-H<br />
One of the phone's new main features is the DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting<br />
Handheld) receiver. That means that you can watch digital television wherever<br />
that is available. Here in Finland we can only receive DVB-H signal in the<br />
big cities (luckily I live in Oulu and I can receive DVB-H signal in here...)<br />
But I would be pleased if I could be able to see that signal in places like<br />
cars, trains, planes and ferries but that is not gonna be possible ever,<br />
because only a really small amount of phones have the DVB-H and hardly anybody<br />
watches it. I do not look it unless I have a good reason as it takes a lot<br />
battery. You can also record DVB-H and schedule recordings, that means you<br />
actually have a recording television receiver in your pocket :) But I do not<br />
have any reasons to do such a thing.<br />
<br />
4.2 VIDEOS<br />
The phone, as I said earlier, is being advertised as a pocket-sized video<br />
player. The phone has some pre-loaded factory videos (Some advertising<br />
videos and 1 Transformers Movie). I tested DivXPlayer and it played<br />
small video files (like 100-200MB) really well but when I tested a 350MB<br />
TV-Series episode, it lagged all the time after playing it for 2 minutes.<br />
I also tested CorePlayer and Smartmovie and they both had the same problems<br />
except that the CorePlayer played the file hardly for 2 seconds and started<br />
lagging. But I converted the same file with SmartMovie converter to a 80MB<br />
file and it had much worse quality but still it played with no lagging at<br />
all :) You can also convert any video to a .3GP or .MP4 file but I guess<br />
that it is better to play your video files with SmartMovie or DivXPlayer.<br />
The videos captured with the phone's camera are relatively big, a 4minutes<br />
long video with the best possible quality that the camera has, is over<br />
50MB big. Oh, and one more thing: I just also realized that the phone<br />
supports Winamp Remote really well. Just for all of you who are not familiar<br />
with the Winamp Remote: Winamp Remote is an application wich lets you watch<br />
any videos from your computer´s hard drive over an internet connecton with<br />
quite high quality. I tried that and I was amazed that it worked. Althought<br />
you have to put the flash player as default way playing the video, because<br />
it laggs too much when watched using the Real Player. Oh, and that brings<br />
one another thing to my mind: The Nokia's default web browser now also<br />
supports Flash videos :) I tried youtube and it worked pretty well. And,<br />
as I said earlier the Winamp remote Flash Videoplayer also was able to play<br />
my PC´S videos :) So, Nokia N96 is good for what it is originally meant for:<br />
PLAYING HIGH-QUALITY VIDEOS ANYWHERE, ANYTIME whenever you need to do so.<br />
<br />
4.3 MUSIC<br />
The phone has music keys and I just love them. But the music player is not<br />
anymore being started automatically when the phone is being started and<br />
that means you have to manually put it on if you want to be able to use<br />
the music buttons for playing music. That sucks. The phone has really nice<br />
stereo speakers and they are very loud and I just love them. The earphones<br />
supplied with the phone are really, I mean REALLY bad. They suck, but with<br />
20-40 € you can get some good earphones like KOSS. They have also removed<br />
an old really nice feature. The phone always lists the newest added music<br />
tracks to a list, but you cannot anymore add the newest tracks easily to<br />
another self-made playlist. That is what I hate as I used to do that with<br />
my old Nokia N91. :@ That sucks, I don´t know why on earth they made such<br />
a change in the Music Player. Quality of the music played with good<br />
earphones is quite amazing. But also playing music eats the battery as fast<br />
as a worm diggs itself into mud, you cannot play the music so long time,<br />
but as I am not a music freeak that does not matter so much to me (I prefer<br />
listening to .XM keygen music with my computer and Logitech speakers) But<br />
I can also listen to Keygen music with the LCG Jukebox, I have done that<br />
once for real at school and I just loved that as it made me more creative<br />
at the arts lesson :D<br />
<br />
4.4 PICTURES/CAMERA<br />
The phone has a 5MP camera with a LED flash and a red LED light<br />
to "help" with taking videos :P The phone takes really good images<br />
especially when the phone's flash is used. It can take amazingly good<br />
pictures even when there is no sunlight at all ;) The flash is really<br />
amazing. I don´t know why, but I even think that it takes better pictures<br />
at night comparing to the pictures taken at daylight. Umm, I guess you<br />
can use the phone as a camera in emergency situations when you need to<br />
be able to take a picture of a good situation. The front camera wich is<br />
intended for Video calls takes really awful pictures when there is not<br />
enough light, especially the videos ARE JUST AWFUL but that is just because<br />
who would use the front camera to take pictures of anything else (just for<br />
testing purposes and taking some stupid images of yourself ;) Um, and yeah I was<br />
surprised about that, but it does not matter at all anymore :D Taking videos<br />
with the 5MP camera at the back is nice because they have quite good quality!<br />
But they are also relatively big and I guess that is one more feature that sucks,<br />
as the video quality is not too good! One more new and really nice feature is<br />
that you can set the phone to automatically save the location where the picture<br />
was taken into the picture's metadata and view the location in the Nokia Maps<br />
application. Almost all photos that I have took with my phone have a "geotag".<br />
<br />
5. NAVIGATING/GPS<br />
The Nokia N96 also has a GPS receiver with A-GPS support. I was first surprised<br />
that the phone really knows where you are in just 10 seconds or a bit more. But<br />
when I noticed that it is only caused because the phone has A-GPS and I had set<br />
it on. And what is so bad about that? The A-GPS does not know where you are so<br />
specifically, the accuracy in A-GPS is almost everytimes something like 100<br />
meters so using the phone as a navigator is not so good but I guess it is just<br />
fine for me! The phone has 1 year navigating license for the Nokia Maps application<br />
(wich BTW sucks), but I prefer Garmin wich is better in all ways :) But while I<br />
was testing navigating in the car, it was working fine. When Garmin said that<br />
"waiting for better GPS signal", it only took about 5 seconds for it to already<br />
show me that it had a full signal with 5-10m accuracy! Yum that is going to be<br />
a nice feature because I am going to use it while travelling at Europe next summer.<br />
Navigating is much, much better comparing, for example to the Nokia E90 and<br />
some external Bluetooth GPS receivers. I am pleased that I know that I am always<br />
carrying a really powerful GPS navigator in my pocket, and it is ready whenever<br />
i just need it to be used :)<br />
<br />
6. N-GAGE/GAMES<br />
Nokia N96 also has pre-installed Tetris and an activation code for that is being<br />
given with the phone (wich BTW WAS NOT WORKING FOR ME!). I installed brothers<br />
in arms AND IT LAGGED LIKE A HELL?! What the hell is the problem with that, they<br />
did not add a 3D Accelerator chip to the phone and they are still advertising<br />
it as a "Good N-Gage gaming phone" Haha, I just shall laugh about that. I guess<br />
I WILL NOT BE USING THE PHONE FOR GAMING THEN. So overall, if you did not already<br />
understand my opinion about the Gaming features in the phone: DO NOT THINK THAT<br />
THE PHONE IS GOOD IN GAMING... :) Also, tried Vampent´s vNes and it was not able<br />
to start emulating (it was when I tried with my Nokia N91! Well, also the joystick<br />
is a limitation wich makes it nearly impossible to play games with the phone.<br />
It actually isn´t a joystick at all (they do not even advertise it to be that :)<br />
I liked my old Nokia N91's joystick as it was really nice for playing games! But<br />
playing games like Tetris should be fine. Also I will be going to try playing<br />
games with the numeric keys, maybe that will be fine ;D<br />
<br />
7. THE 16GB MEMORY + SDHC Memory Card place with hotswap support!<br />
Yep, that´s true. I was first really impressed when I heard that the Nokia N96<br />
has a HUGE 16GB memory and also A SDHC memory card spot. That was one of the<br />
main reasons why I really said myself: If I am going to buy a phone, it will<br />
definitely be the Nokia N96 unless something REALLY impressive will become<br />
to the markets. I put my favorite tracks and kept almost all of the factory-loaded<br />
videos in the phone and I still have a bit over 10GB free space (I also took about<br />
hundred photos) not even mentioning that I also have installed Garmin Mobile XT<br />
with all European maps to the phone (also Navicore and TomTom, they just weren´t<br />
working and I was too lazy to be able to remove them or try solving why they<br />
weren´t working) They are advertising that the phone can take up to 40 hours<br />
of good guality video. Yeah that is just amazing and it is true too. Borrowing<br />
to one guy's words who has been showing the N96 prototype at youtube: "So you<br />
really, really have enough space on this phone" That is so true. I just wonder<br />
what the hell I am going to do with all that 10GB left space ;D<br />
<br />
8. A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE<br />
Many have complayed about the Nokia N96 battery life. I cannot understand why!<br />
It has better battery life than in by Nokia N91. Two listed examples by me:<br />
<br />
* I just charged the phone at around 7pm. I went to sleep and the clock was about<br />
10pm. Before that, I decided to put a 1 hour long TV episode to a scheduled<br />
recording. The phone did that very well. And I was surprised that when I looked<br />
at the phone's battery state: It showed me that it had 100% full battery life!<br />
And it kept there until I watched the whole 1 hour episode, then it still had<br />
6 bars left of the 7 bars maxium. Pretty impressive.<br />
* I put the phone to charge itself a few minutes before I went to sleep.<br />
At morning I went to school. At there I watched TV episodes using Winamp<br />
Remote for about 30-45 minutes. Then I listened to .XM keygen music with<br />
LCG Jukebox for about 2 hours! Also I was playing with the phone a bit more<br />
time too. When I went to home, it had something like 2 or 3 bars left. That<br />
is not a very good example but that is already enough for me, and the<br />
phone has had much better battery life after this case :)<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
---&gt; [OVERALL REVIEWING] ---<br />
<br />
* The Nokia N96 is a good mediaphone but it is also enough<br />
good to be used as an officephone. The stereo speakers,<br />
DVB-H, GPS and a good camera, 16GB mass memory and a<br />
SDHC memorycard slot... That is just everything I would<br />
ever want from a phone! But all this comes with a price<br />
wich will make most people just dream about the phone,<br />
or buying it from an operator with a cheap price like<br />
I did. Even thought the firmware is buggy, I can still<br />
recommend the phone for anybody who likes to have a<br />
good-looking phone with all possible mediafeatures!<br />
The phone is still buggy but that was with the Nokia N95<br />
too. I cannot understand why people are saying that<br />
"Nokia N95 is soo much better and looks better..." that<br />
is so not true. The N96 beats N95 hands down! And overall,<br />
the phone would be too perfect if it would not have bugs,<br />
all new phones have bugs! Think about the iPhone, it was<br />
not even able to send a MMS message but it has been enabled<br />
in the new firmware update. Also iPhone has been buggy when<br />
it first came but it has been improved much. The same will<br />
100% surely happend with the Nokia N96 too! They already<br />
have released v11 wich has made my phone a bit faster too :)<br />
<br />
+ A big screen with bunch of colours!<br />
+ 5MP camera takes good quality photos<br />
+ GPS finds location fast with the A-GPS feature<br />
+ Really good stereo speakers!<br />
+ Supports WMV :P<br />
+ The phone is not too thick and it is smaller than N95<br />
+ The phone just looks sooo good!<br />
+ 16GB memory + A SDHC memorycard slot!<br />
+ The phone's 1-9 keys are nice and they can be easily pressed even<br />
thought they are really flat! Writing with the phone is fast :)<br />
+ The phone just looks so good!<br />
+ DVB-H with scheduled recording and awesome quality!<br />
+ Battery life is just enough!<br />
<br />
- The GPS is fast but mostly not accurate except at outside<br />
- Music-Player no longer gives an option to add a freshly added<br />
music track to another playlist :( I have to find all the<br />
freshly added tracks manually from the All tracks-section if<br />
and when I want to add them to a nice playlist :(<br />
- The front camera has a really bad picture and video quality<br />
- The software in the phone still has many bugs<br />
- A fingerprint magnet &amp; Cheap plastic materials :(<br />
- Price!<br />
- OH, the gaming features just suck :(

If I hadn't got one myself(N96) I would say that what you just said might not be true, just an advert! I luv my N91 8gb, but his time it would be a second time around N96. ;)

            You think I am a liar? No no no, I am speaking true. Why would I wrote that long review just to put people buying a phone that sucks...? I really love my Nokia N96 as the v11 update + 2 weeks has made it A LOT faster! Yeah maybe you think I work for Nokia
 but I don´t. I am just a Nokia Fan, I admit that. My Nokia N91 (weird considencehas also worked really well and I almost switched back to that from N96 because I just loved my old phone so much :D But did not do that as the N96 was expensive and it has everything
 that the Nokia N91 does not have. So upgrading from Nokia N91 to Nokia N96 is something I really suggest to anybody (at leat if the person's N91 is in such bad condition like mine). There were 3 (three) reasons why I just upgraded from my old reliable Nokia
 N91 to the all-new and expensive Nokia N96:<br />
<br />
1. My old Nokia N91 had too many scratches on it (I got tired of them as my phone looked UGLY because of them)<br />
2. Nokia N96 just has so many new features that my old Nokia N91 does NOT have!<br />
3. I have had my Nokia N91 for 2 (two) years and I got it as a birthday present. So it was my birthday again and my mother asked curiously that wich is a phone that I really like and I said of course the Nokia N96. And I got it almost immediately when it hit
 the Elisa-markets all around the Finland (also in Kempele and Oulu).

            His post that the N96 sucks is 100% right just the battery life really sucks. Not even pushing the phone for lots of sms and calls you can just make last for a day. Phones are the only thing you cant try out for 7 days and then take them back if you dont
 like them. If we could then you will find that nokia will not rush a phone out to sell just to fix it later with FW updates.

            Um, yes I can :P (BTW, nice that there are other N96 likers too, as I am also very surprised that there are so many haters :O)<br />
<br />
You can get Winamp Remote from here: <a href="http://www.winamp.com/player/free-download-full?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winamp.com/player/free-download-full?lang=en-us</a> When you install it, choose Winamp Remote as a part of the installation. You can get more help from the Winamp Forums. Winamp Remote should be easy to use, but if you need more help ask from the
 Winamp Forums or PM me :) (One of the main things is that you have to have ports forwarded fine, that is quite hard to explain but go to:
<a href="http://www.portforward.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.portforward.com</a> and follow their instructions meant just for your router, I am not sure that do they have instructions just meant for Winamp Remote but if you are lucky enough you just should be able
 to do the tricks in half an hour :D)<br />
<br />
DivXPlayer is available at here: <a href="http://labs.divx.com/system/files/private/DivXPlayer_S60_3rd_0.sisx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://labs.divx.com/system/files/private/DivXPlayer_S60_3rd_0.sisx</a> AND PLEASE NOTE that DivxPlayer takes so much memory that it CANNOT PLAY FILES OVER 200MB. I tried a 150MB DivX .AVI video and it played very well but I tried a 350MB DivX .AVI video and
 it lagged like a hell. You can use Lonely Cat Games (LCG) SmartMovie to convert about 350MB file to a 80MB file with just fine enough quality. I know that talking about "illegal" things is forbidden in here but just a small tip: Find a good Mobile Phone stuff
 forum, they are giving some good and CR@CKED applications for free (normally they are asking huge prices for them) There are dozens of good mobile forums just waiting for somebody who needs all that stuff :D For example the SmartMovie will put the video's
 image grey after two minutes (if you have converted the video with that tool) of playing it. But just some little googling and you are fine to go :) But supporting software studios is also important, so if you just have enough money I really suggest that you
 buy all your softwares!

<h2>            Can&#39;t open two windows on windows 10 when using microsoft office programs</h2>
                    I recently acquired a brand new pc with windows 10. I have the microsoft office package 2016. When I try to open two files at the same time ( word docs for example) It opens the last document but also closes the first one. So I havent been able to keep
 both opened. What should I do?

            <p>Exactly how are you trying to open these 2 files at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFIK, you should be able to do this, ie by using &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;Click&gt; to select more than one file in Windows Explorer or the File Open dialog and hitting &lt;enter&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, are you able to open the 2 files one at a time so that you can view the 2 of them side by side?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something you can try is right click on the shortcut you use to start Word, select "Properties", then in the Properties dialog, in the "Shortcut" tab, in the "Target" field if they are not already there, put quotes around the path and filename WinWord.EXE
 and add a &lt;space&gt; and /w so that it looks something like this (your path WILL be different) :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office 14\Office14\WINWORD.EXE" /w</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK to save the change.&nbsp; Now each time you click on this shortcut it will start a totally separate session of Word under Windows.&nbsp; (Really, this should not affect your problem as described, but who knows ... )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to a source for all of the command line switches you can use (this document should still apply to 2013 and 2016 even though it does not say so explicitly)</p>

            <p>Hello Rohn 007,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you said but unfortunately didn't work. There is another thing I've noticed, The title of every document I open says
<strong>"Mobile"</strong> microsoft word office 2016. I don't know how much does it have to do with my problem but I reckon that if It's a mobile version of the Microsoft office package, then It must be lighter than the full version and probably the double
 window feature is not included here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it make any sense to you?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I do not have access to the Mobile version so I can't confirm.&nbsp; But I strongly suspect you are right that this is a feature that is not supported by the Mobile version.
<br />
</p>
<p>So are you working on a tablet or smartphone?&nbsp; If you are, go back to your original question and click on the "Edit" button. Then change the "system and device" option to "Win 10 Mobile". That will put you in a place that people with more specific skills
 are likely to see the question.</p>

    <title>Why does my percentage pie chart take data from the first - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my percentage pie chart take data from the first worksheet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a monthly budget template provided by excel. After entering values and finishing up with the first month (January), moved on to the next month by copying the entire spreadsheet. I entered the values for February expenses but my pie chart wasn't calculating
 the changes. I realised that it would only change if i changed the values entered in the January spreadsheet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The formula that runs the pie chart is this:<br />
=SERIES(,,'Chart Data'!$B$4:$B$5,1)<br />
<br />
I don't understand what i'm supposed to change so that it would get the data from the second spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I don't understand the 'range' used either because i'm assuming $B$4:$B$5 is supposed to be values within cells B4 and B5. But there are no values within those cells so I do not even know where the first graph in the January spreadsheet is getting the data
 from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone will be able to shed light on what is happening.</p>

            Sadly it sounds like you have one that has the proximity sensor issue. I suggest you return it to the retailer and see if they will swap it for you.

<p>I have the same problem as well. The phone behaves erratic sometimes the screen goes blank &amp; sometimes its fine. I had a similar issue with my NL 920 as well. Had to return back to NOKIA twice for replacement. but the defect never disappeared. I still have
 the handset lying in my drawers with the same defect.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue with my brand new Lumia 930 - the screen goes black (a bit randomly) when talking on the phone. I used a trick decribed in a post with the same issue on a 920, which is to firmly wipe just above the N in Nokia in the top right
 corner on the phone (where the sensors are) which helps. However, it is not really fixing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anybody knowing another solution but to return the phone, which feels a bit cumbersome to say the least?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Icon size for attachment</h2>
                    <p>On an MS Access 2010 form I created a field for attaching an Excel file.&nbsp; How can I control the size of the Excel Icon that appears in the field?&nbsp; As it is now, I must have a field at least .4" high to fit the icon-- I want .24" like all the other fields.&nbsp;
 This is about the icon size-- not the file size.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By default, Access sets the data type for the field to Attachment and places an icon in the header row of the field and displays the program icon that

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>corresponds to the file types. For example, you see the PowerPoint icon when you attach a presentation, and so on. If you want to control the size of the

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>but the whole window.You can move the Quick Launch bar below the ribbon if that would help. If you right click on the Quick Launch bar there is an option

    <title>Difficulty in printing labels from addresses file in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c s gopalakrishnan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difficulty in printing labels from addresses file in Excel</h2>
                    I have an address file in Excel-7 which I have used to print labels using the 'Mailings' tab in Word-7. I have used a custom label sheet and hence have fed the dimensions to create the custom label and given it a name. I use the A 4 page feed with manual
 feeding of the sheets. After the merge the labels look fine in preview but when the actual printing begins (HP Laser Jet 1018) the spacing between labels vertically goes awry.The labels get printed across labels &nbsp;including spaces between labels in a column.
 I have tried both inch and millimeter dimensions but no reprieve is in sight. I did not have this problem before. When I sent the Label document in Word to a friend of mine using a different model of HP laser jet printer, the labels got printed without any
 issues. What is going wrong? Any thoughts?

<p>
</p><p>On office 2016 64 bit, when we try to save invites for outlook from Internet Explorer, the user gets an error message that another instance of Outlook is already running. Also, the moment we try to save the invite from the browser, another Outlook process
 gets started in task manager. Normal invites in outlook are getting saved without any issues. Please let me know if someone knows the fix to this as I have a client waiting for resolution of this issue.</p>

<p>Hi Ahsan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if there is Outlook add-in that starts up before Outlook itself. We'd like to learn more about your concern, so we can determine the best solution or direct you to the correct forum if needed. Can you provide the answer to the following
 questions?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us how Outlook is configured? Is it using <strong>POP</strong>, <strong>
IMAP</strong> or <strong>Exchange</strong> server?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Is the computer connected to a domain?</li><li>Have you already tried starting the computer in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong> to disable some add-ins that may be causing the
 issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h2>            usb connection of phone</h2>
                    Since the last update, my computer constantly notifies me (abut every ten seconds), it cannot recognize the last device connected via usb...it's my phone. This is highly annoying, and will not allow me to download anything from my phone to my computer.
 Any suggestions?

</p><p>Hi Manly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding the issue with your phone being undetected by your computer, have you tried using a different USB cord to connect your phone to your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, try to connect a different phone on your computer using the USB cord that you have so we could limit the possible causes why your device remains undetected on your PC.</p>

            Hi ScottSiegfort,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Skype doesn't have telephone support. The only option that they have is chat support.
<br />
<br />You can chat with a live Skype support agent. Here is the link. Select Account, Profile and sign in. Then click on chat. 
<br />

<p>I do not know if you are agreeing or disagreeing with me on the functionality of chat. Below is a graphic displaying all the drop-downs that provide you with a chat option and how chat is launched. The others do not. This is how it should function if nothing
 is impeding it. If a pop-up blocker is engaged you may never get the chat pop-up or the transition from the queue to the agent.</p>

            Very interesting short video.&nbsp; You made several choices from the "Select you issue" drop-down.&nbsp; However, I am not having an issue such as you have chosen.&nbsp; I can log-on with my account just fine.&nbsp; My issue is "Calling and messaging" since it is the closest
 choice.&nbsp; My wife and I can both log into our Skype accounts just fine, see contacts, etc.&nbsp; But we cannot Skype video call each other. No green dot is shown on the contact in the list.&nbsp; We have uninstalled and reinstalled several times, both the App and the
 desktop version with the same result each time.&nbsp; We have send invitations to each other which seem only to have the effect of spawning Skype. Interestingly when "Calling and Messaging" is chosen, the "Chat" option does not show.&nbsp; Thanks for your responses!&nbsp;
 I will try a different dropdown and chat that way.&nbsp; Since MS dropped Mesh, Windows Phone, Groove, and the great Photo apps, I&nbsp;have been really bummed out by MS and don't have a

            <p>Well, being as to how this is Windows 10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;its OneDrive as integrated into Windows 10 (10547).</p>
<p>2) Well, not exactly.&nbsp; I have shutdown, deleted and restarted OneDrive resyncing from scratch.</p>
<p>3) In Settings -&gt;System-&gt;Storage-&gt;Save Locations-&gt; Save New Documents to: Drop the box change the location.</p>
<p>4) All new documents from all apps that don't let me independently set a default save location, i.e. Word lets me set a default location of its own, but the integrated Windows 10 mail app does not and attachments go to OneDrive instead of where I would prefer.&nbsp;
 New apps with a default save location start in OneDrive until I manually change them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I indicated, in Settings, if I change the default save location, it changes itself to OneDrive as soon as I hit "Apply".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not having this problem with the other default save location settings, i.e. Music, Pictures or Videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only having this problem on one machine and not on the other 3 within arm's reach.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I already had a Skype account.&nbsp; Now Microsoft has added a skype account to my hotmail. I went into setting but can't seem to delete it. It's causing issues as people are calling me on this skype associated with my hotmail, and I'm on my other skype account
 that I created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other posts about deleting a skype account on the forum are locked???? I wonder why??? The only help is to delete your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go into skype settings - there is no delete skype button.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a quick fix?</p>

            A Skype account which is linked to Microsoft account can't be deleted without deleting Microsoft account. It would mean losing access all other Microsoft services.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. Your old Skype ID is also preserved. 
<br />
<br />If you want - You can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your new account

            Deleting a Skype account would require deleting your Microsoft Account, since Microsoft now links them since October of 2016. 
<br />
<br />Try transferring the contacts to the account you want to use:

<h2>            march of empire stopped working after windows update</h2>
                    I have been playing this game for months and it stopped working all of sudden. No matter how many time I try reinstalling it, game is dead on my PC :(

<p>My apologies for half baked info. I upgraded to 'windows 10 pro insider build 17063.rs_prerelease.171213-1610" and since then game is not working. Although I reverted to old version but game refused to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to Microsoft store, it shows me that its already installed but there is no trace of game files in my PC! Tried reinstall process several time by now</p>

<p>Is it showing up in your App list under Settings? If so, try to uninstall it and then go back to the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe most store apps are stored in &nbsp; "C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Packages"</p>
<p>Shortcuts are stored in &nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Application Shortcuts"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use File Explorer and in the Search box type your game and see if it finds anything else. Maybe search just for March or Empire and see if there are any more references to the game. Delete those also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then hopefully you can go back to the store and install the game.</p>

    <title>&#35;VALUE error on Excel 2016 for MAC that does not appear on Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#35;VALUE error on Excel 2016 for MAC that does not appear on Excel 2011 for MAC</h2>
                    <p>I have programmed a spreadsheet using Excel 2011 for MAC and when I open it with Excel 2016 appears a #VALUE error in a set of cells where I have no error at all when I work with Excel 2011. Could anyone let me know what could be happening? I expected that
 something that works with an older version will always work in a newer one but it seems this is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you to all of you for the prompt reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've identified the problem. It has no relationship with the version of my Office but with the language. My Office 2011 was in Spanish and Office 2016 is in English. Change in the language automatically changes the formulas, for example the function CELDA
 in Spanish becomes CELL in English, but what does not translate the info_type. This is the function CELL is of the type&nbsp;CELL(info_type, [reference]) and info_type for MS Excel in one language is not translated when I try to open the spreadsheet in a MS Excel
 configured for another language. That's crazy because it means that I can only use that function CELL in any MS Excel configured for a given language or it returns a #VALUE error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite surprised that something so obvious and important hasn't been noticed by the guys that programmed MS Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or comments are most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            I'm afraid there's nothing anyone here can do with regard to how the program is written. Use the Smiley @ the right end of the Ribbon to submit your findings to Microsoft. It would help to have an example displayed in the sheet when you do so you can use
 the <em>Include Screenshot</em> option.<br />

            <p>I agree with Bob's comments in his August 19 reply. And, his suggestion to turn it as a bug is correct also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might&nbsp;I suggest, If you follow his advice: to describe the issue&nbsp;and your findings and fix in same detail (in fact a Copy/Paste of your Reply Wouldn't be a bad idea).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then tick the Box to send email address. And type your email address.&nbsp;And send the Report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the likelihood of getting a response back asking for additional information, would be about the same as getting Struck by lightning, while standing in same spot, 4 times in a row, within a 10 minute span.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still, should add some additional seriousness to your input, other than just posting report anonymously.</p>

    <title>Reverted back to Evaluation Build 10565 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joelsampson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reverted back to Evaluation Build 10565</h2>
                    <p>I thought I had successfully upgraded to the "real" Windows 10 OS from the Insider Preview. Tonight it did a ton of updated and reverted back to Preview 10565. I am not happy. What do I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's on a Levnovo K450e with an i7. It came with Windows 8.1, which I quickly updated to the W10 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you're referring to the win 10 release to the public, released July 29, 2015, you get that by directly upgrading to it from your Windows 8.1, not through the insider preview. Many got into the preview program for many reasons other than the right ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If go back to your 8.1, you can download the Media Creator Tool, 32 or 64 bit, onto your desktop from this site: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click on it. When it opens, select "Upgrade This PC now".&nbsp; It will take you where you have indicated you wish to be.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Hotmail Account not downloading e-mail details &#47; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frisbee_david  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Hotmail Account not downloading e-mail details &#47; sending</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just updated from Outlook 2013 to 2016, and have a Hotmail account attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have any dramas before updating with my hotmail, however since updating, no e-mail details is downloading. For some reason it is registering new e-mails, but just shows &lt;None&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Tried the SFC /Scannow fix, but didn't do anything.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also no e-mails are sending via outbox.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried deleting the hotmail account, and reattaching, and also creating a new outlook account, but nothing worked either.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Anyone help?!?! Thanks!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know what type of account you have configured in Outlook.&nbsp; (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync)</span></p>
<p><span>Let us open Outlook in safe mode and check how it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do that, close Outlook. Click on Start – All Programs – Accessories – Run, and in the open box type in Outlook /safe and hit ok. (Note: There is a space between Outlook and /).&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span></p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK. </span></p>
<p>

            <p>Nope the hotmail account was defn configured as an exchange active sync account, refer screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some other details. I uninstalled Office 365, and then reinstalled, and this didn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also numerous times removed my hotmail account, and then added again, and still hasn't solved these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also installed Office 365 on my other computer, entered in my hotmail address to add it, and voila, it works without any issues?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm thinking it must be something like my profiles or something like that... something specific to my Windows 10 Surface Pro tablet, rather than the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other recommendations?!?! Do you need to log into my computer to check the problem / settings at all?!</p>

            Hi Microsoft, any other comments / fixes?<br />
<br />
Clearly this sux as it was working ok before my upgrade to Microsoft 2016 / 365 (previously Outlook 2013), so I don't feel I have had a good deal at all from upgrading!<br />
<br />
Given it works on my home computer with me pointing to my laptop's PST file, I'm at the point that I'm thinking of actually reformatting my laptop?!<br />
<br />
Any further help would be much appreciated!
