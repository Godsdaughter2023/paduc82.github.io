<h2>            How to update from W8 to W8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm from Austria (Europe) and I own an unlocked W8 Nokia Lumia 920 phone. Everytime I check for an automatic update, it shows me that my phone is up to date although W8.1 is out there for long time which I would love to have :) I was thinking to use
 "preview for developers" app but I might lose all my data and contact numbers which would be catastrophic :( so I will be very thankful if you guys have a solution for me.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Similar issue with my 950xl.&nbsp; Microsoft Weather App does no longer launches nor does it allow me to uninstall the app.&nbsp; Also the font scaling has changed to a larger font that spill over the icons.&nbsp; Mobile sites on Edge many are now unusable due&nbsp;to some &nbsp;font
 scaling issues that the font size is so large only two words are displayed on each line&nbsp; I just don't understand how a release like this gets past any rudimentary testing.</p>

            <p>Hey Harry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've split your reply out as it's in fact different than the symptoms discussed in the other thread. I want to ensure we don't lose your issues and others may also have font scaling problems. Keeping it in a separate thread will help with discoverability,
 etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you check on a few things for me and let me know the results?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To confirm, are you on the Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary update? Let me know what version you see when you go to Settings &gt; System &gt; About, more info.&nbsp;</li><li>If you go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Display, what is listed as the "Size of text, apps, and items on this display"?&nbsp;</li><li>Could you take a screen shot of the text spilling over on the Live Tiles and in Edge? To take a screenshot press power + vol-up. You can post your screen shot here.&nbsp;</li><li>Regarding your Weather app and your inability to uninstall -- can you describe that a bit more? Do you get an error when doing so?</li></ul>

            Hi susan_857
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Now chat is stored on cloud since last 2 years. There is no Recycle bin type of facility in Skype. A chat once deleted is delete forever. 
<br />
<br />But if the chat was sent by you and was deleted by you, then it is deleted from both you and receiver's cloud.
<br />
<br />If chat was received by you then deletion on your side doesn't delete from sender's Skype. Hence, if you can contact receiver, that person will be able to share with you the chats sent by him/herself (not what was sent by you but deleted by you)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            MS EXCEL&#58;  Auto-Hide Ribbon misbehaves... hides ribbon AND forces full-screen</h2>
                    <p>The Auto-Hide Ribbon function is *insane*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to make your Excel window as small as possible?&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; We have this feature to hide the Ribbon entirely!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Far from simply doing what it obviously is supposed to do (hide the ribbon), for some totally bizarre reason Excel decides that you want to expand the window to full screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be like making text italic and Excel deciding you want to also make everything bold.&nbsp; Nuts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I auto-hide the ribbon WITHOUT the Excel window deciding to go full screen?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PS, Microsoft, if you want screen shots of this, open Excel and do it yourself.&nbsp; Don't ask me to hold your hand.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can address a suggestion to developers here.</p>
<p><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/34461775-minimizing-ribbon-and-customizing-size-of-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/34461775-minimizing-ribbon-and-customizing-size-of-window</a></p>
<p>Vote!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can double-click on any ribbon tab. This will give you something approaching what you want. The wide command bar will disappear, leaving you with the tabs and the QAT. The window will not resize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently when this feature was added to Office 2013 they were looking for a way to maximize the space given to your workbook. It is the same across all the Office applications.</p>

<h2>            Creating a Rule to both quarantine a message and send an e-mail to the sender</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I've got a requirement, in Exchange OnLine, to create a rule either in DLP or in Transport rules to, that will quarantine an outbound e-mail and send an notification message to the sender and perhaps their manager?</p>
<p>Any one got any ideas??</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>hi peter,</p>
<p>based on my research and test, please check if the following transport rule can do the trick:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=cbe5a127-afcd-4071-b5e8-52db88a59693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dcbe5a127-afcd-4071-b5e8-52db88a59693" /></a><br />
<br />
<strong>note:</strong>&nbsp;before selecting conditions and actions, choose&nbsp;<strong>more options</strong>&nbsp;first to ensure all the options can be selected.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6bd31a9a-ad69-4e23-b8a5-6814c3128455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6bd31a9a-ad69-4e23-b8a5-6814c3128455" /></a></p>
<p>if the rule you set cannot cannot meet your requirement, please take a related screenshot and upload it for our further analysis.&nbsp;to upload pictures, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> and<strong> insert/edit media</strong>.<br />

<h2>            HPVAL &#47; NAME&#63; when opening Excel 2007 doc in Excel 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    <span>Greetings,</span>
                    <span>Greetings,</span>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>I have received a Excel workbook (.xlsm) file from a Windows Excel 2007 and am opening it on Excel 2011 for Mac.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>The workbook consist of many sheets with multiple data points.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Although the workbook runs perfectly on any Windows machine, I basically get #NAME? error through out.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>The problems seem to becoming from the HPLINK and HPVAL functions listed in some formulas.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>I am unfamiliar with these, but have done some limited research.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Do I require an ADD IN to make these work? &nbsp; (I did, however, check other Windows machines and they could view the document without any add-ins, including Hyperion, running.)</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there a particular way the Windows Excel 2007 document can be saved so I can open and work on it on the Mac?</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
</div>

            These are add-in functions, part of Hyperion tools. As far as I know, Hyperion has not made a Mac compatible version. The only way to save it so that it can be used on a mac is to rewrite the workbook so those functions are not used. You may want to contact
 Hyperion to see if there is a Mac version of the add-in

<h2>            Windows 10 Preview - Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT does not detect second screen</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed the preview of Windows 10 on my BootCamp partition of my MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It runs great and especially love Windows Defender! I do not have to deal with installing the Mcafee anti-virus software of my internet provider...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, with Windows 7 Home edition, I was able to get my second display recognized and use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But with Windows 10, I only get my laptop screen. Mind that I may not have the latest drivers for my graphics card. But still, it should be detecting my Dell monitor connected on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took a while to update to version 10130 from 10074 but it made it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update of Windows 10 and the Nvidia drivers, I still didn't see my second display!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for the heck of it, I disconnected my mini display to DVI converter from my MacBook and my second display appeared!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I just needed to reset the connection between my monitor and my computer to make it work. Wonder if just a power cycle of the monitor would have worked too...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I now have a dual screen, which makes it so much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will definitely post any issues I encounter in the next few days, if any!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, the only issue I had was an 0x00 (do not have the whole error code) when trying to update the preview to 10130... but it was because I am not patient enough! I finally let it run and it updated fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also got a bunch of out of memory messages during the update. But the OS never crashed. I just had to refresh the Windows update once in a while and it completed without any other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>

<h2>            Build 16226 install failed, Visual C&#43;&#43; Runtime Error</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to update to the latest build several times. I am currently running Build 16199.&nbsp; The update downloads and does the first step of installation, then "Requires Restart". When it restarts, it gets to about 30% and comes up with a window that reads:</p>
<p>

<p>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</p>

<p>Since the current Fast Ring build is 16232, try running Disk Cleanup and then the Windows Update Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use <strong>cleanmgr /sageset </strong>and select all options, followed by
<strong>cleanmgr /sagerun </strong>to delete the preselected items (for Disk Cleanup). That should get rid of the remnants of build 16226.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late response.&nbsp; I was uninstalling anything with Visual C++, which was installed by another program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is an old laptop with Windows 7 installed.&nbsp; I am dual booting with Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<p>This setup has not given me any problems since I started with Insider Builds in 2014.</p>
<p>I have no idea why the installation boot manager sees the installation drive as E:.&nbsp; Microsoft does not let us look under the hood during setup the way they have in the past.</p>

<p>Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did the trick.&nbsp; I believe this should be a sticky on the feedback hub.&nbsp; This should be the first step anyone should take when they build installation problems.&nbsp; The previous build was a little wonky.&nbsp; It would hang at the login screen and I would have
 to do a hard reset with the power button on the PC.&nbsp; It would also tell me that the video driver had failed when the computer was brought out of sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listed below are the steps I took:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I ran Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; You can access it by clicking on the Start Menu (Windows Logo) and typing it in.</li><li>Select the drive with your Windows Operating System installed on it (it will have a Windows Logo next to it, usually drive C:\)</li><li>When the Disk Cleanup window appears, click on the "Clean up system files" button on the bottom left.</li><li>Check the box for any files you want to remove.&nbsp; I selected all because my personal files are backed up on other devices.</li><li>Click "OK".</li></ol>
<p>Windows Update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Next, I ran Windows Update Troubleshooter.&nbsp; You can access it by clicking on the Start Menu (Windows Logo) and typing in "Troubleshoot".&nbsp; It is also located in Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Troubleshoot.</li><li>Click on "Windows Update".</li><li>When asked to "Download and Install pending updates", click "Skip this fix".</li><li>It should ask if you want to delete pending update files and download fresh versions.</li><li>Apply all other fixes and close the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to restart your computer after doing this.&nbsp; Hope this helps anyone in the future.</p>

                    I upgraded to a new Dell laptap with Windows 7&nbsp;and purchased Office 365 Pro-Plus. Previously I have been using Windows 7 and&nbsp;Outlook 2007&nbsp;synced to my gmail account. This has worked for 5+ years with no problems.&nbsp;After installing&nbsp;Office 365 on my new laptop&nbsp;I
 synced&nbsp;Outlook to my gmail account. All emails in the Inbox, [Gmail} folder<em>,</em> and most of the generic folders were imported. All my sub folders(the ones I created over the past few&nbsp;years)&nbsp;under the Inbox were also imported, but the emails in them are
 not in those folders. I can add new emails received to these folders and they are visible. However, no old emails are visible. The entire set of folders and all their contents are visible in gmail. I have spent a few hours on the phone with Microsoft reps
 and they have been unable to fix it to date. How can I get the contents of these folders visible. (A few notes: IMAP is enabled on gmail, syncing works without errors, we have set up a new Windows Profile and new Office 365 profiles, but the same problem continues)

<h2>            Switching views on a form to a datasheet does not keep record in focus</h2>
                    <p>I am using this vba code to switch views between form and datasheet (and vice versa)</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p>Private Sub ScheduleNo_Click()<br />

DoCmd.RunCommand (acCmdDatasheetView)<br />
ElseIf Me.CurrentView = 2 Then<br />

End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>After the view change, the recordset returns me to the first record in the sort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a code to keep the record in focus and in sort order.&nbsp; yet still give access to all records either in datasheet view or form view?&nbsp;</p>

            In my own tests, switching the view doesn't change the current record.&nbsp; Are you doing something else via VBA or macro, in some other event, that would change the record?

<p>there are only 3 events on this form.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first field "EmployeeNo" has the switch view VBA as shown above.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is single click event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1st date field has a "AfterUpdate" vba code event to update 6 other day of week fields.&nbsp; (this is a work schedule table)</p>
<p>The&nbsp; Form has a "Current" VBA event which updates the table with actual POS sales based on the schedule date and the POS table when the form becomes Current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The form opens in Datasheet by default.&nbsp; ScheduleNo = 1040</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first test; In Datasheet view, I cursor down to another employee number = 1050 ; single click the&nbsp;</p>
<p>ScheduleNo and the form opens with the first record number = 1040.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My second test; With the view in FORM, I advance the records using the record selector at the bottom of the form to ScheduleNo = 1050.&nbsp; &nbsp; I single click and this time the datasheet displays with the correct ScheduleNo = 1050.&nbsp; The same number as was shown
 on the form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next text:&nbsp; With the view in DATASHEET, I cursor down to select 1060.&nbsp; When I click on this and then form 1050 displays.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Results, </p>
<p>1. While at form 1060, when I change views from Datasheet to Form view, record which was still current in the last form view (1050) is the record to be displayed in the Form View again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When in Form View, I increment the forms to 1060 and change views from Form View to Datasheet, the record displaying in the form view 1060 is the record displaying in the Datasheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next test; while in DataSheet, I increment to another form (1065) and edit a field in a that record to insure that the record 1065 is Current.&nbsp; I then select the ScheduleNo and the view changes to Form with the Record 1060 in focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going from datasheet to form is having the problem.&nbsp; I can live with this but would like to understand the problem.&nbsp; Try it on your test db.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks, Gary</p>

<p>I can't reproduce this on my test form.&nbsp; Maybe I'm not correctly envisioning what you are doing, or maybe there's something about your form that I don't know about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused about something, which may or may not be relevant.&nbsp; Do you have two different fields, one named "EmployeeNo" and one named "ScheduleNo"?&nbsp; Or are you using these two different names interchangeably for the same control?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question, hoping to identify some difference in what we're doing:&nbsp; when you say, "I cursor down to another employee number = 1050 ; single click the&nbsp;ScheduleNo and the form opens with the first record number = 1040," are you clicking on ScheduleNo
 on the line that is actually showing 1050?&nbsp; Any time you click on&nbsp;any row of the datasheet, that row will become current -- I'd say, "of course", but maybe something odd is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally, what is the code you have in your Current event?</p>

<p>Dirk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about my delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The statement regarding EmployeeNo was a typo.&nbsp; EmployeeNo does not figure into this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The issue regarding the Datasheet bringing the previously opened record in form view is consistent on all of my view switching forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; When switching from form when on record 1050 with that field in focus, the datasheet displays with that record and field in focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; When switching from DS to Form after scrolling down to another form but remaining on that field, the form view will come up with record 1050 in focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Analysis: Datasheet switching to Form returns the last record that the form was on.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is true even if I edit a field in datasheet mode on the current form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is consistent with all the form switching that I am programming.&nbsp; I am using the following code for both Click and doubleClick.</p>
<p>
<em>Private Sub ScheduleNo_Click()</em><br />
<br />
<em>If Me.CurrentView = 1 Then</em><br />
<em>DoCmd.RunCommand (acCmdDatasheetView)</em><br />
<em>ElseIf Me.CurrentView = 2 Then</em><br />
<em>DoCmd.RunCommand (acCmdFormView)</em><br />
<em>End If</em><br />
<em>End Sub</em>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Finally, you ask for my Current code on that form.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a code at update sales information on the schedule form.</p>
<p>
<em>Private Sub Form_Current()</em><br />
<em>[1ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [1MonDate]")</em><br />
<em>[2ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [2TueDate]")</em><br />
<em>[3ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [3WedDate]")</em><br />
<em>[4ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [4ThuDate]")</em><br />
<em>[5ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [5FriDate]")</em><br />
<em>[6ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [6SatDate]")</em><br />
<em>[7ActualVol] = DLookup("GrossReceipts", "tblMicrosSysbalDaily", "RecordDate = [7SunDate]")</em><br />
<em>[TtlEstVol] = Me.txtTtlEstVol</em><br />
<em>[TtlActualVol] = Me.txtTtlActualVol</em><br />
<em>End Sub</em>

<p>
</p><p>That is very odd.&nbsp; I cannot reproduce this behavior.&nbsp; Are you able to create a copy of your database with any sensitive information removed, and post it on a file-sharing service like OneDrive or Dropbox where I can downloaded it for further investigation?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I am using the following code for both Click and doubleClick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>You mean you have that view-switching code in both the Click and DblClick events of ScheduleNo?&nbsp; That should be redundant, and possibly cause unexpected results, because when you double-click a control, both of those events fire -- first the Click event,
 then the DblClick event.&nbsp; So the view-switch code should then execute twice.&nbsp; Does that happen?&nbsp; What happens if you take it out of the DblClick event?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just as a test, what happens if you remove the event procedure from the Current event?&nbsp; I don't see how that could have any effect, but just conceivably it could affect the timing of things.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting that.&nbsp; I was able to reproduce the problem and pin it down to a factor I hadn't considered.&nbsp; It seems to be a bug that occurs only for PopUp forms.&nbsp; Your form's PopUp property is set to Yes, which you hadn't mentioned and I hadn't tested.&nbsp;
 With it set that way, it shows the incorrect behavior you described.&nbsp; If I change the PopUp property to No, then it behaves correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I think this is a bug, and I'll report it to the Microsoft Access product team.&nbsp; It's not just a problem with the view-switching, either -- after switching the view, even references to Me.Recordset raise an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for how you can work around it -- if the form really has to be a popup form -- I've found that this works:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Private Sub BegTime_DblClick(Cancel As Integer)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '*** BEGIN Crazy workaround for bug<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim formName As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim currentPosition As Long</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formName = Me.Name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; currentPosition = Me.Recordset.AbsolutePosition&nbsp; ' save current position<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '*** END Crazy workaround for bug<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case Me.CurrentView<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 1: RunCommand acCmdDatasheetView<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 2: RunCommand acCmdFormView<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '*** BEGIN Crazy workaround for bug<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms(formName).Recordset.AbsolutePosition = currentPosition<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '*** END Crazy workaround for bug</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">End Sub</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The change in the view-switching code itself -- "Select Case" instead of "If .. ElseIf" and elimination of the unnecessary "DoCmd" -- is just a simplification of your original code, and not relevant to the fix.&nbsp; While I think it's
 better this way, those changes aren't important.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I should mention that this fix only works if the form is a main form, not a subform on another form, and only if it's a default instance of the form.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp; It worked!... as I am sure that you expected.&nbsp; Regarding the Select Case issue on my original code, I see what you mean.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; PopUp is important in how the application appears.&nbsp; It is easier for me to see that it is a separate form and can
 be handled individually easier.&nbsp; I can now use this new code in several forms that need switching back and forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Image Rotation Issue in Windows 7 IE10</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Hi All,</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Good afternoon.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We would like to ask support from you regarding our issue on one of our application running in Windows 7 IE10.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One of the function of our application rotates an image by 90,180,270 degrees using DX Matrix Filter.</div>
<div>However, there are images that cannot be rotated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This issue does not happen in Windows XP IE7.</div>
<div>The issue is also resolved if "Use Software Rendering instead of GPU rendering" is checked in IE10 setting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue also occurs only on specific machines.</div>
<div>Please find below details.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u><b>Issue occurs using below machine Specs:</b></u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>System Manufacturer: DELL</div>
<div>RAM: 2048MB</div>
<div>Total Available Graphics Memory: 256MB</div>
<div>Dedicated Video Memory: 0MB</div>
<div>System Video Memory: 64MB</div>
<div>Shared System Memory: 192MB</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u><b>Issue&nbsp;<font color="#ff0000">Does Not</font>&nbsp;occur using below machine Specs.</b></u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>System Manufactured: HP</div>
<div>
<div>RAM: 4096MB</div>
<div>Total Available Graphics Memory: 1546MB</div>
<div>Dedicated Video Memory: 64MB</div>
<div>System Video Memory: 0MB</div>
<div>Shared System Memory: 1482MB</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, kindly advise on below:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;a. Is there is a minimum video requirement for Windows 7 IE10?</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;b. IE7 doesn't have "Use Software Rendering instead of GPU rendering" in its setting, what does IE7 being used by default? Is it software rendering or GPU rendering?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks,</div>

            <p>Hello Amie, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank You for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you have issue while using the Internet Explorer in Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But, in order to help you better I would need some more information on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Is this issue specific to one particular website?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Have you tried any troubleshooting steps?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the mean while follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>DirectX-based Filters and Transitions (DX filters) are obsolete in Internet Explorer 10 for webpages in the Internet Zone. By default, they are disabled for webpages in the Local Intranet and Trusted Sites zones, but can be enabled
 for selected document modes. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>DX filters are no longer supported</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh801215(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc"><strong>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh801215(v=vs.85).aspx</strong></font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Here are the answers to the question you had. </div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>a) Here are the requirements for Internet Explorer 10 mentioned in the below link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Internet Explorer system requirements</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/ie-system-requirements#ie=ie-10-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/ie-system-requirements#ie=ie-10-win-7</font></a>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
</p><div>b) Here is the answer to the question about "<strong>what is software rendering or GPU rendering".</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Software rendering" depends on the CPU to do generate the screen elements. The problem is that the CPU is busy doing other "stuff" at the same time, which could slow down screen painting.<br />
<br />
"GPU rendering" hands off much of the screen drawing to the Graphics card. In theory this can be better/faster if you have a high power graphics card for a few reasons:<br />
â€¢the GPU isn't as busy as the CPU which is doing "everything" else<br />
<br />
â€¢GPU is optimized for graphics, CPU isn't (CPU has to do more calculations)<br />
â€¢many GPU's are designed to process graphics commands in parallel, CPU single threads them<br />
â€¢GPU has dedicated memory it does not have to share with other CPU based apps.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>Also, post your question in the TechNet forums because they have more expertise on the issue to help you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">TechNet Forums for 7</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

            Hi Shalini,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please see below answers to your questions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>1) Is this issue specific to one particular website?</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - This also happens to other site which includes rotation of images</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Have you tried any troubleshooting steps?</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - We conducted some monitoring on GPU usage when loading particular images.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GPU usage is high on images which encounters the issue..around 200+MB considering total graphics memory of the machine that encountered issue is only 256MB.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Did the issue occur because IE uses GPU rendering and total graphics memory is only 256MB?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong>DirectX-based Filters and Transitions (DX filters) are obsolete in Internet Explorer 10 for webpages in the Internet Zone. By default, they are disabled for webpages in the Local Intranet and Trusted Sites zones, but can be enabled
 for selected document modes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Render legacy filter is enabled in Local Intranet and Trusted Site. IE10 is also using Compatibility View</div>
<div><br />
<div>"GPU rendering" hands off much of the screen drawing to the Graphics card. In theory this can be better/faster if you have a high power graphics card for a few reasons:<br />
â€¢the GPU isn't as busy as the CPU which is doing "everything" else</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- from the above statement, if GPU rendering will be used, is it advisable to have high power graphics card? if so, what graphics card specs can you recommend?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>thanks,</div>

            <p>You would need to contact the computer manufacture for options for graphics cards and or updated drivers for built in graphics or adding ram/ memory,</p>
<p>Common dedicated Video cards vary usually a asus 1 gig card is awesome but they all have minimum or recommended&nbsp;power supply requirements of 300 watts,</p>
<p>Here's a good place to start,</p>

            Hi ThrashZone,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your suggestion.</div>
<div>I just wanna confirm if the root cause of the issue we encountered is because of the graphics card currently used given that our application displays some big images and rotate them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hi Shalini,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you think it is because of the graphics card?</div>

            <p>Yes the one or more machines that don't have at least I gig or 1024mb graphics memory are having the issues,</p>
<p>The ones with 1546mg aren't,</p>
<p>So it's an easy upgrade,</p>

            <p>Hi, New Activation licences have been issued. Therefore in Windows Insider find the Quest "Validate activation status on your Windows 10 Technical Preview device" and do this for the Home or Pro version whichever you use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update will&nbsp;NOT work on the old licence. Everyone will have to do the Quest</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait for a while reboot and check you are on the "Fast" ring for windows update and check for updates. Took 45 minutes at least to get access to new 10166. after reboot.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have dug out my old Nokia N97 which, has definitely seen better days!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question; If broken, i.e touch screen no longer works, but still charges, currently does not turn on (Still charging, so this may change) Can I, somehow retrieve all my old photos? Is it a possibility to get it repaired?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions as there are a lot of memories stored on this phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You need to disable reset protection and then use the Windows Mobile device recovery tool.&nbsp; If reset protection is already disabled just use the tool:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue makes disabling reset protection a bit of a hassle. You most likely won't be able to get the recovery key from&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=615903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>account.microsoft.com/resetprotection</span></a><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;or
 be able to disable reset protection in the settings, or do a soft reset. All due to this issue. So you have to do a hard reset. Then when it asks you to disable reset protection enter the MS Account/Pass that was used the first time setup failed. Stop here.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;At
 this&nbsp;point,&nbsp;you have only disabled reset protection. You have not&nbsp;set up a MS&nbsp;Account that comes later in the setup. Do not&nbsp; try to set up&nbsp;a MS&nbsp;account on the phone, because doing so automatically re-enables&nbsp;reset protection.<span>&nbsp;Plug the phone into&nbsp;</span>your<span>&nbsp;computer
 and use the device recovery tool.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Domain based rule to filter&#47;sort emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andr&#233; antunes da cunha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Domain based rule to filter&#47;sort emails</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
With the new so called "Advanced Rules for sorting new messages" I am failing to find out how to do a simple domain based rule to sort my incoming email.<br />
<br />
What I had before the update: "If sender email ends with &lt;somedomain.com&gt; then move to &lt;somefolder&gt;". That kind of worked (although if I receive an email from &lt;gruesomedomain.com&gt; it would also be matched, which is bad).<br />
<br />
Now, the closest one I got is "Sender contains" and could not find any documentation or explanation of possible wildcards or operators.<br />
<br />
With this, I could try to use a rule like "Sender contains &lt;somedomain.com&gt;" to "Do the following: Move to &lt;somefolder&gt;", but, in addition to the aforementioned problem in parenthesis, now this is even worsened by the fact that I would be using "contains" instead
 of "ends with". Furthermore, now I can not even start a filter with the character @ (at), which I could before the update (to use like "If sender email ends with &lt;@somedomain.com&gt;", although it would fail to match emails of the same domain ending like &lt;news.somedomain.com&gt;).<br />
<br />
Where can I find some in depth explanation of the new rules? How can I properly set a domain rule?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope that you are doing well. I'm Wayne from Microsoft Community and I have read your post and I understand that you have some questions regarding the recent changes in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to inform you that we have simulated this issue in our end and the missing "@" sign when creating a rule starting with "@" is by design. Though don't worry as it would still be working with or without the @ sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The @ sign though would still show if you provide a specific email address (i.e.&nbsp;
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) in the rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding your other query with "ends with" rule, we also have simulated this and this as well is by design. I strongly suggest that you check out the Outlook.com blog in this article I'll give you concerning the recent changes done in Outlook.com for more
 information and if you have further questions:</p>

            Hello Wayne_C., thank you very much for your reply!<br />
<br />
I already have read that blog entry before posting my question and unfortunately it does not seem to explain possible wildcards and logical operators (i.e. 'and', 'or', 'not') for matching. With your answer, I am not sure if there is a documentation somewhere,
 since the suggested blog entry does not even mention this.<br />
<br />
But so, while I can see that it would still match without beginning with "@", the problem is that different domains with the same ending would both be matched. I just wanted to know if there is some way to do a proper domain filter, and if the answer is no
 I would like to hear it (it is way better than losing time trying to guess by myself).<br />
<br />
Perhaps my original question was not clear enough, so I will try to give a simple example:<br />
Received 3 emails: one from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", one from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and one from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".<br />
With one filter I would like to match the first two (both are from the same domain: "bar.com"), without matching the last one (which is from a different domain: "notbar.com").<br />
Is that possible? (yes or no?)<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for your attention!

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information that you've provided and we understand the inconvenience this issue has caused you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that by using "Sender contains" option when creating email rules, there are other domains that also goes to your folder, what we can suggest is to create another rule for that specific domain (example, "notbar.com") and move it to
 your Inbox so that it will not mix up your specific folder.</p>
<p>

            Hello Eugene R., thank you for your consideration!<br />
<br />
Your suggestion is already what I have been using since the Outlook.com changes. Unfortunately, it only "helps", but the very same problem persists: if, then, I receive an email from "cannotbar.com", it would be matched to the "notbar.com" filter and improperly
 moved to the same folder. The suggestion, and perhaps the best approach then, is like a cat and mouse game.<br />
<br />
From the answers I have received up until now, it seems I can assume that a proper domain filter is impossible and that there is no accessible documentation/explanation about wildcards and operators anywhere.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you for your time and answers and please let me know if my assumption is wrong!

            Did it ever get solved? The newest update 3 years later, just took out all my filters that had been working for several years, now I can no longer create domain based filters, that I guess they allowed for a window of time.

<h2>            Copying Ms Word for Mac to email Issues</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac to Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac (Version 15.21.1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What used to be a simple process of copying and pasting text from a Word doc to email now does not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to copy and paste text from email messages or web pages to to email messages.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue seems to be with Microsoft Word 2016. </p>
<p>Is there any reason why this is happening? Can I change something in settings to make it work?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the additional details. Unfortunately, I'm not able to reproduce what you're reporting (also using OS X 10.10.5). Whatever I copy from a Word document pastes into a gmail, Apple Mail or Outlook message as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I have no idea how "someone's email address" even gets onto the Clipboard if it isn't something you're actually copying. The standard Clipboard behavior is that it will retain the last information copied, but only until you copy something else.
 IOW, the Clipboard contains only 1 body of content at a time, that being the last content copied. Are you using any sort of utility or 3rd party clipboard management program? I'm also curious as to why
<strong>Show Clipboard</strong> isn't listed in your Finder's Edit menu - it's a standard command which is what's being found by the Search you're doing, but a Search shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if some basic steps will resolve the issue;</p>

<li>Launch Apple's <strong>Disk Utility</strong> &amp; run <em>Repair Disk Permissions</em> on your HD.</li><li><strong>Restart</strong> your Mac.</li><li>See if the issue persists.</li></ol>

                    <p>Below is the contact card for my work email, we use Outlook 2010. How do I remove the highlighted "scott heitpas" text from the top of my contact card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how it got there, but I cant figure out how to edit or delete it. I believe it's the name of a co-worker I had to look up in my address book awhile back, not sure why it is appearing here though. Fairly random and annoying.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Bluetooth searching... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zandex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth searching...</h2>
                    
<p>Want some help in figuring out how the bluetooth service works on Windows Phone 7. I have been experiencing battery drain, and thought it relates to one of the services on the device. So, I did a hard reset of the device and fully charge the battery. Took
 the phone off its over-night charge at 6:00am. Basically I have disabled the&nbsp;WiFI, however bluetooth was left on. There are no bluetooth headset paired, I've not done this yet. Here is what I am now observing on the device:</p>
<p>1. 6:30am - Battery life has lost 15% or more..</p>
<p>2. Bluetooth option - Showing "Seaching..." and this is forever!!</p>
<p>I observe that if phone has not been paired with any bluetooth device, then it will forever be locked in the "searching / discovery" mode. This will have an impact on the battery, hence the drain in 30mins.&nbsp;Why doesnt it stop searching after x seconds? To
 further my test, I decided to pair the Plantronic 900x headset to the phone. All I did was to turn on the headset into pair mode, and the phone found it. Suggesting that "searching" is for real and the device was always searching (never stopped).</p>
<p>I wanted to take this a bit further in my testing. So I grab another bluetooth device, this time the Rocketfish Headset MB. Place this new headset into pair mode, and bam -- WP7 found the headset and ready to pair with it. All this testing suggest to me
 that WP7 is always searching for a bluetooth device with that single option turned on "Searching and Discoverable"...</p>
<p>Something is missing here, how do I turn on the bluetooth service without automatically getting the "searching and discoverable" always on? Am I not getting it? All I want here is to enable bluetooth, and not the searching feature. If this the case, it means
 that I will&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;see the battery issue I'm now getting on the Samsung Focus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Zandex,</p>
<p>The design is to have the phone only be discoverable and searching for BT devices&nbsp;while in the Bluetooth control panel. WP7 device will not stop searching for the BT devices if you do not leave the Bluetooth settings. Keep mind that if the screen time-out
 is active the search would stop after the device time-out (default settings is 1 minute).</p>
<p>I have tested it with my Samsung Omnia 7 and the feature worked as expected:</p>
<p>Open Settings - Bluetooth (control panel)<br />
Turn ON BT (the device would be also searching and discoverable for other BT devices)<br />
Verify that the phone is discoverable (from a PC or another phone)<br />
Exit the Bluetooth control panel<br />
Verify that the phone is no longer discoverable (from a PC or another phone)</p>
<p>Maybe your phone got stuck into searching mode after you exit the Bluetooth settings, restarting the device should fix the issue.</p>
<p>Best Regards<br />
Martin V.</p>

<h2>            Onenote for iPad won&#39;t sign in with my Office 365 account for synching</h2>
                    <p>I am signed in OneNote on my iPad with my Office 365 work account. I noticed that there is a message in a yellow bar at the top of the OneNote page that says "Sign in to sync this notebook". I click on the "Sign In" link and it takes me to a Sign In page
 that wants me to provide my "Microsoft account" info. When I put in my Office 365 credentials it says "That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tells me it is wanting a non-Office 365 account like Hotmail or Outlook.com account. It will not take my Office 365 info. I want to sync with my Office 365 account and not a personal account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a triangle with an exclamation point inside of it that when clicked on shows a message that it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't sync section</p>
<p>We need the password to sync this notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Error code: 0xE0000024) https://d.docs.live.net/08a9f9c50d2...........</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this is trying to sync to a non-existent WIndows Live account or something similar. Why won't this work with my Office 365 account?&nbsp;</p>

<li>Signing out of OneNote in the app</li><li>Double clicking on the iPad Home button and then swipping up on OneNote to make sure it was closed out</li><li>Going into Settings, scrolling down and selecting OneNote in the applications list on the lefthand side of the screen</li><li>Selecting the "Reset OneNote" option and selecting the "Delete All Notebooks" and "Delete Login Credentials" options.&nbsp;</li><li>Then restarting the iPad</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to sync with my Office 365 account now.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Excel 2016 from composing a new email when I click a cell with an email address&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use a Mac with Excel 2016. On a daily basis, I update and reference a customer management spreadsheet. I use an online email server (Go Daddy) and regularly need to copy &amp; paste email addresses from the spreadsheet into new emails. However, every time
 I click on a cell, Excel creates a new email with "Mail" even though I do not have a "Mail" account and do not want one. &nbsp;I would like to permanently disable this feature. I do not want to have to manually do it each time I add a new addresses. &nbsp;Thanks in
 advance for any advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Feedback for software designers:</strong> &nbsp;I would be great if you built in a pop-up that asked your Excel users initial questions like "what email server do you use?" and "would you like Excel linked to your email server?". &nbsp;It is a shame that you
 are assuming your Mac users use "Mail" when statistics will probably show that most Excel and Mac use other servers like gmail, hotmail, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Excel doesn't <em>assume</em> anything :-) It directs email output to the locally installed email client program (not an email
<em>server</em>) designated as the default on your Mac. The email client directs outgoing messages to the server associated with your email account. Use
<strong>Mail&gt; Preferences</strong> in Apple's Mail app to select the default email program. My understanding is that if you access email strictly through your browser (which may be the case with GoDaddy) Excel cannot direct output to it.</p>
