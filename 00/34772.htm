    <title>Internet connection lost after switching between accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieln92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet connection lost after switching between accounts</h2>
                    <p>I performed&nbsp;"Refresh" from advanced startup prior to having this problem.&nbsp; My problem is as follows: In the first account, I put a file for download and locks the computer. Internet is fine at this moment but when another user in my PC logs in his account,
 my internet connection in&nbsp; the first account is lost. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was working perfectly fine before I refreshed my PC, not sure if it was any settings I made prior to make this work but I cant remember them now. I would appreciate any help to resolve this problem quickly.</p>

                    <p>I have just brought a new laptop and when trying to install any programs i get hit with the Error 1935 code every time. I can't find any straight answers on what it is. I'm not super techy but can someone help me out on what this is and how I can fix it?
</p>
<p>I feel like a brand new been used for 20 minutes laptop shouldn't be having any problems...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Megan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, please answer few queries.</p>
<p>1. What is the make, and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>2. What is the Complete error message/code you receive?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you receive a 1935 error when you try to install software, the Windows file system transaction log has become corrupted.
</span><span>To correct this install error, you need to clear the log. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest that you try the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>1. Open an Administrator command prompt. To do this, press <strong>Windows key + X
</strong>keys together and choose <strong>Command Prompt(Admin). </strong></p>
<p>2. Now type, <strong>fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. This assumes that C: is the drive in which Windows 10 is installed. If it is installed on another drive like D:, please change the drive letter appropriately.</p>
<p>4. Restart the system and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your reply is very important for us to ensure a proper resolution. Please get back to us with the above information in order to assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows installer keeps starting up and aksing for a &#42;.msi file</h2>
                    Every time I start my computer the windows installer file pops up "preparing to install" - and then asks for a .msi file (status.msi; PSSWCORE.msi are the 2 I get the most).&nbsp; What is going on - this just started happening 1-2 weeks ago.

<p><span><span><span>Hi Peteharper,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank you for posting your question.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>It is a Start up item which is triggered automatically every time the computer starts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can get rid of the error by placing the computer </span><span><span><span>in clean boot mode.<br />
In clean boot mode only the Microsoft service will be running and all the third party service will be disabled.
<br />
<br />
As you are facing this issue during startup, in the “System Configuration Utility” you may directly go to “Startup” tab and then look for the entry which relates to the error message that we receive during startup. Once you have found it, uncheck the tick mark
 and apply the settings. <br />
<br />
That should help us in resolving the issue.<br />

<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, OEM licenses can only be installed on the same computer where they were pre-installed. Is this the situation?

    <title>Xbox one Media Remote interfering with other things in my room - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one Media Remote interfering with other things in my room</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys. I've just bought an official Media Remote for my xbox one, and it's a lovely bit of kit but unfortunately I have a strange problem with it. I have two sets of LED lights that are operated with two separate remote controls in my room, and for some
 reason the xbox one media remote is controlling them?! For example, If I'm on the home screen and I try and navigate with the d-pad on the media remote, every left, right, up or down press changes the mode/colour on both sets of lights in my room?! It doesn't
 do this with the control pad though? I would have thought the media remote and the control pad communicate with the xbox in the same way, but the media remote must use a different signal somehow? It's definitely the actual media remote that's causing the problem
 and not the signal being relayed from the Kinect. If I say "xbox volume up" for example, and it sends a signal to my amp to turn the volume up, my LED lights don't get affected. But if I press the volume up button on the media remote, both sets of LED lights
 change their mode/colour. As you can imagine, this is REALLY annoying and kinda ruins the whole experience. I highly doubt there is going to be any way around it, but thought I'd post a message to make sure just incase.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The Xbox One Media Remote uses a infrared (IR) transmitter, which is fairly common in television remotes and it's probably the same technology used to control your LED lights which is the problem your running into.</p>
<p>The Xbox One controller users a different technology which is why you don't have that problem with the controller as you do with the media remote.</p>
<p>IR requires a straight line to the console in order to control it, so you essentially need to move the LED lights IR module away from the console so when you attempt to use the media remote, the LED lights don't detect it. I'm not sure if this is a feasible
 option but that's probably your only option.</p>

    <title>Program Hang on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> socceteer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program Hang on Windows 7</h2>
                    I have windows 7 installed for about 6 months. At the same time I installed a home automation program called ActiveHome. Just last week I started the program and during the start it asked me about security and if I wanted to allow the program to start.
 There was an option to change the computer security so I opened that option and set the security not to ask anymore.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From that point on i have been unable to start that program. When I open the program it shows on my task bar as open, but on the desktop all I get is a black area on the screen and when I move the mouse over that area the cursor turns into as if it was
 loading the program.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program, I have deleted the folder and the program is still hanging.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any thoughts of where I can go to fix this...? I have scanned the registry&nbsp;with CCleane&nbsp;for error and is does not sow any errors with ActiveHome</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Which security software is installed on your computer?<br />
Which security pop-up did you get, is it windows or any third party security pop-up?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the software completely from Windows installer clean up utility.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Download Windows installer cleanup utility from the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Once you have uninstalled the program completely perform a clean boot, here is the link:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then, try installing the program and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also
</span><span>I would suggest you to download the latest drivers for the software from manufacturer’s website install it and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Please respond back with the status of the issue and let us know
 if you have any issues.</span></span></p>

    <title>Issue with Windows 10 Photo Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue with Windows 10 Photo Gallery</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Photo Gallery will not run on my Windows 10 Home (Version 1511, Build 10586.494) desktop PC. &nbsp;I got the answer that I needed to install Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition. &nbsp;I went to www.microsoft.com and downloaded and installed the software
 and rebooted. &nbsp;I still get the same message!! &nbsp;I am running Windows 10 on a machine with 16GB RAM and an AMD A10-G6800K enhanced quadcore CPU with Radeon Graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After getting the message telling me I need the SQL server, if I click on "Go to Download Center" I then get an error message which disappears too quickly for me to read the error code! &nbsp;Photo Gallery closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what I can do to get Photo Gallery to run on my PC. &nbsp;I DO have Windows Essentials 2012 previously installed on the machine (version 16.4.3528.0331). &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. The issue is specific to Windows Photo Gallery - I thought that was quite clear!</p>
<p>2. No, I did not make any changes prior to trying to use Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>3. No - read my question again! &nbsp;The error message appears and disappears within a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand your comment about reinstalling the program. &nbsp;I didn't install it in the first instance. &nbsp;It came with Windows 7 or 10, I don't know which. &nbsp;I am disappointed that, having found it and having tried to use it, it doesn't work!</p>

</p><p>I apologize for the delay in responding. Are you still facing this issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is you PC connected to a domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the apps troubleshooter which can automatically check and detect most of the app related issues:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to reset the Windows store cache. Press Windows key +R, type "Wsreset.exe' and then check if the issue persists.</p>

<li>Yes, the PC is connected to a domain.</li><li>The AppsDiagnostic.diagcab cannot be used by Windows 10! (By the way: The built-in troubleshooter for Windows Update detects and fixes 0x80070490 but with no impact for the Windows Store updates!)<br />
</li><li>Wsreset.exe didn't help either.<br />

            <p>I am having a similar problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a 64-bit version of Win 10 Home on my HP Stream laptop with no problem. &nbsp;I can install new apps from Store OK, and the apps I have installed are being updated automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet, running a 32-bit version of Win 10 Home, it is another story. &nbsp;I cannot install new apps from the Store, nor are updates being installed. &nbsp;I now have 22 updates pending; all efforts to install them have failed. &nbsp;In
 every case the error code is 0x80073CF9. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the fix you suggested - to reset the Store cache. &nbsp;Nothing changed; attempts to "Try that again" for previously-failed downloads ended up with the same failed results and error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on a suggestion from another thread, I checked to see if I had an "AppReadiness" folder in the C:\Windows folder on my Dell tablet. &nbsp;I did not, so I manually created one. &nbsp;Made no difference. &nbsp;App updates still fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It mystifies me why everything related to the Store works fine on my HP Stream and not at all on my Dell tablet. &nbsp;However, there may be a clue. &nbsp;One of the failed updates on my tablet is a 123.3 MB update to the Store software itself. &nbsp;It is possible that
 whatever changes are in that update may resolve the failures for the other 21 pending updates - but I cannot download and install the Store update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! &nbsp;My apps are getting further and further out-of date, and I cannot install new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phil</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;Let me be specific about these failed updates. &nbsp;What is actually happening is a download failure, rather than an installation failure. &nbsp;When I click the "Retry" circle icon, each of them will begin the download process, showing "0 of xxx MB downloaded"
 and then stop. &nbsp;Nothing actually downloads for any of them. &nbsp;Yet Windows Updates are downloading and installing OK; my OS is up-to-date. &nbsp;The download issue only applies to apps.</p>

            <p>I ended up doing essentially the same thing that aureole82 reported on February 17th, except that I used the "Reset" option within my installed Windows 10 Home software. &nbsp;In fact, I have used this option on two different PCs to address Windows 10 issues.
 &nbsp;The refresh took about a half a day, including re-installation of applications software that was automatically deleted during the &nbsp;process. &nbsp;Since completion, everything has worked the way it is supposed to.</p>

            <p>I faced this problem for months, i also tried every possible way given in every existing forum; but nothing worked. Finally, i fresh installed windows 10 and it is perfectly fine now. I can download any app from windows store, I know it's a bit annoying
 but i think that's the only way. I expected a solution for this from windows....</p>

<p>Opening Windows Store I have 14 updates inside the queue. All failed! Some with the code

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Ok. Do you think that's weird?!</em><br />

I could do that for hours even days. It seems that even the installed updates are not installed!

<p>I have recently found a&nbsp;simpler solution, so I will just leave it here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it thanks to this feedback message:</p>
<p>feedback-hub:?contextid=319&amp;feedbackid=0664ce32-7d79-4c58-a61a-f16fc2bb1bae&amp;form=1&amp;src=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, in order to be able to install your apps correctly, you need to go to Settings/System/Storage and change the setting that says 'New apps will save to:' and select the drive where Windows is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that external storage support is still a bit on the rough side... I will send some feedback to MS as well.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I&nbsp;had&nbsp;asked my boss (wife) if I could blow away the PC and start from scratch, but was&nbsp;told no. SO, I am going to wait for the&nbsp;Anniversary edition&nbsp;of Windows 10 next month, which should perform an upgrade and hopefully fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think Microsoft would be concerned with the number of people who are receiving this error and come up with a fix better than "Reset your Windows 10 PC and re-install all of your apps. But, good news! Your documents will still be there!"

<p>
</p><p>I think the issue lies with backward compatibility with Windows before 10 (old&nbsp;runtimes, etc.). I think it is time they build this&nbsp;OS for this century, and if we need to run older apps, have it run in some sort of segregated virtual environment.

                    <p>As the subject says. Anytime I'm playing an online game I crash (about every 10 minutes) and if I go to event viewer I can see that it's always caused by this security audit. Is there any way to fix this? (I have the code for it below btw)</p>

            Hi Zack, 
<br />
<br />So I found these links - <a href="https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventID=4624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securit...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/securi...</a>
<br />
<br />Looks like it’s a successful login event ID...
<br />
<br />And there is a 5 next to logon type. 
<br />
<br />5	Service	A service was started by the Service Control Manager.
<br />
<br />I feel like we have service that is kicking off, causing your game to crash, but what one?
<br />
<br />Hit the windows + r, and then type “msconfig” - go to the services tab. 
<br />
<br />There should be a button “hide all Microsoft services” - button that off. Disable the rest. Do a reboot, and then try to launch your game(s) 
<br />
<br />See if it crashes. If not, you could do a guess and check on the services by adding 1,2,3 back at a time. When it crashes, you know it’s one of those. 
<br />
<br />Give it a shot and let me know!
<br />- C

            I disabled everything except for Steam and BattleEye (because I can't run the game without those two enabled) and it still crashes. Still with the same 4624 code

            Ok, let’s try a 3rd party tool to clean up your sys files and the reg. 
<br />
<br />Download and install Ccleaner - <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download</a>
<br />
<br />After installing, run the cleaner, and then the registry tool. Run the registry tool until there are no more fixes to be made. Reboot. 
<br />
<br />See if this helps and let me know!

            I ran Fortnite and it still crashes. I also let my computer sit while running the Unigen Heaven benchmark for about 15 minutes and that didn't cause it to crash so I don't think it's a hardware issue.

<br />
<br />Click the Windows button - type “Device Manager” - and select it from the list of results.
<br />
<br />Expand Display adapters / Network adapters 
<br />
<br />right click on those drivers, and Update Driver Software...
<br />

<h2>            Family Safety does not report any recent activity for kids Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and had never previously used Family Safety (didn't know about it). &nbsp;I have my main admin login so I created a kids login to test how family safety works...but it reports no web activity at all, and does not allow me to block
 any apps (meaning...I see no way to do it, no drop down boxes, nothing but a heading implying I am looking at the spot where I should be able to block apps.) &nbsp;I can whitelist and blacklist just fine, but haven't tried any features other than these. &nbsp;I am really
 mainly wanting to see web activity so I hope there is some way to fix this.</p>
<p>BTW, I have verified my admin account, and the child's account. &nbsp;didn't change the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Dave</p>

            This is issue still persists with me. I was hoping that the most recent windows 10 update would fix this but this is not the case. I'm able to set time limits, but that's about it. At this rate, going back to windows 8.1 looks to be the best option at
 this point and I'm not really looking to do that. <br />

    <title>Removing payment options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tessabryan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing payment options</h2>
                    
<p>Having had a situation where my 3 year old son managed to order over £50 worth of live points, and then finding out its non refundable, I would like to remove my credit card from the system. However when I do it, it says that that it is unable to remove
 my credit card details at this time. My live me,bership is paid up for a year, and with already 6000 unwanted points on my account, I don't see why I should have to add another card or paypal. How do I get round this? Its a mater of urgency as I don't want
 it to happen again.</p>

<p>if you read the terms of use</p>
<p>it answers your own question</p>
<p>an creditcard cannot be removed from an active membership</p>
<p>the only way to do it is to call support turn off autorenewal and wait till the account turns silver</p>
<p>or if it is over 1month left on the membership then you can ask support to turn off autorenewal and remove the creditcard</p>
<p>in 5-7business days you will be issued a prepaid token for the remainder &nbsp;of your prepaid time</p>

<p>its a quick read i can read it in 2mins</p>
<p>shoul;dn't you have read the contract you signed?</p>
<p>if there is an active membership and renewal what else would they bill if you do not tell them to cancel</p>

<h2>            Windows &#47; Cortana search &#34;Results may be incomplete&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all - I just received a brand new Surface Pro 4 for the holidays, with Windows 10 etc. &nbsp;Search (i.e pressing windows-S and then typing in a search term) works fine with the first user account I created during the initial setup, but every other account
 I've tried to add has a problem - specifically some (many) items don't show up and there's a warning at the top of the search window that says "Results May Be Incomplete..." For instance if I search for Control Panel, it finds it. &nbsp;If I search for "users",
 it does not, even though on my first account searching for Users does return the Users item from the control panel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've Googled around for fixes and I've tried various fixes without success - I've seen other users complaining of the same behavior, like somehow after you create the first account during setup Windows doesn't quite know how to set up subsequent accounts
 propely. &nbsp;Fixes I've found online and tried without success includes running "sfc /scannow", making sure indexing complete, manually firing off a brand new rebuild of the index, etc. &nbsp;Is there any way to fix this? &nbsp;Its really disappointing for this to be happening
 in a brand new computer from Microsoft themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jennifer, thank you for your reply. &nbsp;I just got the Surface, and I've not tried to manually install any updates but of course I think by default it will try to install updates automatically and so some may have been installed that way. &nbsp;In any case,
 this is the behavior since I got the computer, it did not suddenly change - search works fine on the original account I created during setup, any account I have added after that however has the problem. &nbsp;I've added (and deleted) several accounts and they all
 end up with this problem - some are just local accounts, some are accounts tied to Microsoft accounts, but same issue regardless. &nbsp;

    <title>when trying to read a cdr with data on it. it says its a blank cd. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saborfox  say:</h3>
<h2>            when trying to read a cdr with data on it. it says its a blank cd.</h2>
                    
<p>has anybody else been having this issue. I have inserted 10 different cdr's 5 cd-r 5 cd+r, all with data and sessions closed. and it keeps telling me that the cd's are blank and keeps asking if i want to burn a cd. and dont want the same answer as ur cd/dvd
 might be bacd because i have tried it on 7 other machines running win7 and same thing. when i put the same 10 cd's in a vista or xp machine it reads them just fine. win7 is the only system that i have been seeing this issue with. and in order for me to even
 talk to a stupid microsoft tech rep i have to pay money for an answer to an issue with there own f*(&amp;^*&amp; software.</p>
<p>this is what i have done on all the machines, removed the upper and lower filter for the cd/dvd rom, uninstalled/reinstalled the drives. updated the drivers, took apart computers to clean the cd/dvd drives with can air and denatured alchol.&nbsp; and i am still
 getting the same chit. after inserting a burned cd in to the drive auto run starts and asks if i want to burn a cd. and it only does it with cd/dvdr's that i have burned.</p>
<p>the only cd/dvd that it will read is if it was massproduced program cd/dvd. and nothing that me or my friends/family has burned to a cd/dvd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thx and i am hoping that i am the only one having this issue and not others.</p>

<p>I never&nbsp;experience that kind of error on either my windows 7 or my dad's windows 7. Are your "other machines" mentioned in your first post have their windows 7 installed from<em>the same installation DVD</em>? If so, possibly that copy of windows 7 is faulty
 or pirated. Since you had cleaned the optical lens of the drive, and DVD±Rs are read correctly on vista/XP, what else could cause the problem?</p>
<p>Also, there is no CD+R, only CD-R (with minus sign) exists. I think they are DVD+R.</p>

<p>yusufat, the other macines running win7 was factory installed when bought 3 months ago, family aand friends systems. As for my systems that are running win7 i had bought the win7 ultimate x64. At first i thought it was a bad install disk also, so that is
 y i had tested them on different systems.</p>
<p>marilyn, the web link for microsft was not able to fix the issue because it told me to put in a cd/dvd media in the drive when in fact there was one alrdy in it. so the link is useless for the issue that is at hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quick fix link and the how to fix dont even come close to fixing the issue. what i think is the problem is that i use winxp pro for some of the cd's and the used vista ultimate x64 for the others. and in truth i think microsoft put there own burning
 software in there so we have to use theres and if we use a 3rd party program like nero or slysoft, win7 dont see that the cd is closed and reads it like it was blank.</p>
<p>and when i insert one of my cd/dvd that has some picture and some ebooks that i was to use, it asks me if i want to burn a cd/dvd. and when i try to add data to it to see if it will burn it comes back and says no space avialbe on media / media is bad, please
 insert media disk.</p>
<p>i have searched the net since i posted the first one and all the answers i have seen it that the cd/dvd drive is bad and need to replace it. if it was just my machine then i would think that the drive is bad. but because it has the same issue on different
 machines running win7, and no issues on machines running xp/vista, then the only conclusion i have came to is that win7 has issues that microsoft dont want to address unless they get alot of email and calls about the issue of not able to read cd/dvd's that
 was burned and not mass produced.</p>
<p>I guess that is why apple has become the number 1 in the computer industry right now and micrososft is falling out. and besides the cd/dvd issue i am having other issue's because i upgraded to office 2010x64 and i cannot even sync my windows mobile 6.5 phone
 to outlook and xfer info between the two. and after reading a knowladge base on it office 2010 x64 will not support syncing devices to it. the only fix for that is to downgrade to the office 2010 x86. for me that is not a solution because i have very large
 excel files, along with 200+ contacts that i use on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>marilyn, thx for the kb article, but still a no go. i even went has far as removing the drivers and removing the drive from the computer restarting and then shutting down, reinstalling the drive and letting windows reinstall defalt drivers for the drive.
 and still coming up wiht the same issue. at this point i have basic given up on reading my old cd's on this system, so i have basicly used my vista machine to copy the contents of the cd's to my external drive. and use my win7 system to reburn to a dvd. i
 know its a hassel but its the only way i can read them then that is what i have to do....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and again thx for the help on the artical. that article did help me on my xp system that i was having some issues with..</p>

<p>Hello saborfox,</p>
<p>Do you have any other CD burning software on your system? If so, you should uninstall it and then see if you are having problems with burning of the CD/DVD's.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, then do a clean boot and see if there is any 3rd party software or program that is conflicting and causing a problem.<br />
You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us<br />
determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service.</p>
<p>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup<br />
programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable</p>
<p>All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.<br />
If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application<br />
and or service running that is possibly interfering.</p>
<p>To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to go back into “msconfig”</p>
<p>and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.<br />
Depending on how many programs you have installed, this step can take a long time.<br />
You can enable programs in blocks to see if there is a problem which may be a little quicker.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Saborfox, I have the same problem. &nbsp;Its not solved by updating driver, setting registry from "0" to "1", and FIXIT doesn't resolve it either. &nbsp;Interestingly, when I attach an external USB CD/DVD on the same laptop, the CD does not appear blank and I
 can see the data on it. That said, I know its not a hardware issue, its a windows issue affecting the internal CD/DVD drive. &nbsp;On my old laptop, using windows xp home 32 bit, the problem went away when I upgraded to SP2.

<h2>            Webcam Microsoft HD-3000 &#47; Windows 10 &#47; Zoom</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have webcam Microsoft HD-3000 and my OS is Windows 10 / 64 bits</p>
<p>It's impossible for me to use "zoom" function because in the application "Camera" from ·Microsoft store" the options for "zoom" are not available&nbsp;</p>
<p>On an other hand, it's impossible for me to find driver of this device for windows 10</p>
<p>1/ how can I do to use "zoom" functions of the webcam with windows 10? Is there any application which can provide me this function?</p>
<p>2/ where can I find updated drivers for windows 10</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Hello Celta75
<br />
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />This webcam is not supported on Windows 10.
<br />It worked fine on Windows 7 but you may encounter lots of issues on Windows . It often doesn't work at all
<br />You will find lots of thread related to this

            Hi. celta75
<br />My name is Ben
<br />Independent Advisor
<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	First, in Windows 10, you can zoom in or out using two fingers to zoom in or out on the screen.
<br />
<br />	In Windows 8.1, the Camera application does not have a digital zoom. However, you can get the same effect that you would get by zooming in if you take a picture and cut it out.
<br />
<br />1. Swipe your finger to the right or select the left arrow to view recent photos and videos. Keep sliding your finger or clicking on the left arrow until you find the photo you want to cut out.
<br />
<br />2. Swipe your finger quickly from the bottom edge to see the commands of the application.
<br />(If you use a mouse, right click on the application).
<br />3. Select Trim.
<br />4. Select Aspect Ratio and choose one of the preconfigured options or drag the borders to place them where you want.
<br />5. Select Apply.
<br />6. Save the cropped photo. You can update the original photo or save a copy with the changes.
<br />
<br />	Now with respect to the Windows 10 driver updates and many devices (such as network adapters, monitors, printers and video cards) are automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />	It is likely that you already have the most recent driver, but if you have problems with a device, you can try to correct it by updating or reinstalling the driver. Here we show you how:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type Device Manager and select it in the results list.
<br />2. Expand a category (such as Monitors or Network Adapters) to find the name of your device, right-click on it (or keep it pressed) and select Update Driver. For example, to update a graphics card driver, expand the Display Adapters category, right-click on the graphics card, and select Update Driver.
<br />3. Select Search updated driver software automatically.
<br />4. If Windows does not find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow its instructions.
<br />
<br />	If these steps do not work, try reinstalling the driver: open Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) the name of the device and select Uninstall. Restart your PC and Windows will try to reinstall the driver

<p>
</p><p><span>"First, in Windows 10, you can zoom in or out using two fingers to zoom in or out on the screen."&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Skype 8 Question&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> revenkogaming  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype 8 Question&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi OKi I've just found out that files that are sent to you cannot be downloaded at all as my wife had sent me one of her songs to sample via Skype, I clicked on it to download and guess what? the New and so called improved
 piece of rubbish that we are all forced to now use does not allow you to download anything and on top of that there are absolutely (Yes I have turned whatever options you've given us on!) No advanced options in the settings and what settings there are, are
 completely rubbish!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Skype is Terrible on every level, the only thing that I can say that I genuinely like about it is the dark theme, that is it! Also what the hell is up with the forced attached window that has the start tutorial in it that you cannot unattached
 at all so have to drag into your contacts list just so you're not always staring at it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously whoever decided to ruin Skype and completely gut Skype of everything that actually made Skype essential in day to day life has got to either be fired or re-educated about everything!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please for the love of everything! Bring back the old style Skype with all of the options, pref more options, the option to be able to hide or show what contacts you want and just everything else that made Skype essential
 and actually useful because the new Skype, esp now since I've found out I cannot download anything on the desktop version that I am using has become completely worthless to me and everyone else who I know who uses Skype for both personal and business / school
 (student life!) usage...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Why the hell are you "Microsoft!" trying to destroy / kill Skype? you do realise that millions of people from around the world uses it right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the hell did you buy Skype from it's creators Ahti Heinla<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">, Priit Kasesalu, and&nbsp;</span>Jaan Tallinn just to then freaking
 well destroy it over time and make it useless! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet again, there is No options at all apart from the useless ones you've added.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell happened to the options to be able to set up voice messaging, were to download files to and everything else that all of the old versions of Skype has? I know I've mentioned this above but I just want to know
 why the hell you've now more or less turned Skype into a useless piece of junk that will make lots of people turn away from and go to alternatives instead like QQ or something...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reconsider what you've done and make the new Skype 8 just as good, if not better than the older versions with plenty of options esp advanced ones! Look why don't you look at all of the previous versions of Skype and
 try to combine everything into the new one because with each upgrade I had noticed you kept removing certain features or options -.- which is wtf in itself! So please fix this and make Skype actually useful and not just a waste of freaking space on your System!
 .. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for ranting and so on but come on! I've been using Skype since I was about 16 due to my older siblings, I'm 21 now! Do you really want Skype to become as useless as things like WhatsApp and so on? Please think about&nbsp;
 it and stop thinking about freaking money! your company is worth&nbsp;$272. billion, your stocks are forever falling - I know because I own a lot of stocks with your company and a lot of others so I watch the stock market all the time! - it doesn't really need
 to worry about profits esp since your OS more or less rules the planet as every new system comes with it unless someone chooses to go with Apple or go Open Source like Linux and so on .. Hopefully I've gotten my point across without carrying on as I could
 quite easily carry on but that's not in anyone's best interest!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, DA</p>

            Greetings,
<br />
<br />Thank you for taking the time to write in today.  My name is David, a Microsoft Independent Advisor and it is my pleasure to assist you today.
<br />
<br />There are many issues with the latest version of Skype including the one you shared.
<br />
<br />While these bugs are being figured out, I would highly recommend revertiong back to the classic version of Skype.  First, please uninstall your current version of Skype and install the classic version and this has been found to resolve the issue.  Hopefully the newer version of Skype will become more stable as these bugs get worked out. 
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

<p>Hi David, thanks a lot for taking the time to reply back to me, I very much appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also thank you for the link, I will install the classic version of Skype in a few minutes and I will also provide my feedback via the link that you have given me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be at all possible to be able to help resolve the current Skype issues? I'm Cisco qualified and am looking into becoming Microsoft qualified so if I can help in anyway whatsoever then I would gladly help even if it was just as a volunteer as I'd
 like to be able to make Skype better as well as having everything that it used to have which had made it an essential application for everything from work, personal and so on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this isn't possible then no worries, I had just wanted to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks yet again for your reply!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

<h2>            Desktop Inactive and the closed apps icons are still visible in transparency on the applications bar</h2>
                    <p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>I'm facing a problem with my Windows 10 desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen seems freezed, I can't click the icons and open the applications from the desktop, also when I save some files on the desktop the new icons doesn't appear on the screen. It is possible to open the files&nbsp;only from the folder "explore file" and
 from the search area on the application bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, the icons of the closed apps are still visible in trasparency on the application bar (in background of the opened applications, please see the picture below). &nbsp;What can I do?</p>
<p>
