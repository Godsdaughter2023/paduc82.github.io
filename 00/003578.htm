            Odd that you have older data saved but not the new.&nbsp; If you created a restore point before you reset Sticky Notes you could try rolling back to the nearest restore point before you reset.

<p>I didn't get 2017 data using restore or backup technique.</p>
<p>After reset i checked(.snt) that it was already in .snt file (2017 Data).</p>

    <title>Nokia Ngage QD - why won&#39;t Nokia own up to their own bug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shinydragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Ngage QD - why won&#39;t Nokia own up to their own bug&#63;</h2>
                    I transferred data via Bluetooth to my mobile phone (a Nokia Ngage QD), resulting in an out of memory message. Phone did not allow deletion of files to make room or to do anything else on the phone (giving a message saying that the phone was out of memory)
 turned phone off and now it wont start up again. Have researched this and it seems to be the "WSOD—White screen of death" which is a known bug in this series of phone. "WSOD is simply when your N-Gage’s internal memory gets so full it can no longer re-start
 itself." The keywords WSOD and Ngage will return many, many results when search engined all saying the same thing - and even this forum has reference to it..<br />
<br />
Visited the Nokia Care Centre in the City and was told that there was no other way around it but to pay for repairs ($50), and that it was impossible for the consumer to fix it themselves. The guy that was serving me kept going on about how great this phone
 was and how he hadnt seen one for a while and then, unbelievably (I am still laughing/crying to myself because the whole ordeal was really quite crazy) when it was established that the only way to fix Nokias own software fault (a really stupid one I might
 add) was to pay for it he asked for my name to book in the repair without even asking me whether I wanted to proceed (and all the while indicating that it was probably I who had put corrupted software on and broken it myself) and when I refused saying that
 it was ridiculous he starting talking about how Nokia has these new phones out that played Ngage style games, brought up the store in his browser and...launched into trying to sell me one...<br />
<br />
Next stop was the Nokia customer support line which denied all knowledge of this problems existence (or to be more exact the person on the other end of the phone said so, I didn't hear her typing or doing anything to verify such a claim) and she kept repeating
 EXACTLY the same line to the point of hair pulling along the lines of - you have to take it into a Nokia Care Centre and pay for repairs while I was still trying to explain what the problem was.<br />
<br />
I consider myself to be a reasonable person, but if you manufacture a phone and it wont even start because the memory is full and you, as a company, realised this fault in the PREVIOUS incarnation of the phone (the Nokia Ngage minus the QD) and did jack all
 to fix it, the LEAST you can do after the consumer has lost all of the precious data (all my dear saved messages and many of my contacts which save to the phone, luckily I backed some of these up) is to have the decency to treat your customer right and fix
 it so the phone actually works (I was even prepared before I went in to pay and let it slide if it was $20 or so to save the effort of going up against them as sometimes its just easier to let the big guy push you around). Let alone getting off the phone actually
 shaking from being spoken to so severely and hearing the blatent lies and have people trying to sell me a new one and force me into getting it fixed.<br />
<br />
Will try and pursue the matter, contacted the ACCC who recommended to try Fair Trading NSW (where Nokias portfolio is) under my statutory rights. Its all a bit scary as I have never been motivated enough to do such a thing before.<br />
<br />
I recommend against purchasing a Nokia phone (I realise I am just a little voice out there trying to speak out against something so big that I can't fathom it) if this is the way they treat thier customers.

            All electronic devices are susceptible to faults from time to time, and no device (Nokia, Samsung, SE etc. phone, Windows or Mac computer, anything) is going to start if it appears not to have available memory resources to operate.<br />
<br />
The Ngage QD is a model over four years old. If this problem had occurred under the warranty period, it would have been fixed free but like any product that is out of warranty, you have to pay for the repair.<br />
<br />
You say much about your current problem but nothing about any previous issue, so it can be assumed that you have had several years good service from the phone. May I assume the reference to 'NSW' is New South Wales? $50 is about 30€ - you are not exactly being
 asked to remortgage your entire life.<br />
<br />
My Citroën Xsara suffered FEDS (French Electrical Death Syndrome, a common issue with French cars) last year. It too was out of warranty. Life's a **bleep** sometimes...

            sounds to me like you should hard-reset the device. this is essentially like fixing a windows pc by formatting the harddrive and installing the OS and apps on it fresh all over again.<br />
<br />
in other words, if the problem is hardware specific, then this won't help. otherwise this fixes it at the expense of all your data and apps.<br />
<br />
according to this page:<br />
<a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/archive/t-16907.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/archive/t-16907.html</a><br />
<br />
a hard reset is performed by typing *#7370#<br />
then entering the password (default=12345)<br />
<br />
clearly this option only applies if you can get the phone to boot up. other devices have an alternate method used when you power up: hold down `*`, `3`, and `GREEN (talk, send, whatever you call it)` when the device is OFF, then turn it on (with these buttons
 all pressed you may need to ask someone else to turn it on) and keep the buttons pressed until it is done booting.<br />
<br />
note: i don't know that this key combo trick works on the nage qd, but i have used it myself on newer devices (N95 and N82).<br />
<br />
say what you will about nokia care centers, i've got an N82 there for the second time and they've been pleasant and courteous to me - they even sent me a prepaid 2-day express package label so i didn't have to pay to post my phone twice for the same issue.
 sure, it's not fixed yet, but they've been fair chaps about it so i don't feel burned up at all.<br />
<br />
your ngage qd originally shipped in 2004 - thats a 4 year old phone. for a mobile device, 4 years is a ripe old age.<br />
<br />
put it in perspective, my $3k USD PowerBook G4 was built in 2005 and has had numerous out of warranty issues. apple won't touch it for free and i wouldn't get very far for $50 if i asked them to repair it. i've opened it myself to remove faulty thermal sensors
 (this model was well known for having 'narcolepsy' where it goes to sleep repeatedly with no time to use the machine between faulty emergency thermal shutdowns). it's annoying, but a fact of life... scratch that, it's a fact of business. create, produce, sell,
 honor the warranty, repeat. sometimes honoring the warranty costs more than the projected budget integrated into the design/manufacture/sales costs. sometimes not. but only small mom-and-pop shops have the ability to repair, free of charge, outside of warranty:
 they're not responsible to a huge group of employees and investors and can take the hit if they deem appropriate.<br />
<br />
[ending my rant now before i start talking about growing radishes, finding out god doesn't exist, or the best way to eat messy foods)<br />

            If you have the WSOD error on an N-Gage QD, then the phone does not boot up at all properly, and cannot be reset by the user.<br />
<br />
The '3', '*', green/talk formatting does not work on the N-Gage QD, either (it started working only from the 6600 and S60 2nd Edition and onwards).<br />
<br />
So, the only way to fix this problem is to have a Nokia repair center reflash the phone with whatever is the latest firmware version.<br />
<br />
As the phone is out of warranty, there might be a charge, but you can try to discuss it with the repair center (ask to talk to a supervisor/manager, if necessary).

            This phone can not not started via any buttons being held down and doesnt get to the point where I can type anything into it.<br />
<br />
My issue is that it is a complete design flaw with this phone. This phone is supposed to be capable of receiving data and of course starting up when turned on. It isnt a matter of how old the phone is and whether its in warranty or not, it could have happened
 on the first day of owning the phone and is an issue the manufacturer created. The phone doesnt do what it is supposed to.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Spotlight Cache Enormous</h2>
                    <p>Hope I can find someone to help with this issue. I am at my wits end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine Stats</p>
<p>Mac Pro Late 2013</p>
<p>El Cap 10.11.3</p>
<p>2.7 12 Core Xeon E5</p>
<p>64 GB of RAM</p>
<p>512 GB SSD</p>
<p>Outlook 15.18</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user that has a 200GB local mail archive (trust me, not by my choice) originally in Office 2011. We upgraded the user to Office 2016 and the application converted the mailbox and moved it to the Group Containers folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cool right? Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spotlight now is running non-stop until the hard drive is filled and the OS X notification comes up that the disk is almost full with the /.Spotlight-V100 weighing in at 119GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of the troubleshooting process I formatted the hard drive and loaded a fresh copy of El Cap. I moved the users documents over one folder at a time and was able to narrow the issue down to Outlook archive in Group Containers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what has been done so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Verified all traces of Office 2011 were removed.</p>
<p>2) Uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2016.</p>
<p>3) Rebuilt index using the following terminal commands.</p>

<p>I checked on my own Mac and I don't seem to be having that problem.</p>
<p>Have you tried playing with the activity monitor to see whether indexing was hanging? Could you have a conflict with the mdimporters?</p>

            I don't think its possible on&nbsp;incoming messages. You can on new messages and replies.

    <title>Import Contacts directly to a new, or created contact list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesus m morales  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import Contacts directly to a new, or created contact list</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have figured out how to import a .csv contact list file to Outlook, the only problem is that I want to import directly to a new, or already-created contact list instead of having to type in the names of the contact list members. We are a very large district
 and it's taking too update the lists everytime members leave, or enter our organization. It would be best if we could delete all of the contacts in a contact list with a click of a button rather than one by one and then import the newly updated .csv&nbsp;file to
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider making this chore less time consuming for us. Our IT department does not create these lists for us within Outlook but does do it for a separate group emailer option on the district's teacher resource website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

<p>This is total rubbish...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might work with Outlook on the Desktop but I think the OP was asking about Outlook.com, at least that's the forum it was posted in!</p>
<p>Parmi has done nothing to address the OP question which was about "Importing Contacts directly to a new, or created contact list"</p>
<p>There is nothing in the article (or anywhere else) about creating a contact list when importing a .csv file. Zero points.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Disappearance of all tiles and search not working</h2>
                    <p>Having loaded Win 10 some time ago and, in my view it was working OK, I have now picked up a problem. Previously when starting my PC, the desktop etc appeared and when&nbsp;left clicking the windows logo (left bottom of screen) a list of programs (eg control
 , device manager, search etc))&nbsp;appeared. When right clicking the logo a number of tiles (eg weather, win Live etc) appeared with desktop in the background.&nbsp; A Few days ago after starting OK, &nbsp;left clicking on the logo produced nothing and left clicking produced
 the abovementioned list but the "search" does not work (all the others do). As for as I know I did not change any settings etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what the problem(s) could be and any suggestions please.&nbsp; Thanks Chris</p>

I don't believe it's a sharepoint issue. Everything act as expected in when interacting with sharepoint.&nbsp; This happens only after you open it in Excel and try to edit the document. &nbsp;If this were just an Excel issue how would you address it?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I bought a n86, first day web browsing and downloading things through wlan was ok. After a couple of days, I am lucky if I can open one web page, most of them do not open in the web browser, I just get a blank page and after a few seconds I receive a message
 in the screen "WEB: no answer from server". Other programs using wlan don't work neither.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated firmware and did hard resets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas?</p>

 tried restoring this associations and have not succeeded.&nbsp; (Open With &amp; Browse to Office14, &amp; Control Panel | Default Programs).&nbsp; How can this be repaired?&nbsp; Can different users on the PC have different file associations?</p>

<h2>            MS Publisher, unable to display &#47; edit text box in catalogue</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make printout of price list. Data is in Excel file. For editing purposes I have made small file to set the print of the catalogue. But often I get text displayed only partially with red dots&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd48017c-6c1d-494e-add7-d0af522540b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd48017c-6c1d-494e-add7-d0af522540b8" /></a>&nbsp;and
 whatever I do I can not manage to fit the whole text in the grid, it just gets thrown all over the box, the problem is worse if I change font size from 10 to 7</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for rapid answer, I have inserted Excel data with in Catalogue tool and linked data (I have Slovenian version, therefore sometimes it might not be clear what did I use). It look like everything works fine for font Arial narrow size 8, but not as good
 for size 7. I can work fine with size 8, but I am lacking space, therefore I would like to use size 7. It is just change in size that solved/produced problems (funny :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version is 1711 build 8730.2127</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4424e0f5-3de0-4963-86c9-43ac6037addf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4424e0f5-3de0-4963-86c9-43ac6037addf" /></a></p>
<p>This is correct view of same data as on example above, this time in font size 8</p>

<h3> personal computer  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Word could not create work file. Check temp environment variable.&#39; It occurs when I go and press the &#39;browse&#39; box to upload a Word Document. This error at the moment only occurs in Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7 but not Mozilla Firefox</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7, MS Office 2007 and Internet Explorer 8. When I use IE and I go to any website i.e. hotmail, there is a 'browse' box and I click that. A dialogue box appears and note at this point my preview pane is open. I go and open a Word Document
 then it attaches but I also get an error saying 'Word could not create work file. Check temp environment variable.' There are some other errors sometimes as well referring to Normal Template. However it attaches but I get the error and this happens on any
 site that has a browse box to upload a file. Note that this error only occurs with Word Documents - not just docx documents but all formats. It doesn't occur in Mozilla Firefox and also doesn't occur when IE protection mode is turned off. This is very strange
 and does anyone have any ways to fix it? My registry as far as I know is all in good shape. I would appriecate any suggestions please?<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p><span><span>Hey PERSONAL COMPUTER,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A website that you select as a Trusted Site means that you trust the website as safe. When you add a website to the Trusted Sites zone, you believe that files you
 download or that you run from the website will not damage your computer or data. By default, there are no websites that are assigned to the Trusted Sites zone, and the security level is set to Medium.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>By placing the website in the Trusted Sites list Protected Mode will be turned off for that website. This means that if malicious software tried to run you would have
 less protection that if the website wasn’t on the Trusted Sites list.&nbsp; Because of the nature of email and the possibility that you may receive unwanted, malicious software by means of an email, you may want to not list your email websites as a Trusted Site.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For the most secure experience you would not have the website set to the Trusted Sites list and would keep Preview Pane disabled to avoid the errors. The alternative
 would mean less security, but the ability to use Preview Pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately the only workaround to using the Preview Pane in Internet Explorer is to have Protected Mode turned Off.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information on Protected Mode:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Word Home and Student 2016 vs. Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>What is the difference in functions and features between Word Home and Student 2016 and Word 2016?</p>
<p>It says on the website that the Home and Student version is for non-commercial use, which is vague! What if I use Word Home and Student 2016 to work as a journalist? Will it be considered as commercial or non-commercial use?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sales support agent told me the Home and Student version doesn't not allow add-in. A technical agent said it doesn't include Macro. Is there a comparison table?</p>

<h2>            Denying access to a site collection for a user</h2>
                    <p>I am supporting a SharePoint Online application.</p>
<p>One of my customers not having access to a site collection even though full control given to the user. I checked permissions. It looks as below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34b28812-9189-47d4-8681-038ca50f8c2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34b28812-9189-47d4-8681-038ca50f8c2c" /></a></p>
<p>I had removed the user from all groups at tenant level and re-added however the deny on permissions still present in that site collection. This only for this user and only in this site collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to resolve this problem.</p>

<h2>            Requerying A Listbox on a Form Changes the Current Record of a Subform to the First Record</h2>
                    I have a listbox and a subform on a form. The recordset of the listbox and subform are unrelated. A button on the form requeries the listbox (vba=mylistbox.requery). When I click this button, whatever record I was on in the subform is changed to the first
 record. I can't understand this behavior and I'm especially confused by it when the recordsets of each object are not related in any way. Does anyone have insight on this?

            Hmm, seems a bit odd wonder if that's an Access 2016 issue.&nbsp; That said, can you post the entire block of code that runs with *MyListBox.Requery* so we can be sure nothing else is causing that.

<p>
</p><p>' Requery Memo Listbox<br />
Me.lst_MemoList.Requery</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The button simply requeries a listbox that lists a bunch of memo titles... but a totally different control - a subform which has nothing to do with the memos table keeps having it's current record changed back to the first record every time the button is
 clicked. This is happening consistently.</p>

            I did some more testing on this and found that requerying any listbox on my form sends my subform back to the first record. Interestingly, requerying comboboxes on my form does NOT have any affect on the subform. I have 3 listboxes and 4 comboboxes on
 my form.

            <p>I do this in Access 2010 and 2013 and it does not go back to the first record.&nbsp; My List Box is on a Subform which is on a Tab Control.&nbsp; When I run the requery only the Subform is affected, nothing happens to the Main Form.&nbsp; I will need to test in Access
 2016 which is on another machine to see if this is a problem unique to Access 2016.&nbsp; Might not get to that until tomorrow...</p>

            It looks like you may have changed your Excel settings to R1C1 style.
<div><br />
<div>If you have the one of the newer versions of Excel then use the Office Button or File to access the Excel Options Dialog. Open Formulas -&gt; Working with formulas then check if the R1C1 option is selected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In earlier versionss of Excel access Options from the Tools menu and look in the General Tab</div>

            <p>Sounds like the 50 sheets were "grouped" thus what is done to active sheet is done to all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you see [Group] up on the Title bar?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, select any sheet tab other than the active one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you have saved the workbook while sheets were grouped, you will have to find a backup.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answer. I use only&nbsp;<a href="https://hotmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">browser version of Outlook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://login.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">browser version of Skype</a>. I tried to delete the contacts
 in both places but got the same result: contacts remain under People/My Contacts/Skype Contacts. Like I said, the contacts do get removed from Skype. I have added both contacts recently in a testing purpose so I have never had a conversation with those. I
 have Windows 7.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. We just want to confirm if you tried deleting those contacts using different browsers? If you haven't tried yet, we suggest that you do so.</p>

 account to your preferred browser and see if the is still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is not resolved after performing the above steps, we highly recommend that you post your feedback to the

<h2>            Flash player in youtube in IE 11 on Windows RT 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not actually a question but since I did not find a suitable way to send feedback to Microsoft, I came here knowing a lot of MVPs do review posts and help out people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love the internet explorer in my surface 2 its amazingly great for touch, but it is tedious when it comes to some buttons in viewing videos, especially in YouTube. For example, it is hard to trigger full screen because the button is small and it requires
 more than one attempt some times. Maybe Microsoft can add something that recognizes a YouTube flash player on a webpage and gives the user a context button or menu allowing him/her to trigger full screen given that the button be bigger than the original YouTube
 one. Thanks!</p>

    <title>validation rule violation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thick mike  say:</h3>
<h2>            validation rule violation</h2>
                    I am trying to append about 25,000 records from one table to another.
<div>The append query throws up an Validation Rule Violation for about 4,500 records.</div>
<div>I have identified the records that fail (by running the query, making a new temp table of all records and querying unmatched records).</div>
<div>I have deleted fields one by one from the append query and find that most (but not all) failures are in one text field - some of the fail records have data in that field, others do not.</div>
<div>The failure is not caused by field lengths.</div>
<div>The table I am trying to append to has no validation rules and has no relationship to any other table.</div>
<div>I have tried creating a new table to append to; have tried removing indexes; have tried turning Unicode on and off. &nbsp;All to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I image it is some sort of data issue, but how can I identify the cause of the failure, and correct it?</div>
                </div>

<p>A check() constraint may have been added and has no User Interface area where you can see it, but when it fails, the error message mentions the constraint name. What is your error message?</p>

            also see if you have maybe too many messages stored. usually if it is more than near 3000 phone can do funny things. do you have up to date firmware ? clean the internet cache, things like this might help your phones situtaion.&nbsp;
