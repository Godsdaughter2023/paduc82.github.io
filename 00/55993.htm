<p>Edge is just a browser, like Internet Explorer or Firefox or Chrome. &nbsp;Edge cannot hold emails, it can only go to websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you meant the Mail app instead of Edge. &nbsp;If that's the case, Mail app only shows recent emails by default. &nbsp;If you want it to show more, go to the Mail options, under Accounts, and set your account sync settings to show emails from a longer period
 or even "from all time" if you want it to download all your emails.</p>

                    <p>Good day everyone, </p>
<p>I've been using my laptop away from home for the last couple of months and I've never had any problems with internet connectivity.</p>
<p>Now that I'm back home, whenever I try to connect to my home WIFI I get no internet connection whereas all the other devices work fine. I already tried all the possible solutions; flushing my computer's DNS cache, resetting the router, using Google's free
 DNS, switching back to the automatic DNS... Nothing worked so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It'd be really great if you help solve this.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot .... it seems I was able to resolve my issue by myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I disabled all IPv6 protokol for my private LAN/WAN in the network settings of the business notebook</p>
<p>2. restarted notebook and Fritz!Box 6490</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I was able to get a stable connection by WLAN from both Fritz!Boxes</p>
<p>But LAN still got no connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then randomly I found a funtion in Internet settings/Connection/LAN settings "Automatically detect settings" and enabled this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards I got internet connection by LAN, WAN with both Fritz!Boxes as well.</p>
<p>I restarted computer several times and it seems to work stable now though the hook in this settings was removed again automatically (?!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it will work now without any further surprises.</p>
<p><br />

</p><p>To isolate the case, make sure that your mobile number is set up as your sender ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There’s no way for us to receive SMS on Skype, however, setting up sender ID can help your recipient reply to your SMS messages via Skype. Sender ID needs to be set up separately like a caller ID.

    <title>&#34;Access Denied&#34; when I try to update a driver in device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n3oboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Access Denied&#34; when I try to update a driver in device manager</h2>
                    <p>Good day<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm having an issue cropping up more often in the last couple of weeks with clients of mine. I work for a company that sell USB GPS devices and we have had two different generations of the units - one with a Prolific USB to Serial driver and one with a ST
 Microelectronics driver. We have over 35000 of these units in circulation and they have always worked 100% fine (for about 3 years with the Prolific chip and just over a year with the ST Micro chipset).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago someone logged a call saying that their device is not working anymore. I have had previous instances where Windows would automatically update the Prolific driver with an updated driver but this caused our software not to communicate with
 the unit anymore. The quick fix was to go via Device Manager, click Update Driver and choose the older driver and it worked fine.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Suddenly, with this particular user, I try that and at the end it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>‘Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it'<br />
Prolific USB-Serial Comm Port<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Access Denied’</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in the IT industry for over 15 years and I've never seen this. I've tried various methods (from driver and temp folder permissions to registry) and I cannot for the life of me get this sorted out. Then it suddenly happened with another user the
 very same day, but with the ST Micro chipset. It has happened to about another 5 users suddenly and I need to know whats happening. I've searched various forums and discussion boards and they all refer to the driver version of that specific case (which ranges
 from HP printers to screen drivers to display cards) but this is not the case in my eyes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is as if something in Windows has changed and suddenly this is now happening. I'm at my wits end and I'm getting the feeling this is eventually going to start to happen to everyone and I cannot afford that since its essentially 35000 users...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Our company sells smart cards and smart USB keys and suddenly various smart card readers from different manufacturers stopped working. Device Manager is showing Error Code 31 but any update or change of drivers is impossible and we get the same message:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">That started about two weeks ago. The&nbsp;only&nbsp;pattern we were able to see so far was that all the customers with the problem were&nbsp;using&nbsp;Windows 7. Otherwise we weren't yet able to&nbsp;pinpoint&nbsp;any
 other similarity.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Same as N3Oboy we tried quite a few different things but&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;worked, we can't change the drivers.</span><br />

            <p>Hello Dovydas,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated about the issue and sorry for late reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer the suggestion provided in the following Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Access Denied" or other errors when accessing or working with files and folders in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2623670/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2623670/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the below command in elevated command prompt and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Start, </strong>click <strong>All Programs </strong>and open <strong>
Accessories.</strong></li><li>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt </strong>in the Program list and then select
<strong>Run as administrator.</strong> If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 2.25in"><strong>TAKEOWN /A /F C:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Then try to run the next command.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 99pt"><strong>TAKEOWN /F C:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give both admin and your account full permissions to ALL files in the C: drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response but the issue here is not access to folders in my opinion (as I have tried setting access and ownership to relevant folders). Upon doing some scratching around, it seems to be related to the permissions to the relevant device's
 hardware ID folder in the registry (normally under HKLM --&gt; SYSTEM --&gt; <em>Controlsets
</em>(either CURRENTCONTROLSET, CONTROLSET001, etc...they all contain the same keys and they all have the same permission issue) --&gt; Enum --&gt; USB --&gt;
<em>HardwareDeviceID</em> (different for each device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously if the device does not use USB as its transport (like graphics cards or monitor drivers), then the issue would not be in the above mentioned registry key, but it will still probably be found in the same hierarchy. I still haven't resolved the issue
 since I have not been able to replicate the issue on my side and I do not want to make extensive changes remotely to client's machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need an explanation of what caused this problem and if indeed registry related, how permissions could have changed by themselves in the registry since there is no common denominator when it comes to OS version (other than that so far its only been Windows
 7 machines affected ) or their respective update status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to also keep in mind that in my case, these were always working fine...it just changed and stopped working about a month ago...and system restores etc does not work (short of reinstalling the operating system altogether - which does resolve the
 problem...but for how long...</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated about the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue still persists try the below methods and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the <strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong> to check if your computer is affected by viruses.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persists I would suggest you to <strong>login as administrator</strong> then
<strong>perform clean boot</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this would help. If issue still persists, post back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestions, we will be happy to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hi again everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new development with regards to the issue at hand...not sorted out yet but I will have a machine in front of me to try a couple of things on Monday (thus far I've been dealing with clients remotely and have been restricted in my attempts to apply
 possible fixes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest is that if you boot into Safe Mode and try updating the driver to the correct one - it works 100%...no access is denied error. My test though was limited to trying that remotely with a client on the phone and asking to restart back into Windows...where
 again the unit did not work and one could not update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I thought to share this development as it brings us one step closer to the solution. I'm fairly certain I will be able to sort it out on Monday once I have the PC in front of me.</p>

            <p>Hi again everyone<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks Ramesh but that still does not work. I have found the solution and it might relate to malware or a new virus so it might also indicate a security hole in Windows 7 since this is the only OS affected so far.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have had 4 users install MalwareBytes from <span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></span>, run a scan, clean, reboot and then go through Device Manager again to manually update the driver to the existing one installed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The process in Device Manager is as follows:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plug in the device<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on the Start menu and then RIGHT click on Computer<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Manage in the menu that appeared.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A box will open called Computer Management. On the left hand side you will see an option called Device Manager - click this.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It will show you a list of hardware categories...in our case we are looking for either "Other Devices" OR "Ports (COM &amp; LPT)". If you have an "Other Devices" category, you will either see a "USB-to-Serial Controller D" OR "STM32 Virtual Port" - follow
 the steps below for either.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no "Other Devices" category, then in the "Ports (COM &amp; LPT)" category you should see a device called "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port" OR "ST Microelectronics Virtual COM Port" with a COM value in brackets next to it. RIGHT click this and
 click Update Driver<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the window that appears, click the bottom option and click Next.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this window, again click the bottom option (it will say something about not browsing the computer but that you will pick it from a list) and click Next<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this window you should see a white box area with a couple of renditions of the same thing...except they have different dates in brackets next to them. Choose the oldest date by clicking it to highlight it<br />
10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Next and it should install the driver accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For other hardware obviously the process would differ with regards to what you device you are working with and what to look for in Device Manager but the update process stays the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if anyone tries the above solution but still cannot get theirs to work or whether it did in fact work!</p>

<h2>            Windows server 2016 datacenter install error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to install windows server 2016 DC. I created the bootable USB using Unetbootin (Rufus fails) but when I boot, it says cannot detect install.wim file. The install.wim file is about 4.8 gigs..I suspect this is the issue since there is a lit of
 around 4.3 gig file size for fat32 FS. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm what was the result when you tried Method 2 was it successful ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be possibility that incorrect recovery disc that you are suing. I would suggest you to create a new Installation Media and then try to repair Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that you should have Product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer tot he mentioned article to create Installation Media:</p>

                    I have 38 MS services in stopped status in Config, is that unusual?

            Nope.&nbsp; I have 68 showing as 'Stopped' in msconfig.&nbsp; But my configuration is very lean and I also don't have any item listing in the msconfig Startup tab (zero).&nbsp; That works for me, but it might not work for you.<br />
<br />
There are lots of Services that may be stopped or completely disabled depending on your system configuration.<br />
<br />
There are also many XP Services that get installed as an Automatic startup item that you might not need to be starting at all (again - depending on your configuration).&nbsp; There are some Services that are configured to start Automatically that you might not need
 that if running, leave your system vulnerable to outside threats.<br />
<br />
If you check the box 'Hide All Microsoft Service' you will see other Services that may have been installed by third party applications you have installed.<br />
<br />
If you want to learn more about the XP Services and which ones you need or might not need, a good place to start looking is here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/</a><br />
<br />
Using a search engine like Google can also help you decide which Services you need to have running, starting or disabled - or ask here if you are not sure.<br />
<br />
If you think you are going to be messing around with your Services, it is prudent to research them first and if you are going to start changing things, only do one or two at a time remembering and keeping track of what adjustments you make so you can undo the
 adjustments if something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to render your system unbootable if you disable certain Services so it is also prudent before you start to have a plan for what you are going to do if your experimentation or tinkering leaves your system in an unbootable state - how are
 you going to undo things if your system will not boot?<br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to make a manual System Restore point and registry backup before starting too.&nbsp; Always make sure you have a way to recover in case you get into a jam.<br />
<br />
Many Services 'depend' on other Service to be running for them to start so if you disable one thing thinking you don't need it, that might prevent other Services that you do need from starting.<br />
<br />
Example:&nbsp; There are some Services you might think you don't need and might disable (like Task Scheduler) but just because you might not have any Scheduled Tasks, it is not a good idea to disable that Service since other XP functions depend on that to work properly.<br />
<br />
Example:&nbsp; Much MS Answers advice says to set things like the Help and Support Service to 'Automatic' start, but I always set that to 'Manual' so it will only start when it needs to start.&nbsp; There is no need for the H&amp;S Service (and others like it) to be starting
 automatically every time your system boots and running all day with nothing to do except consume memory and CPU cycles that you would probably prefer to go towards something you really do need.&nbsp; All that stuff slows you down<br />
<br />
You might be able to disable many 'Updater' Services like Google, Flash, Skype and just update those things when you need to update them or they will tell you they need an update when you run them.<br />
<br />
I also always disable the Java Quick Starter Service. and the associated jusched Startup item.<br />
<br />
You can shave <i>many </i>seconds off your boot time without these things starting every time you reboot your system and running all day with nothing to do.<br />
<br />
Of course the only way to really see the effect is to have a good way to accurately measure your startup time before and after adjustments instead of just saying "Well, it seems faster" or "It might be faster".&nbsp;&nbsp; Accurately measuring to the 100th of a second
 also eliminates things like "It takes my system about 40 seconds to boot (or 5 minutes)".&nbsp; Using software tools, there is no "about" to it.<br />
<br />
There is free and easy to use software to help you do all that of course, such as:<br />

    <title>Windows DVD Maker avi file is not valid or corrupt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snowboarder1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows DVD Maker avi file is not valid or corrupt</h2>
                    
<p>i have a Toshiba Satellite and am running Vista Home Premium the 64-bit version. When i try to add avi files to Windows DVD Maker i get an error message saying that the file is not valid or corrupt. I no for a fact that there is nothing wrong with the file
 they open and play fine in any of my players and the exact same files have been burned using Windows DVD Maker on another Toshiba Satellit (owned by my brother) I have been serching trough these forums for a couple weeks now trying things that have worked
 for other people. I have installed ffdshow as well as the vista codec pack mentioned in another responce. I have also run the sfc/scannow command in the command prompt nd upon finishing it told me that corrupt files were found but not all of them could be
 fixed. I dont no that much about the workings computers but i suspect that it is a bigger problem then just DVD Maker because when i try to put these files into Movie Maker they go in fine but then when u play them or drag them to the time line there is no
 sound or picture. I have only had this computer for a couple months and would reallly like to be able to use DVD Maker becasue everyone i no uses it and really likes it. please help me</p>

            Hi Tilden, 
<br />
<br />If the wireless router/modem is supplied by XFinity, the default SSID and Password should be right on the side of it. 
<br />
<br />In order to connect to the network, you'll need to turn airplane mode off on your laptop. 
<br />
<br />If you do that, it should display in the list of available networks. 
<br />
<br />Let me know and we'll try to figure this out!

            Hmmm, without that password, we may be dead in the water. 
<br />
<br />Let me ask you this, what device is connected? We may be able to retrieve it from that. Also, on your router, is there any sort of label? There could be an IP address you can enter (Ex. 192.168.1.1) that allow you to access the router. That would have information about the wireless network if you’re able to log into it. 
<br />
<br />And HomeGroup was removed from Windows 10 in version 1803, that being said, there are other ways you can see different devices (IE Network Discovery) 
<br />
<br />Regardless, I think we should try to figure out the wireless password issue first.

<div>Wow - you went above and beyond with the annoying uppercase lettering thing, eh?&nbsp; Not only uppercase lettering for some parts - but an extra space between each letter of a phrase just to make it that much more ...&nbsp; annoying
 was a good word.&nbsp; I know - you were trying to call attention to yourself - but to be honest - in these forums - the best way to differentiate yourself from everyone else when asking a question is to state the facts clearly and concisely, give pertinent information
 and not go 'over the top' in any fashion.&nbsp; You are asking for help from strangers who cannot see what you have/have tried.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So - what I see from your post is not too bad on the information front.&nbsp; You have Windows 7 Professional (don't know if it is 32-bit or 64-bit) and are having trouble setting your background image.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you upgrade this from some prior OS/version of Windows 7 or is this a supposed clean installation of Windows 7 Professional?</div>

<h2>            how to pair your microsoft bluetooth mobile keyboard 6000 if you are unable to pair</h2>
                    
<p>the keyboard like any other device is considered one device. but unlike other devices, this keyboard is unique, in that is has TWO parts working as ONE device.</p>
<p>when a device goes in to discovery mode, it does not interfere with other bluetooth devices that are currently connected, so while the devices may be on and connected, they do not interfere with other devices that are in discovery mode.</p>
<p>HOWEVER&nbsp;when you attempt&nbsp;to get your PC to discover the keyboard device something different is happening and that is interference. but from what? YOUR NUMBER PAD IS POWERED ON AND THEREFORE INTERFERING WITH THE KEYBOARD WHEN IT IS IN DISCOVERY MODE. the
 number pad is on but because is part of ONE device, it is creating a sort of confusion for the pc or mac (older software). the pc is confused about your keyboard because is getting mixed signals? is it wanting to connect or not? so it refuses to accept the
 disovery mode, because the number pad (which is the same device as the keyboad) is saying something different than the keyboard.</p>
<p>SO THE SOLUTION IS SO SO SIMPLE.</p>
<p>before you start, MAKE SURE THAT EITHER THE KEYBOARD OR THE NUMBER PAD IS POWERED OFF BEFORE YOU GO INTO DISCOVERY.&nbsp; so if you are connecting the number pad, TURN OFF THE KEYBOARD. if you are connecting the keyboard, TURN OFF THE NUMBER PAD.</p>
<p>once you are in the add device box, press the discovery button a couple of times to make sure that the pc or older mac is throughly connected with the keyboard or&nbsp;number pad. once you see the specific name and not the generic title that the pc is issuing,
 and you also see an exact image of the device in the box, select and press next.</p>
<p>once you are done with one part of the device. repeat this. NOW&nbsp;TURN OFF THE OTHER&nbsp;PART THAT YOU JUST CONNECTED, AND NOW TURN ON THE OTHER PART THAT YOU HAD TURNED OFF. and repeat this process once more.</p>
<p>there you go. that is your complete solution.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem to be the "complete solution" to my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Number Pad paired as expected.&nbsp; No Problem.</p>
<p>The power is NOT on to the Number Pad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power is turned on on the Keyboard.</p>
<p>The Discovery button is pressed until the Red/Green lights flash.</p>
<p>The Keyboard is found by the PC</p>
<p>(The PC is running XP and using Bluetooth with a Dongle)</p>
<p>The numbers to Pair are shown and Properly entered in the 6000's Keyboard - and then the Enter Key.</p>
<p>The PC does not recognize the Keyboard.&nbsp; It acts as if the PC's Bluetooth Dongle doesn't receive the Keyboard's keystrokes.</p>
<p>Yet, the Key Pad work flawlessly.</p>
<p>Could I have a defective Keyboard?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

            your issue sounds different, not related to the pairing problems i encountered. you may need to work on your hid (human interface devices) located in device manager. you can locate this in the control panel. click on the system tab located in the panel.

            I have this exact issue, and have since purchase in mid-2010.
<div><br />
<div>Depending on the order in which I pair, only one device will work. &nbsp;BOTH devices successfully pair, and Windows (Vista Home Basic) declares that device drivers were successfully installed, HOWEVER - only the FIRST paired device actually FUNCTIONS. &nbsp;I can
 jam away on the other, and never see a character appear. &nbsp;THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried pairing simultaneously (it only actually pairs the first device discovered).</div>
<div>I have tried pairing with both devices in discover mode, only one in discover mode, only one on, and only one with batteries installed. &nbsp;NOTHING WORKS. &nbsp;I don't have the receipt anymore but at this point I dreadfully wish I could return for a refund. &nbsp;Microsoft
 this is a serious problem!</div>

            Origin is the cause. Closing Origin will fix it but it will happen again if you use a game from Origin (seems that Origin in game is the problem). I am afraid we will have to wait for an update to get a permanent solution.<br />
Hope it helps!

            Usually, If you possess a valid license of Office, it should not be gone. Care to tell us what Office version was?

            Hi Ron, here is how to revert to Windows 7, please Note reverting to Windows 7, will not restore Office. If you do not have a licence Key for your version of Office, you may need to contact the system manufacturers to get another copy of that . . .
<br />
<br />The Windows 7 product key should be o a Sticker on the bottom casing of your PC/Laptop If it is a laptop, or it might be under the battery - you will need it! 
<br />
<br />Backup all your files 
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 7 ISO file 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Click this link to download a small Microsoft utility (Windows USB/DVD Download Tool) to create bootable Installation Media from the ISO 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the bootable Installation media on a DVD or USB Flash Drive 
<br />
<br />Insert the bootable media into the PC 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, on the manufacturers logo screen press the appropriate button to get into BIOS Setup (Usually F2 or Del key) 
<br />
<br />Move the drive with the bootable media to the to of the Boot order list 
<br />
<br />Press F10 to save settings and restart 
<br />
<br />Windows 7 will begin installing 
<br />
<br />When your system reboots, go into BIOS and set your hard drive as top of the Boot Order 
<br />
<br />Do not remove the Installation media until you reach the Desktop 
<br />
<br />That's It!

            See DaveM121's reply and let me add that if you don't like Windows 10, you might want to keep it and download and install the free Classic Shell (http://www.classicshell.net) or the $4.99 Start10 (https://www.stardock.com/products/start10/). They are both
 very good, but I prefer Start10, and I think it's worth the $4.99. With either one installed, Windows 10 will keep its advantages, but its interface will be much more like Windows 7.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.

To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>At the command prompt, type the following line,
<span><span><strong>sfc /scannow
</strong></span></span>and then press ENTER: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved. If the issue that you are experiencing is not
 resolved, use the procedure that is described in the "The System Restore tool" section.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that will fix it for you, please post back and let us know.

 possibly that I had to omitted any procedure; per example to understand the behavior of this device. After I downloaded and installed on my Toshiba laptop a new program from Toshiba and I aren t sure if this program is appropriate to my computer and operating
 system. I appreciate very much if this program is not effective that you help me to desinstall it and to return to the initial state. Thanks you very much<br />
