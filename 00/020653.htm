<h2>            Have to stay signed into Office to use it &#40;Office 365 Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So this just started this afternoon after using Office all morning without issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having closed a word doc and opening another doc, a box came up saying I had to sign into my account to validate it. Office has been activated for months and worked. I read this can happen periodically, but having signed in as requested, I then decided I
 wanted to sign out and just use the office app offline as I normally do, as I do not use Onedrive or Sharepoint or any Microsoft online facility with the desktop apps. However on re-opening any office app I am prompted again to sign in to validate. My name
 then appears in the top right corner where normally there is a sign in button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to File - accounts there were 2 Onedrive services shown: one says it is connected, and personal and has the email address. The other says it is personal but not connected, and there is an option to connect or remove. I removed it. The other one
 that has the email address has no option to remove it and it is connected. I assume that is why I need to be signed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I did not ask for this. I read that a onedrive can only be removed if added by the user, and this does not apply to business onedrive accounts or sharepoint. But I have neither of those and I did not purposely connect my office apps to one drive. I do
 have a one drive account, associated with my hotmail address, but I only ever use this via a browser and upload things to the cloud via the browser. I don't have "save to" onedrive as an option in the usual saving of word docs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent some time discussing with an online Microsoft chat but they also could not understand why I should need to sign in and why if I sign out I need to resign in. They thought it might have something to do with Windows Credential manager but I didn't
 want to muck around with that at this stage... in case I ended up not being able to sign in at all in which case office would not operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a huge issue as once I have signed in I can use the account, but I don't see why I should have to stay signed in &amp; I don't like the idea of having the work I am doing on the computer linked to an online account. Having said that, the only things
 in the onedrive cloud are the things I put there manually... but why do all my office apps seem to think I need to be connected at all and why do I have no option to disconnect and why can't I sign out of the account without being forced to sign back in again
 to use it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks yes I had already made local PC the default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Office 365 Home that's why I posted here. I mentioned business and sharepoint only because I found that in trying to remove connected services it said that they could not be removed, but it wasn't those that I had; it was a home user account but I
 still could not remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link. It's not quite exactly what I'm seeing but similar - I have to sign in to validate, not accept the EULA but it might be connected...hopefully the fix they are doing will fix my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response :) </p>

            Try following -
<br />
<br />1. Clear stored credential
<br />Type credential in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Credential Manager &gt; Clear off all credentials under Windows Credentials &gt; Generic &gt; Now reboot your computer
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<p><span>So this is what I see under Generic;</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>I don’t like to do things without knowing what I am doing or why, so I have a few questions:</span></p>
<p><span>Do I need to delete everything or just the 3 Office ones/ or the Office and the OneDrive?</span></p>
<p><span>If deleted, does this mean the next time I open office I will be prompted to sign in again? And what exactly am I signing into? At the moment I am asked to sign in, in order to validate my Office… it’s not as if it’s optional to sign in for the purpose
 of using online features… though on the accounts page, it tells you when not signed in, to sign in, in order to make full use of these features. I’ve never done this before. The issue at the moment is that I have to sign in JUST TO USE OFFICE, and if I then
 elect to sign out, I have to sign in again… so Office is not giving me any option to stay signed out.
</span></p>
<p><span>I’d just like a better understanding of how these credentials operate…as I understand it, they are supposed to be stored usernames/passwords for websites. But I am not trying to access a website, just open an office Desktop app. Note that I use Pop
 mail, not IMAP, and I don’t elect to have anything to do with Onedrive via the desktop app.
</span></p>
<p><span>When expanding any of these credentials, there is the option to edit or remove. Strangely, under the edit option, it displays only dots for the password, no username is displayed at all. Should there be one?
</span></p>
<p><span>I am also curious about the E97YiBb33i entry…any idea what that could be? It was modified on the 11<sup>th</sup>, which was a Saturday, and I don’t recall even doing too much on Saturday as it’s not a work day. I’m a bit concerned about that one as
 there seems to be no way to identify it. </span></p>
<p><span>I’m also a bit concerned to delete anything here, as I suspect there is some sort of corruption with the way Office is validating….removing these might fix the problem, but then again, if something is “broken” elsewhere, removing these entries might
 mean I can’t <span>&nbsp;</span>get back at all….. I would only do this if I had an absolute assurance that nothing like that could happen.</span></p>
<p><span>As for the advice about Repair – I have already done that before when I had other issues with Office. At the advice of a MS rep, I did an online repair but it did not take 30-60 minutes. Well the repair took maybe that long but then it was another
 6 hours on the phone to get Office activated…. If you advise people to do an online repair please warn them that re-activation will be necessary. Every time I renew office, it seems to have some sort of drama in activating properly…I have it activated now….but
 since yesterday this strange behaviour started where I need to log in to Office to validate it…then all is good as long as I stay logged in… so no real drama… but I would like to have the choice.</span></p>
<p><span>I wondered whether the issue was related to the latest Windows updates, however my husband has the exact same computer and is on the same Office licence and he is not required to sign in. So it would seem there is something wrong with my validation
 operation….and I have already tried both quick and online repairs in the past to fix that, and it didn’t. I don’t wish to do a full reinstall as I am constantly using this computer…maybe I’ll leave that as a last resort when I have more time.

<p>Thank you, Yes I had heard that signing in periodically might be asked. However I thought that once validated, it would be ok to sign out. However here is the real answer:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Do I have to sign in every time I use Office 365?</strong> </p>
<p>No, after you sign in, you won't be prompted to sign in again
<strong>unless you sign out. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So in other words, there is no option to sign out. I thought it was to do with licence validation &amp; I have been signing in with that log-in, however I have my own hotmail account, and I wondered...what if I want to be signed in with my name but it's not
 the subscription log-in? So I tried it and it worked. So it's a personal log-in, not a subscription log-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried being signed in to hotmail, but that doesn't stop me from having to sign in to Office as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange thing is, My husband has had the same updates and he is still not being asked to sign in..... days later..... discrimination!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thanks so much for this information. now I can stop going crazy..... </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We already got in touch with our support team and forwarded this concern. Currently, we are collecting data from a small subset of customers that have Office 365 running but are not signed in, prompting them to sign in. Customers will see a sign-in dialog
 like the one below and if they choose not to sign-in, a Biz Bar will be shown for two days:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e85d76b2-411c-44b4-9975-aad7b9931748?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e85d76b2-411c-44b4-9975-aad7b9931748?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd like to request feedback if you see this behavior with your concern. We are monitoring the feedback coming from customers so that we can get the necessary details to assist in preventing this error to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>We are an IT consulting company that focuses primary on home end-users.&nbsp; This is not a small subset and over (40) totally unrelated customers have contacted us about this issue in only (2) days.&nbsp; That would be over (40) totally unrelated Office 365 Home
 licenses and over (200) user installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can easily give you access to many of these accounts if you need more proof than what has already been reported on the ticket.</p>

<p>The bar you have shown is exactly what I get if I am signed out. I have to sign in. Once signed in, all is well unless I sign out, and then the bar reappears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I had a similar bug when my subscription came up for renewal, although I was set to auto-renewal I got a reminder every day for a month beforehand to renew my subscription and there was nothing they could do to fix it. Once the subscription day came,
 the notification disappeared, but it should never have been there in the first place. The whole idea of auto-renewal is so that you don't have to worry about remembering.

                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I have Outlook.live.com (web based) and Outlook 365 (desktop based) running at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In outlook 365 (desktop) there is the ribbon feature that a third party software which I have installed uses for filing e-mails. this is very useful. Unfortunately Outlook.live.com does not have this feature so I have no access to this third party add on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Outlook.live.com (web based) is free. As I have paid for Office 365 (desktop) can I revert back to Outlook 365 or am I stuck with Outlook.live.com? (I was updated to Outlook.live.com automatically without any choice).</p>

<br />
<br />Yes, you can have both mail access running at the same time, both Outlook web (OWA) and the desktop application. Both synchronize constantly.
<br />When you ask: can I revert back to Outlook 365 or am I stuck with Outlook.live.com? What exactly do you need? Tell me a little more about this question to help you better please.

 the various programs. Clicking on Outlook brought up the conventional desktop outlook screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>last weekend the computer did an update. When I now click on the office red icon on the main screen the normal red screen appears and then there are the office individual icons - no change there. However, when I click on the Outlook icon I go straight to
 the Outlook.live.com web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have configured the Web outlook page with all my e-mail accounts and everything is syncronised OK. I can see and send e-mails. the layout is a bit weird and does not feel very comfortable but I guess with time it will seem logical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main concern is that I have lost access to a third party add on program that fitted into the ribbon in Outlook. The program is called "Mail Manager" and allows me to save the e-mails (complete with attachments not just a web link which seems to be the
 case with Outlook.live)&nbsp; on the hard drive quickly and in the correct job folder. The e-mails are also filed with the sender's name and title showing which also seems to be missing in the web version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is that the only icon that I can click to open Outlook sends me to the web version which I do not want. How can I have a direct access to the desktop version of Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work independantly from home so I need to have my e-mails saved on my hard drive (backed up to a second and the web) and also work on many projects each month. I know that this can be done in the web version but from what I can see only the file link is
 saved and if you delete the e-mail from the web the saved link is then broken / not valid and the e-mail is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite IT savy so if I need to go into the C: drive to find the .exe file to open Outlook from the desktop I can do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>

            You can get Office 365 installation packet from the link below:

<br />
<br />In addition, if you use an Office 365 email account (personal domain), maybe you have a license with Office ProPlus. 
<br />It is  your case? 
<br />Do you have a vanity domain? Let me know to help you get Office PorPlus installation or check for access.

<p>Thanks Wendy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a personal domain and just use the e-mails that the companies who I work for give me. Usually this is to send e-mails with their company domain name in the e-mail address</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link. One question that I have is If I re-install office 365 using the link given will it not just install the version of Office 365 which uses Outlook.live.com as the default e-mail account. This kind of defeats the object.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the set up file that I originally installed Office 365 with,&nbsp; which should have Outlook (desktop) version within it. However, will office not do an automatic update and we are back with the Web version of Outlook again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I re-install will I not loose the information that says that I have paid for the year?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a way to have a 'standalone' copy of Outlook 365 (desktop) running on the PC.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />Hi Pik20e
<br />
<br />Just to clarify a few things
<br />
<br />#1 - There's no requirement to use your Outlook.com account that is automatically created with your Microsoft Account used to purchase Office 365.
<br />
<br />#2 - As long as you have not purchase Office 365 Home &amp; Student, the Outlook desktop program is part of the Office 365 suite
<br />
<br />#3 - If the Office 365 suite has been properly installed, then you should have an entry for Outlook program (along with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access etc). When clicking on that entry in the list, it wouldn't launch you browser and open the Outlook.com web page so not at all clear what the following refers to
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />However, when I click on the Outlook icon I go straight to the Outlook.live.com web page.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />#4 - When Outlook (desktop) is opened for the first time, you will be prompted to configure at least one email account. After that you can configure additional email accounts as the need arises - none of which involves the Outlook.com web email account.
<br />
<br />The question you need to decide is whether to configure the email account as a POP3 or IMAP account. If you're not familiar with POP3 &amp; IMAP - please advise and will provide the information.
<br />
<br />Summary
<br />
<br />The first thing I would do if you have Office 365 already installed would be to perform an &lt;Online Repair&gt; via Control Panel --&gt; Programs. The &lt;Online Repair&gt; takes longer but is more comprehensive then the &lt;Quick Repair&gt;

            If you install the Office 365 product, you will only be installing Office in the desktop version, this does not affect the email, because all the information is in the cloud. When you have the installation done, you will be able to create your new Outlook profile and the information will be synchronized.

<p>OK Guys / Girls I found the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently when Office updated it made all the links that come under the 'my office' red icon go to the web browser version of office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The stand alone version was still there but I had to re-create the short cuts from the start / programs menu (drag and drop on to the desktop screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have thought of this earlier so feel a bit stupid at finding the easy solution - Thanks for your comments and advice anyway</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may go back to the web version but only when I feel ready and really need it. Having it pushed on to me when I was not ready (and wasted 2 days trying to figure how it worked) is not right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />I recommend to validate if by some chance it was eliminated of eliminated and this in the recoverable ones follows these steps to arrive at the recoverable ones from Outlook.com or desktop Outlook app.
<br />
<br />Recover deleted items in Outlook for Windows
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/recover-deleted-items-in-outlook-for-windows-49e81f3c-c8f4-4426-a0b9-c0fd751d48ce?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/recove...</a> US
<br />
<br />Important: If you do not see the Deleted Items folder, but instead see the Trash folder, then your account does not support recovering an item that's not longer in your Deleted Items folder.
<br />
<br />Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com

<p>This allows you to correct any accidental marking of a message as junk. You can recover previously deleted emails from the Deleted fold by clicking on the link and checking the ones you wish to move back to Inbox or whatever folder you wish to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember that deleted messages are indefinitely stored and lost eventually as they are purged (junk is automatically deleted after a period) so try and recover them as soon as you can. If you find them junk or unnecessary again you can banish or delete them
 again.</p>

            One problem could be that if you are trying to connect a HD to the receiver with A/V&nbsp; cable, the Zune HD does not support A/V output through the headphone jack.&nbsp; If you have an AUX connection on your stereo you can connect the zune that way.&nbsp; Will still
 have to use the zune to control your music though.&nbsp;

    <title>Nokia 6234 starting problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> htaeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6234 starting problem</h2>
                    Hello, i have had my phone for about 3 months now and have never had a problem until now. I have never ever dropped, bumped or damaged my phone in any way as i take perfect care of it.<br />
<br />
The problem is that yesterday morning as i tried to turn on my phone it began turning on like normal, it went through all the start up screens and got to the stage where the main phone screen should load. This is where the problem began. Instead of loading
 the main screen, the phone stayed white for a second, then the menu, battery/signal/clock icons and wallpaper came up for about another second. Next a thin black line appeared horizontally across the middle of the screen then it turned white again. This process
 repeated 4 times then the entire phone turned off. Now every time i try to start it up it does this.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything like removing battery, cleaning dust and charging but the only thing that changed anything is the first time i tried to plug it into the computer. When i plugged it in it came up saying TEST MODE across the screen in red writing but
 that's all that happened until i turned the phone back off. This hasn't happened since.<br />
<br />
I do have it under warranty currently but it is a very long story why i would rather not get it fixed that way, so if anyone has any ideas on how i could possibly fix it i would be much appreciative. If all else fails i could send it to get it fixed but i would
 rather not.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time.

            Ok, I've just realised what may be the problem. Just before turning my phone off before all this started i had recorded a video which took up pretty much all of my handset memory. This had happened to me previously but i had a little more space left at
 that time so although the phone was running extremely slow i was able to clear the memory and my phone was working perfectly from then on. I suspect that i am having a similar problem now but without being able to turn my phone on i have no way to clear the
 memory. Does anyone know if there is button combination or something that i can use to reset my phone to clear all the memory? Is maybe there's a computer program i can use to flash it?<br />
<br />
All help is much appreciated, thanks.<br />
Heath

            Reset codes are as follows:<br />
<br />
*#7780# - Restore factory settings<br />
*#7370# - Reformat your phone<br />
<br />
If the above does not work then try the "3 finger reset" which is depress these three keys simultaneously "*" "3" "green phone" and then power on phone whilst keeping those same three keys depressed until you hear start-up tone.<br />
<br />
Make sure you try to backup your phone before trying all the above as you will probably lose your data.

            Press the "*" button, "3" button and the "green" call button. Keep them pressed and then press the "Power" button to turn the phone on. You will lose your data. I have you backed up your phone regularly.

            Then the 6234 is probably an S40 phone and not an S60 phone. Unfortunately you will have to send it back to the Nokia Service Centre. They should be able to sort out your problem there for you.

</p><p>Students can no longer copy pages from the Content Library to their own Notebooks in Web Interface. This was available until last Thursday (9/11/17), in IE the words highlight but nothing copies to clipboard, on Chrome no highlighting of text in right click

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried first turn Collaborate Space locked and immidiately unlocked it. Now students can copy pages from Content Library normally, but you have to have Collaborate Space unlocked or if it was already unlocked, lock it and again unlock it. You also have
 to do it for all notebooks separately.</p>

<h2>            Unable to permanently delete unwanted favorites from IE-8. They continue to repopulate after deleting.</h2>
                    I am able to delete favorites either by directly deleting them in the Favorites list, using the organize favorites box, or going directly to the favorites folder within My Documents. Unfortunately, they continue to repopulate shortly after deleting. How
 can I permanently delete them?

<h2>            Outlook 15.31 for Mac - Calendar Issue</h2>
                    I installed the latest version of Office for Mac - 15.31 - today.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the Outlook Calendar, when I create a new event, the “Category” is greyed out – not accessible. If I create the event, save and close, and then reopen, the Category is accessible.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please fix. This did not happen in 15.30. Having to close and reopen each event is a nuisance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you, PMH

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am not able to activate/sign into my microsoft office account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried multiple student accounts (Microsoft office is free to download for all students in my school). Upon opening Microsoft excel/word, I am directed to a sign in page - I key in my details and it seems like the program is able to detect wrong passwords
 but when the correct information is typed in, the screen just seems to refresh. I have redownloaded office(also following the guide on how to completely remove it, key chain etc..) and restarted my mac many times to the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love some help here, I need to do work...</p>

<p>Hi UG-Goh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information in PM.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you described in PM, you and your students have licenses for downloading and activating Office applications, while you all are unable to activate Office applications on your mac only. I would like
 to suggest you refer detailed steps in this article to try solving the issue: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-to-try-if-you-can-t-install-or-activate-Office-2016-for-Mac-5efba2b4-b1e6-4e5f-bf3c-6ab945d03dea#PickTab=Activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What to try if you can't install or activate Office 2016 for Mac</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

.<br />
So, you have bought the cheapest, lowest specified Windows Phone device on the planet and feel justified to complain?<br />
<br />
Sorry but no. What you have bought is actually excellent for the money. In the U.K., the 520 can be bought for less than £90, which makes it an absolute bargain for a full touch screen smartphone.<br />
You need to learn how to manage your phones storage and not come complaining here, it's that simple.<br />

            There is win8 on this Phone, yes? This is an operating System,yes? Is this a SMARTphone? So, this is a minimum. All of my old phones (Siemens, Alcatel...) can handle the directories. Cheap, yes. This is the reason why bought this One. I have an another
 Phone to Talk. You have interesting Sense about cheapness! And It wasnt an answare.

            Lumia urgently needs files n folders manager else buyers would regret a lot. Because I was embarassed when files and folders can be very easily explorable in a very basic phone and not in Lumia! Its a basic activity. We cant have access to pc always. I
 tried to sell my lumia520, but was asked for very less price..no way i'm using it. Now I understood, why androids are rejoicing.<br />

<p>Loren,</p>
<p>Try this out - it worked for me.</p>
<p>File &gt;&gt; Options &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add-Ins</p>
<p>Bottom of the screen "Manage" make sure "COM Add-Ins" selected then click on "GO"</p>
<p>In the "COM Add-Ins" window UNCHECK - what ever anti-virus you are using box --- Click OK restart Outlook</p>
<p>I sent test email and I did not get any error message in Sync Folder - then I went back in and I put back that "check" that I had removed and I had no issues.</p>
<p>I hope it works out for you, let us know if problem continues....</p>

<p>turning off AV integration reduced the amount of these "Modification Resolution" Sync logs but they are still coming in at approx 2 per hour....i understand they have something to do with the email being changed by exchange after it is delivered to outlook
 and then the change is not being made in outlook so this sync error is thrown...is this correct?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office for Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>I have a mobile phone running Windows 10. I have just installed Dropbox and Office apps. However when I try to open Excel files I get a message saying they cannot be opened as that version of office cannot open files from early office versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Is there an alternative programme/app that can do&nbsp;this? In android(sorry!) there are alternatives such as Sheets and Polaris

    <title>Profiles&#47;Identities in Outlook 15.8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killerbob71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profiles&#47;Identities in Outlook 15.8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Outlook 15 onto my Mac and all is working fine - bar a few beta issues.<br />
<br />
I do however have several profiles, and I have followed the guide in this link <a href="https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Import-items-into-Outlook-for-Mac-6cc48404-a65c-4b8c-a12a-95a905249414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-nz/art...a-95a905249414</a> to import the profiles I had in Outlook 2011, but now I wonder how do I have it prompt me every time I open Outlook as to which profile I want to open? I of course figured out to link to the Outlook
 Profile Manager, and "simply" change the default profile every time I want to access one of the other profiles, but that is a daft way of doing it!</p>
<p><br />
In Outlook 2011 I had Outlook prompt me for the Identity every time I opened up Outlook, and that worked fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A solution needs to be delivered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have imported one of my profiles into Outlook 15, and now I need to import the other ones. However, there seems to be no solution to do this, so how does Microsoft expect me to be able to migrate to the new version. There
<strong>HAS</strong> to be a way to enable either 1) importing several profiles into Outlook, or 2) switch between profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is Beta, and I can certainly appreciate that, but when the final version comes out, this has to be solved. I run an IT consultancy with a few hundred costumers, and there is
<strong>NO</strong> way I can recommend staying with MS Office if there is no solution for this.</p>

            I have three identities from Outlook 14 I want to import into Outlook 15.8.1... I can't because I can only import one at a time, and there is no way to import the second and third identify into an existing profile... Bad solution is what I call it.<br />

            <p>The problem is you don't import multiple Identities into a single profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016 the word "Profile" replaced the word "Identity" but it means the same thing. If you bring in 3 Identities you will now have 3 Profiles, not just one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the Outlook Profile Manager app into your dock. Use it to switch Profiles (aka Identities). I've got to make a YouTube video about this. It's driving people crazy.<br />

<strong>not</strong> a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does MS want me to migrate to a single identity, coming from 3 profiles??? I don't want to mix the three profile/identities, but there seems to be no workable way otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be made an easy way to select another profile, otherwise I guess Office 2011 was it for a lot of users...</p>

            Have to agree with KI. Just spent a whole Saturday afternoon trying to figure it out. Impossible! Looks like another unfinished product from MS. Back to Office 2011 for me.

<h2>            Office 365 question</h2>
                    My previous employer gave individuals access to Office 365 for their home PC's.&nbsp; I am no longer with that company and they have shut down my access so I no longer have the ability to email (current is read-only), Word, etc.&nbsp; What is the best way to get
 a personal version? is it the $ 99.99 yearly subscription? I would assume my ISP would still be able to recover my emails once I switched to a different O365?&nbsp; as long as I have the email password, etc.

<div>Hi Coe15,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>I'm writing to follow up on this thread. Have you referred to the information above provided by "Palcouk"?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sill having concern, please provide us with the following information below:</p>
<p>When you say “I no longer have the ability to email (current is read-only)”, May I know whether you are access ISP mailbox via using your employer Office 365 Outlook desktop client?</p>
<div><br />
<div>You can purchase Office 365 subscription as per your personal/business need. See
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?&amp;activetab=tab:primaryr1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get the most from Office with Office 365</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it mailbox provided by your previous employer or your own ISP provider?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the mailbox provider is your ISP, you may check whether you can access ISP mailbox emails via using webmail client. If so, you can set up your ISP mailbox to newly purchase Outlook 365 client to access your email.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,&nbsp;<br />
<div>Shyamal</div>

<p>No your ISP won't be able to "recover" emails from your Work account. Only Work can do that for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you still have access to them email, you should "export" everything you want to keep</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The $99 subscription is a yearly "rental" (that has to be renewed each year) that is most likely Office 365 Home.&nbsp; It allows you to "share" your license with up to 5 other people in your "home" (no official definition of Home). So if you have kids, relatives
 or friends who would like to have Office, you can share with up to 5 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Office just for yourself you have 2 options.&nbsp; Office 365 Personal has the same applications as 365 Home, but it is just for one person.&nbsp; Both allow you to install on up to 5 computers at the same time.&nbsp; Both have Outlook.&nbsp; Your other 1 person
 option is Office 2019 Home and Student, or Home and Business. They are one-time payment licenses. Home and Student does not have Outlook, Home and Business does. The one-time payment licenes can only be installed on one computer at a time.</p>

<h2>            Excel copy formats to other cells - not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basics:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel for Mac Version 15.36. German</p>
<p>MacBook Pro &nbsp;2016 - mac OS Sierra 10.12.6</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to copy the format to other cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I mark the cell with the supposed format</p>
<p>2) I click right mouse button and drag to the cells that should be formated</p>
<p>3) menu opens I chose the option&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) as click nothing happens and the "open a new worksheet" pops up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it with several worksheets - always the same</p>
<p>Checked if VBA scripts are active - none as far as i can judge</p>
<p>Tried the same worksheet on other computers/Mac --&gt; it worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be great if anyone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> sandy.oliver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows phone not receiving texts or calls</h2>
                    My wife and I both have windows 10 phones and both will miss text messages and phone calls. Sometimes they will not show that a call was missed and some times they will not notify us of voice mail. The same is true for text messages. We can go to check
 messages and there will be several but notification when they came to the phones. This happens frequently and is very annoying. I switched my sim to an android phone for about 10 days and never had a problem while my wife's windows phone continued to have
 problems. <strong>It is not the carrier</strong>. The phones are also different makes, one is a Nokia and the other and Alcatel. I have manually checked for updates to make sure we have the latest.

</p><p>
</p><p>The issues wherein your Windows 10 Mobile operating system phones not being able to receive calls and text notification may have been caused by the notification service stopping. You may resolve this issue by soft resetting your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To soft reset your phones, press and hold the <strong>Volume down</strong> + <strong>
Power </strong>buttons for ten to fifteen seconds or until it vibrates. Your phones will automatically restart and the notification service should also be started.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here we go again. &nbsp;I'm running Mac OS Sierra Version 10.12.3 and MS Outlook for Mac Version 15.32 (170309). &nbsp;Now, when I begin or respond to a message, the font shrinks to non-readable. &nbsp;I've checked all my settings and when change them to Font Size 10,
 it still shrinks when used.</p>

<h2>            Account Hacked - How to delete account</h2>
                    My account is sending an email each minute from my account and each one is bouncing back, so I am getting spammed with emails from postmaster. I do not need this account anymore, so I want to de-activate the account.&nbsp;

            Dear Jason,<br /><br />Could you please explain what exactly you mean by :<br />"  it's not acknowledging my email, yet I can login to outlook. "<br /><br />If you are getting stuck at some point please explain it in more detailed way.<br /><br />To be able to close the account you need to have full access to it. If you do not have it, You may need to retrieve your account first, before you can proceed with closing it.

<p>Since December I have been fighting to gain control of my Hotmail acct.&nbsp; It has been hacked yet Microsoft claims they cannot prove it is mine. &nbsp; Well, see I can't provide emails sent recently because I am not in control of my account. &nbsp; Which btw has been
 used to access my bank acct, change email to 2 step verification, but recently cranked up my old HP and there is my account (had for 20 years) BUT, it only went to 2017, and yet again Microsoft states they cannot prove it is mine. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
To me, this company is complicant in the theft and invasion of privacy that continues to happen daily. &nbsp; I have proof it is my account yet no one want to listen.&nbsp; And when I call, Im told to pay money to a fly by night company to retrieve my account. &nbsp; To say
 I am disgusted it mild.&nbsp; This person has control of my facebook, my Amazon (Which I lost over 20 years to a thief while Microsoft dithered. &nbsp; I am sick of trying to get any outlook acct to work properly.&nbsp; Truly I wish I had never heard of Microsoft. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no one will see proof, paperwork sent to me, my ID, birth certificate, and even my job but NO, apparently I've lost control of all my accts.&nbsp;<br />
It amazes me that technology has advanced so far to intrude on every fiber of your personal life, ruining and destroying while Microsoft sits on the sideline shrugging. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
